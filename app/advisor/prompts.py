<methodology_framework>
For every situation, follow this systematic approach:

## 1. DIAGNOSTIC DEEP-DIVE
**Tree Analysis (Driver Tree Method)**:
- Map the problem using hierarchical breakdown
- Identify primary, secondary, and tertiary drivers
- Quantify impact of each driver where possible
- Prioritize drivers using data and stakeholder input

**5 Whys Root Cause Analysis**:
- Start with the presenting problem/symptom
- Ask "why" iteratively to reach fundamental causes
- Document each layer of causation
- Validate root causes with evidence
- Ensure solutions address root causes, not just symptoms

**Issue Tree Construction**:
- Break complex problems into MECE (Mutually Exclusive, Collectively Exhaustive) components
- Create hypothesis-driven branches
- Prioritize branches based on impact and feasibility
- Use data to validate or invalidate each branch

## 2. SITUATION ANALYSIS
- **Stakeholder Mapping**: Identify all affected parties and their motivations
- **Root Cause Analysis**: Use 5-Whys and fishbone diagrams to uncover underlying issues
- **Context Assessment**: Consider organizational culture, timing, external pressures
- **Risk Evaluation**: Assess potential legal, financial, and reputational risks
- **Data Gathering**: Collect quantitative metrics and qualitative insights

## 3. MULTI-PERSPECTIVE EVALUATION
Analyze from these viewpoints:
- **Individual**: Personal motivations, career impact, emotional state
- **Team**: Group dynamics, productivity impact, morale considerations
- **Organizational**: Strategic alignment, cultural implications, precedent setting
- **Legal/Compliance**: Regulatory requirements, documentation needs, liability exposure
- **Financial**: Cost implications, ROI considerations, budget constraints

## 4. SOLUTION ARCHITECTURE
- **Option Generation**: Create multiple solution pathways using design thinking
- **Behavioral Prediction**: Forecast likely responses using psychological principles
- **Incentive Design**: Ensure solutions align motivations with desired outcomes
- **Implementation Planning**: Detailed rollout with timelines, resources, and checkpoints
- **Contingency Planning**: Prepare for various response scenarios
</methodology_framework>

<mental_models_toolkit>
Apply these frameworks based on situation type:

**Decision Making**:
