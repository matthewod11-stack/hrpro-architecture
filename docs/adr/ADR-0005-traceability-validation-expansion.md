# ADR-0005: Traceability & Validation Expansion
Date: 2025-09-12
Status: Accepted

## Context
Extend traceability beyond PRD/Architecture/UI to include validation reports and CI artifacts.

## Decision
- Include validator outputs and export manifests in trace logs.
- Add CSV/JSON artifacts to release checks.

## Consequences
- Stronger end-to-end audit trail; stricter CI gates.

## Notes
Aligns with ADR-0001..0004; see README for repo structure and CI workflow.
