For the ﬁrst time in history, many workplaces span six generations:

from the octogenarians of the Silent Generation who are still working

— and in many cases still holding onto key global leadership roles —

to the teenagers of the emerging Generation Alpha who are eagerly

pursuing their ﬁrst summer jobs and high school internships. In

## between are the Baby Boomers, Generation X, Generation Y (often

called the Millennials), and Generation Z.

## HBR / Digital Article / Leading the 6-Generation Workforce

To be sure, this unprecedented age span could aﬀord organizations

unique opportunities to reimagine and reposition themselves for

sustainable intergenerational inclusion and impact. At the same time,

where executives are unwilling or unprepared to engage this new six-

generation (6G) reality, organizational chaos and decline may ensue.

Here are ﬁve steps leaders can take to create healthy 6G organizations.

- 1. Develop a 6G organizational strategy.

Every organization needs a 6G organizational strategy. To be clear,

this is not a special “six-generation strategy” that sits apart from

the organization’s core strategic plan. Instead, developing a 6G

organizational strategy is about ensuring that the discipline of 6G-

thinking is embedded within — and evident throughout — your

organization’s strategy, dashboards, and scorecards. In other words, 6G

strategic thinking can make your organization’s strategy come alive.

At ﬁrst glance, such a strategy might appear to be the exclusive domain

of your talent management team. But this about more than recruiting,

retaining, and advancing talent from all generations. Leaders are also

tasked with creating the conditions that incentivize older and younger

workers alike to be open to learning from and with one another, sharing

## their wisdom and know-how without fear or insecurity.

As America navigates the so-called “peak 65” demographic benchmark

with over 4 million Americans projected to reach age 65 every year

through the end of the decade — that’s more than 11,000 people every

day — eﬀective succession planning is essential for organizational

sustainability. Thinking in 6G requires organizations to undertake the

hard work of ﬁguring out how to become employers-of-choice for every

generation (not just the younger ones), anchored by a compelling

employer brand that is both authentic and attentive to each generation’s

# workplace needs and preferences.

## However, beyond the traditional internal people-and-culture types

of issues, there are critical market-facing dimensions for which 6G

strategy is necessary. 6G strategy ensures the evolving needs, tastes, and

preferences of a 6G consumer and/or customer base are understood,

prioritized, and addressed through the organization’s products or

services. For example, the thought process that led Chevrolet to refresh

its iconic Corvette embodies the heart of this thinking. To broaden its

customer base beyond its average consumer, pegged at age 61 (and

rising), Chevrolet’s strategic redesign and brand repositioning eﬀort

doubled sales to Gen Xers. In short, strategizing with a 6G mindset —

and involving voices from all six generations — is just as important for

marketplace impact as it is for workplace impact.

- 2. Manage both age-based differences and generational differences.

Building healthy 6G organizations involves a nuanced understanding of

## two related but distinct dimensions of human diﬀerence: age-based and

generational diversity. Age eﬀects give us a snapshot of how individuals

diﬀer based on where they are in the life cycle (e.g., toddler, emerging

adult, or in the ﬁnal third of their lives). Generations, on the other hand,

are cohorts of individuals who were born at a similar time (often over

a 15- to 20-year span) and had their worldviews shaped by the same

## key national/global events, trends, and social forces (e.g., economic

## recessions, wars, social movements, breakthrough technologies) in their

# formative years.

Age and generation are often conﬂated. Some of the dynamics in the

6G workplace that are attributed to age are actually due to generational

diﬀerences. And conversely, there are other attitudinal and behavioral

diﬀerences (e.g., investment risk tolerance and voting participation)

that have less to do with generation than with age/life-stage diversity.

To be sure, eﬀorts to deepen diversity, accelerate inclusion, and

institutionalize equity (DEI) are sources of contention and controversy

in many organizations. However, it is important to note that diversity

is about more than human diﬀerences based on sex/gender, race/

ethnicity, socioeconomic class, sexual orientation, disability status,

and/or religious identity. Whereas many of these diversity dimensions

## vary in their relevance from culture to culture, age and generational

## diﬀerences impact every organization in every culture around the

# world.

The science is clear: Diversity can make our teams and organizations

## smarter, more creative, more innovative, and more proﬁtable. As global

life expectancy continues to increase and many organizations grapple

## with mandatory retirement ages for executives and board members, age

and generational diﬀerences take on renewed signiﬁcance. It can be

tricky to ensure that your organization’s playing ﬁeld is level for people

of all ages/generations to thrive. It can be challenging to ensure that job

applicants and employees alike don’t feel like they must hide their age

or apologize for being a member of their generation just to get access to

opportunity in your organization. In short, leaders in 6G organizations

must be prepared to manage the challenges created by both age-based

# and generational diversity.

- 3. Look at generations as cultures.

Multigenerational teams often experience signiﬁcant interpersonal

tensions in collaborating across the generational divides: diﬀerences in

norms regarding the use of technology, communication norms around

giving and receiving feedback, perceptions of what “hard work” and

“good leadership” look like, just to name a few. When faced with these

tensions, many people — from all generations — resort to stereotyping,

judging, and then attempting to “ﬁx” the other generations. However,

diﬀerences do not have to be divisive. Instead of looking at generational

diﬀerences as problems to be solved, leaders would be well advised to

look at them as sources of richness and vibrancy to be understood,

appreciated, and even leveraged.

Culture informs a common way of thinking that motivates a common

way of doing among cohorts of individuals. Cultures give insight into

where people are “from” — and so do generations. Just like cultural

diﬀerences, generational diﬀerences can distinguish teammates from

one another without dividing them from one another.

Viewing generations as cultures can help leaders foster inclusive

## environments of mutual respect, honor, and inclusion in which

everyone can be their best and bring their best every day. The same skill

of cross-cultural agility, which enables people to wisely navigate across

## lines of cultural diﬀerence with humility, curiosity, and ﬂexibility, can

help teammates of diﬀerent generations productively engage with one

## another without an underlying sense of cultural — or generational —

# superiority.

- 4. Reimagine the 6G talent pipeline.

Another important challenge that leaders must confront is the

increasing congestion in the talent pipeline. At one end is often

## a bottleneck of more seasoned workers in top positions who, as

they approach “retirement age,” are either ﬁnancially unable or

psychologically unwilling to retire and have nowhere else in the talent

pipeline to advance. At the other end is often younger talent impatiently

waiting their turn for advancement into more challenging roles because

the pipeline is clogged. In the middle are the so-called “sandwich

generations,” sitting frustrated as the unwritten rules of the game

change right before their eyes. While these challenges are not entirely

new, the 6G workplace exacerbates them.

To create healthy 6G organizations, leaders must reimagine their

talent pipelines altogether. One of the most pressing opportunities to

decongest the talent pipeline is to create meaningful opportunities

for senior talent to remain engaged in post-executive roles. Such

positions must include more than honoriﬁc titles, be positioned as

a positive step forward instead of a step aside (or a step back),

and carry real value in transferring knowledge, sharing experiences

and expertise, and mentoring younger colleagues without the weight

## and time commitment of executive-level responsibility. One great

example is Mitre Corporation’s “Reserves at the Ready” program, which

leverages retired employees with valuable technical and customer

service expertise to periodically staﬀ projects as mentors to younger

# workers.

When more openings are created at the top of the pipeline, this

movement enables the second key piece of reimagining the pipeline:

engaging and retaining younger talent by more intentionally designing

the path to advancement. The “keep calm and wait your turn” approach

to talent advancement is a sureﬁre way to lose top young talent.

Leaders can take a page out of the hospital emergency department

playbook and leverage queuing theory to help them manage their

employees’ career path experiences. To summarize, the length of time

that people will wait — whether in a grocery store checkout line, a

theme park, or a hospital emergency department — depends upon the

perceived value of what they hope to get and the quality of the waiting

experience. For example, people wait willingly for hours to experience

## their favorite theme park rides, both because of the excitement they

can see and hear from the riders ahead of them and because there

is fun to be had during the wait. In the queue, there’s entertainment

and clarity on the length of the wait and the cause of any delays.

Employers can create the same sense of willingness to wait by gamifying

career pathing: showing people how they can advance by anticipating —

and working toward — the “next level.” By building 6G talent pipeline

architecture, companies can ensure that people can move forward on a

career path with more intentionality and transparency, not to mention

## joy and maybe even commitment to the organization.

- 5. Center purpose as the great intergenerational unifier.

The tensions between older and younger workers are not new. Now,

some human capital futurists believe that we are on our way to a post-

generational workforce environment — a paradigm that suggests the

path forward might be to transcend generational diﬀerences instead of

overly focusing on them. Deloitte’s 2020 Global Human Capital Trends

survey suggests that the post-pandemic workforce may be characterized

by greater cross-generational alignment regarding what people want out

of work (such as meaning, purpose, and growth). This means leaders

have the opportunity to capitalize on that intergenerational alignment

by designing organizational life around the importance of purpose.

Centering personal and organizational purpose represents a critical

opportunity for leaders on the quest to build sustainable 6G

organizations. It’s not just members of the younger generations who

are motivated by purpose, preferring to work for organizations that

make a positive diﬀerence. McKinsey reports employees at all levels

want purpose in their lives. Embracing this commonality elevates

the conversation around the company’s purpose, why it matters, how

it is experienced by colleagues, customers, and clients. To do this,

leaders must move beyond the marketing spin and commit to helping

colleagues see how working in their organization can help them activate

their own personal sense of purpose while coming together with others

to fulﬁll the organization’s purpose at the same time.

Each of these ﬁve steps can help leaders build healthy 6G organizations

that are designed for intergenerational sustainability in the workplace

and the marketplace. Giving each generation — and, importantly, each

individual — the opportunity to be seen, understood, valued, and

leveraged in the workplace throughout the course of their career is

## essential for personal, social, and even societal well-being.
