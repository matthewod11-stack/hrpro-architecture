This fall, companies are once again pushing workers to return to the

oﬃce, continuing the debate over how many days employees should

# work together in person.

This debate continues to miss the point.

One-size-ﬁts-all mandates can succeed only if work is a universal task

executed by a homogenous workforce. Of course, we know neither is

true. Instead of threatening employees, CEOs should empower and

enable their managers — especially those on the front line — to gain

a deep and nuanced understanding of the work their teams do, the

working style of their team members, and how that work best gets done.

They must also consider the impact of generative AI, which will change

# all of these factors.

Our research, experience working with company leaders, and surveys of

workers around the world show how considering these factors can lead

# to better outcomes for everyone.

# Companies Are at a Crossroads

We can empathize with CEOs. Leaders must justify oﬃce rents despite

record-low occupancy levels and build a culture of collaboration in a

place with empty halls. They are grappling with quiet quitting, quiet

cutting, pressure from city governments to restore the vibrance of

## business districts, and the impact of generative AI.

But the answer to these pressures is not return-to-oﬃce mandates

that essentially use face time as a performance management tool —

think badge-swipe monitoring, which has elicited notable backlash.

Monitoring the time employees spend online doesn’t work, either. A

recent survey of 18,149 desk workers and executives conducted by Slack

revealed that 32% of employees’ time is spent on performative work,

and 63% try to keep their status active online even if they’re not working

# at that moment.

The inclination to associate physical presence or time active online

with productivity is a symptom of a broader issue, as many of today’s leaders struggle to embrace ways of working that are radically diﬀerent

from how they grew up. They proved themselves in a culture where

commuting to the oﬃce to work from 9 to 5 was the norm, and where

anyone who tried to work ﬂexibly was marginalized — such as those on

# the “mommy track.”

The most successful organizations will recognize that there is too much

complexity to set rigid, top-down mandates, and that the managers who

are at the rock face of the work, the team, and the customers are best

positioned to make such decisions when they are empowered with the

# right skills and tools.

CEOs and executive teams who focus on the following four actions can make work work better for everyone.

Recognize the Needs of the Work

When we asked more than 1,500 oﬃce-based workers when they wanted

to be in person, we learned that they want to come to the oﬃce to

do tasks and activities they consider best done there. For instance,

participants were eight times more likely to prefer being in-person for

aﬃliation and development, compared with doing work that requires

focus or tackling administrative tasks, which are better done remotely.

But where employees feel most eﬀective doing certain types of work

is only one side of the coin. We also explored how much time they

spend doing these tasks. We found that individual contributors spend 37% of their time on work they believe is done most eﬀectively in

person; for managers and executives, this jumps to 49%. But this is on

average across organizations. It is important for leaders to spend time

investigating what those preferences look like based on the nature of

## work and people across their organization.

It becomes even more critical to recognize which types of work are best done in diﬀerent settings in the age of generative AI. When doing

focus work, our survey data suggests that 65% of employees want to be

remote — but some of this work can be greatly enhanced with the use

of generative AI. A ﬁeld experiment that our BCG colleagues conducted

with the support of a group of academics from HBS, MIT, Wharton,

and the University of Warwick found that for tasks that involve creative

ideation, GenAI generates output that should be considered as a ﬁnal

draft (versus a ﬁrst draft that humans need to take time to edit). This

means that for some employees, the mix of work that they do may start

to shift, as they hand over some of the focus work they would have

preferred to do remotely and pick up other tasks beyond the frontier

of generative AI’s competence. As a result, their work models may also

need to shift, depending on what these new tasks are.

Recognize the Needs of the People

In our survey, roughly 90% of employees who identify as female,

caregivers, LGBTQ+, or as having a disability consider ﬂexible work

options an important factor when deciding whether to stay in or leave

their job. That is 30% higher than employees who did not identify with

these categories. In other words: If you care about diversity, equity, and

inclusion, you need to get your working model right.

We saw a particularly wide gap when it comes to gender: Female

employees are 1.5 times more likely than their male counterparts to

prioritize ﬂexibility. And this is not just a working-mom phenomenon. We found only a marginal diﬀerence (3%) among women when

comparing caregivers with non-caregivers.

Our biological cognitive diﬀerences also indicate preferences toward

certain work environments. In some situations, groups of people doing

the same job may have similar cognitive proﬁles. For example, a team of

software engineers is more likely to be “analytical/tough-minded” and

therefore might work best when allowed to maintain focus and prefer to

have routines in how they do their day-to-day work.

But teams with high cognitive diversity will need more options to

maintain optimum performance and happiness. We found outliers

in our survey, for example — those who prefer to do interactive

## work remotely, and administrative or focus work in person. Some of

their preferences are likely linked to cognitive characteristics such as

# introversion/extraversion.

Leaders struggling with how to think about getting the best out of employees with diﬀerent cognitive proﬁles would do well to remember

that your people are just as diverse as your customers. Just as successful

companies obsess about their customers and the decisions they make, it

may be even more important for them to obsess about their employees.

By doing so, they can reveal the root of the emotional and functional

needs involved in making decisions about their careers — and create

work environments that fulﬁll these needs.

# Rethink How Work Gets Done

“Place” is just another tool for getting work done. As HBS professor

Tsedal Neeley has observed, “I talk about using the oﬃce as a tool, the

same way we use various technologies as tools to communicate and

engage. If you see the oﬃce as a tool, you determine what speciﬁc uses

it has for collaborations that require people to be physically present

together.”

Yet 62% of our survey respondents told us that they do not have a say in

their work model policy. Instead, it is dictated either by company-wide

guidelines or by their manager. Of all participants, 39% reported that

their company decides where they work. In these companies, 24% of

employees were unhappy with their work location policy; this ﬁgure

decreases to 14% if the manager decides, and to 6% if the team decides.

The closer to the executors of the work the policy gets set, the more

satisﬁed employees are.

Companies like Cisco and Dropbox are redesigning their oﬃce space

to make it more amenable to collaboration. Such moves are consistent

with their respective work model policies, which enable employees to do

focus work remotely and encourage employees to come together for key

events such as all-hands meetings. As Cisco’s CEO Chuck Robbins put it, in today’s world you have to oﬀer a compelling “return on commute” to

get your employees bought into coming into the oﬃce.

Redesigned work models also need to consider the ways in which we

communicate. For example, we worked with Verizon to improve the

way they run meetings, such as scheduling 25- or 50-minute meetings

with a 5- or 10-minute lagged start time to give people breathing room.

We also identiﬁed meetings that could be replaced by asynchronous modes of work (such as email, chat, shared documents, or oﬄine

review) and clariﬁed what “required” and “optional” meant. In our experiments, 90% of participants reported overall meeting eﬀectiveness

had improved and 78% felt they wasted less time sitting in meetings

where their live participation wasn’t required.

Leaders will also need to monitor the impact of new technologies

that they introduce. The generative AI experiment mentioned above

also revealed that overreliance on generative AI can lead to a loss of

collective diversity of ideas. As leaders seek to beneﬁt from the value

creation opportunities of generative AI, they’ll need to consider where and how people collaborate most eﬀectively to ensure they retain their

# creativity and innovativeness.

## Invest in Building a New Managerial Muscle

The orchestration of these factors needs to come from managers —

those at the front line, working with the teams. They are closest to the

needs of the work, the people, and how that work gets done.

However, this orchestration requires two new managerial muscles.

The ﬁrst is one that was not needed before Covid, when work was

done in the oﬃce by default, nor during Covid, when remote work was

predominant for many oﬃce-based professionals. Managers now need

to facilitate discussions with and align their teams on where, when, and

how work gets done. They need to hold weekly retrospectives on what

worked, what didn’t, and what to change in how they work the next

# week.

The second muscle is one that managers arguably needed before Covid,

since working with distributed teams isn’t new. Managers need to

build their ability to create connection and culture as well as develop,

inspire, mentor, and coach across distributed and hybrid teams. They

must also meet employees’ emotional as well as functional needs.

## A recent BCG survey on employee expectations about leadership at

work conducted across nine countries revealed that the top four

qualities characterizing great leaders are recognition, people coaching

## and development, empathetic listening, and care.

Building these new managerial skills requires work, but the rewards

are worth it: better performance, engagement, and retention, to name

but a few. And just like any muscle, it needs investment of time and

practice to strengthen. However, every organization can take positive

steps starting from within: Identify your best managers — the ones who

are already doing some of these things. Determine the speciﬁc habits

and behaviors that set them apart, then follow a “best teach the rest”

approach to help others learn how to develop similar capabilities. This

is beyond simple training; it is about teaching, coaching, role modeling,

and rewarding new ways of working every day.

In short: Instead of setting top-down mandates and expecting frontline

managers to enforce them, leaders ought to focus on empowering those

managers to co-create ways of working with their teams that are best

suited to the needs of the people and the work they do, as well as the

## digital and GenAI tools at their disposal.

While it may be easier to follow the crowd and issue blanket return-to-

oﬃce policies, the potential upside of implementing thoughtful changes

based on the four categories above is not only worth it — it will soon

become an imperative for businesses that want to create and sustain

## work and talent advantages into the future.
