In the ongoing, heated debate about the costs and beneﬁts of remote

work, a pivotal advantage often goes underappreciated. The ability to

quickly transition a workforce to remote work when necessary provides

policy. And that sort of ﬂexibility will only become more critical in

a warming world, where extreme weather is (sadly) becoming more

# common.

Companies’ readiness to remote work obviously proved crucial during

the Covid-19 pandemic. During the onset of the pandemic, workers

could suddenly not safely go to the oﬃce anymore. As a result, ﬁrms

that were more remote-work-ready lost, on average, $98.81 million less

## in quarterly revenue than their less prepared competitors, and similarly

outperformed them on other performance metrics, such as net incomes and stock returns. This eﬀect is most pronounced during the ﬁrst three

quarter of the 2020. As the pandemic progressed, less remote-work-

ready competitors eventually caught up, in part due to increased tech

hiring and IT investment as well as workforce reorganization to enable

remote work practices. But the damage was already done.

While we may hope to not see a global pandemic again anytime soon,

the advantage of remote-work readiness extends beyond pandemics

to include unforeseen natural disasters like snowstorms, ﬂoods,

hurricanes, or wildﬁre smoke, which can swiftly impede worker

mobility. Notably, ﬁrms equipped for remote work have demonstrated

## commendable resilience in the face of these events. This adaptability

not only safeguards operational continuity but can also result in

substantial cost savings in the millions of dollars, illustrating the

advantages of maintaining a remote-ready workforce beyond pandemic

# scenarios.

Over the past 12 years, U.S. ﬁrms with a remote-work ready workforce

maintained a distinct edge when impacted by such disasters — yielding

around $70 million more in the quarterly revenue on average, compared

## to their less-prepared counterparts during the quarter of the crises.

These disasters, causing damages exceeding a billion dollars each,

## include notable events like Hurricane Sandy and Hurricane Ian. This

demonstrates the substantial economic beneﬁts reaped by ﬁrms with robust remote-work readiness in eﬀectively navigating and recovering

## from the impacts of severe natural disasters.

We reached this conclusion by compiling information on workforce and

hiring intent from a vast pool of over 300 million online job postings

and then integrating this data with occupation-level remote-work

readiness scores. This index served as a quantiﬁable metric, assessing

the ability of ﬁrms to smoothly transition to remote work when faced

with unexpected events. The study then incorporated Compustat data,

including company performance data, headquarters locations, and

information on software investments, to provide additional depth to the

# analysis.

Then we added data on more than 370 billion-dollar natural disasters

(i.e., events that caused more than $1 billion in total damages) from

## the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA).This

strategic approach allowed for a comparative evaluation of the

## performance of more remote-work-ready ﬁrms against their less-

## prepared counterparts before and during these impactful events.

According to NOAA, U.S. billion-dollar disasters cost a total of $595.5

## billion, with an annual average cost of $119.1 billion between 2018 and

2022 alone — nearly three times the 43-year inﬂation-adjusted average

cost. As these types of disasters are evidently more common, remote-

work readiness will need to become an increasingly important aspect of

ﬁrms’ HR and workforce management strategies.

Our measure is capturing whether a company employs people in

occupations that can easily work remotely. To some degree, that’s

diﬃcult to change: A software engineer can work remotely more easily

than a barista, and management can’t do much about that. However,

we believe our research suggests that ﬁrms proactively shift their

operations toward remote-work readiness. There are, after all, plenty

of ﬁrms that could be more remote-work-ready than they are today.

It’s important not to wait for disaster to strike before planning a remote

## work strategy. At the onset of the pandemic, numerous companies

found themselves competing for scarce resources, complicating the

adoption of remote work practices. Moreover, equipping a workforce

to seamlessly transition to remote work, embracing virtual meetings

and cloud collaboration, can be a time-intensive process, particularly

for less technically inclined employees. In today’s competitive

business environment, maintaining an inactive workforce during such unforeseen shocks is a luxury few ﬁrms can aﬀord.

Notably, our ﬁndings do not necessarily advocate for a permanent

shift to remote work practices but rather emphasize the importance of

remote work as an organizational capability. Remote work can present

considerable drawbacks, encompassing challenges such as blurred

work boundaries, isolation, diminished team cohesion, and reduced

cross-team collaboration. As the new work landscape takes shape, it

appears that ﬂexible hybrid work arrangements are becoming the new standard, oﬀering the advantages of both the home oﬃce and in-oﬃce

## environments. Crucially, these ﬂexible remote-work arrangements

maintain the readiness necessary to navigate the potentially disastrous eﬀects of the next unexpected natural disaster, whenever it may occur.

Evidently, ﬁrms today are considerably more remote-work-ready than

they were in early 2020.

While investments in remote-work readiness are not without cost, they

can help minimize harm during increasingly likely natural disasters.

Moreover, the investments required to establish remote-work readiness

## often complement various other productivity-boosting practices. For

## example, investments in cloud computing and other communication

technologies may foster cross-team collaboration and improve ﬁrm

performance, while cultivating a more geographically-diverse workforce

which may foster innovation and facilitate the identiﬁcation of

new markets. Overall, we believe measures to enhance remote-work readiness will prove to be cost-eﬀective, as they unlock a plethora of

synergies within ﬁrms. And they will, unfortunately, be an increasingly

necessary part of maintaining operations and keeping employees safe
