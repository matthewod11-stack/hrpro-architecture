Who is Covered

# Section 212(a)(5)(A) of the Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) is administered by the Oﬃce of Foreign Labor Certiﬁcation (OFLC)

# of the Employment and Training Administration (ETA). This Section applies to employers seeking to hire foreign workers

## immigrating to the United States for the purpose of permanent employment.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

A permanent labor certiﬁcation issued by the Department of Labor (DOL) is most often the ﬁrst step in allowing an employer to hire

a foreign worker to work permanently in the United States. In most instances, before the U.S. employer can submit a petition to

the Department of Homeland Security's U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) seeking to hire a foreign worker as an immigrant, the employer must obtain an approved labor certiﬁcation from the ETA. The Department of Labor must certify to

USCIS that there are no U.S. workers able, willing, qualiﬁed, and available to accept the job and that employment of the alien will

not adversely aﬀect the wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.

An employer must ﬁle with ETA an Application for Permanent Employment Certiﬁcation (ETA Form

9089(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-laborpdf/9089form.pdf)). The application describes in detail the job duties, educational requirements, training, experience, and other special capabilities the employee must possess to do the work, and a statement of

## the prospective immigrant's qualiﬁcations.

Prior to ﬁling ETA Form 9089 with ETA, the employer must request a prevailing wage determination from the State Workforce

Agency (SWA)(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-laborcontacts.cfm) having jurisdiction over the proposed area of intended

employment. In addition, the employer (except for those applications involving college or university teachers selected pursuant to a competitive recruitment and selection process) must have conducted certain recruitment activities to ﬁnd U.S. workers prior to

ﬁling the application.

The employer must recruit under the standards for professional occupations set forth in 20 CFR Part 656.17(e)(1) if the occupation

involved is on the list of occupations. This list is published in Appendix A to the preamble of the ﬁnal

regulation(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-laborpdf/PERM_Final_Rule_12-27-04_FR.pdf#Page=53), and a bachelor's or higher degree is a customary requirement. For all other occupations not normally requiring a bachelor's or higher degree, employers can

# recruit under the requirements for nonprofessional occupations at 20 CFR Part 656.17(e)(2).

# Employee Rights

All appropriate protections under U.S labor laws apply to workers who received their permanent residency based on a permanent labor certiﬁcation from the Department of Labor.

There is no poster requirement. However, employers must provide notice of the ﬁling of the application and be able to document

that notice was provided, if requested. Notice must be provided between 30 and 180 days before an application is ﬁled.

Notice must be given to:

The bargaining representative, if any, of the employer's employees in the occupational classiﬁcation for which the certiﬁcation is being sought in the employer's location of intended employment;

Employees at the facility or location of employment, if there is no bargaining representative; and

Household employees, only if one or more U.S. worker is employed.

# The notice must be posted for 10 consecutive business days and must be visible and in a conspicuous place. Employers must

# also publish the notice in any and all in-house media, electronic and printed, in accordance with the normal procedures used for

## recruitment for similar positions in the organization.

The notice must include the statement that an application has been ﬁled under the program; address of the appropriate DOL

oﬃcer to whom the application sent; and information in the job advertisements including wage rate and job description.

Labor certiﬁcation process. The Department of Labor processes applications for Alien Employment Certiﬁcation (ETA Form 9089). The date the labor certiﬁcation application is ﬁled is known as the ﬁling date and is used by USCIS and the U.S.

Department of State as the priority date for visa issuance. After the labor certiﬁcation application is approved by the Department

of Labor, it should be submitted to the USCIS service center with an I-140, Immigrant Petition for Alien Worker. You may access

the State Department Visa Bulletin(http://travel.state.gov/visa/bulletin/bulletin_1360.html) to learn which priority dates are currently

being processed.

Records. The employer is required to retain documentation supporting the application for ﬁve years from the date of ﬁling the

Application for Permanent Employment Certiﬁcation. This documentation varies depending on the type of application ﬁled (for a

professional, a non-professional position, or for a college or university professor engaged from a competitive recruitment process)

but generally includes recruitment documentation, including information regarding the number of potential U.S. applicants and the

reasons for rejection of these workers. The SWA prevailing wage determination documentation is not submitted with the application, but it must be retained for ﬁve years from the date the employer ﬁles the application.

There are no reporting requirements.

If possible fraud or willful misrepresentation involving a labor certiﬁcation is discovered before a ﬁnal labor certiﬁcation

determination, ETA will refer the matter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for investigation. In addition, ETA can take

steps to revoke an approved labor certiﬁcation if ETA ﬁnds the certiﬁcation was not justiﬁed, including if fraud or willful

misrepresentation is discovered, and the employer, attorney, and/or agent can be barred from ﬁling applications for up to three years. Additionally, DHS or the Department of State may invalidate a labor certiﬁcation if the agency determines there has been

fraud or willful misrepresentation involving the labor certiﬁcation. Finally, if the Department learns that an employer, attorney, or

agent is involved in possible fraud or willful misrepresentation in connection with the permanent labor certiﬁcation program, the

Department will refer the matter to the Department of Justice, Department of Homeland Security, or other government entity, as

appropriate, for investigation, and send a copy of the referral to the Department of Labor's Oﬃce of Inspector General.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

Various Federal state and local labor standards, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA), will apply to foreign workers

employed in the U.S.
