In the fast-paced world of entrepreneurship, success seems to hinge

on knowing when to seize the opportunity to expand and when to

bide your time. The question is: Does the “fast and furious” or “slow

and steady” approach to scaling reign supreme in the race to startup

# success?

Within Silicon Valley circles, many advocate that rapidly expanding

your business, or scaling quickly, stands out as one of the most (if

not the most) eﬀective strategies to gain global traction and establish

a formidable position in the market. In their 2018 book Blitzscaling,

Reid Hoﬀman and Chris Yeh contend that speed is the most important

## edge in today’s economy, and companies like Facebook and Uber

provide successful examples of startups that scaled quickly and beat

out competitors to dominate the market.

Unfortunately, however, this fast and furious approach has also led

numerous companies to failure. For instance, Groupon’s breakneck

growth didn’t allow for a critical assessment of its deals’ long-term

sustainability, ultimately resulting in major setbacks. Companies like

Homejoy and Baroo neglected essential experimentation with new

markets and overlooked the crucial process of aligning their products

with customer needs, ultimately leading to their downfall.

An alternative approach is to take a slow and steady route. While

some argue that moving more slowly allows competitors to gain an

edge, some companies have achieved tremendous success by being

patient and strategically timing their growth. Take PillPack, an online

pharmacy startup founded in 2013 and later acquired by Amazon in

- 2018. PillPack emerged from the MIT Hacking Medicine hackathon

in 2013 and went through extensive experimentation, participating

in the Techstars startup accelerator and collaborating with IDEO

for product design. After validating ideas through an experimental

store in New Hampshire, they initiated signiﬁcant scaling eﬀorts in

- 2016. This involved hiring nationwide, launching PharmacyOS, and

achieving $100 million in revenue. Thus, PillPack’s success was rooted

## in meticulous timing and systematic experimentation.

Given these conﬂicting data points, it is evident that the timing of

scaling is crucial but challenging to grasp and study. This realization

led us to the compelling question: When should startups scale?

# The Risks of Scaling Early

In our recent research, we analyzed large-scale data from Burning

Glass Technologies and Crunchbase. This data included 6.3 million job

postings from 2010 to 2019 listed by 38,217 U.S.-founded startups. We

discovered that when startups begin scaling, they typically hire their

ﬁrst manager and salesperson to coordinate a growing workforce and

expand their customer base.

Leveraging this insight, we used the ﬁrst job postings for these two

roles to capture the timing of when a startup begins to scale. Our

analyses revealed that early scaling (within the ﬁrst 12 months of

founding) increases the risk of failure by 20 to 40%. Furthermore,

this risk of failure is particularly prominent for two-sided platform

companies. However, we also found that when startups incorporate

## experimentation through A/B testing, the adverse eﬀect of early scaling

# on the likelihood of failure decreases.

So, what’s driving the dynamic between scaling speed, experimentation,

and failure? We propose that it boils down to one pivotal force that every

startup must navigate: commitment risk. Scaling requires committing

to an idea, strategy, or product, even if it’s not fully reﬁned. The

risk underlying this commitment is heightened when startups scale

prematurely, as they lock themselves into a particular direction before

fully developing their concept.

In contrast, when startups take the time to scale, they avoid the

risk of committing too early. This approach gives them the leeway

to experiment, reﬁne their idea, and make improvements over time.

Although they may encounter challenges like competition or imitation,

they gain the ﬂexibility to adjust their ideas and strategies. Based on our

ﬁndings, it’s evident that the risk of committing too soon outweighs the

# potential beneﬁts of rapid growth.

Especially for platform companies, scaling too early can prove

## detrimental to their success, despite their need for network eﬀects.

These ﬁrms often need more time for experimentation, learning, and

understanding the complex interdependencies on both sides of their

## market. Additionally, many platforms (such as Amazon, Facebook, or

Uber) operate within heavily regulated markets where it is crucial to

## fully comprehend regulatory risks and policies before committing.

Take Olive AI, for example, which shut down in November 2023. Their

speedy scaling led to a diverse clientele, from small businesses to large

hospitals. This resulted in a mismatch in user experience as each type of

client had diﬀerent needs. Instead of building a loyal client base, Olive

AI prioritized acquiring more clients of any size to impress investors

with its growth. A more measured approach involving experimentation

and A/B testing within speciﬁc customer segments before full-scale

expansion might have laid the stage for a more focused strategy and

# greater success.

Similarly, take Convoy, which ceased operations in October 2023. The

discounts and incentives they oﬀered during their initial attempt to

dominate the market resulted in disloyal customers when market

dynamics changed. A more patient approach of focusing on sustainable

pricing, rather than establishing market dominance, could have

potentially led to greater success.

# What Entrepreneurs Should Consider

By unpacking how the timing of scaling impacts startup outcomes,

our research provides insight into what entrepreneurs should prioritize

when formulating their scaling strategy:

- 1. Don’t rush into scaling early. First and foremost, startups should

exercise caution when scaling early. Despite the allure of rapid

growth and the prevailing narrative that fast and furious is the

best path to startup success, it’s crucial to approach early scaling

with discernment. Avoid scaling your business and committing to a

concept until you’ve achieved product-market ﬁt. Premature scaling

can signiﬁcantly jeopardize your startup’s chances of success.

- 2. Embrace experimentation. Secondly, it’s important to embrace

a culture of experimentation and make strategic use of A/B

testing. In the dynamic landscape of startup growth, experimenting

## with diﬀerent concepts, strategies, and customer segments allows

entrepreneurs to gather valuable insights and validate assumptions

before committing to the costly process of scaling.

A limitation of our research is that it examines only one dimension of

scaling — speciﬁcally, its timing — and how this dimension inﬂuences

startup success and failure. Other dimensions, such as mode (i.e.,

## whether startups scale organically, through acquisitions, or through

## strategic alliances) or geography (i.e., which markets or regions they

scale into) may also signiﬁcantly impact startup performance. Hence,

many valuable insights into the dynamics of startup scaling remain to

be uncovered.

. . .

Although it may seem less exciting and glamorous in an era where rapid

growth is celebrated, patience can ensure a more promising long-term

trajectory for budding startups. In the end, slow and steady truly wins

# the race.
