“I felt like I was going to throw up,” Filip confessed to me during our

coaching session. “Giving feedback is something a leader should be able

to do every day without breaking a sweat,” he said. “But for me, it feels

# like the end of the world.”

Filip was the director of project management at a company that oﬀered

translation services for streaming content providers across the globe.

Hard working (sometimes to a fault), Filip was an expert at juggling

multiple priorities, coordinating translators, quality control experts,

and client liaisons across time zones, languages, and cultures. He had

a knack for thriving in ambiguity, keeping his eye on strategic goals

without getting lost in minutiae.

Filip also prided himself on always having his team’s back, even if it

involved taking the heat from an irate executive. But when it came

to delivering feedback to his direct reports, Filip’s resilient exterior

crumbled. He would be overcome with worries of damaging the

relationships he had worked so hard to build. He’d overthink what to say

for hours — sometimes days. The mere thought of uttering the words, “I

have some feedback for you,” made him nauseous.

When a high-stakes project spearheaded by Angelique, one of Filip’s

brightest team members, failed, it brought his fear of giving feedback

into sharp focus. For two weeks Filip had sensed something was amiss.

The team’s low spirits and sluggish performance concerned him, but he

told himself Angelique would pull everything together in the end. He

never voiced his concerns, and the cost was devastating. Their biggest

account would now be going to a diﬀerent provider who could provide

# better service.

“I could have prevented this. I should have spoken up.” Filip told me.

His story echoes a struggle I hear from many of my executive coaching

clients: How do I overcome the fear of giving feedback? Whether you

worry about causing tension, demotivating your people, or handling

others’ emotional reactions, conﬂict aversion is a common trait, and

managers aren’t immune to it.

You’re not doing anyone a favor by avoiding conﬂict. When problems

go unaddressed or are swept under the rug, everyone suﬀers, including

you. A lack of constructive feedback is also detrimental to your team,

depriving them of mentorship and growth opportunities. Workplaces

marked by poor communication and unclear expectations are breeding

# grounds for low trust and disengagement.

Here’s how to navigate the sense of discomfort and apprehension that comes with diﬃcult conversations, so you can say what needs to be said.

# Challenge binary thinking.

Many leaders who avoid confrontation carry assumptions like, “no one

likes a micromanager,” or “bringing up this issue will ruin our working

relationship.” While these beliefs may stem from past experiences

with rejection and failure, they reﬂect inaccurate, binary thinking. In

actuality, it’s possible to be both assertive and direct without damaging relationships or earning a reputation as the “diﬃcult manager.”

Instead, focus on what you could gain by speaking up and the potential

rewards of clear communication. Not only will voicing your thoughts

help you feel more conﬁdent, but:

- Your input may be exactly what’s needed to drive a challenging

# assignment to completion

- That candid comment you make to a coworker about their

disruptive behavior could result in a more peaceful, productive work

# environment.

- Your constructive criticism could help a team member develop and

grow in their role, opening up new career opportunities

When you look more closely, you’ll see that expressing your thoughts, feelings, and opinions is far more beneﬁcial than stuﬃng them down

and suﬀering the consequences.

See feedback as a tool.

Despite what you may believe, your team craves meaningful, candid

feedback. While 72% of employees rated “managers providing critical

feedback” as important for them in career development, only 5% believe

managers provide such feedback. Likewise, when team members don’t

think their boss is great at giving honest feedback, their engagement

scores typically take a nosedive. But on the ﬂip side, leaders who rank in

the top 10% at giving honest feedback create teams that rank in the top

# 23% of engagement.

It’s not fair to deprive your team of information they need to grow.

When you reframe conﬂict as a healthy, normative part of leadership, it loosens the anticipatory anxiety you may feel broaching diﬃcult

topics with others. Next time you have to give feedback, take a deep

breath and remember, you’re not causing a conﬂict, you’re guiding

your people toward growth. You’re not criticizing; you’re nurturing. And

you’re certainly not being a villain; you’re being the leader they need.

# Anticipate eventualities.

Fear of the unknown or wondering how the recipient will react can hold

many leaders back from ever speaking up. What if your direct report

becomes defensive and lashes out at you? What if they start crying?

You can calm your anxiety and handle uncertainty using the worst case/

best case/most likely tool. Consider the worst that could happen. If your

employee cries, for example, how would you handle it? Perhaps you’d

take a time out. Then consider the best that could possibly happen to

foster more optimism. Finally, consider what is most likely, which is

## usually somewhere between the two extremes.

# Start strong.

You can also ease your whirlwind of thoughts by planning your opening.

Being in control from the get-go can provide a conﬁdence boost and

allows you to set a respectful tone for the conversation. Once Filip

realized he needed to tackle the situation with Angelique head on, he

approached her and said: “I appreciate your dedication and creativity.

Something I wanted to talk about is a pattern of low morale, and I want

to understand if there are any obstacles that we can address together.”

Using “I” statements whenever possible helps ensure you communicate

directly without vacillating or minimizing your concerns simply

because you’re scared. Being speciﬁc is also important. Rather than

saying, “You dropped the ball again,” try saying, “I’m concerned that I

didn’t get the documents in time for the client meeting today.”

# Make feedback part of the process.

Feedback should be a regular ritual, not an occasional blast. Making

feedback a habit ensures the tiny annoyances and frustrations you

harbor don’t blow up into major conﬂicts. Plus, gradually exposing

yourself to fearful situations is the best way to overcome them. The

more you practice giving feedback in lower-stakes, everyday scenarios

as part of your role, the better at it you’ll become.

A great way to systematize feedback is through regular one-on-ones

with your team. You can also schedule project debriefs where team

members can reﬂect, or pre-mortems where people can discuss in

advance any risks, potential problems, and ﬂesh out how they’ll work

# with one another.

Creating a positive feedback culture will give you opportunities to ﬂex

your newfound assertiveness skills while also strengthening rapport and

can hope for.
