## With remarkable shifts in research and advances in medicine, life

expectancy more than doubled between 1900 and 2021. Yet, there are

many illnesses that still don’t have a cure. This means that, at some

point in your career as a manager, you may have someone with a

# terminal illness on your team.

When an employee receives a terminal diagnosis, continuing to work

might oﬀer them a sense of normalcy and purpose. Work can provide

a respite by helping them maintain social connections and feel

# productive.

At the same time, there will inevitably be diﬃcult moments for

everyone involved. Unlike many work challenges, it’s not about a

business outcome. It’s about balancing the responsibilities of your role

as a leader with the emotionally charged period leading up to the loss of

## someone you and your team know and care for.

Our recent research focused on how becoming aware of an employee’s

terminal illness can incite negative and positive leadership behaviors

among managers. We learned that while this situation requires

managers at any level to skillfully blend compassion with strategy,

ﬁrst-time managers ﬁnd this situation most challenging as their inexperience can make it diﬃcult to balance empathy with the demands

of their role. We also learned that some managers may struggle with the

emotional toll of supporting a colleague through a terminal illness while

also maintaining team morale and productivity. The pressure to manage

their own feelings, provide adequate support, and uphold workplace

stability can be overwhelming.

We recently expanded our research (forthcoming in BMJ Leader) as we wanted to understand how managers navigate the profoundly diﬃcult

challenge of managing a terminally ill employee. We conducted 60-

minute semi-structured interviews with 21 supervisors — 18 of whom

were new to this role — who each managed a terminally ill employee.

The questions focused on their experiences, the challenges they faced,

and the strategies they found most eﬀective in supporting persons with

terminal illnesses. Among other questions, we asked:

- Can you describe the speciﬁc challenges you faced when managing a

terminally ill employee?

- How did you approach conversations with the terminally ill employee

# about their work and health needs?

- What steps did you take to ensure knowledge transfer from the

## terminally ill employee to other team members?

- What strategies did you ﬁnd most eﬀective in supporting the

terminally ill employee while maintaining team morale?

In addition to our interviews, we spent up to three days in each

manager’s organization observing team dynamics and workplace

interactions. We also spoke with 10 terminally ill employees and 20

of their coworkers at those organizations, gathering their perspectives

on what worked well for them. These insights were then triangulated

with our interviews with the supervisors, providing us with invaluable

insights into the real-world challenges and practices that were eﬀective

in supporting terminally ill employees.

Conducting research within workplaces where these situations were

unfolding allowed us to observe interactions, practices, and the overall

environment ﬁrsthand. Our inquiries helped us further understand the unique diﬃculties and eﬀective practices in these sensitive situations.

Based the insights we gathered, we’ve identiﬁed with three interlinked

recommendations to help both new and experienced managers address

## both the emotional and practical aspect of the impending loss of a

colleague. We hope that by integrating them, managers can create

a supportive environment that values and respects the needs of

terminally ill employees, maintains team morale, and ensures business

# continuity.

# Support Your Terminally Ill Employee

Your ﬁrst step is to make sure your employee feels a sense of security

and belonging. To do that, here are two things you need to focus on.

Involve them. Talking to your employee about their needs isn’t just

practical, it allows you to provide emotional support. Letting them

express their needs can provide clarity, direction, and purpose, as well

as help them to feel valued and respected.

“When Laura expressed her desire to mentor someone to take over

her projects, it gave her a sense of purpose and allowed her to leave a

lasting legacy,” one manager shared. Similarly, a terminally ill employee

shared, “Discussing how I wanted to transition my responsibilities and

make changes to my role gave me peace of mind and a sense of control

over my work.”

Address their needs. It’s crucial to adapt your work environment to

meet the physical and emotional needs of a terminally ill employee.

This might involve restructuring team responsibilities or providing

them with options like remote work, ﬂexible hours, or extended

leave. Such ﬂexibility can signiﬁcantly help improve the terminally ill

employee’s quality of life and ability to contribute eﬀectively.

“Being able to work from home gave me a sense of dignity and control.

I could manage my energy and still contribute meaningfully, which

made me feel valued rather than pitied,” one terminally ill employee

shared. Similarly, one supervisor mentioned how adjusting a terminally

ill employee’s schedule helped: “We shifted Tim’s hours to be more

ﬂexible, so he could work when he felt up to it and rest when needed.

It gave him peace of mind knowing he could still do what he loved

without overexerting himself.” A team member reﬂected, “Knowing our

company was willing to bend the rules for someone going through such

a tough time made me proud to be part of this team. It wasn’t just

about work—it was about showing we care.” Another team member also

shared, “Knowing that our company values ﬂexibility made it easier for

us to rally around our terminally ill colleague and provide the necessary

# support without hesitation.”

One option to consider is to implement a future role-planning initiative

where the terminally ill employee can help design the future structure

of their role or department. This not only shows respect for their

expertise but also give them a chance to make a lasting impact on the

organization’s future.

In our research, we observed two organizations who took this approach.

In one, managers found that involving the terminally ill employee in

planning their role’s transition gave them a sense of control and purpose during a diﬃcult time. However, it’s important to note that responses

to this approach may vary — while some employees may welcome the

opportunity to contribute, others may ﬁnd it somewhat triggering and

prefer a less formal role in future planning, which was the case in the

# second organization.

# Keep Up Team Morale

After establishing a supportive environment for managing the

terminally ill employee, it’s equally important to focus on your team’s

emotions and morale. To achieve this, here are a few things you can do.

Balance honesty with sensitivity. When talking to your team

members about the situation, use compassionate language and provide

clear, factual information that can help the other employees feel

empowered to support their colleague.

You might say, “While [colleague] is facing serious health challenges, we

are committed to supporting them in every way possible. It’s important

that we remain strong and united during this time.” This fosters a sense

of security and shows that the organization values the well-being of all

# its members.

Listen actively. To support your team members, our research indicates

that it’s essential to oﬀer speciﬁc times and spaces for them team

to express their feelings and process the situation. Facilitated group

discussions, counseling sessions, or informal gatherings can make a

signiﬁcant diﬀerence. You can look to HR or your employee assistance

program for resources and guidance on how to do this.

One manager recalled how he held weekly group discussions where

everyone could share their feelings. These sessions provided a

structured yet empathetic environment for employees to voice their

concerns and support each other. Our ﬁndings also showed that the

need for emotional support evolves as the illness progresses, and

managers should remain ﬂexible, adapting the format and frequency

of these discussions based on team needs and feedback.

During these discussions, signal active listening by nodding along, maintaining eye contact, and oﬀering aﬃrmations like “I understand”

or “I hear you.” By being fully present, managers can reinforce

a compassionate and cohesive team dynamic even in the most

challenging situation.

# Manage Business Continuity

While supporting the team is critically important, managers have the

added responsibility of making sure that any needed work gets done. To walk this diﬃcult line:

Take action right away. To ensure a smooth transition, it’s crucial to

act quickly once the news of a terminal illness is shared. Our research

suggests that managers should work closely with the terminally ill

employee to document key responsibilities, processes, and unique

knowledge. There are a few ways you can do this.

You can assign a team member to immediately shadow the employee

to observe daily tasks, join key meetings, and learn essential processes

directly. For example, if the employee manages speciﬁc client

relationships or handles specialized tasks, the shadow can participate

in these activities to grasp the subtleties involved. As the employee’s

condition changes, shadowing can adapt to virtual sessions or brief

check-ins, allowing for continuous knowledge transfer even if the

employee’s health declines.

Another option is to pair the terminally ill employee with

team members for mentorship, providing a hands-on approach to

transferring practical insights. Formalizing these mentorship sessions

with regular meetings and clear objectives ensures a systematic transfer

of knowledge. One team leader told us, “John mentored several team

members, and the knowledge he passed on was invaluable.” This

approach not only facilitates the transfer of essential skills but also

strengthens team relationships and builds conﬁdence among team

# members.

Make it a team eﬀort. Our research indicates that engaging team

members in discussions about the transition of responsibilities is key

to maintaining productivity and morale. One manager shared how

they created weekly transition meetings in which team members were

encouraged to ask questions about the transition process and oﬀer their

input on how to best oversee the projects previously managed by their

terminally ill colleague. “We found that this level of transparency and

involvement helped the team feel more united and empowered during a

challenging time,” the manager explained.

In cases where there may not be time for a complete transition due

to sudden changes in the employee’s health, it’s crucial to develop

a contingency plan. This could include identifying critical tasks that

need immediate coverage, assigning temporary point people for urgent

projects, and maintaining a shared document or platform where key

information is regularly updated. One manager shared how their team

created a contingency plan that included cross-training team members

on critical tasks and documenting key processes and contacts. When

their colleague passed away unexpectedly, this preparation allowed

the team to quickly reassign responsibilities and continue work with

minimal disruption. This proactive planning helps the team remain

resilient and focused, even in the face of sudden changes.

. . .

By integrating these strategies, managers can provide a compassionate

and practical approach that addresses both the emotional and

functional needs of the terminally ill employee and the team, creating

a supportive, resilient work environment. This approach will not only

help you deliver on your business responsibilities as a leader, but it will

also foster a culture of empathy and support that can positively impact

# the entire organization.

Ultimately, handling such sensitive situations with care and

thoughtfulness can strengthen team cohesion and enhance the overall

## workplace morale. In moments of profound challenge, the way we

support one another deﬁnes our humanity and the enduring strength of

our workplace community. By prioritizing compassion and connection,

we honor the dignity and contributions of every individual.
