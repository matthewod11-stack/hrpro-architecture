You’re doing ﬁne at work. You’re working remotely, hitting your targets,

and keeping things moving—but ﬁne doesn’t really feel fulﬁlling.

Poor performance management, lack of visibility, repetitive routines,

and restricted growth opportunities can result in feelings of frustration,

stagnation, and boredom. Maybe you have a boss who doesn’t see your

potential. Maybe there’s lots to do, but none of it excites you.

## HBR / Digital Article / In a Slump at Work? Here’s How to Motivate Yourself.

## In an uncertain economy where layoﬀs loom and job opportunities

feel scarce, the idea of making a career move might not feel realistic

or like something you even want to pursue. And when you work

remotely, there might be fewer opportunities for spontaneous career-

## focused conversations or organic networking opportunities where you

can chat, observe, and learn. If it doesn’t feel like there’s a promotion on

your horizon or immediate opportunities for growth, how do you stay

motivated? What should you do if it feels like there’s nothing to look

# forward to?

The good news is you have more control over your career than you

might think. Here are ﬁve options to reignite your motivation at work—

no matter how remote you are.

Create your own mini performance review.

If you’ve been at your company for a while and have been through at

least one performance review cycle, now’s a good time to go back and

revisit it. In my work as a career coach, I’ve observed that most people

ﬁle away their reviews and only revisit them when the next one is due.

However, past conversations could hold clues about what you could be

doing right now to invest in your growth.

What themes came up in your last performance review? What are your

core strengths? What goals did you share in that conversation but

haven’t acted on? What constructive feedback did you receive?

Goals or suggestions from your last review can serve as a springboard

for thinking about speciﬁc, actionable goals to pursue in the next few

months. You can also reﬂect on any changes in your role, team, or the

company since that last performance conversation. In addition, if your

company has shifted priorities since your last review, consider what you

could explore to match those new needs.

Sometimes your previous performance review feedback may not give

you the clarity or direction you need. I’ve coached professionals who

found themselves out of sync with their supervisor’s assessment,

received vague feedback, or had their review led by someone who’s

no longer on the team. In these cases, it can be valuable to build

relationships with senior leaders and trusted peers who can oﬀer

## constructive insights on areas for growth and opportunity.

Completing your own mini performance review using past reviews and

feedback from trusted peers doesn’t just mean looking back; it provides

the opportunity to examine the present. Consider the next three to six

months and ask yourself: What would you love to accomplish?

Seek a stretch assignment.

When you proactively seek out a stretch assignment, chances are your

manager or teammates will see it as a win-win opportunity. Taking

on a project that interests you and challenges you in new ways will

expand your skills and has the potential to reignite your engagement. In

## addition, it can position you as a forward-thinking collaborator.

Think about what’s important to your leadership right now. What

initiatives or priorities have they shared during all-staﬀs or town

hall meetings? Does your company utilize cross-functional teams for

internal initiatives or community programs that you could contribute

to? Even in a remote environment, there may be more opportunities to

collaborate across teams than you might realize.

What are your team’s or department’s objectives for this ﬁscal year?

Where are there opportunities for you to support or add value? After

surveying the landscape for opportunities, suggest ways you can

contribute. Or, if you’re not sure where you could add the most value,

ask your manager if there’s something they need help with. Expressing

interest may open a door you didn’t know existed.

If you’re feeling demotivated, it may feel hard at ﬁrst to ﬁnd the

enthusiasm in the short term, but I encourage you to zoom out and

consider the bigger picture. Exploring opportunities to contribute in

new ways will strengthen your resume and increase your visibility for

when promotion opportunities arise. A stretch assignment could help

you uncover a new interest, leverage your skills in new ways, and

increase your exposure to other leaders or decisions-makers at your

company. All these things will accelerate your growth. In addition, you’ll

have concrete examples of your initiative, leadership, and adaptability.

Explore opportunities to shadow others.

If you’ve been feeling uninspired in your own workﬂow, consider

exploring how other people in your organization approach their work.

To identify potential opportunities, look at projects, roles, or

departments that interest you. Think beyond your ideal role and focus

on the kind of tasks and collaborations that energize you. Ask if you can

connect with a peer. This might involve joining a meeting or observing

how they approach key tasks via screen-sharing as they work.

In his book Nonlinear, author Kevin Bethune recounts how he landed

a job at Nike as a business planner after receiving his MBA from

Carnegie Mellon. While he appreciated the opportunity, Kevin wanted

to learn more about product design. He started networking across Nike

to connect with individuals pursuing that work.

A conversation with D’Wayne Edwards, who was the footwear design

director for Jordan, led to 6 a.m. meetings for Bethune and Edwards before the oﬃcial workday began. This resulted in an opportunity for

Bethune to take on the ultimate stretch assignment: his ﬁrst-ever shot at

designing footwear.

Shadowing a peer can help you learn more about your organization,

gain new skills, build relationships, and bring much-needed new energy

# and perspectives to your work week.

Strengthen your skills by sharing your knowledge.

I’ve witnessed from my own career how connecting with someone to

share your work and experiences and answer their questions can unlock

# various beneﬁts for both parties.

At ﬁrst glance, mentoring or advising someone else may seem

counterintuitive when you’re the one looking for growth. It is, of

course, a great way to pay it forward. But mentoring also provides the

opportunity for you to learn new things from your mentee’s shared

# perspectives.

Ask your manager if there are opportunities to mentor junior

employees, or oﬀer to lead a training session. If your company has an

internship program, are there ways for you to lend support? Sharing

your knowledge with others can remind you just how much you’ve

learned and accomplished already in your career. It can be easy to take

that for granted. In addition, teaching a skill can help break up the

monotony you’re feeling because it provides an opportunity for you to

articulate and apply your skills. Witnessing the transformation in others

can feel incredibly rewarding.

Mentoring doesn’t have to be a long-term commitment. Even a single

conversation can have an impact on someone’s career and remind you

of what you’ve achieved.

# Recognize incremental wins.

Throughout my career as a coach, I’ve seen how professionals’

momentum can stall when they overlook the everyday achievements

that collectively drive their growth. Last year, I took on a stretch

assignment to develop Fire Memos, a platform designed to help

professionals record and recognize their wins in real time. If you’re

waiting for the next major milestone, you might be missing the impact

of smaller wins happening every day. Too many of us underestimate the

impact of what we do. At the end of each week, reﬂect on your progress,

write down at least three wins, and commit to continuing to add to that

list. If you stick to it, by the end of each month you’ll have at least a

dozen achievements documented that you may have forgotten about

# otherwise.

Over time, these reﬂections become a powerful narrative of your

growth, even during what might feel like slower phases of your career.

Maintaining this habit will make it easier to advocate for yourself when

the time comes and recognize how much you’re contributing in the

# interim.

. . .

Remember that slow seasons can nurture growth. It’s not uncommon

to feel bored during certain periods at work, but don’t allow boredom

to become stagnation. Your career is the most personal and the most

valuable investment you’ll ever make. It’s up to you to be proactive

about how you seek out opportunities to learn, grow, and evolve. In fact,

slow seasons can be a precursor to something new and exhilarating—

whether that’s an idea, a revelation about what you need to do your

best work or what you want to explore next, or even just a deeper

understanding of who you are. It’s up to you to determine how you will

handle it, seize new challenges, and ﬁnd the silver lining.
