## When Trust Takes Away from Effective Collaboration

Research shows that it takes a long time to build interpersonal trust

in organizations. When people from different groups come together

to cross-collaborate on important strategic challenges, there will be

low trust between the individuals who haven’t worked together before.

The same is true when a startup brings in new executives to help

## scale the business, or when an incumbent organization brings in new

## individuals with new competences into their decision-making processes

# and management team.

Heuristics like “collaboration is all about trust” would suggest that the

examples above are doomed for failure, and the low success rate of

inclusion and cross-collaboration we see in organizations might, at first

sight, appear to be the proof. Fortunately, contrary to common belief,

trust is not a prerequisite for teamwork and collaboration. Research on

teaming and collective intelligence suggests that if we focus on getting a

few things right, new constellations of people can collaborate effectively

before they’ve had time to build trust.

Successful transformation depends on the organization’s ability to

bring people with diverse competencies together to make high-quality

decisions. In such situations, shifting attention away from creating

## trust toward information sharing, perspective taking, and effective turn

taking can help organizations make progress on and speed up change

# and transformation.

Building trust vs. proving trustworthiness

Leaders should be aware of a counterintuitive risk of trust: A strong

emphasis on trust can lead to inertia, as employees might prioritize

appearing trustworthy over behavior necessary for good, collaborative

decision making. For example, in order to maintain a perception

of being competent and trustworthy, an individual might withhold

information or share inaccurate information when things aren’t going

# well.

I’ve spent over a decade making research on collaboration useable for

organizations ranging from scaleups becoming unicorns to incumbents

embracing transformation. Below I will explain how overemphasizing

trust can hinder collaborative decision making and cause inertia — and

how leaders can strike the right balance between trust and progress.

## How trust and distrust interfere with decision making

Two things stand out as critical to collaborative decision making on

# complex challenges.

First, in a fast-changing environment, you need access to accurate

and updated data in order to make good decisions. The data for

simple decisions is relatively easy to come by. For example, most

organizations I’ve helped can access real-time customer data that they

can analyze and base quick, smart decisions on. But most complex

strategic challenges — for example, cross collaboration to meet a

changing customer demand — require humans to bring in most of the

# important information.

When industries transform, organizations need new competencies.

Most often, those competencies come attached to a person, who may

differ from established employees in terms of background, values,

demographic characteristics, etc. Thus, being able to include new

## individuals and their information into teams and decision-making

processes is the second requirement for collaborative decision making.

Trust is a vague term and has a vast number of definitions. To

understand trust in regard to collective decision making, keep these two

# definitions in mind:

- 1. In the organizational context, trust is most often defined as an

interpersonal relationship that forms when a person shows

## consistent proof of competence, benevolence, and integrity. This

kind of trust takes a long time to build and is easily broken.

- 2. More broadly, trust describes the intuitive and immediate feeling we

get when we interact with another person, especially new

individuals. This feeling is based on past experience: If the new

person looks, sounds, and acts like people we’ve had a positive

experience of, we intuitively feel trust. If the new person is different,

we feel distrust. The greater the difference, the more distrust. This

kind of trust is closely linked to unconscious bias and has nothing to

do with the new person’s competence or the quality of the

information they bring to the table.

Problems arise when our intuitive feeling of distrust makes us more

doubtful of the information brought by new individuals who haven’t

had time to prove their trustworthiness. This puts us at risk of

undervaluing important information that’s communicated by someone

new and overvaluing other information. Since new individuals often

possess crucial information, this can be detrimental to transformation

# and strategic progress.

Another problem is when feelings of distrust cause established

individuals to challenge a new person in ways that they don’t challenge

other established collaborators. This can trigger feelings of exclusion

## and defensive and provocative behavior between the parties, which in

turn harms the productive exchange of information that collaborative

decision making depends on. Excluding behavior often comes from

individuals who believe they’re safeguarding and protecting their

organization. Unfortunately, they fail to realize that their behavior is

keeping the organization from accessing the information needed for

## strategic progress, transformation, and long-term survival.

Organizations that overemphasize trust risk triggering this kind of

unproductive behavior. Of course, it’s important to know that people

in the organization are trustworthy, but management meetings and

strategic collaboration efforts are not the right time to perform such

# evaluations.

How our focus on trust drives inertia and poor decision making

Individuals naturally want to establish themselves as competent and

trustworthy in the eyes of their peers and leaders. But it’s much harder

for people to work together on high-impact, complex transformation

challenges if they’re more concerned with appearing trustworthy than

with effective exchange of information and ideas. Here’s what that can

# look like in practice:

- 1. New individuals hold back information, challenging questions, and

out-of-the-box ideas in order to establish themselves as competent,

# benevolent, and trustworthy.

- 2. Individuals representing the old norm who are not experts in the area

of transformation hold back questions and hide ignorance and

knowledge gaps because they’re afraid to appear less competent and

# trustworthy.

- 3. When things don’t go according to plan, individuals hide

information or share an inaccurate picture of the situation to avoid

looking incompetent or like a failure.

- 4. In cross-collaborative settings, individuals withhold information,

questions, and ideas because there’s a history of distrust between

# different departments.

- 5. Individuals refrain from openly changing their mind, as they’re

afraid of appearing inconsistent and unpredictable.

The more an organization emphasizes the importance of trust, the more

# the behaviors above amplify.

How to keep trust from getting in the way

To maximize productive behavior and strategic progress when

gathering diverse groups to solve important, complex challenges,

leaders are wise to communicate that:

- Trust is important to many aspects of organizational success, but

interpersonal trust is not a prerequisite for collaboration. This is

important, as the inaccurate notion that “collaboration is all about

trust” is deeply rooted.

- Feelings of trust and distrust are natural when collaborating with new

individuals. However, they’re intuitive biases and should be set aside.

Consider the advice of Nobel prize winner Daniel Kahneman: “Delay

forming an intuition too quickly. Instead, focus on the separate

points, and when you have the full profile, then you can develop an

# intuition.”

- It’s vital to get the most accurate data on the table, even when that

data is unpleasant to share. Everyone involved is responsible for

creating an atmosphere where others can act with both candor and

vulnerability when sharing their perspective.

- Our individual willingness to explore and take each other’s

perspectives is key to progress and effective decision making on

# complex challenges.

When leaders focus on getting the conversations right, groups often

improve decisions and progress quite quickly. The experience of shared

progress often strengthens trust between collaborators. It might sound

counterintuitive, but shifting attention away from trust might be one

effective way to quickly build trust in new constellations.
