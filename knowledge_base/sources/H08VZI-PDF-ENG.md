## Every two years, like clockwork, one of the largest automotive parts

manufacturers in the world faced what it called a “big event”: a large

project went oﬀ the rails, costing the company a minimum of $80

million to $100 million each time. When a new president joined the

organization, he decided to investigate what was behind this expensive

# pattern.

The problem, he discovered, was that people in the organization were

not willing to risk giving feedback up the org chart until it was too late—

once a situation escalated, and they had no choice but to go outside

the plant and ask headquarters for help. As in many companies, a

phenomenon called “CEO disease” prevailed: the higher up leaders go in

an organization, the less candid feedback and information they get from

# below.

This is just one example of how employees’ failure to take risks (in

this case, the risk of speaking up) can have outsized consequences for

teams and organizations. In reality, people need to go out on a limb

in order to achieve high performance. Unless they are willing to name an inconvenient truth about a strategy or product, make a diﬃcult decision, or raise their voice about an issue, it’s diﬃcult for companies

to go beyond what has been done before and to build something

diﬀerentiated from competitors’ oﬀerings.

And yet risk-taking goes against the operating model of human beings

—their biology—which defaults to protection, especially when feeling

pressure to perform. Taking any risk triggers a clash between the

requirements of high performance and how our brains try to protect

us. I call this clash the fundamental conﬂict of performance: at the exact

time an organization needs people to take risks to move fast to execute

the strategy, their brains are defaulting to protection.

So, how can companies address this clash and get employees to take

# risks more often?

My experience working with coaches of high-performing teams in

the NFL, NBA, and Olympics—combined with research from my

organization, the Institute for Health and Human Potential—has helped

us identify strategies that enable teams to take more risks and improve

faster than their competitors. And it all starts with a number: 8%.

# The Last 8%

In a multiyear survey of 34,000 people that looked at a range of risks—

from making hard decisions, to naming inconvenient truths, to having

the hardest parts of a conversation—my organization found that there is

a gap between the risk people feel they should take in a situation and the

actual risk they do take.

In conversations, for example, people tend to leave out an average 7.56%

—rounded up to 8%—of what they want to say. They are comfortable

enough discussing the ﬁrst 92%, but when they get to the more

challenging parts—those that have the biggest consequences for the

other person or the project—they get caught up in how their counterpart

is reacting, or is perceived to be reacting, and they avoid having the full

# conversation.

It is the same with hard decisions. Most people are comfortable making

the easier choices they face, but when there’s a risk involved in

making a decision—one they perceive will upset others, such as who

gets promoted and what projects should get supported—they back oﬀ,

procrastinate, and struggle to take action.

We’ve named this gap the last 8%.

Our work also identiﬁed the kind of team culture and environment that

enables people to more frequently take risks—to close the 8%—and the

three kinds of team cultures that do the opposite, acting as barriers to

taking risks. Those insights came from a study we conducted of over

72,000 people in which we asked individuals to describe the elements of

their team they perceived to be barriers to, and enablers of, taking risks

to do hard things.

The data shows that enabling high performance through smart risk-

taking has two pillars: high connection, meaning people perceive they

have a voice, are valued, and feel psychological safety; and high courage,

meaning people are capable of, encouraged to, and enabled by norms

to be courageous to execute on hard things, such as holding people

accountable. When high connection and high courage are both in place,

a culture of trust is built that enables people to take more risks—in other

# words, a last 8% culture.

Of course, not all teams in organizations have both high connection

and high courage. For 67% of our respondents, one or both of the pillars were perceived to be at levels that were insuﬃcient to drive

performance. In these instances, we saw teams default to one of

three culture types that impair risk-taking and performance: family,

transactional, or fear-based. These patterns occur independent of

# industry and company size.

Let’s look at each culture in turn.

## Family Culture: High Connection, Low Courage

When a culture has high connection but low courage, we call it a family

culture. It exists in the lower right-hand quadrant of the map and is

characterized by being “nice” but unwilling or unable to do difficult

things. We found that 37% of the people in our survey, the largest

## cluster, belong to teams with a family culture.

In this environment, people sugarcoat communication. Taking cues

from and modeling their behavior on that of their manager, people on

these teams don’t make tough decisions or name inconvenient truths.

Why? Groupthink is in eﬀect; employees don’t speak up because they

don’t want to upset others. It is, at heart, an avoidance strategy driven

by people not wanting to experience (or not having the capability to manage) diﬃcult emotions. A family culture might be high on care, but a lack of suﬃcient accountability breeds mediocre standards;

in addition, decision-making is slow because people try to include

# everyone in the process.

## Transactional Culture: Low Connection, High Courage

A transactional culture, which makes up 14% of our sample, sits in

## the opposite corner of the map and features low connection and high

courage. It is characterized by prioritizing short-term results over both

## relationships and the culture of the team.

In these environments, there is less avoidance than in a family culture.

It’s more common for people to attempt hard things, which does take

courage—but that courage is unskillful or even cutthroat. Managers, for

example, do not hold back on pointing out inconvenient truths or giving

feedback, but because of a lack of skill and connection with others,

a lack of interest in how their delivery aﬀects employees, or because

their focus is on short-term results, they can be perceived as harsh and

unyielding. In our terminology, they “make a mess.” That sets the tone

for everyone and gets in the way of the team being able to explore

disagreements or talk through tensions together. These managers often

hold a belief that the only way to get results is by pushing their people to

do more, creating impossible targets and unreasonable timelines (often

driven by pressure they feel from above).

In a transactional culture, short-term results can be achieved, but they

are generally not sustainable because, over time, team members feel

less of a sense of belonging and an emotional commitment. They start

to check out, burn out, stop giving discretionary eﬀort, and are less open

to putting themselves on the line to take risks. They also, relatedly, have

an increased intention to leave.

## Fear-Based Culture: Low Connection, Low Courage

There is a third culture type that acts as a barrier to people taking risks

to do hard things: fear-based. In this culture, which made up 16% of our

sample, teams have both low connection and low courage.

This type of team culture can feel similar to a transactional culture, but

it is characterized by inconsistency and unpredictability. At least in a

transactional culture, people know how their manager is going to show

up. In fear-based cultures managers are all over the place: sometimes

they provide feedback and are open to listening to team members,

but other times they oﬀer no feedback and do not listen. This lack of

consistency creates great anxiety and causes people to feel like they are

walking on eggshells. They stop taking risks, such as speaking up when

they see something wrong or when they have an idea that could help,

for fear of personal judgment. The groupthink that happens is less about

not wanting to upset others, as in a family culture, and more about

self-preservation. People don’t want to put themselves in harm’s way.

One common trait of fear-based cultures is that people often have to

endure toxic “bad apples,” those team members who display negativity,

## withhold eﬀort, or violate important interpersonal norms. When just

one of these people is on a team, it has a spillover eﬀect, causing other

team members to take on the same behaviors: they argue and ﬁght

more, do not share relevant information, and communicate less. Why

do teams with this culture type endure toxic bad apples? Because short-

## term results matter more than anything else.

## Last 8% Culture: High Connection, High Courage

There is an alternative to the ﬁrst three cultures—a culture where

people step in and take risks to do hard things, with both high courage

and high connection. This last 8% culture made up 33% of our sample.

In this culture, people feel connected, a sense of belonging and

trust, and are enabled through team norms to be courageous. The

dominant behavioral characteristics, modeled by their manager, are

high accountability and high care. People know where they stand with

their manager and colleagues because messages are not sugarcoated.

Instead, the environment is feedback-rich, which creates a level of

trust that enables people to take smart risks. Importantly, feedback

and accountability are delivered with high care, helping employees

feel genuinely valued and listened to even if they are not agreed

with. They still feel they belong even when there is discomfort and

tensions rise. That in turn means they are more able to hear and

make use of criticism. They know that their manager is looking out for

them and, crucially, understand the intention behind the feedback and

## accountability: the pursuit of a clear, big goal.

Last 8% cultures have a drive for results—but not at the expense of

relationships. It is through strong relationships that people collaborate

to achieve these results. Importantly, high care is also about people

caring deeply about the work. There is purpose and pride in what they

do and who they do it with. Subsequently, they are more emotionally

committed, give extra eﬀort, and attempt hard things because it matters

to them and the team. These cultures have all the elements to help

people take the kind of interpersonal and strategic risks that lead to real

# innovation.

## Building a High Performance Team: Where Are You on the Map?

The ﬁrst step in achieving a Last 8% Culture is understanding where

your team currently stands. You can start assessing your culture and

norms by reﬂecting on which of the map’s quadrants feels most like

how things get done on your team. Ask yourself the questions below,

drawn from the assessment we use with clients—and be honest with

your answers, even if they’re uncomfortable.

- Do people feel connected to each other, but avoid doing hard things

such as naming inconvenient truths and having tough conversations?

# (The Family quadrant.)

- Do people do hard things, such as naming inconvenient truths and

having tough conversations, but not feel as connected to each other as

you or they would like? (The Transactional quadrant.)

- Do people avoid doing hard things and also feel disconnected from

# each other? (The Fear-Based quadrant.)

- Do people skillfully do hard things and also engage in the diﬃcult

work to discuss issues the team faces? (The Last 8% quadrant.)

While it matters what you think, it matters just as much—or more—

what your team thinks. At your next meeting, start a conversation about

which quadrant employees think the team is in. To help you have the

discussion, below is an outline you can follow, based on the protocol we

# use with clients.

- Tell employees that you’d like to have an honest conversation about

# your team’s culture.

- Show the culture map and describe each quadrant.

- If honestly and frankness aren’t the norm on your team, it makes a

big diﬀerence to be vulnerable about why the team’s culture matters

to you. Consider sharing stories about previous teams you’ve worked

on where the culture either was or wasn’t good, and why that was

meaningful for you. If you don’t think you are in the upper right-hand

quadrant—a last 8% culture—share where you think the team is at

now, why, and how you might be part of the reason.

- Ask employees where they think the team is on the map. Which

# quadrant feels most familiar, and why?

- Ask what the team can do to move closer to a last 8% culture. Oﬀer

your ideas ﬁrst about your contribution—what you need to do to get to

the culture you want, and invite people to oﬀer other ideas.

- Depending on how the conversation has gone so far, ask what

commitments the group can make as a result of the discussion. We

suggest making three. These commitments are crucial to make before

facing last 8% situations because they will carry employees through

hard moments when it is easier to avoid taking risks.

No matter how the discussion goes, do not get defensive. This is an

opportunity to inﬂuence the culture just by how you show up: Do you

give employees a voice? Value their opinions? Make them feel safe,

even if you disagree with them? What you do signals to others which

behaviors are acceptable and rewarded—and they’ll remember it. Our

clients ﬁnd these conversations, when done right, to be some of the

richest they have as a team, giving them a concrete way to move the

# needle on their culture.

Finally, make a personal commitment to own your team’s culture.

Because culture exists more at the team level than at the organizational

level, you, not the CEO or CHRO, need to take charge of the norms you

want to have. When employees see you being vulnerable about what you

can do to improve things, and see that you are genuinely open to what

they have to say, they will feel less threatened, and the probability will

go up that they will feel safer to take more risks themselves. This is how

you build a high-performing team.

Your team members have the ability to be courageous to do hard things.

But they face a fundamental clash between the requirements of high

performance and how their brains try to protect them. Your job is to

create the conditions—the culture—so they can perform at their best

and achieve results that matter.
