make things better; cares for people, helping them to thrive; and mobilizes

people to solve tough problems. These three elements, they argue, are

the soul, heart, and mind of leadership — and activating them requires

## careful attention to both the personal and the organizational dimensions

of leadership. The following is a lightly edited excerpt from their book.

We live in a remarkable time. Truly exceptional value, with thriving

people and communities, is possible when we learn how to combine the

## productive power of technology and organization with the power of our

# humanity and a deep sense of purpose.

We believe that realizing that potential more fully requires rethinking

our organizations in a way that is truly diﬀerent from what we’ve

known. We’ve seen glimpses of this promise in recent years.

During the early months of Covid-19 we saw remarkable demonstrations

## of the power of the human spirit, in concert with technology and

purpose, to drive unprecedented innovation and even growth. This in

spite of a crisis impacting every facet of our lives; one in which no one

was unaﬀected — one in which we all lost something. It was the best of

# our humanity on display.

At the same time, we saw the chasms that divide us widen and deepen

## — and not just on a global or geo-political scale. Within organizations

the chasm of broad discontent among the workforce has quickly

## overtaken that spirit of unity and innovation.

The Great Resignation was our warning shot, and the widely reported,

## unprecedented levels of dissatisfaction and distrust in organizations

must be our burning platform. We cannot aﬀord to succumb to the

familiar pressure to double-down on power and control, giving priority

to quickly reducing costs at the expense of people, purpose and genuine

gains in productivity. The real costs are too great. We see them in

the growing prevalence of burnout and the incidence of workplace

bullying and harassment. We see it in the surge of adults reporting

signiﬁcant symptoms of anxiety or depression. We see it in the general

discontent as reported through annual engagement surveys of workers

# across organizations and industries.

And, more than likely, we all feel it — to some extent — ourselves. We

are technologically more advanced than we have ever been. And we are

# miserable.

But the glimmer of promise we saw in the earliest days of the Covid-19

crisis should give us hope. When we loosen our grip on consolidated

power and control and expand our myopic focus on short-term costs

(to prioritize people, purpose and real productivity) something great —

even miraculous — can happen. This is the lesson of the last few years

— and it isn’t a new one.

But still — almost universally — we revert to power and control in

the name of the need of the times for quick ﬁxes. In doing so, we

continue to embrace a legacy paradigm that is driven by the pursuit

and maintenance of power over people. And the story we tell ourselves

— and the one we reward — is that this is good leadership.

But the truth is that this paradigm — what we call the “power-over”

paradigm — is the very reason executives ﬁnd themselves frustrated

that they aren’t getting as much out of their people and organizations as

they believe they could be.

This is the paradox of the power-over paradigm: We have a tendency

to default to its ways of thinking, behaving, and organizing, even as it

serves to limit our capacity to make things better.

We need a new paradigm of leadership — what we call the “leading

through” paradigm — to help to break through this tendency. The aim of

leading through is to activate the power of our humanity — soul, heart

and mind — to create thriving organizations. Power to create amazing

value for organizations; power to improve the lives of people; and power

to heal the divides and bridge the chasms that exist between us. It is this

power that we hope to activate, power that is realized through others.

The Cleveland Clinic saw the need for this kind of paradigm shift

when it embarked on a journey to make empathy — and the overall

patient experience — a deﬁning characteristic of the organization.

The organization’s executives had come to believe that the patient

experience needed to change so fundamentally that the empathy

initiative would need to touch everything and engage everyone in the

quest for improvement and innovation. And it did. From its objectives

## and standards to its strategy and structure, the empathy initiative

transformed the clinic into a place where people “imagine what another

person is going through, work to alleviate suﬀering, and create joy

# wherever possible.”

The results were remarkable. Between 2007 and 2019 patient

satisfaction with nurses improved ﬁve times more than the national

average, while satisfaction with doctors increased 11 times the national

average. Over this same period employee satisfaction increased from a

top box score of 55% to 92%. At the same time, the clinic continued

## its record of medical innovation and outstanding patient medical

outcomes. It is perhaps not surprising that the clinic also grew

substantially during this period, generating record revenues.

To experience this kind of paradigm shift and move from “power over”

to “leading through,” organizations need to embrace an approach to

leadership that strengthens their capacity to:

# Increase organizational “light.”

In our view, leadership is always and everywhere a moral work.

Leadership derives from moments of inﬂuence. What a potential leader

does with that inﬂuence will impact the people involved for good, or

for bad. That makes leadership a moral concern and we believe that

eﬀective leaders always seek to do good, and to make things better

for the long term. This is what we call the soul of leadership, and

it demands that leaders (and those they lead) strive to do what is

right, because it is right, even when it is hard. This means that the

work itself and the people who do it need a moral context — a shared

framework of moral values and beliefs that guide and direct action in

# the organization.

In that spirit, the work of leadership must overcome what we call

organizational darkness — attitudes, behaviors, and practices that make seeing the right way forward more diﬃcult. Darkness is generated

by things like arrogance, inﬁghting, abuse, bullying, backstabbing,

## exploitation, harassment, discrimination, corruption, fraud and the

waste of talent and capital, among many others. And, borrowing from

the words of Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr., “Darkness cannot drive out

darkness: only light can do that.” Thus, the most important work in the

soul of leadership is to generate light in the organization.

Organizational light is generated by attitudes, behaviors and practices

that make doing what is right easier. Light guides and energizes people

and is sustained by things like kindness, generosity, respect, love,

personal meaning and growth, shared purpose, a vibrant community,

## honesty, transparency, high standards of excellence, and the productive

use of talent and capital, among many others. Just like physical

light, organizational light is a source of vision and energy, creating

the conditions for growth and increased strength in individual lives,

## reputations, assets and in the organization itself.

# Harness the power within people.

Thriving organizations are created and sustained by thriving people.

Great leaders understand that creating an environment where people

thrive is crucial to the viability and vitality of the organization. A

thriving human being is a wonderful source of power — with signiﬁcant

capacity for action. That is why great leaders place people — including

their personal growth — as a ﬁrst-order objective. This means care and

## concern for people above and beyond the functional tasks or outcomes

of the work. This is what we call the heart of leadership — promoting

# human thriving.

Relationships are central to the heart of leadership. To eﬀectively

communicate, motivate, mentor, teach, direct, counsel, learn from,

inspire and energize the people they lead, leaders need to build

relationships of mutual commitment and care. It is through

## relationships of care, trust, high standards and accountability that

leaders help people thrive.

We capture the heart of leadership with a framework we call LIVE. The

acronym represents four drivers that help people engage and thrive –

love, inspiration, vitality and expression. The framework gives leaders a

way to connect the work people do every day to their deeper needs. And

it really is about the heart — about caring for people, getting to know

them (love); about inspiring them with a vision of a better future and

of their own potential (inspiration); about establishing energy-creating

patterns in their lives (vitality); about giving people voice and room

to create (expression). LIVE is a tool for unleashing the power and

potential that is already in people and making the heart of leadership

# real.

# Drive action, learning, and change.

## The soul and heart of leadership generate commitment and energy but

unleashing it in a meaningful way requires something more. This is

where eﬀective leaders mobilize people in a process of action, learning

and change aimed at solving tough problems and pursuing meaningful

opportunities. This is what we call the mind of leadership — advancing

# purposeful action, learning and change.

We capture the mind of leadership as a process — the leadership process

— that reﬂects speciﬁc patterns that are common, useful and eﬀective

in every situation that calls for action, learning, and change. It is the

domain of sizing up problems and opportunities, creating a vision of the

work, and setting direction. It is where leaders build teams, establish

plans, and engage people in the work. It is through this process that

leaders activate the potential energy in people and teams and help them

maintain disciplined attention and focus.

The leadership process is a powerful, but ﬂexible framework for

initiating change, and mobilizing and empowering people. It can be

used with a single individual, with a small team, a major project, an

## acquisition, or any other situation where action, learning and change

are necessary. It requires leaders and their teams to think clearly,

creatively and strategically. It requires the mind of leadership.

In the “leading through” paradigm, the soul, heart, and mind of

leadership are three dimensions in one. Without the mind, the soul

and heart may produce commitment and engagement but struggle

to mobilize it in the right direction. And without the soul and

heart, the mind may gravitate towards the “power over” paradigm.

These metaphors — the soul, the heart, the mind — are inseparable

characteristics of eﬀective leadership. Anyone who wants to do the work

of leadership — and do it well — must attend to, and learn to lead with,

their own soul, heart and mind. They need to focus on doing good,

on caring for people, and on thinking innovatively and creatively to

mobilize people to act, learn, and change in ways that makes things

# better.

Leading through is a paradigm designed to activate that kind of

## leadership all throughout the organization, from the C-suite to the

frontlines. It is a paradigm to help organizations thrive by unleashing

the power and potential of their people. Making that happen is work

— the work of leadership. And we know this kind of work can be hard. Mobilizing people is not easy, and the path to solving diﬃcult problems

may be uphill and rocky. Yet, that is precisely why leadership is great

work. It is meaningful and fulﬁlling because it takes initiative and

## creativity and stretches both leaders and teams.

But we also know there is joy in this work. Joy comes from working

together to make things better, seeing people grow and learn, and

changing the organization so that it is more productive and more

purposeful. Eﬀective leadership opens up opportunities, gives people

meaning, and strengthens the health, energy and vigor of the

organization. It is the promise of making things better that is the focus

of the leading through paradigm.
