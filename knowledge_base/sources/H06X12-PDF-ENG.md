LinkedIn recently introduced a new category — Career Breaks — for

users who are building proﬁles. The new label helps normalize the idea

that careers are not always linear — and will give an enormous boost

to the recruiting eﬀorts of employers running career reentry programs

or otherwise targeting the pool of professionals returning from career

# breaks.

The Career Break category allows individuals who have taken time

away from the traditional workforce not only to call out their career

breaks on their LinkedIn proﬁles, but to describe the highlights of their

career break experiences — including travel, family responsibilities, or

## volunteer work — just as they would a traditional work experience.

Employers are launching career reentry programs at unprecedented

rates. Recruiters are recognizing that people who’ve temporarily left the

workforce are a “hidden” talent pool — and that in most cases, their

decision to take a break from paid work has nothing to do with job

performance. Recruiters expanded their targeting of these candidates

during the pandemic: LinkedIn’s own data shows the share of U.S. job

postings mentioning career breaks up 63% from 2020, and up by nearly

100% from 2018.

For job seekers, the LinkedIn Career Break designation solves the

problem of how to label or classify a period of time when they were not

in the paid workforce. It also solves a growing problem for employers

trying to recruit relaunching professionals. That’s because most formal

career re-entry programs require that applicants have a minimum of a

one-to-two-year career break to be eligible. However, many job seekers

account for their time out of the workforce by listing volunteer work or

other activities. If mistaken for current employment, these candidates

could be deemed ineligible.

Consider the case of Simone, a software engineer. She has a master’s

## degree in computer science and seven years of experience in database

development, and she last held paid employment in 2015. Simone is

a perfect candidate for a reentry program, but when she applied at

a well-established company career reentry program, she received an

automated rejection within an hour.

Baﬄed by the instant rejection, Simone got in touch with our team at

iRelaunch. Seeing her obvious qualiﬁcations, we wanted to understand

what happened, too. We contacted the employer, a long-time partner

of ours. They looked more closely at Simone’s excellent technical

credentials, her eﬀorts to stay current with technology, and her long

career break, and she ended up receiving an oﬀer. If Simone hadn’t

pushed back, she would not have been hired — and the employer would

have missed out on an outstanding candidate.

Why was she rejected? For the period since 2015, Simone’s resume

showed volunteer work and recent technical coursework, but did not

clearly state that she had taken a career break. Newer recruiters on the

employer’s team who hadn’t been fully trained to spot the resumes with

career breaks missed that Simone was eligible.

## Between electronic screening and recruiters less familiar with

relauncher proﬁles and resumes, it is not uncommon for recent

volunteer experiences and coursework to be mistaken for current work

experience, instead of a valid career break. There’s an irony here: by

taking steps to camouﬂage their career breaks on resumes, job seekers

are inadvertently setting themselves up for rejection by employer career

reentry programs because their career breaks are not obvious enough.

Now LinkedIn has given relaunchers the perfect mechanism with which

to call out the career break on their LinkedIn proﬁles and employers the

means to avoid missing another Simone.

## From a recruiting perspective, the new Career Break designation

presents employers with an additional beneﬁt: If relaunchers start using

## the Career Break category in the experience section of their LinkedIn

proﬁles, employers will be able to do a keyword search for “Career

Break” to identify eligible candidates for their career reentry programs.

Choosing the “Career Break” category may even make sense for

people who’ve gone through a period of part-time employment or

underemployment. In fact, most employers running career reentry

programs encourage relaunchers to deﬁne the career break loosely.

The eligibility deﬁnition of career break may allow for some income-

producing activities, such as occasional consulting, substitute teaching,

or a side gig that is unrelated to the primary career. We recommend

individuals err on the side of applying to a program rather than self-

selecting out of it because they are worried their income-producing

activity makes them ineligible. Lead with the Career Break category at

the top of the Experience section, and call out the income producing

activity either as part of that section or as a separate entry right below it.

LinkedIn’s move is the latest in its evolving approach to helping people

document non-linear careers. Back in March 2021, as a precursor to

the new Career Break category, LinkedIn announced that stay-at-home

mom, dad, and parent leave designations had been added to the pre-

populated dropdown menus for proﬁle-building.

I recently interviewed Bef Ayenew, the engineering leader behind

the LinkedIn Proﬁle page. He explained that the new Career Breaks

category is much more intuitive than the previously announced “Stay

at Home Parent” designation. “Career Break” is an optional entry in

the experience section and includes built-in options indicating the type

of career break — examples include caregiving, extended travel, and

retirement. Just as when posting a role at an employer, the Career

Break category provides the opportunity to highlight activities during

the career break that are relevant to career goals, or are signiﬁcant

# standalone experiences.

While the Career Break category is a step forward, some relaunchers

may be leery of using it. As common as career breaks have become

— especially during Covid— there are still plenty of managers who

exhibit bias or think it’s risky to hire someone who’s stepped away from

the workforce. LinkedIn stats bear this out: “While half (50%) of hiring

managers globally say that career breaks are becoming more common,

almost 60% (59%) of people believe there is still a stigma attached for

# career breaks.”

By our count, nearly 40% of the Fortune 50 have an in-house career

reentry program. As employer career reentry programs continue to

expand in number, and as the existing programs scale and run longer,

there will be more relaunchers inside organizations — people who may

be more likely to favor hiring someone else who took a career break.

For years, LinkedIn has helped relaunchers rebuild their networks by

making it easy to ﬁnd and connect with long-lost colleagues from the

past. And with 800 million members, LinkedIn plays a powerful role

as the arbiter of career path proﬁling. LinkedIn’s decision to make “Career Break” an oﬃcial category in the LinkedIn proﬁle Experience

section validates the career break as a standard part of career paths for

those who elect to take one — and recognizes the value of the career

break experience itself. This marks a major leap forward in the gradual

progress we’ve been seeing in the nearly 20 years since the concept of

reentry programs ﬁrst took hold.
