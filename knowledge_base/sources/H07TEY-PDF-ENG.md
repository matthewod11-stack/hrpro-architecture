## Recent transparency policies across several U.S. states, like salary

history bans that prevent employers from requiring candidates to

report their compensation or even their salary expectations, have

heightened the focus on fair salary practices in the workplace. As

a result, there’s an increased demand for strategies to determine

appropriate compensation. A key solution lies in salary benchmarking:

using aggregated market data to establish competitive pay rates.

Setting salaries is a balancing act: you do not want to oﬀer salaries

that are too high relative to the market, because that’d be wasteful; but oﬀering salaries that are below market may make it diﬃcult to attract,

retain and motivate your employees. How do employers ﬁnd their sweet

# spot?

In a recent study, we developed a theoretical model to shed light on the

demand for salary benchmarking. In our model, ﬁrms know exactly how

much value the job candidate would bring to the table. The ﬁrm would

like to oﬀer the candidate below that value to keep some of the value

as proﬁt. However, how much lower should the oﬀer be? The lower the

oﬀer, the better the savings. On the other hand, if the oﬀer is too low,

the ﬁrm risks losing the job candidate to another ﬁrm — they may turn

down the oﬀer, or accept the oﬀer and leave shortly thereafter.

So, whether the company wants to make a more or less aggressive oﬀer

depends critically on what the ﬁrm believes is the market value of the job candidate: i.e., how much other ﬁrms are willing to pay for the job

candidate. That’s where salary benchmarking comes in: ﬁrms can use

data on the oﬀers accepted by similar employees (e.g., with the same

position title and industry) to make sure that their oﬀer is not too low, or

## too high, relative to the market benchmark.

Our research also provides empirical evidence that access to salary

benchmarks has a signiﬁcant eﬀect on the salaries that ﬁrms set. We

conducted it in collaboration with the largest U.S. payroll processing

company, ADP, serving more than one million ﬁrms and processing

paychecks for one in six U.S. workers. In addition to the payroll services,

the company aggregates the salary data from their payroll records in the

form of salary benchmarks. Clients can then search for any job title they

want in a user-friendly way. It is one of the most advanced benchmark

tools and is being used by many prominent ﬁrms.

Our data covers the roll-out of the tool when it was ﬁrst introduced to

the market, late 2015, through the start of the pandemic in 2020. Our

sample includes 584 “treatment” ﬁrms that gained access to the tool

and 1,431 “control” ﬁrms that did not gain access to the tool but were

selected because they shared similar characteristics to the treatment

ﬁrms. We studied the evolution of salaries in the treatment ﬁrms shortly

before and after they gained access to the benchmarking tool, and we

compared that to the corresponding evolution of salaries in the control

# ﬁrms.

Here’s what we found: let’s say that a ﬁrm sets the “right” salary when

they choose a salary that is in a narrow (5%) band of the median salary

for the same position, industry, and state. Prior to gaining access to

the benchmarking tool, there was an 11.6% probability that a ﬁrm sets

the “right” salary. After gaining access to the benchmarking tool, the

probability of setting the “right” salary increased two-fold, to 22.1%.

This is compelling evidence that these salary benchmarks are truly

inﬂuencing pay-setting, and causing position-level salaries to converge

# across companies.

We also found that the eﬀects of salary benchmarking are quite

symmetric. After looking up the benchmark, ﬁrms are less likely

to pay signiﬁcantly above-market, presumably because it would be

wasteful; but ﬁrms are also less likely to pay signiﬁcantly below-market,

presumably because it would be costly in terms of attracting, retaining

and motivating employees.

## For standardized positions, such as bank teller and receptionist, we

found some evidence of a modest increase in the average salary. If

employers are choosing to raise salaries for this group, it must be

because they expect to get something in return, right? For instance,

bumping salaries up to market may allow employers to retain their

employees and save those pesky turnover costs. Our research shows

that, indeed, benchmarking improves retention. Among employees in

these roles, the gain of about 6% in average salary was followed by an

increase of about 16% in the retention rate over the following 12 months.

How can I use salary benchmarking?

The payroll data show that high quality salary benchmarks sway

employers to set pay closer to the marketplace median pay, and that

benchmark users beneﬁt from a boost in employee retention. But how

exactly does one go about sourcing and using a salary benchmark?

Salary benchmarks are wide ranging; some are created by the

government and others exclusive to the clients of consulting ﬁrms.

Still others are crowdsourced data from anonymous employees. For

## example, the U.S. government reports average earnings at the six-digit

occupation code, within industry and state, each year using surveys

of businesses and households. These data are highly representative,

but are released infrequently and at a higher level of aggregation

## than the sought after position level information. Meanwhile, several

large consulting ﬁrms oﬀer exclusive access to the aggregated earnings

of their clients, often using proprietary standardized corporate titles.

Most recently, ﬁrms that collect salary information as part of their

core businesses, like ADP, have added user interfaces that make

aggregated, anonymized data accessible as benchmarks. And platforms

like Glassdoor have encouraged millions of users to volunteer their

salary information anonymously in exchange for seeing the average

# inputs of others at the position level.

To better understand how ﬁrms use salary benchmarking, we also

conducted a survey with the members of the Society for Human

## Resource Management Research Institute (SHRM). We collected

## responses from a large sample of 2,085 HR managers in charge of

pay-setting. This sample spans organizations of every size, state and

industry, including both public and private sectors. To complement this

data, we conducted an additional survey with a sample of clients from

ADP, in which we obtained responses from 720 HR managers in charge

# of pay-setting.

Employers use salary benchmarking for a wide range of purposes. For

instance, 54% of respondents use benchmarking when setting the pay

of new hires. Other popular uses include salary negotiations (53%),

setting ranges for speciﬁc job titles (90%), and setting the salary for a

job advertisement (41%). Employers also vary in terms of how frequently

they consult salary benchmarks. For instance, while some employers do

benchmarking for every single new hire (37% of respondents), the rest

prefer to do it for some speciﬁc new hires or for some speciﬁc positions.

Our survey data indicates that employers diﬀer in which data sources

they use. The most popular option is to use industry surveys, chosen

by 68% of respondents, but hiring a consulting ﬁrm to conduct these

surveys can be quite expensive, and there is no guarantee that the

survey data will live up to the expectations. If you do not have a big

budget, you may also want to try the second most popular option: free

## online data sources (58% of respondents) such as Glassdoor.com. More

recently, payroll service companies have gained popularity (used by

23% of respondents and the fastest growing source), which may give

the best bang for your buck in terms of data quality. Most employers,

however, use a combination of data sources. While the majority look at

free online sources, on a scale of 1-5, HR professionals report that other

sources are twice as trustworthy as free online sources.

Labor market trends can sometimes change rapidly, especially in the

post-pandemic world. You do not need to check the benchmarks on a

daily basis, but try to at least do it from time to time — remember that

information, too, has an expiration date. Likewise, you may not have

time to sit down to study market trends for every position in which you

hire. However, make sure to at least do due diligence for the positions

that are most critical for your business.

When using a benchmarking tool, you may feel information overload.

Some tools provide not only the median pay, but also the mean, 10th

percentile, 25th percentile, and so on and so forth. And some tools

allow you to ﬁlter by industry, state, and other criteria. There are trade-

oﬀs. For instance, ﬁlters can allow you to focus on peer employers,

but at the cost of smaller sample sizes and thus statistically imprecise

benchmarks. While the right approach depends on the context at hand,

according to our survey, there are some clear favorites: most ﬁrms (89%)

prefer to look at the median market pay or the average market pay, and

the most popular ﬁlters are by industry (87%) and state (84%).

We also gave the survey respondents an opportunity to share their

own tips and advice for salary benchmarking. Some recommended not

relying on job title information alone, but rather to pay attention to the

job description to ensure it’s a good match. Another manager suggested

that, to the extent possible, you should review the benchmarks regularly

to stay in sync with the latest trends in the job market. In the same

spirit, one manager recommends being proactive — do not wait until

employees are unhappy about low pay and reach out to you, or you risk

# higher turnover.

In sum, the pay transparency revolution extends to ﬁrms knowing

much more about what their competitors are oﬀering. New high-quality

sources have changed pay-setting practices. According to our latest

study, keeping up with pay in the marketplace, and knowing how to use

those sources, can aﬀect your bottom-line retention and payroll costs.

And from a societal perspective, this is closing the gap between pay

Editor’s Note: On October 19, 2023, a change was made to the originally published article to correct the number of firms and workers serviced by ADP. A change was also made to make clear that firms that collect salary information, like ADP, take various steps to make sure the data is anonymized and confidential information is protected.
