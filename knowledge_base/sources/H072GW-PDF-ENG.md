Historically, most organizations have approached inclusion

## sequentially: gender this year or two, race next, then sexual

orientation, and maybe someday disability and age. Or maybe class.

Or neurodiversity. Generally, sequential inclusion is expanded from the

power center to bring in the next-most “acceptable” characteristic. But

what happens if someone is an older, Black, visibly disabled woman? Or

an Indigenous, economically disadvantaged, autistic man? What about

a deaf refugee ﬂeeing religious persecution, or any other person who

happens to have some attributes that aren’t “currently includable”?

Sequential inclusion leaves people behind.

Welcoming all talent requires:

- Systemic inclusion that considers intersectionalities, comprehensively

addresses all barriers, and embeds inclusion in all talent processes

and decision-making mechanisms. It calls for inclusion by design,

thoroughly and thoughtfully planned.

- Inclusion from the margin. Creating systems that include the most

marginalized and those identifying with multiple marginalized groups

is the fastest way to include all. It also requires the participation of

the marginalized. People don’t notice barriers they don’t face. Those

impacted by barriers others don’t notice (or only notice when the

problem becomes extreme) are best qualiﬁed to design the barrier-free

# future of work.

At one point in my career, it looked as though I had “overcome”

the blatant gender, class, and even xenophobia barriers I had faced

in previous jobs. And yet, for years, I was stuck, doing the work

but not getting the credit. Even when a well-intentioned organization

implemented an initiative to promote more women in leadership, I still

didn’t feel included.

Looking back, I know that I hit the neurodivergent leadership ceiling,

a hidden barrier. Autistic people are often overlooked when leadership

is equated with charisma or extreme extraversion (although research

shows that in dynamic environments, introverts and quiet people lead

better than extroverts). In this case, the bias was not blatant. The people

in charge didn’t mean to exclude me or those like me. The system, like

most, was set up to cater to the dominant neurotype. Perhaps years

later there would be an intervention to make the organization more

welcoming of neurodiversity. But when I was desperate to be seen,

heard, and acknowledged for my contributions, tweaking the system

to include women did nothing for neurodivergent women — I was still

unincludable and on the margin. In that, I was not alone: In the U.S.,

85% of autistic college graduates struggle with unemployment, but very

few organizations have programs to support neurodiversity or disability

# hiring and success.

Because autism can be experienced as culture, as a disability,

or as social disablement, it has many psychological and physical

manifestations that overlap with other cultural experiences, diﬀerences,

and disabilities. Hence, addressing the barriers autistic people face

both helps solve the sequential inclusion problem and creates a more

inclusive environment for talent from other marginalized groups.

Removing barriers autistic people face at work benefits everyone

The comparison to canaries in the coal mine is often used within

the autistic culture to describe the autistic experience of heightened

vulnerability to harmful environmental factors, from bullying to the noise of open oﬃces and the stress of management by fear. An open oﬃce could make an autistic employee with sensory sensitivities

ill within hours, but most employees suﬀer negative health and

# performance consequences over time.

As another example, imagine a diversity-focused company proud of

designing what they believe to be an inclusive hiring tool for rating candidates for oﬃce jobs: a standardized interview with rubrics,

focused on speciﬁc answers and behaviors. Now imagine that one

of the criteria in the rubric is “presentation,” consisting of elements

such as eye contact and speaking enthusiastically. Some may consider

evaluating eye contact and enthusiasm unbiased. Unfortunately,

many autistic people will be excluded by this evaluation because

intense discomfort with eye contact is one of the prominent autism

# characteristics.

However, these outward “presentation” barriers don’t impact only

autistic people. For example, “enthusiastic speech” evaluation does

not consider those with speech diﬀerences or who use communication

devices — autistic or not. People with facial trauma or paralysis, vision

impairments, and many other disabilities will also be unfairly impacted

by presentation criteria. Moreover, many cultures discourage direct eye

contact and have diﬀerent norms for expressing enthusiasm. Finally,

aﬀect recognition is also racially biased. Detecting and removing

arbitrary, non-work-related barriers makes selection fairer for multiple

# groups.

This is why I call my model of creating inclusive organizations

the “Canary Code” for building better workplaces. Before there were

electronic carbon monoxide detectors, canaries were used to detect the

deadly gas in coal mines. Toxic gases impact the canary ﬁrst, but all

others are harmed eventually. And healthy air beneﬁts all.

I reviewed over 150 academic articles on inclusion and best

practices that help employee experience and performance. My ﬁndings

converge with marginalized individuals’ lived-experience accounts:

characteristics of work that are essential for including autistic talent

(e.g., skills-based hiring, transparency of procedures, normalizing

remote work) help all marginalized people and are highly desired by

# most employees.

Breaking the cycle of systemic discrimination

Access and success barriers make up the self-perpetuating cycle

of systemic discrimination. Access barriers limit the pipeline of

marginalized individuals into the organization. Multiple rungs of

success barriers (e.g., limited access to professional development,

unfair promotion mechanisms) further restrict representation, voice,

and leadership opportunities for marginalized groups. The lack of

representation in leadership, in turn, perpetuates access barriers. Thus,

only a systemic intervention can address cycles of discrimination.

However, inclusive practices support a better future of work for all,

## because mechanisms of exclusion also perpetuate stress and frustration

# for all employees.

To create a system of fairness, embed the six key principles of the

## Canary Code into the entire talent cycle.

# Participation

## Include individual employees in the work-design process — in

particular, those who think diﬀerently or are intersectionally

marginalized. For example, I’ve helped rewrite a research analyst job

description that initially included working with frequent interruptions.

Not only is this suboptimal for any analyst because data analysis

requires deep work, but it would be a major barrier for autistic people,

who pay a higher psychological price for distraction. Many autistic

professionals have lost their jobs because their responsibilities were

changed to include excessive multitasking, they were moved into noisy

areas, or they were otherwise precluded from exercising their strengths

— without their input. It’s more eﬀective to involve individuals in

crafting their jobs than attempting to design for them, even if using

empathy. Empathy is constrained by similarity, and those who have

not experienced autistic focus may think of an interruption as a minor

inconvenience, not the sensation of being hit with a baseball bat.

## And even in less-extreme situations, participation boosts morale and

# productivity overall.

# Outcomes

Autistic employees’ productivity is partly explained by their innovative

ways of working. Yet, innovative employees of all backgrounds are

often forced to work in traditional, less-eﬀective ways. Focusing on

## outcomes instead of “professional appearance,” presenteeism, or work

style supports both inclusion and productivity. For example, if a

performance evaluation form calls for assessing the number of phone

calls an employee made, but they exceeded their sales goal using a

well-crafted email blast, does it matter that they didn’t use phone calls?

Or if a manager eﬀectively uses asynchronous collaboration technology

to unite a hybrid team, is the lack of synchronous meetings a problem or

# an accomplishment?

To avoid evaluating style instead of substance, review your criteria for

performance evaluation and promotion. Do these include references to

subjectively deﬁned “potential” or “ﬁt”? Do they include preferences

for a speciﬁc work style (e.g., teamwork)? When criteria other than

outcomes are considered, the most marginalized are the least likely to

be similar to the rater and most likely to be negatively impacted by the

# similarity bias.

# Flexibility

Removing arbitrary time, place, and work-style barriers supports the

employment of those who need the ﬂexibility to accommodate sensory

sensitivities or sleep issues associated with autism. Moreover, it can

help address other opportunity gaps, such as transportation limitations

associated with disability or economic disadvantage. Expanding

ﬂexibility to include job matching to peoples’ unique strengths, job

crafting, and job sharing, as well as providing viable part-time options

## and beneﬁts that work for a wide range of life circumstances further

helps include marginalized talent. It also supports the satisfaction and

retention of all employees, for whom ﬂexibility is a highly desired perk.

# Organizational justice

Justice in the workplace is concerned with the fairness of outcomes

and procedures, as well as interpersonal treatment, dignity, and providing suﬃcient information to employees. All types of justice have

# implications for employee morale.

In particular, use Leventhal’s six procedural justice criteria when

evaluating whether your organization is inclusive. Evaluating your

## hiring, promotion, and other decision-making procedures, ideally with

substantial participation of those who are traditionally not represented,

will likely surface areas for improvement. Just procedures:

- Are applied consistently across people and time

- Are free from bias

- Ensure that accurate information is collected and used in making

# decisions

- Have a mechanism to correct inaccurate decisions

- Conform to prevailing standards of ethics or morality

- Ensure that the views of various groups aﬀected by the decision have

been taken into account.

# Transparency and clear communication

Clear organizational communication is essential for autistic people,

who are often excluded by the reliance on hidden messages, corporate

## doublespeak, and “insider” expressions with obscured meaning.

Cultures that lack transparency in procedures and decision making

present success barriers for autistic people and others. Transparency,

on the other hand, supports both inclusion and productivity, promotes

a sense of psychological safety, and drives organizational performance.

# Valid tools for decision making

## Subjective selection, promotion, and other talent management practices

exclude neurodivergent talent, create barriers for other marginalized

groups, and narrow organizations’ talent pools. Instead, using valid

instruments rooted in job analysis helps ensure inclusivity. For

example, autistic job-seekers are often denied work because of

personality-based interviews, which measure the ability to talk about

one’s skills rather than demonstrate them. This access barrier also

## impacts class migrants and people from cultures that value modesty.

In selection, direct assessment of skills essential to the job is more

valid than asking people to extol their skills. In promotion, evaluation

supported by examples of outcomes helps reduce bias.

Solving the problem of autism exclusion at work by designing radically

inclusive systems can help solve other inclusion and well-being

problems, creating a better future of work for job seekers and employees

of all backgrounds. Ultimately, removing barriers to access and success

of marginalized talent can help make sure that no one gets left behind.
