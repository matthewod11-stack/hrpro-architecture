## As with many new technologies, the potential impact of generative

AI on society is polarizing. There is a fear that this technology will

replace human workers, leading to mass de-skilling and widespread

unemployment. And there is a hope that generative AI will instead

supercharge human capabilities, leading to unprecedented boosts in

individual and collective innovation and productivity. In our work

at Microsoft Research on augmenting human cognition and decision-

making with AI, we have come to think about these scenarios as points

on a spectrum and have created a sports analogy to help think about

it: AI tools can range from steroids, to sneakers, to a coach, each

representing a diﬀerent relationship between human users and the

# technology.

Let’s start with steroids, the least desirable point on this spectrum.

Steroids elevate short-term performance but leave you worse oﬀ in the

long term. For example, imagine a student who is assigned homework

to read and critique a passage of text. The student could use a large

language model (LLM) as a steroid by simply dropping the text of the

passage into ChatGPT or any similar tool, prompting it to produce such

a critique, and passing the output back to the teacher. While this gives

the student the ability to complete the assignment in an instant, in the

long term it defeats the purpose of the exercise. Not only might the

student fail to learn from the assignment, but they might never acquire

(or slowly lose) the ability to critique a passage and articulate their

thoughts in clear writing. Just as with sports, taking shortcuts to achieve

a short-term goal can have negative consequences for other goals in the

# long term.

In the middle of the spectrum, AI-powered tools can instead be used to

augment people’s skills and make them more productive. That’s what

we think of as the analog to a good running sneaker. Like Nike’s carbon-

soled shoes that make runners on average 4-5% faster, some AI tools

can elevate performance in the moment without the long-term negative

eﬀects of de-skilling workers. For example, LLMs are particularly useful

for translating, reformatting, and annotating unstructured text, which

can save knowledge workers considerable time and eﬀort. Imagine an

analyst who runs an international survey with free-form text responses

in 20 diﬀerent languages. An LLM could drastically reduce the time

it takes to translate these responses to one common language, score

## them for positive or negative sentiment, and extract key themes. Similar

to performance-enhancing sneakers, in this case AI can accelerate

an analyst’s capabilities in the moment, while still allowing for their

human judgment, curiosity, and creativity to be applied.

On the most desirable end of the spectrum, AI-powered tools can be

used like a coach that improves people’s own capabilities. Consider

an IT professional who is studying to pass a certiﬁcation test for a

new, complex system. An LLM that has been trained on the system’s

documentation could interactively generate practice questions as the

professional gains competence and provide personalized feedback as it

teaches advanced concepts. Ultimately this would help the professional

stretch their understanding of the subject matter and develop new skills

that last beyond just the time spent using the AI-powered tutor.

Our own research has shown similar beneﬁts for learning new math

concepts. In a randomized experiment we ran online, we found

that giving people access to LLM-based explanations while practicing

standardized test problems led to sizable improvements in their ability

to later solve similar test problems on their own. Much like a sports

coach, AI tools that teach could potentially provide both short and long-

# term beneﬁts to performance.

While we think these parallels between athletic and cognitive

capabilities are apt, there are important diﬀerences between the two

domains. Whereas in sports the three relationships of steroids, sneakers,

and coaches are all quite distinct, they are much less so when it comes

to AI-powered tools, many of which are small variations on the same

underlying technology. As a result, the choices we make in terms of

how we design and use these tools can shift them from one end of the

spectrum to the other. Likewise, the norms we develop and how our

priorities evolve over time will play a crucial role in determining how,

when, and why we use AI-powered tools.

# Design Choices Matter

## First, from a design perspective, seemingly innocuous choices of how

we architect AI-powered tools can have a substantial impact on their

eﬀects. Take the somewhat mundane example of spell check. Most spell

checkers don’t automatically ﬁx words as you type without feedback.

Instead, they provide cues that indicate a potential misspelling and

oﬀer an opportunity to not only correct what’s written, but to visualize

the proper spelling. This small choice shifts spell check from being a

kind of a steroid to more of a coach. It improves your ﬁnal product while

also helping you learn from your mistake (or typo).

By thinking intentionally about how we design AI tools, we can

minimize or avoid harmful long-term eﬀects. For instance, our own

recent experiments show that simple conﬁdence-based highlighting,

similar to what’s done in spelling and grammar check, can help people

spot and correct fabrications or “hallucinations” produced by LLM-

based search tools. The idea is that if we can show people which bits

of information in an LLM-generated response might be less reliable, we

can help them spot and ﬁx potential errors. This would still oﬀer the

chance for productivity gains while maintaining the necessary cues for

cognitive awareness of where LLM-based responses can go wrong. With

thoughtful design we can develop helpful co-pilots that augment, rather

than replace, people in getting work done.

# Norms Will Emerge

Second, we will need to develop rubrics for thinking about when and

how we use AI-powered tools. Calculators serve as another historical

analog here. While we would be hard pressed to make an argument

against a banker using a calculator to compute compound interest,

it would be equally diﬃcult to make a case for giving a calculator

to a grade school student learning basic addition. Just as we have

come to settle on these norms for navigating how and when we use

past technological innovations, we imagine the same will emerge for

AI-powered tools: the same tool may be considered beneﬁcial in some

settings but detrimental in others. We also expect these norms to shift

# over time.

For instance, it used to be the case that physical libraries were the

gold standard for ﬁnding information and citations, but as the quality

and coverage of search engines improved along with our ability to

issue eﬀective queries and ﬁnd the right results, the web has become

an increasingly reliable and accepted information source. We believe

the same types of shifts will happen with AI-powered tools as the

underlying technology and our aptitude for using it co-evolves. At the

same time, businesses need to think about the consequences of having

workers become overly reliant on the latest tool: having only one way to

solve a problem is a point of vulnerability. In the workplace it will fall on

business leaders to set norms and expectations for when AI-powered

tools are (and aren’t) appropriate, and to ensure that they are used

# responsibly and ethically.

# Priorities Will Evolve

None of these categorizations are straightforward and can carry nuance

from person to person and industry to industry. Consider how the value

placed on spelling and arithmetic has changed over time. As mentioned

above, it used to be the case that being able carry out long division or

spell obscure words without aid were prized and respected talents, but

now they are now largely seen as archaic and esoteric skills. Presumably

this is because most people have access to a reliable calculator or spell-

checking tool when they need one, transforming what was at some

point feared to be a steroid into less of a concern. As a result, this has

freed up time for people to invest in developing other skills. In short,

we have decided to let some skills atrophy so that we can focus on

developing others.

With the growth of AI-powered tools, we expect to see similar shifts

in the skills that are valued and prioritized by society. People will

use their time diﬀerently and invest their learning in new places.

## For example, detailed syntactical knowledge of speciﬁc programming

languages might become less valued as generative AI tools evolve to

automatically generate code with increasing accuracy, freeing engineers

to focus on higher-level system design and architecture. As certain skills

become less prominent and new ones emerge as priorities, companies

should proactively oﬀer training to ensure employees remain equipped

## with the most relevant and valued skills.

We hope the steroids, sneakers, coach framework we have provided

here will prove useful for thinking through these issues and asking

critical questions about the AI tools being woven into both work and

life. As we integrate AI, our challenge is to craft tools that enhance

rather than diminish human capabilities. Through mindful design and

thoughtful consideration of when and how these tools are applied, and

allowing these priorities to shift as we co-evolve with them, we have

the opportunity to shape a future in which AI augments our human

# capabilities.
