Natural disasters are becoming increasingly frequent and severe,

## with devastating consequences for both individuals and communities

around the world. In the U.S., the National Centers for Environmental

Information reports that between 1980 and 1989, there were an average

of 3.3 natural disasters per year that caused more than $1 billion dollars

in damage (adjusted for inﬂation). That number increased to an average

of 23 per year in the last ﬁve years, with 27 such events in 2024 alone.

A natural disaster is not business as usual. These catastrophic events

demand that managers prioritize their people and focus on immediate

support for aﬀected team members. The following strategies, drawn

from our experience with clients as well as HR executives we spoke

with, will help managers provide tangible support and mitigate stress

for employees facing the emotional, logistical, and ﬁnancial challenges

that accompany natural disasters.

# Prioritize Safety and Well-Being

Your immediate focus should ﬁrst and foremost be on ensuring the

physical safety of your team members. This includes:

# Safety check-ins

Call or text any impacted team members. Ask about their personal

safety and physical well-being, oﬀering a supportive ear without waiting

to be asked. Let them know their safety and well-being is the number-

one priority and that you and the company are there to support them. A

personal check-in from you as a leader lets them know you care and are

concerned about their welfare.

If your company has a business continuity plan, there are likely useful

resources to help with this outreach. For example, Colony Capital, a

global real estate investment trust, has used a mobile app to send

automated communications quickly and at scale to selected groups

of employees during ﬁres, earthquakes, and hurricanes. Employees’

contact information is pre-loaded into the app to enable messages

such as “Hi, we are checking in on you, please conﬁrm you are okay,”

to selected groups by zip code or city. Employee responses are then

rapidly aggregated, highlighting the few nonrespondents for immediate

# outreach or follow-up.

## According to Karren Fink, principal of KAF HR Consulting, companies

that don’t have this type of mobile app service can manually pull

employees’ contact information from their HRIS system based on city

or zip code to create a modern-day phone tree.

Time off and paid leave

Recognize that these employees may need to manage immediate

impacts, such as evacuations or securing shelter for their families.

Check with your HR department to see if they have a speciﬁc policy for

this type of situation. Fink says that most companies have some form of

paid time oﬀ for these types of emergencies or can create a temporary

# plan in reaction to the event.

You can also inquire about a longer paid leave for those employees

who may need more time to deal with the immediate aftermath of

the disaster. Finding longer-term temporary housing, managing the

bureaucracy of insurance claims, and potentially ﬁnding new schooling

for kids all take time, not to mention cognitive and emotional capacity.

A longer paid leave can also help alleviate some of the ﬁnancial stress

# during this turbulent time.

# Mental health and emotional support

Support your employees’ mental health by oﬀering access to

counseling, such as through your company’s Employee Assistance

Programs (EAP), and other stress-management resources. Listen to

them, validate their emotions, and show empathy. The simple act of

witnessing their distress empathetically and showing that you are there to support them during this diﬃcult time can help ease some of the

stress they experience and can mitigate the degree of trauma they may

# experience.

You can also encourage other team members to reach out with messages

of support (without the expectation of a reply). This will help to foster

connectedness and create a sense of community and support during

# this challenging time.

# Triage and Reallocate Workload

During times of crisis, it’s essential to adjust workloads and

expectations to allow impacted team members to focus on their

immediate needs. You’ll want to:

# Shift mission-critical work.

Transfer critical tasks to other teammates so the aﬀected employee can

## focus entirely on their personal safety, family, and recovery. This not

only alleviates pressure on the aﬀected team member but also ensures

that the team remains productive.

# Adjust deadlines and expectations.

For any non-critical work, push out timelines or pause these

projects altogether until the aﬀected employee can re-assume these

responsibilities. In addition, communicate these changes to the relevant

stakeholders on the employee’s behalf, making this one less thing the

individual needs to worry about.

Be transparent and engage the rest of the team.

Communicate regularly and openly with the team about the situation,

any updates from the aﬀected employee that they’re comfortable

sharing, and the anticipated timing of when they will be able to re-

engage with work. This will provide transparency for all involved as

well as ensure that the team is aligned with the rebalancing of the

workload. It also gives them visibility into the approximate duration of

any shift in responsibilities and allows them ﬂag any coverage issues so

that modiﬁcations can be made to the reallocation of work. Ultimately,

this will ensure there is little to no “mess” for the returning employee

to clean up upon their return and will help make for a smoother, less

# stressful transition back to work.

# Offer Ongoing Support

When your impacted employee starts to re-engage in work activities,

they may still feel overwhelmed. To alleviate the burden on these

employees, oﬀer practical resources, including:

# Necessities assistance

If possible, consider having your team or organization organize

donations of basic necessities, such as food or clothing, to help the

person get settled. During natural disasters, there are often many free

resources that get circulated via email and social media. Aggregate

## and share these, where possible, with the aﬀected team members. For

example, in the past, Airbnb has oﬀered a free week of housing and Uber

has oﬀered free rides to evacuees. Generous oﬀers like these can make a

big diﬀerence to aﬀected individuals.

A team member of one of Melissa’s clients tragically lost their home

in the recent Palisades Fire. Rather than waiting for the individual

to reach out, a colleague took the initiative to organize support,

gathering essential clothing and hygiene items for the family. They

also coordinated a team-wide eﬀort to contribute to a fund, ensuring

the aﬀected family received gift cards for Amazon and a national

supermarket chain—resources they could use if they had to relocate.

The family expressed gratitude for the gesture, saying it relieved the

awkwardness of needing to ask for help during an overwhelming time.

# Financial and other assistance

As a leader, make sure you are aware of any ﬁnancial or other

assistance your company provides and share this information with

the impacted team member, even if the company has already sent

out an announcement, as aﬀected employees may miss various

communications in the midst of all the chaos. For instance, during

the LA wildﬁres, the CEO of Penske Media Corporation sent a note to

all employees saying that the company would pay for any impacted

employees to stay in a hotel while evacuated, provide cash to pay for

## necessities, as well as match donations by employees for disaster relief

and allow paid time oﬀ for any employee that volunteers to support

relief eﬀorts. This is an example of a CEO leading with heart and living

# the core values of their company.

Other options you may pursue on behalf of the individual are to check

whether the company can oﬀer a pay advance or loan, or even start a

crowd-funding campaign to help them cover unexpected out-of-pocket

expenses or administrative support to deal with personal matters.

This will not only help alleviate stress but also enable them to be

more present and focused when they are at work. You can also share

information from the Society for Human Resources, which oﬀers a

variety of resources on its website to help team members aﬀected by

natural disasters navigate related ﬁnancial and insurance issues.

# Patience and ﬂexibility

The aftermath of a natural disaster often leaves employees in a state of

uncertainty. It will likely take time for the aﬀected employee to re-focus

on anything work-related. And, when they do re-engage with work,

they may need additional ﬂexibility, including ﬂexible hours and/or

the ability to work remotely (if they don’t already) to handle personal

matters related to the disaster, such as changing housing, or driving a

# child to a new school further away.

By implementing the above strategies, you can support team members

who have been aﬀected by natural disasters and help them recover,

both professionally and personally. In doing so, you can contribute to

creating a sense of security at a time when their life has been upended

# by catastrophe.
