No one would argue that having high standards for your work and your

teams is a bad thing. Yet sometimes, extraordinarily high standards can

be unproductive and halt forward movement in your leadership career.

Leadership can be messy. Things often don’t go as planned. Rather

than accepting this as a natural part of life, if your standards are too

inﬂexible, you’ll feel perpetually frustrated because neither you nor

your team live up to your goals.

In practice, this can look like:

- You and your team don’t seem to be on the same page in meetings.

- Projects never get completed in the timeline you set forth.

- Your manager says, “Eighty percent done is good enough,” yet you

delay getting work to them until it’s “perfect.”

- You and your teams always work long hours.

- Your teams are showing signs of burnout (and so are you).

It may feel personally satisfying to see a project completed at your

perception of “one hundred percent.” But at what cost? And what is

the long-term net good? It might be less than you think, both for the

company and you. All this extra energy is exhausted seeking perfection

when it could be used to innovate or take a new step in your career.

Your high standards can become a detriment, inhibiting good work and

sabotaging your career.

If this sounds like you, here are four ideas to help you adjust your

expectations and get you moving forward again.

# Pause

Instead of charging ahead, take a beat. Set aside 15 to 30 minutes in your

week to ask yourself the following questions:

- How long have I had these standards in place?

- Are they in line with the company’s goals and needs?

- When did I last consider how I’m measuring success for the current

situation? Do I need to recalibrate?

- Have I ever discussed these standards with my team? (It’s not

uncommon for leaders to have incredibly high standards…which

they’ve never communicated.)

- What has worked with these standards in place?

- Why did I set these standards?

- What do other people on my teams think about these standards?

- Has the culture shifted? Should my goals shift?

Then, consider this question: What does “good enough” look like for

# you?

Karen often sees this scenario in high-growth companies: The “best”

way of accomplishing tasks gets in the way of “good enough” for the

time and budget available. Be clear about your organization’s priorities.

Assess where you are, what needs to be adjusted, and how you need to

communicate with stakeholders. Sometimes good is good enough.

Know when to be flexible.

High standards can’t be reached without other people on board. Do

others understand your vision? Ask yourself these questions:

- How much social capital do I have with this team?

- How does the room respond when I deliver feedback?

- Are my standards making a meaningful diﬀerence in whether we

accomplish our goals?

One of Anne’s clients with exacting standards regularly made her team

members stay until midnight to make minor changes to proposals.

Her team was losing motivation fast. Through coaching, the client

determined the extra hours were not worth it; she needed to ﬂex

her standards so she wouldn’t burn out her team. The incremental

improvements resulting from those extra hours weren’t helping the

bottom line. This client derived greater beneﬁt from letting the team

go home after normal working hours; the product didn’t suﬀer, and the

# team didn’t feel resentful.

Another one of Anne’s clients had a disconnect with his team. He

thought he’d been clear on his vision for the department. However,

vision-sharing is not one-and-done; leaders need to continually share

their vision with team members and get everyone’s buy-in. Because

the team lacked clarity, they weren’t aligned on work standards and

what would be “good enough.” Once the leader sat down and shared his

vision again, team members “got it” — and the work improved.

Consider your culture fit.

You may need to zoom out and look at the bigger picture. Ask yourself

whether you’re in the right company or department to leverage your

skills. There’s no such thing as a perfect job or a perfect company, but

you may be better suited to another environment. Ask yourself:

- What am I hearing in my performance reviews?

- What do the outputs from my 360s look like?

- What is the culture of the company? How do I ﬁt within it?

- Is leadership supportive of my work? (Ask your manager for candid

# feedback.)

- Am I working on the company’s highest priorities?

Check-ins like this are also not a one-and-done; you’ll need to do them

# continually throughout your career.

Karen will often provide 360 assessments for her clients. They are

all individual high-performers, but not all have high-performing team

skills; for some clients, the gap in team skills is a major oversight. If

you feel you aren’t being as eﬀective in team settings as you’d like, ask

for feedback. Then, listen and learn from what you receive. What you

perceive as the right way to do something may only be the right way

for you to do it. Or maybe you’ve been successful with this method in

the past with another team — but this team, these speciﬁc people, work

diﬀerently. To be eﬀective, you need to work diﬀerently, too.

# Engage in productive conflict.

Your team members, peers, and managers may not understand the

importance of your high standards and may be confused by your lack of

ﬂexibility when conﬂicts arise. Just because someone disagrees doesn’t

mean you need to compete — or shut down and walk away from

the project or conversation. Engage in productive, respectful conﬂict

and seek common ground with your colleagues. Remember that you

don’t need to win every disagreement. Pause, allow space for the other

person, and take your time in reaching a resolution. Approach the

conﬂict assuming your colleagues’ good intent and desire to see the

work done well.

It can be frustrating to have high standards that are not valued.

Consider: Do you need to be more ﬂexible, or should you go to a

company more aligned with your exacting standards? Either way, don’t

let your standards halt your career trajectory.
