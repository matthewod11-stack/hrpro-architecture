When Anika, the chief marketing ofﬁcer of a staﬃng organization,

learned that her boss had unexpectedly resigned and her coworker,

Charles, had been promoted from chief operating oﬃcer to CEO, she

was dismayed. She and Charles had a long history of disagreeing on

key issues at work, so she worried that she’d endure tense relations,

## micromanagement, or, worse, demotion or dismissal.

“Charles and I have worked together for 13 years and never seen eye-to-

eye,” she told me in a coaching session. “Now is his chance to get rid of

me.” She even considered preemptively looking for other jobs.

Anika’s reaction was understandable. When a colleague you dislike or

who dislikes you becomes your new leader, it’s natural to feel anxiety

or despair, worry about the fallout, and think about leaving. After all,

research shows that having a good relationship and reputation with

your manager is critical to job satisfaction and engagement. Gallup

Workplace Reports has repeatedly found that one of the most common

reasons quit is because they don’t like their manager.

But it’s important not to throw up your hands too quickly, especially if

you genuinely enjoy your organization and your job. Instead, you need

to use the transition as a catalyst for resetting the troubled relationship

and ﬁgure out a better way to work together. Here’s how:

# Distinguish feelings from facts.

When Anika heard the news about Charles’ appointment, her emotions

took over, leading her to worries that weren’t grounded in reality.

To break her out of this pattern, I encouraged her to list her feelings

or perceptions on one side of a piece of paper and the actual facts on

the other. For example, “Charles doesn’t trust me” versus “Charles said

that my presentation could include more campaign results and ROI

data.” This exercise helped Anika realize that she had no actual data

indicating that Charles actively disliked her or wanted to sabotage her career, just that he wasn’t afraid to challenge her or oﬀer suggestions for

# improvement.

Anika learned to practice emotional generosity and open-mindedness

with Charles. While he was not her ideal boss, he also was not the

antagonist she had created in her head.

## Shift from ambivalence to active inquiry.

When you don’t get along with a coworker, you might be able to create

workarounds so you’re only interacting on an as-needed basis. But that’s

not possible when the person is your boss. I helped Anika realize that

she would need to shift from ambivalence to active inquiry to better

understand what made Charles tick.

This process starts with creating a “core concern map” that includes

## information on your manager’s key goals, priorities, and values. This

information can help you ﬁgure out how to best inﬂuence them

and showcase gaps where you can provide value that improves your

# relationship.

## Acknowledge and bridge key personality differences.

Interpersonal conﬂict often stems from diﬀerences in work speed,

## communication style, decision-making processes, or levels of

# extroversion and introversion.

When I pressed Anika on this, she acknowledged that she was more of

a big picture, conceptual thinker and liked to share broad ideas, while

Charles loved getting into the weeds and would often ask her for speciﬁc

## process details, results, and reports in meetings.

The next step is to create a plan to bridge those diﬀerences. Don’t

assume your new boss will change. Now that the power dynamic has

shifted, the onus is on you to adapt your behavior to them. Ask yourself:

What new behaviors will be required from me in interactions with this

person? What’s one thing I could do diﬀerently to generate the most

# positive impact?

Anika adjusted her approach to meetings and interactions with Charles.

Instead of creative marketing ideas, she focused focus on lead campaign

# data and results.

Leverage shared values and desired outcomes.

To heal a diﬃcult relationship, the mindset must move from “me

versus you” to “you and me working towards the shared success of

the organization.” A list of shared attributes, values, and goals — both

professional and personal — can help.

When I prompted Anika to do this, she noted that she and Charles both

valued integrity, quality, and transparency and wanted to see positive

customer feedback and ﬁnancial results. Outside work, they had kids

the same age involved in similar activities.

Prompted by this thinking, Anika developed a new reporting tool to

transform the way her sales and marketing team tracks and veriﬁes

leads and plans campaigns, much to Charles’s delight. She also found

a way to connect with him personally with chats about their families’

# respective weekend and vacation plans.

# Address the elephant in the room.

If after trying these strategies the relationship still hasn’t improved,

it may be time to address the issue head on. You can opt for two

approaches depending on the nature of the relationship.

If you believe your colleague-turned-manager is open-minded and self-

aware, ﬁnd a time for honest and vulnerable conversation. Start by

taking ownership and accountability for speciﬁc situations in which

you’ve clashed, and then with genuine sincerity and curiosity, explain

that you’re committed to helping the team succeed and ask how you can support that eﬀort.

If you suspect that your boss won’t be receptive to feedback, might

react negatively, or isn’t even aware of the problem, try a less direct

approach. You might ask what they believe will be the keys to successful

collaboration, what they value in reporting relationships, and what

speciﬁc actions you should (and shouldn’t) take to help them achieve

# results.

Taken together, these ﬁve strategies might just help you transform a

challenging situation into career growth.
