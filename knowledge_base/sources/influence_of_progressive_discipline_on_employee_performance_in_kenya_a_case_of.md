# ABSTRACT

Conflict between managers and employees is inevitable in any organization, whether public or private. often, the source of the conflict is employee non-compliance. managers are responsible for disciplining those employees whose performance or conduct is sub-standard or inappropriate. However, the ability to effectively address employee non- compliance is a challenge to many managers or supervisors.The objectives of the study were to establish the influence of employee reprimand system, employee code of conduct, employee disciplinary procedures and employee rules and regulations on employee performance in Kenya with a case of Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy in Nyeri County.The study reviewed several literatures in line with the area of study and employed descriptive research design so as to carry out an in depth study of the organization in order to come up with relevant data for analysis. the study targeted 130 employees of mukurwe-ini wakulima dairy Ltd 50% of the population that is 65 respondents were sampled using simple random sampling method. the primary data was collected by use of questionnaires as the data collection instruments. the data was analyzed using the statistical package for social sciences (spss) version 21, and presented in the report in form of tables, pie charts and graphs to represent frequencies and percentages. The study adopted inferential statistics and variables were regressed at 5% level of significance to determine strength and direction of their relationship and the study established that all independent variables statistically and significantly influenced the dependent variable. The analysis showed that codes of conduct had the strongest positive (pearson correlation coefficient =.603) influence on employee perfomance. In addition, employee reprimand, employee disciplinary procedures and rules and regulations are positively correlated to employee perfomance (pearson correlation coefficient =.506, .559 and .622).The code of conduct was the most significant factor. The study concluded that employee reprimand, code of conduct, employee rules and regulations and employee disciplinary procedures positively influenced employee performance at Mukurwe-ini wakulima dairy. The study recommends that there is need to have effective employee reprimand systems, good code of conduct, effective employee disciplinary procedures and rules and regulations on progressive discipline as they positively influence employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy.

# INTRODUCTION

This chapter provides a basis for the study on the influence of progressive discipline on employee performance in Kenya with a focus on Mukurwe- ini Wakulima Dairy Limited as the study area. It provides the background and the setting required to put the research problem into proper context and understanding. This chapter includes the background of the study, the statement problem and purpose of the study, specific objectives and research questions, scope, significance and limitations of the study.

# Background of the Study

Mullins (2005) asserts that progressive discipline is a process for dealing with job related behavior that does not meet expected and communicated performance standards. The primary purpose is to assist the for progressive discipline employee to understand that a performance problem or opportunity for improvement exists. The process features increasingly formal efforts to provide feedback to the employee so he or she can correct the problem. The goal of progressive discipline is to improve employee performance.

Margie Mader-Clark and Lisa Guerin (Nolo), asserts that the process of progressive discipline is not intended as a punishment for an employee, but to assist the employee to overcome performance problems and satisfy job expectations. Progressive discipline is most successful when individual to become an effective performing member of the organization. Failing that, progressive discipline the enables

employment of the employee who is ineffective and unwilling to improve.

According to Torrington (2009), typical steps in a progressive discipline system may include these; counsel the employee about performance and ascertain whether issue contributing to the poor performance, which are not immediately obvious to the supervisor. Solve if possible, verbally reprimand the employee for poor performance, provide a written verbal warning in the employees file, in an effort to improve employee performance provide an escalating number of days in which the employee is suspended from work. Start with one day and escalate to five. It may be important to end the employment of an individual who refuses to improve. Employees are uncomfortable when their Manager tells them that their performance warrants a verbal step before written warning, disciplinary action begins. Managers wonder

Many Managers dislike the disciplinary portion of their job more than anything else. In fact in studies of International Manpower Management by Abbass J. (1993), Managers rank firing an employee at the top of the list of actions in which they most hate to play part. Managers would rather spend their time on activities such as setting goals, reviewing progress and eliminating problems employees experience as they strive to complete their work.

From a company perspective, an employee reprimand demonstrates that the company will be working with the employee to help him or her improve. At the same time, the company documents its increasing unhappiness with the

e(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee(cid:859)s perfor(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e. The (cid:449)ritte(cid:374) e(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee reprimand shows that the employee will also be informed of the performance problem and their consequences if they reminded uncorrected. Following the letter of reprimand, depending on

the (cid:272)o(cid:373)pa(cid:374)(cid:455)(cid:859)s dis(cid:272)ipli(cid:374)ar(cid:455) a(cid:272)tio(cid:374) poli(cid:272)ies, additional steps can include subsequent letters of reprimand with accompanying penalties such as days off from work. If the supervisor has faith that the employee can improve his or her performance, at any time during the discipline any action proceedings, and preferably before the first letter of reprimand, the supervisor can introduce a performance, improvement plan (PIP). The PIP is a formal, detailed document with goals, expectations and timelines, the

super(cid:448)isor(cid:859)s opportu(cid:374)it(cid:455) to (cid:272)o(cid:373)(cid:373)u(cid:374)i(cid:272)ate (cid:272)lear job and performance expectations to the non- performing employee (Torrington, 2009).

Mullins (2005), opinionates that disciplinary action, such as an employee reprimands, can be a win-win if the employee needs the message. If the employee does not, the company and the their manager have effectively protected interests and the interests of employees who are performing satisfactorily. The goal is to prevent negative impact on performing employees whose morale is affected by the employee who is not doing his or her job. As a communication tool with employees, an employee reprimand must be fair. Employers need to make certain that they are using the tool appropriately and that certain conditions exist for its effective and successful use. Employee job description must

## Global Perspective of Progressive Employee Discipline.

According to international norms (practice) and expectations, companies have to take into account social, ethical and environmental issues more than during the last two decades. This is for

the reaso(cid:374) of (cid:373)ore (cid:272)o(cid:373)petitio(cid:374), people(cid:859)s expectations and also quality of the processes and procedures involved in handling issues. In recent years, companies have been urged to adopt a variety of performance enhancing or progressive human resource management practices to improve their competitiveness in the and global market place. Professionals academics have long asserted that the way in which an organization manages people can and performance influence

using disciplinary threats that are not followed through, or providing too many warnings; and dispense with progressive discipline where there is strong evidence of serious misconduct that has completely destroyed the viability of an on-going employment relationship, or no rehabilitative potential in the particular employee.

It takes little persuasion on a theoretical level to convince a business leader, those employees who are more committed or involved, work harder and smarter and will be better for the company than those who turn up and do merely what they are obliged to do, Gallup Research Report (2003). The Gallup Research Report (2003) estimated that inactively disciplined workers are 10 times more likely to say they will leave their organizations within a year than involved staff. Their 2003 survey in the US and Canada of 1000 workers found that only a quarter were actively engaged in their work with a huge group of between 56% and 60% not engaged and 17% actively disengaged. The research estimates that actively disengaged (uncommitted) and undisciplined workers cost US businesses between $270 and $343 billion a year due to low productivity

## Local Perspective of Progressive Employee progressive Discipline.

According to Wambugu (2010) conducted a study on the relationship between employee commitment and job performance at the Kenya Institute of Surveying and Mapping. Mutunga, (2009) did a research on the factors that contribute to the level of employee performance in the airline industry in Kenya. It was concluded that several factors contribute to employee performance but, discipline, salary and benefits was the largest contributor. Maluti, Warentho,

- 1553 -

and Shiundu, (2011) carried out a study on the impact of employee commitment on retention in state financial corporations in Kenya. The results indicated that there was no significant impact of employee commitment on employee retention. Mwangi (2011) carried out a research on the intelligence and utilization of emotional transformational for employee leadership engagement in public Universities in Kenya. The results established that emotional intelligence impacts employee involvement and discipline significantly through the competencies in self- awareness, social awareness, self-management and social management

# Statement of the Problem

According to the Gallup Research Report (2003) estimated that actively in disciplined workers are 10 times more likely to say they will leave their organizations and leading to poor performance within a year than disciplined staff. Their 2003 survey in the US and Canada of 1000 workers found that only a quarter were actively engaged in their work with a huge group of between 56% and 60% not engaged and 17% actively disengaged. The research estimates that actively disengaged (uncommitted) and undisciplined workers cost US businesses between $270 and $343 billion a year due to low productivity

There limited research on progressive discipline on employee performance, yet employee progressive discipline is very critical for employee performance, business survival and growth of the industry Otieno (2004).

# Significance of the Study

The results of this study would be of much benefit to several stakeholders. The findings of this study are expected to help the researcher stand to gain after successfully completing the research in preparation for further studies. The Management of the organizations would obtain important information regarding the employee progressive discipline techniques and how they can be improved. The conclusions and recommendations would add value to the existing literature firm. Other researchers would use the study as a spring board to investigate other related aspects of employee progressive discipline which shall be captured in section of implications for further studies. The functional heads in various departments would be interested in the information that would be

for summarized, analyzed and decision making. The government through Kenya Dairy Board would also use it when formulating policies and frameworks to impact the dairy industry in a positive manner.

# Scope of the Study

The study was confined to Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy employees. The company impacts on the Agribusiness activities, giving farmers availability of investment opportunities in dairy sector. The study targeted 130 employees according to the records available as per February, 2015 but a sample of 65 was used for this study. The study limited itself to variables under employee reprimand system, code of conduct, disciplinary procedures and rules and regulations on employee performance in Kenya.

# Limitations of the study

The study faced some challenges such as some targeted respondents were reluctant to share others sensitive misinterpreted the research and refused to provide accurate information for fear of disclosure. However, by discussing the relevance of the study to the respondents it helped to provide the required information. The researcher presented an introduction letter that was obtained from the university to the Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy management and this helped to avoid suspicion and enabled the targeted respondents to disclose much of the information sought by the study. The target group that the study focused on was quite busy carrying out their duties and

was not available to fill the questionnaire promptly.

The issue of unreturned questionnaires and uncooperative respondents proved difficult for the researcher. Follow ups were made to facilitate the response rate. The organizations confidentiality policy restricted most of the respondents from answering some of the questionnaires since it was considered to be against the organization confidentiality policy to expose the organization confidential matters. The suspicion normally associated with any kind of a research study. This study overcame this issue by assuring the respondent of utmost confidentiality and information provided would strictly be used for the academic purposes and would not jeopardize their positions in any way.

# Theoretical Review

Theoretical frameworks are explanations about a phenomenon and according to Marriam (2001) theoretical framework provides the researcher the lens to view the world. A theory is an accepted fact that attempt to provide a plausible or rational explanation of cause- and-effect

(causal) relationship among a group of observed phenomenon (Kothari, 2004). Several theories and models have been put forward by scholars to explain the field of employee progressive discipline. The study is built upon certain theories that have much links with employee employee progressive performance. Mugenda (2008) defines a theory as a frame work of explaining phenomena by stating constructs and the laws that inter relate these constructs to each other.Theoretical framework provides the researcher the lens to view the world. Some of the relevant theories include; Theories of progressive discussed discipline, reinforcement theory, Business Ethics theory, equity theory and systems theory.

# Reinforcement Theory

According to Hull (1951), asserts that as experience is gained in taking action to satisfy needs, people perceive that certain actions help less achieve their goals while others are successful. Some actions bring rewards, others failure or even punishment. result theory was developed by Reinforcement Hull(1951), which suggests that success in achieving goals and rewards acts as a positive incentive and reinforce to successful behavior which is repeated the next time a similar need emerges. Conversely, failures or punishments provide negative reinforcement, suggesting that it is necessary to seek alternative means of achieving goals. This process has been called

(cid:862)the la(cid:449) of effe(cid:272)t(cid:863). The asso(cid:272)iated (cid:272)o(cid:374)(cid:272)ept of operant conditioning (Skinner, 1974) explains that the new behaviors or responses become established through a particular stimulus, hence

- 1556 -

conditioning people to repeat behavior by positive reinforcement in the form of feedback and knowledge of results. Through employee reprimand system, employees receive feedback on their performance. Reinforcement theory explains that people behave in ways they expect will produce positive outcomes. The degree to which experience shapes future behavior depends on extent to which individuals correctly perceive the connection between behavior and its outcome and on the extent to which they are able to recognize resemblance between the previous situation and one that now confronts them.

It has been suggested that behavioral theories based on the principle of reinforcement or the law of effect are limited because they imply, in All port(cid:859)s (cid:894)(cid:1005)(cid:1013)(cid:1009)(cid:1008)(cid:895) phrase, (cid:862)hedo(cid:374)is(cid:373) of the past(cid:863). They assume that the present choices of an individual are found in an examination of the consequences of their past choices and this influence the expectations. The above theory facilitated the understanding of the study variable and objective that is to establish the effects of employee reprimand system on employee performance in Kenya.

# Business Ethics Theory

Business Ethics Theory focuses on the rights and wrongs in the business. In understanding the right and wrong in the business ethics theory, Crane and Matten (2007) injected morality that is concerned with the norms, values and beliefs fixed in the social process which defines right and wrong for an individual or social community. Crane and Matten (2007) define ethics as the study of morality and the application of reason which sheds light on rules and principle which is called ethical theories that ascertain the right

and the wrong for a situation. Businesses are major provider of jobs, products and services and as such demands are placed on the management and governance making their work more challenging and complex as there are compromises to be made. Business ethics helps to identify benefits and problems associated with ethical issues within the organization and it is important as it gives a new light into present and traditional view of ethics (Crane and Matten 2007)

According to Purcell (1987), business aim to achieve prosperity, growth and survival. Ideally success should benefit all the stakeholders in the organization such as owners, management, customers, employees and suppliers. There may be tension between accomplishing business and social and ethical obligations of an organization. An ethical approach will be based high commitment and high involvement policies. The commitment will be mutual and arrangement for involvement will be genuine i.e. management will be prepared not only to listen but to act on the views expressed by employees or if it cannot take action, the reasons explained. It will also be transparent and attempt will be made to maintain full employment policies.

Keasey & Wright (2005) in analyzing code of conduct, distinguish the decision making, the structures and process associated with the production, control and accountability which in turn involve the monitoring, evaluation and control of organizational agents to ensure they act in the interest of all stakeholders and in an ethical manner. From the understanding of ethics, it can be noted that different systems of code of conduct will embody what are of considered

# legitimate

# lines

accountability by defining the nature of the relationship between the company and code of conduct constituencies.

The main role of code of conduct is to limit conflicts of interest between managers, employees and shareholders as well as costs generated by such conflicts. Mizruchi (2004), asserts that parties must be controlled in order to avoid losses. Unethical practices are seen in many organizations. This can cause organization to drop sharply, job to be lost and organization values to be affected. The above theory instigated the second study variable and objective that is to examine the effects of codes of conducts on employee performance in Kenya

# Equity Theory

According to (Adams,1965), equity theory is concerned with the perceptions people have about how they are being treated as compared with others. To be dealt with equitably is to be treated fairly in comparison with other group of people or relevant other person. Equity involves feelings and perceptions is always a comparative process. It is not synonymous with equality which means treating everyone the same. Equity theory states, in effect , that people will be better motivated if they are treated equitably and demotivated if they are treated inequitably. It is significant in terms of morale. There are two forms of equity; distributive equity which is concerned with the fairness in which people accordance with in their comparison with others, and procedural equity the perception which employees have about the fairness with which the company procedures in such areas as performance appraisal, promotion and discipline

are being operated. The above theory facilitated the understanding of the third study variable and objective that is to establish the effects of employee disciplinary procedures on employee performance in Kenya

# Systems Theory

The systems theory of industrial relations as propounded by Dunlop (1958), states that industrial relations can be regarded as a system or web of rules regulating employment and the ways in which people behave at work. According to this theory, the role of system is to produce the regulations and procedural rules that govern how much is distributed in bargaining process and how the parties involve or relate to one another. Dunlop explained that the output of the system takes the following forms; the system is expressed in many formal or informal guises that are in legislation and statutory orders, trade union regulations, in collective agreements and arbitration awards, in social conventions, in managerial decisions and in accepted custom and practice. The rules may be defined and coherent or ill-defined and incoherent. In a company the rules may be concerned with doing no more than defining status quo that both parties recognize as the norm from which deviations may be made only by agreement. In industrial relations this sense therefore an system is a normative system where a norm can be seen as a rule, a standard or a pattern for action that is generally accepted as the basis up on which the parties concerned should operate.

Dunlop (1958), asserts that job regulation aims to provide a framework of minimum rights and rules. These may provide for internal or external regulation, contain substantive or procedural rules or be expressed in the form of collective

- 1558 -

agreements or customs and practice. Internal is concerned with and external regulations procedure grievance, redundancies or disciplinary problems and rules concerning the operation of the employment relationship and the rights of stewards. External is carried out by means of regulation employment legislation, rules of trade unions

In UK, the parties to collective agreements have tended to concentrate more on procedural than substantive rules. In United States, where there is greater emphasis on fixed term agreements, the tendency has been to rely more on substantive rules.

According to Armstrong (2011), Procedural rules are intended to regulate relationships especially those involving conflict between the parties. Custom and practice refers to the unwritten rules on how and industrial employment issues should be dealt with that have been built up and accepted by management and trade unions overtime. Custom and practice is an implied contractual the term. The above understanding of the fourth study variable and objective that is to find out the effects of employee rules and regulations on employee performance in Kenya.

# Conceptual Framework

A conceptual framework is a set of broad ideas and principles taken from relevant field of inquiry and used to structure a subsequent presentation (Frank &Wallen, 2000). According to Mugenda & Mugenda (2003), an independent variable is a property of phenomenon which

influences or affects others while a dependent variable is one which is influenced by the independent variable. The conceptual frame work of progressive discipline on employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy is illustrated in the Figure 2.1;

improvement of work and employees potential great values to the company, reprimand can also in the interest of the employees. Reprimands should never be general, vague or based on rumors set up an appointment with the employee gathers factual, concrete information upon which the reprimand is based and avoid reprimanding an employee when others can hear. Such encounters discourage dialogue between manager and the employee and make attaining positive results much more difficult (Reward, 2004).

Why is employee reprimand system important to performance of employee? As foundational documents they can provide the framework that public servants – political and civil service – use to carry out their public responsibilities (Martha, 2005). Employee reprimand systems can clearly articulate unacceptable behaviors as well as providing a vision for which the government official is striving. Therefore, inducing monetary reform, creating democratic institutions or improvement programs funding economic without a professional government workforce can be frustrating, if not counterproductive. A ensuring fundamental mechanism for professionalism is an employee reprimand systems (Crane, 2005).

# Employee Reprimand System.

Gupta, C. B (2009), asserts that the reprimand should be as positive as possible, and focusing on

The existence of employee reprimand system for employees to enhance performance and reflect a good image of the organization and promote good governance has not mitigated against the employee performance in many organizations (Lwamafa, 2004). Organization management for the employee dealings they are engaged in, they however rarely account for all employes under them.

- 1559 -

Employee reprimand system is the principle that sets out standards of behavior for employees in the organization. It is designed to esure the impartiality, transparency, integrity, efficiency and employees when of performing their duties. It is intended to guide employees in their behavior and how they relate to each other and the public (Lwamfa,2006). The effectiveness of such employee reprimand system depends on the extent to which management supports them with sanctions and rewards. Violations of an organization's employee reprimand systems usually can subject the violator to the organization's remedies. The employee reprimand systems links to and gives rise to a code of conduct for employees in an organization(Baron, 2000).

Codes of ethics are written to guide behavior (Whitford, 2006). Any final analysis of the impact of a code must include how well it affects

(cid:271)eha(cid:448)ior. “(cid:272)holarl(cid:455) resear(cid:272)hers(cid:859) de(cid:271)ates a(cid:271)out codes generally revolve around whether more general codes are mere platitudes, and whether more detailed codes require behavior about which reasonable people can disagree. They even debate whether ethics codes are necessary at all because good people should know how to act ethically without any guidance (Prucell, 2003) these are worthy academic questions, but they are different than those a practitioner must ask. For those working with developing public service communities the more important questions are what blend of the general and specific are most likely to affect behaviors that a society needs from its civil servants and its political leaders. Contemporary social psychological research also strongly suggests that codes can guide or induce

- 1560 -

in developing countries that are behaviors critical to a functioning public service (Crane,

(cid:1006)(cid:1004)(cid:1004)(cid:1011)(cid:895). Codes are (cid:374)ot desig(cid:374)ed for (cid:862)(cid:271)ad(cid:863) people, but for the persons who want to act ethically. The bad person will seldom follow a code, while most people – especially public servants -- welcome ethical guidance in difficult or unclear situations. The average person is not grossly immoral but often tempted, and sometimes confused, by what appears to be a virtuous path.

(cid:862)Whe(cid:374) te(cid:373)ptatio(cid:374)s are sig(cid:374)ifi(cid:272)a(cid:374)t, (cid:449)he(cid:374) the price of adherence (in terms, for example, of the sacrifice to our interests) is high, when the social consequences of violation (harm to others) are relatively slight, when the costs of violation are low – under such circumstances it is easy to be led from doing what you ought to do (Martha, 2005) No code, no matter how severely enforced will make truly bad people good. However, ethics codes can have a demonstrable impact on the behavior of bad people in organizations. When everyone clearly knows the ethical standards of an organization they are more likely to recognize wrongdoing; and do something about it (Andrew, 2006). Second, miscreants are often hesitant to commit an unethical act if they believe that everyone else around them knows it is wrong. And, finally corrupt individuals believe that they are more likely to get caught in environments that emphasize ethical behavior (Armstrong, 2011).

According to Larman, (2002), a code of conduct is intended to be control guide and reference for users in support of day to day decision making. It is meant to classify, an organization mission, values of principles linking them with standards of professional conduct. A code is an open disclosure of the way an organization operates; important communication also serve as an

vehicle that reflects the covenant that an organization has made to uphold its most important value, dealing with such matters as its commitment is employees as its standards for doing business and its relationship with the community.

Supervisors and Managers need to be trained on when and how discipline should be used( Crane , 2007) It is necessary to provide training on counseling skills as these will be used while dealing with problem employees; Centralization of discipline. Centralized means that the discipline decision should be uniform throughout the organization. The greater the uniformity, higher will be the effectiveness of the discipline procedure and impersonal discipline (Whiford, 2006)

Managers are given a few traditional options to modify conduct that does not rise to the level of a removable offense: primarily reprimands and suspensions, with the occasional change to a lower grade. However, agencies also have the option (under most circumstances) to use alternative methods to correct behavior by use of acceptable employee disciplinary procedures. Alternative discipline is characterized by what is not—namely traditional discipline. Alternative discipline is a measure taken by management to address a

regulations management The establishes in the workplaces are necessary so management remains in compliance with the law. The rules and regulations enable the employees to abide to the rules and regulations set and this enables to improve the performance of an organization (Hassan, 2005) and grievance procedures. However, the introduction of unfair dismissal and discrimination legislation and the consequent threat of defending employment tribunal applications were argued to have provided employers with a significant impetus to adopt more formal processes though the regulations effective employee (Edwards et al., 2004). Nonetheless, the greater use of formal procedure failed to halt the rapid increase in employment tribunal applications from 1988 onwards, with the rate more than trebling between 1988 and 1996 (Burgess et. al, 2007).

The relationship between employee rules and regulations and employee performance has been a primary issue in the field of business and society over the past 25 years. Significant in several research has been carried out different with geographical

findings of Orlitzky et al (2003), they indicate that the employee rules and regulations has a positive impact on employeeperformance and that this is strongest in the UK context.

According to Baron (2000), employee rules and regulations in major corporations are coming under scrutiny, and employee pefomance have been challenged about conflicts of interest and their investment advice. Considering that ethical scandals have been exposed even in the very large corporations, e.g. Enron, WorldCom etc., managers are becoming more conscious of how they are perceived by the public, and want to be

Apart from the academic research undertaken, studies have also been carried out by several bodies, such as Institute of Business Ethics (IBE) and Ethical Investment Research Services (EIRIS), in order to provide useful advice to practitioners on how to improve and measure their own corporate social performance. Both of the above EIRIS: Corporate rules and regulations studies generated evidence of a positive relationship between rules and regulations and financial and employee performance (Orlitzky, Schmidt and Rynes, 2003).

formal grievance (37%) or disciplinary procedure (31%). An even larger proportion of workplaces did not implement the three steps as outlined in the dispute resolution regulations. This problem was particularly acute in the case of micro firms with less than ten employees (Forth et al., 2006).The regulations were clearly aimed at reducing the number of employment tribunal forcing employers and, most claims by importantly, employees to exhaust internal procedures before resorting to an employment tribunal claim (Department of Trade and Industry, 2001). Between 2003/4 and 2005/6 the number of single employment tribunal claims fell from 65,364 to 52,000. However whether this was due to more effective workplace dispute resolution, or simply the increased difficulty of making a claim, is questionable (Suff et al., 2006).

Hepple & Morris (2002) suggested that the impact of the procedural changes introduced under the Employment Act 2002 downgraded rather than enhanced procedural fairness. They argued that the statutory procedures fell well short of best practice reflected by the Acas Code of Practice. Furthermore, as long as the employer followed the statutory procedure they could escape a finding of unfair dismissal on the grounds that procedural defects would have

Even so, employers complained that the regulations increased both administration and the incidence of workplace disputes (Gibbons, 2007). Indeed in 2006/7, single employment tribunal claims rose by 3% while the number of those with multiple all claims (Employment claimants) Tribunal Service, 2007).

The Gibbons Review (Gibbons, 2007) and the publication of the Employment Bill 2007-8 have concentrated attention on ways in which employment disputes can be resolved in the workplace. However, one aspect that has received relatively little attention is the impact on reprimand of accompaniment and representation within both formal and informal aspects of disciplinary and grievance processes. Therefore, the study sought to remedy this omission by examining whether representation and accompaniment can help to resolve disputes and moderate disciplinary outcomes as pertaining to employee reprimand systems.

Sally et al,(2004) did a study on Ethical trade in African horticulture: rights and Participation in flower farms in Kenya, South Africa and Zambia. As indicated, most producers recognized the importance of good employment practices and seemed genuinely committed to making improvements. However, what emerged from the research was that they sometimes had a limited understanding of the problems that their workers faced. To some extent codes (including audits against codes) had helped raise awareness of certain potential issues, such as discrimination and sexual harassment, but in general producers were making changes based on their own perceptions and not those of workers. Very few workers in our study had any knowledge of codes, despite the fact that some companies had been implementing them for several years. Most of those that did thought they related only to technical specifications, with only a few aware that there were codes covering (cid:449)orkers(cid:859) rights.

countries workers had generally not been involved in the implementation of codes.

Griffin and Mahon (1997) supported the theory of the positive code of ethics and financial performance relationship with findings from their research. They demonstrated this by studying and classifying the results of 62 studies, into three spanning 25 years of research, categories; no negative positive, effect/inconclusive. They identified 33 results that found a positive relationship, 20 with negative results and 9 which found no relationship or were inconclusive.With respect to the relationship between code of ethics and financial performance, Curtis C. (1998) found that companies publicly committing to follow an ethics code as an internal control strategy achieved significantly higher performance measured in both financial and non-financial terms. Similarly, Berrone et al (2005) in their

A study by U.S.A (MSPBB) 2008 on the U.S. Merit Systems Protection Board (MSPB) by studying 22 departments and agencies to provide with responses to a questionnaire was created regarding their use of alternative discipline on disciplinary procedures. In total, they received and 46 subcomponents of various departments and agencies. The study established that the level of employee disciplinary procedures that agencies provide to their workforce varied greatly by agency, but in most agencies there was little or no disciplinary procedures. Only 7 of our 46 responding organizations told stated that their agency has a formal agency-wide employee disciplinary policy. However, 80 percent of those organizations without such a policy are permitted by the agency to use alternative discipline on an ad hoc basis.

Richard, Valerie & Carol (2008) describes the findings of a pilot study which explored the impact and representation of employees within disciplinary and grievance processes. The research focused on eight case studies of employing organizations and was conducted in April and May 2008. The sample was made up of: two large private sector unionized organizations; two medium-sized non small non- unionized organizations; unionized organizations; and two large public sector organizations which both recognized trade unions. Case studies involved interviews with Human Resource managers, operational managers, trade union representatives and employee companions. It is important to note that the legislation did not compel workplaces to have a written procedure. It simply set out mandatory steps that had to be followed.

Mundia (2009), in a study on the imaging issues in general, in management asserts employee discipline can be best described in terms of a process, where certain attitudes give rise to certain behaviors intended or actual. However, he failed to point out that there have been major changes in the business world and the workforce in the last couple of decades in terms of discipline. In past once hired an employee believed it was a life time job and managers expected their unstinted loyalty to the enterprise. Similarly workers used to be devoted to their employer. This image of employment loyalty has gradually changed with the advent of

# Chapter summary

From the foregoing literature most writers like Mullins (2005), Torrington (2009) and Armstrong (2009), are of the opinion that aspects of progressive employee discipline denotes that responsibility mostly include an obligation to carry out the assigned duties. The more responsible one is the more motivated. It is a good feeling to know that management is considered a person of integrity and intelligent to be given a higher responsibility which is a motivational factor that helps personal growth. interrelated and are All these factors are including positively and promotion, participation in central decision making and execute benefits which are all signs of growth and advancement that add to dedication and commitment of employees.

and employee regulations,(Torrington,2005;Mullins,2005;Robe rt & bascal,2007;Aracelli,2004). Although a number of studies have found these variables to have employee performance, several studies have argued that these variables only provide partial insight into enhancing employee performance and that alternative new variables should be brought into progressive employee discipline (Armstrong, 2011; performance dynamics Dower,2004).Further, not many studies were identified relationship between progressive discipline and employee performance. Finally, the other gaps identified included; no records were available to this study to show any research progressive discipline and employee performance in Kenya. This study therefore sought to fill these gaps.

# Introduction

This chapter presents the methodology and procedures that will be adopted while carrying out the study. It presents the research design, the target population, the sample size and sampling techniques, sampling procedure, the data collection instruments, validity and reliability of instruments, data analysis and presentations. Research Design

A research design can be defined as the structure of the research. It is the core of all different aspect of any research (Kisulu & Tromp, 2006). Orodho (2003) asserts that research design is a plan of all the conditions and elements for the collection and analysis of data in an objective

manner that is in line with the research aims. It provides a framework within which research is done. The research design constitutes the blue print for the collection, measurement and analysis of data, (Kothari, 2005).The research adopted both descriptive research design on Judiciary and a case study approach. Descriptive survey is a method of collecting information by interviewing or administering a questionnaire to a sample of individuals (Orodho, 2003). It can also be used when collecting information about people(cid:859)s attitudes, opi(cid:374)io(cid:374)s ha(cid:271)its or any other social issues (Orodho & Kombo, 2003. A descriptive survey approach is a process of collecting data the members of a population in order to determine the current status of the subject under study with respect to one or more variables (Orodho, 2003). Since this study seeks to establish the role of progressive discipline on employee performance in Kenya

with Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy Ltd. as the study area, this had the advantage of providing an in-depth investigation of the problem under study. The findings were generalized to apply to the sectors in Kenya.

# Target Population

Population in statistics is the population about which information is derived. According to Field (2005), a population is a well-defined or set of people, services, elements, and events, group of things or households that are investigated. This definition ensured that the population of interests was homogeneous. Population studies were more representative because everyone had equal chance to be included in the final sample that was drawn. The population of interest of this study comprised of 130 employees eight departments as presented in the Table 3.1;

# Sample size and Sampling Technique

Kothari (2004) defines a sample size as the number of items to be selected from the universe to constitute a sample. The research used the stratified simple random sampling design to select the sample that represented the population. Random sampling refers to random selection of units from a group. According to Orodho (2005) in stratified random sampling, subjects are selected in such a way that the sample gives equal representation from each stratum.

According to Cohen and Lawrence (1995), a sample of 10% of the population is adequate in large populations, while 20% of the population is acceptable as the population is small. In this study, 50% was used as the population was small, hence the 65 employees out of 130 employees of Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy Ltd were used for the study. This sampling design was used because the research felt to study both the sub-groups using their departmental areas. The sample size constituted of 65 respondents drawn from eight departments of Mukurwe-ini Wakulima dairy as shown in Table 3.2;

# Data Collection Instruments

The study had to determine the data collection approach largely by identifying the type of information needed (Cooper & Schindler, 2003). is Cooper & Schindler contend that this

influenced by investigative questions that must be answered by the study and the desired data for each question. The study used type questionnaire as the research instrument. The Questionnaires consisted of both open ended and closed questions. Open ended questions

- 1567 -

required the respondent to answer questions by narrating their experiences and giving their opinions and this generated qualitative data while the closed questions required multiple choices. Both of these types of questions were administered to the respondents so as to gather information. The questionnaires enabled the researcher to collect data within a shorter time since most of the information was easily described. The study also undertook desk review of existing information about the study areas and collected secondary data which was useful for this study. Secondary data was gathered from existing credible and recognized source. The secondary data comprised of materials that were desirable, current, accurate, sufficient and relevant and was collected from library text books, internet and magazines and personnel file in the organization.

# Data Collection procedure

According to (Creswell, 2002), data collection procedure is a means by which information is obtained from the selected subjects of an investigation. After seeking the consent of the JKUAT and MWDL management to allow the study to be conducted in the organization for collecting data, the researcher visited the respondents within a span of one to three weeks to allow time for the respondents to fill in the questionnaires. Also, the researcher explained the purpose of the visit to the respondents. This assured the respondents of their confidentiality of any information they would give. The primary data was being collected from employees of Ltd, using Mukurwe-ini Wakulima Dairy questionnaires collect primary data. According to (Kothari,2004), questionnaires have low cost even when the universe is large

The questionnaire was administered through drop and pick method to the employee in various departments at Mukurwre-ini Wakulima Dairy Ltd. Questionnaires gave respondents freedom to express their views or opinion and also to make suggestions. Its anonymity helped to reduce more candid answer than is possible in an interview. Secondary was collected by a study of records and documents in various departments and data was collected concerning written records about variables understudy and reports with documentary evidence

# Pilot Study

According to Bordens &Abbott (2008), pilot study is as a small-scale version of the study used to and establish procedures, materials parameters to be used in the full study. According to (Cooper and Schindler, 2010), pilot test is conducted to detect weaknesses in design and instrumentation and to provide proxy data for selection of a probability sample. The pilot study involved pre-testing the questionnaires on 6 respondents of Mukurweinin airy. is supported 2006) who recommends that a pilot test of 10% of the sample size can be used. The respondents were conveniently selected since statistical conditions are not necessary in the pilot study (Cooper &Schindler, 2008). The Purpose was to refine the questionnaires so that respondents in major study have no problem in answering the questions. The results of pilot test were not included in the actual study.

# Validity of Instruments

This is the degree to which an instrument measures what is supposed to measure (Kothari, 2004). A content validity test was used to measure instrument validity. The research had purpose to ensure validity of research instruments by using simple language free from jargon that made it easy to be understood by the respondents. The researcher also intended to seek the opinion of individuals who could render intelligent judgment about their adequacy. The researcher also engaged her supervisor and other experts to ensure that the questions tested or measured what they were supposed to measure. The research adopted content validity which refers to the extent to which a measuring instrument provides adequate coverage of the topic under study. The content validity formula by Amin (2005) was used in line with other previous studies (Lefort & Urzua, 2008);the formula is; Content Validity Index = (No. of judges declaring item valid) / (Total no. of items). It is recommended that instruments used in research should have CVI of about 0.78 or higher and three or more experts could be considered evidence of good content validity (Amin, 2005).

# Reliability of Instruments

Reliability is the extents to which a research instrument yields findings that are consistent each time it is administered to same subjects (Mugenda 2003).Internal consistency reliability is the most commonly used psychometric measure assessing survey instruments and scales (Zhang, 2000). Cronbach alpha is the basic formula for determining the reliability based on internal consistency (Kim & Cha, 2002). Reliability is increased by including many similar items on a measure, by testing a

# Data analysis and Presentations

Quantitative data was analyzed by employing descriptive statistics and inferential analysis using statistical package for social science (SPSS) version 21 and excel. This technique gives simple summaries about the sample data and present quantitative descriptions in a manageable form, (Orodho, 2003). Together with simple graphics analysis, descriptive statistics formed the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis to data. The findings were also presented using tables, charts and graphs for further analysis and to generated facilitate quantitative tabulations, percentages, and measure of central tendency. Descriptive statistics such as measures of central tendency and dispersion along with percentages were used to organize and summarize numerical data whose results were presented in tables, pie charts, column and bar graphs for easy interpretation of the findings

# comparison. reports

# This through

The study adopted the inferential statistical analysis. The tests of significance to be used are multiple regression analysis expected to yield the coefficient of determination (R2), t – tests, z – tests and p – values. The choice of these techniques was guided by the variables, sample

size and the research design and multiple regression model at 5% level of significance to establish the strength and direction of the relationship between the independent variables and the dependent variable. The employee performance was four independent variables. The equation was expressed as follows: Y= β0+ β1X1+β2X2+ β3X3+ β4X4+ ε, Where; Y= E(cid:373)plo(cid:455)ee perfor(cid:373)a(cid:374)(cid:272)e, β(cid:1004)= constant (coefficient of intercept); X1= Employee reprimand system; X2= Codes of conduct; X3= Employee disciplinary measures; X4= Employee rules and regulations; ε = error ter(cid:373); β(cid:1005)…β(cid:1008)= regression coefficient of four variables.

# Response rate

A total of 65 questionnaires were administered to the targeted respondents. Out of these, 38 respondents returned questionnaires giving a response rate of 58.46%.This response rate was considered credible enough to allow for generalization of the findings to the target population besides the arriving at the conclusions of the study, as this response rate was sufficient and representative and conforms to Mugenda & Mugenda (2003) with a stipulation that a response rate of 50% is adequate for analysis and reporting; a rate of 60% is good and a response rate of 70% and over is excellent. This implies that the response rate was considered to be good. The information is as shown in Table 4.1;

The study results corroborates with the findings of Whitford(2006) who indicated that no code, no matter how severely enforced will make truly bad people good. However, ethics codes can have a demonstrable impact on the behavior of

bad people in organizations. When everyone clearly knows the ethical standards of an organization they are more likely to recognize wrongdoing; and do something about it (Andrew, 2006). Second, miscreants are often hesitant to commit an unethical act if they believe that everyone else around them knows it is wrong. And, finally corrupt individuals believe that they are more likely to get caught in environments that emphasize ethical behavior thus the code of conduct can enhance employee perfomance in an organganization (Armstrong, 2011).

# Regression Analysis

The study adopted regression analysis so as to establish effects of independent variables and dependent variables. The study applied SPSS version 21 to code, enter and compute the measurements of the multiple regression.

According to Green & Salkind (2003) regression analysis is a statistics process of estimating the relationship between variables. Regression analysis helps in generating equation that describes the statistics relationship between one or more predictor variables and the response variable. The results are shown in Table 4.10;

It is notable that there extists strong positive relationship between the indepedent variables and depedent variable as shown by R value (0.786). The coefficient of determination (R2 ) explains the extent to which changes in the dependent variable can be explained by the change in the independent variables or the percentage of variation in the dependent variable (Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd ) that is explained by all four independent variables (Employee reprimand, Codes of conduct, Employee disciplinary procedures, Employee rules and regulations). According to the four independent variables studied, they accounted for only 61.80% of the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd Ta(cid:271)le (cid:1008).(cid:1005)(cid:1005): A(cid:374)al(cid:455)sis of Varia(cid:374)(cid:272)e

as represented by R2. This therefore means that other factors not studied in this research contribute 38.20% of the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. Therefore, a further study should be conducted to investigate the other factors influence the (38.20%) that Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. This implies that these variables of progressive discipline are very significant therefore need to be considered in any effort to the in enhance employee performance identifies organization. The study therefore variables as critical improving for employee perfomance. Analysis of Variance (ANOVA)

Predicted Employee performance at Mukurwe- ini Dairy Ltd = 34.555 + (0.506 x Employee Reprimand) + (0.603 x Codes of conduct) + (0.559 x Employee disciplinary procedures) + (0.622 x Employee rules and regulations). This is obtained from the Coefficients table, as shown in Table 4.12, from above regression equation; the study found out that when all independent variables (Employee reprimand, Codes of conduct, Employee disciplinary procedures, Employee rules and regulations) are kept constant at zero the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd will be at 34.555. At one percent change in Employee Reprimand will lead to (0.506%) variations in the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. Also a one percent change in codes of conduct will lead to the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. Further, a one percent change in Employee disciplinary procedures will lead to (0.559%) variations in the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd and one percent increase in Employee rules and Regulations will lead to (0.622%) variations in the Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd. This concludes that

To test for the statistical significance of each of the independent variables, it was necessary to test whether (or standardized) coefficients are equal to 0 (zero) in the population. If p< .05, we can conclude that the coefficients are statistically significantly different to 0 (zero). In general the multiple regression predicted Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd independent variables statistically significantly predicted Employee performance at Mukurwe-ini Dairy Ltd F(4,33 = 44.7098, p< .05, R2 = .583 and all four independent statistically significantly to the prediction p< .05. At 5% level of significance and 95% level of confidence Employee reprimand had a 0.004 level of significance; Codes of conduct showed a 0.001 level of significance, Employee disciplinary procedures showed a 0.003 level of significance and Employee rules and regulations had a 0.002 level of significance; hence the most significant factor was codes of conduct.
