Succession planning has been called “the last act of a great CEO.” That

act is inﬁnitely more complex if the CEO is also the owner and founder

of the company. When that’s the case, the decision about who will

own the business next is a profound one. It will reverberate for years,

aﬀecting not only the founder and the founder’s family but also all the

people whose lives are touched by the company, including employees,

customers, and the community. The choice can cement—or undo—a

# successful entrepreneur’s legacy.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Founder’s Final Act

Yet many founders make the decision very late in life—or not at all.

Some hold on to power until the very end, limiting their options. Or they

passively turn the business over to their children, leaving them to sort

out what to do with it. Many founders are so paralyzed that they simply

do nothing. But when a business is passed down to the next generation

without proper planning, it can lead to enormous tax consequences,

not to mention family tensions, managerial conﬂict, and instability that

could disrupt the business, forcing its sale or liquidation. The same

problems also confront companies run by founderlike leaders, such as

second-generation owners who’ve built a business into what it is today

(for example, Rupert Murdoch) or those who joined the ﬁrm early in its

existence and have become synonymous with it.

Addressing entrepreneurial succession is particularly relevant these

days, given the massive wave of ownership turnover currently hitting

## founder-led businesses—part of the “silver tsunami” of retirement.

More than half of all privately held businesses with employees in the

United States have owners over age 55, representing an estimated 2.9

## million businesses, 32.1 million employees, $1.3 trillion in payroll, and

$6.5 trillion in revenue. These ﬁgures may be even higher outside

the United States, where family-owned businesses make up a larger

portion of the economy. This is not just an issue faced by mom-and-

pop businesses. During the past two decades some of the world’s most

high-proﬁle companies have been founder-led, including private ﬁrms

## like Chick-ﬁl-A, Menards, Enterprise, and Love’s and public companies

like Meta and Nike. An entire generation of founders is now facing

the key question: Who will own my business after me? Despite the long-

## term consequences of this decision, up to 70% of family-business CEOs

across the globe have no succession plan, according to the 2019 STEP

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Founder’s Final Act

In this article we’ll oﬀer a clear explanation of the possible succession

choices for founders and outline the steps they should work through to

make the right calls. No single solution will be appropriate for them

all, so it’s crucial that founders go through the process of deﬁning

what success means to them, understanding and exploring the potential

pathways for achieving it, and then, ultimately, deciding on a plan. By

starting this journey early, founders can make the most of their ﬁnal act.

# The Challenge of Choice

It may seem obvious that founders who care deeply about their

businesses and everyone aﬀected by them should start the ownership-

transition process well before it’s necessary rather than leave so much

to chance. Beyond the problem that company owners are always busy, making transition plans can be diﬃcult for two main reasons.

First, very human emotions are triggered by the process. Letting go of

ownership means contemplating mortality. Planning a transition also

challenges a founder’s sense of identity. For people who have deﬁned

themselves as leaders of companies, letting go can be painful.

Second, ownership decisions have major consequences for families,

which have follow-on implications. A founder may want to pass the

company on to her children, but that can be more complicated than it

initially appears. For example, if one child is involved in the company

as the “heir apparent” CEO while the others are oﬀ pursuing their own

passions, how should that aﬀect the ownership decision? If the founder

chooses to give a greater share of the company to the future CEO, will

her other children think she has picked a favorite and resent her? If

she doesn’t give the obvious successor a larger share, will that person feel insuﬃciently rewarded? What if professional managers and other

employees are waiting around to see if they have a chance at ownership?

Will they leave after the choice is made?

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Founder’s Final Act

While we’re empathetic about the diﬃculties of deciding, we believe it’s

vital for founders to actively engage in succession planning. In our work

advising family businesses, we’ve found that the best outcomes come

from a structured, intentional approach that moves through four key

phases: Deﬁne your legacy, explore your options, experiment and learn,

and execute your plan.

# [ Step 1 ]

# Define Your Legacy

Start the ownership transition by thinking about what you value most

and how you want to prioritize the outcomes for ﬁve main categories of

## stakeholders: you, your family, your employees, your business partners

## (customers and suppliers), and society (both locally and globally).

Of course, ﬁguring that out isn’t necessarily straightforward. But by

identifying your speciﬁc goals for each group, you can begin to evaluate

# the trade-oﬀs of various paths forward.

Some goals are relatively complementary. For example, ensuring that

your employees have stable working conditions can also provide

beneﬁts to the community. Other goals are more zero-sum. You may

maximize your family’s long-term ﬁnancial security by selling the

business, but doing so may diminish your own stature as the business’s

founder. If you turn the business over to a charity, you can’t use the

funds from a sale to support your retirement. And selling the business to

your workers will limit your children’s ability to be involved in it.

To clarify your priorities, we suggest you work through the following

list of questions that we’ve developed in our work advising founder-led

businesses. We ﬁnd that it’s particularly helpful to ﬁrst identify what is

not essential for your legacy and cross out the outcomes that are not

important to you. Then you can take your reﬁned list and divide the

stakeholder outcomes into three categories: must have, nice to have,

# and less important.

- 1. What do I want for myself?

- To maximize my personal wealth

- To be recognized for my achievements

- To keep information about my business private

- To maintain control or inﬂuence over the future of the business

- To have an easy transition

- To be able to change the plan

- 2. What do I want for my family?

- To keep control of the business in my family’s hands

- To ensure wealth and ﬁnancial security across generations

- To enable my family or heirs to participate in and shape the business

- To treat my heirs equitably

- 3. What do I want for my employees?

- To ensure job security and continuity for them over the long term

- To transfer wealth and ﬁnancial beneﬁts to them

- To preserve the company’s culture and traditions

- To give loyal employees their chance to lead

- 4. What do I want for my business relationships?

- To maintain strong long-term relationships with key business partners

- 5. What do I want for the community and society?

- To ensure the continued presence of the business in the local

# community

- To contribute to the long-term economic, social, or cultural strength of

# the region

- To position the business as a lasting pillar of the community

- To give a large, onetime ﬁnancial windfall to a social or community

- To advance social causes through ongoing operations or continued

# ﬁnancial support

Owning a company allows you to deﬁne your legacy on your own terms,

but you need to be intentional when determining and prioritizing your

values so that you don’t drift away from them.

# [ Step 2 ]

# Explore Your Options

Once you’ve determined your goals, you need to decide whether the

best way to achieve them is by transferring the company to another

long-term owner or through a liquidation or sale. Although it may seem

counterintuitive, for some founders the company’s continued existence

will be an obstacle to realizing their legacy. They may lack conﬁdence

that the business can thrive without the speciﬁc skills they bring to it.

They may not want to burden their family with the demands of the

business. Perhaps they fear that without their guidance the business

will become something very diﬀerent that they wouldn’t want their

name associated with. If any of this is true for you, your objective should

probably be to shut the business down or liquidate it.

More frequently, though, founders instead see the business as a lever for

achieving goals that don’t depend on their continued connection to the

business. They may view the business as a source of value that can be

unlocked to fund their retirement, set up their family for the long term,

or support charitable causes. If you see your company this way, your

succession plan should be focused on how to maximize its sale value.

# The booming growth of the private equity

(PE) market has made selling to a PE ﬁrm a

common solution for those who want to

cash out. But you’ll need to understand

that the PE ﬁrm won’t be the ﬁnal owner of

the business. In order to return capital to

its investors, it will take the company

public or sell it to a strategic or ﬁnancial

investor. To maximize its return on

investment, a PE ﬁrm will often make

major changes to a company, including to

## its strategy and operations. Once founders

sell, they have little to no inﬂuence over those decisions or whose hands

the company ultimately ends up in. If your goal is to ﬁnd a long-term

owner for your company that will carry on its mission and operations,

we recommend looking for another option.

Finally, many founders see the continuation of their business as a

vehicle for accomplishing their legacy goals. They may consider their

companies to be monuments to their hard work or a means of creating

opportunity for future generations. They may see their ﬁrms as being

integral to the community, as critical sources of jobs, or as examples of

how to do business the right way. If you view your company as a vehicle,

your priority should be to ﬁnd a long-term owner for it.

For this group of founders, there are ﬁve primary options, listed here in

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Founder’s Final Act

## Pass the business down to family members. Many well-known

companies around the world—including Mars, Chanel, Enterprise,

and Aldi—are fully owned by the founder’s descendants. A family

succession is the default setting for many owners who want to see their

company continue beyond them or to provide for future generations.

Bequeathing a business, rather than the proceeds of a sale, can be a

way to address one major concern that we hear business founders voice, which is that wealth will infect their children with “aﬄuenza” and sap

their work ethic. Giving your heirs an operating company where the

value is invested in factories, salaries, and assets—rather than available

to spend—will make them rich on paper without giving them the liquid

funds that may create idleness. The main risk with this option is that

conﬂict among your successors can destroy both the company and

# family relationships.

Take the company public or sell an interest in it to investors. Reporting

requirements and corporate governance regulations ensure that there

is oversight of public companies’ performance. Public ownership also

helps businesses access the capital they need to keep growing and

allows them to incentivize employees with stock. On the ﬂip side,

public companies face pressure to focus on the short term and may

not continue the business’s mission if conditions change or the winds of

# public opinion shift.

Selling to private investors, such as a family oﬃce, is also an option.

But one danger to consider is that private investors’ interests may

diverge from the objectives of the founders, just as the interests of more-

# traditional PE ﬁrms could.

Turn ownership over to your employees. That may mean senior leaders

assume ownership, as typically happens in professional service ﬁrms.

Or it may be that a broader group, such as all the company’s employees,

does. John Spedan Lewis, son of the founder of the UK department store

John Lewis, established a trust for the beneﬁt of all current and future

employees and transitioned 100% of company ownership to it. As of

## 2024 the John Lewis Partnership—operating in the United Kingdom

## under the brands John Lewis and Waitrose—had more than 70,000

employee owners and over £12 billion in revenue. In the United States

there are nearly 11 million employee owners across more than 6,000

companies, according to joint research by the Aspen Institute and the

## Rutgers University Institute for the Study of Employee Ownership and

Proﬁt Sharing. The main reason to pursue employee ownership is that

the business can remain private and stay true to its purpose while

allowing the founder to share the value created with the staﬀ. There

can also be tax beneﬁts with certain types of structures. The main risks

are that the company will have to take on debt if it’s buying out the

founder’s shares, that it may face additional regulatory requirements,

and that tension could arise between employees who are looking to cash

out their shares at retirement and those who are investing for the future.

## Place ownership in the hands of the company’s customers. John Bogle

created Vanguard, a pioneer in the ﬁeld of passive investing, as a mutual

company owned by the individuals who invest in its funds. The outdoor

gear and clothing business REI is a consumer cooperative, owned by its

members. A large number of companies are also cooperatives, including

## one of the oldest companies in the United States, the Philadelphia

Contributionship, a home-insurance company that was founded by Ben

Franklin in 1752. Cooperatives and mutual companies (like State Farm

and Northwestern Mutual) can align the interests of the executives and

customers, allowing for a value-driven approach to decision-making.

However, the number of sectors where ownership by customers is

practical is relatively small. Businesses owned by customers can also

struggle to get capital and stagnate because of lower ﬁnancial pressure

to perform.

Donate ownership to charity. The founder of Rolex, Hans Wilsdorf, gave

all his shares to a foundation that owns 100% of the company. Each

year, the foundation distributes an estimated 300 million Swiss francs

(about $360 million) to charitable causes. Paul Newman donated 100%

of the company he’d founded, Newman’s Own, to a foundation that

supports children in need. While charitable ownership is challenging

in the United States, the “Newman’s Own exception” allows founders

to give an entire company to a charity. In other countries, company

ownership by charitable entities is much easier and more common.

Charitable ownership can create a permanent home for a business that

is driven by creating value for stakeholders rather than by maximizing

proﬁts. Proﬁts that aren’t reinvested can be directed to causes important

to the founder. Beyond the limited options available in the United

States, the main downside to this approach is that a charity may not

be motivated enough by ﬁnancial performance to provide eﬀective

## stewardship in a dynamic business environment.

Each of these choices has strengths and weaknesses. Some founders

will ﬁnd that none align perfectly with their desired legacy, so they’ll

need to tap a mixture of them. For example, 80% of Publix, a large

supermarket chain, is owned by its employees through an employee

stock ownership plan (ESOP) while about 20% remains in the hands

of the founder’s family. The Hershey Company is publicly traded, but

80% of its controlling interest is held by the Hershey Trust, which

was established by its founder, Milton Hershey, to support a school

he created. A controlling interest in Novo Nordisk, the publicly traded

maker of the blockbuster drugs Ozempic and Wegovy, is also held by a

# foundation.

Charitable ownership can create a permanent home for a business that is driven by creating value for stakeholders rather than by maximizing profits.

Yvon Chouinard, the founder of Patagonia—whose mission statement is

“We’re in business to save our home planet”—felt that Patagonia needed

to continue operating independently to demonstrate that companies

can be proﬁtable while protecting the environment and to model a

better way of doing business. Yet his greatest asset, the company

stock, wasn’t liquid, so it couldn’t easily be put to work. He seriously

considered selling Patagonia to another owner or taking it public with

a controlling-share class in order to cash out and use the proceeds

to ﬁght environmental crises. But as a letter he posted explains, he

decided against that path because “we couldn’t be sure a new owner

would maintain our values or keep our team of people around the world

employed.” As for the option of an IPO, he said, “even public companies

with good intentions are under too much pressure to create short-term

## gain at the expense of long-term vitality and responsibility.” And he

concluded early on that he didn’t want to burden his adult children with

owning the company, in part because they in turn didn’t want to burden

# their own children one day.

With those options eliminated, Chouinard needed to ﬁgure out how the

company could continue under the stewardship of owners who shared

his values. He ultimately chose to create a perpetual purpose trust

(PPT), a new business-ownership structure that’s growing in popularity.

It involves putting the voting shares of the company in a trust, which

in Patagonia’s case is overseen by the family with the sole objective of

ensuring that Patagonia continue its mission. The family transferred the

nonvoting shares to a 501(c)(4) nonproﬁt, which allows for donations to

charities and political causes but did not provide a tax deduction to the

family. Patagonia’s proﬁts, net of those held for reinvestment in growth,

will ﬂow from the foundation toward environmental causes.

# [ Step 3 ]

## Experiment, Learn, and Formulate Your Plan

After you’ve deﬁned what success will look like, you can test your

hypothesis about how a future ownership model will help you realize it.

There is no one-size-ﬁts-all solution. Two founders who want the same

kind of legacy could choose very diﬀerent models. Doug Tompkins, the

founder of the North Face, shared Chouinard’s desire to help save the

environment when he was exiting the apparel company Esprit, but he

chose to sell his shares of it to an investor group. That allowed him to

immediately put the full proceeds of the sale toward land conservation.

To this day much of the Patagonia region in South America is protected

# by Tompkins’s conservation easements.

## With a clearer vision of the potential ownership structures, you can

explore strategic options, assessing diﬀerent pathways against your

priorities. This phase is iterative: It can take years to fully investigate

viable options while ensuring the business remains strong. It entails

two distinct eﬀorts: ﬁrst, scenario testing, in which you analyze the

diﬀerent options’ potential to achieve the ﬁnancial, operational, and

ownership outcomes you desire; and second, a feasibility assessment,

in which you consider real-world constraints such as taxes, valuations,

deal structures, governance, and legal risks. The best-laid plans can be

derailed by external factors, so you must balance strategic ambition

# with the realities of execution.

builders in the United States, approached retirement, he began to step

back from the company in phases. First he handed over day-to-day

leadership to a team he had built while retaining a “kill switch”—the

ability to override major decisions he felt were counter to the company’s

essence. At the same time, Weekley began carefully studying other

family businesses, attending family-business conferences, and learning

what worked and what didn’t. He encountered transition models that

felt misaligned with his values—such as families that gave a single heir

full control of the business, leaving no role for the other children, or

that suﬀered from “dividend sprawl,” where dozens of passive owners

collected checks without contributing to the business. Instead, he made

a plan that would balance family involvement, employee ownership,

# and community impact.

For David Seaton, the founder of LiveOak, which runs residential

## communities for adults with cognitive disabilities in Texas, the process

of creating his succession plan solidiﬁed what he wanted his legacy to

be. “The more the attorneys I met with talked about how much money

I could make, the more progressively depressed I became with that

outcome because it just did not ﬁt my values and my goals,” he says.

“I was going to end up with a fat wallet and a broken heart.” Seaton

began exploring options that would ensure that his employees were

rewarded for their hard work and dedication to residents. He ended up

creating a trust that ensured the company’s proﬁts would always beneﬁt

# its employees.

# [ Step 4 ]

# Execute the Plan—and Adapt as Needed

At some point exploration must give way to decisions and action.

Diﬀerent transition paths demand diﬀerent timelines. For instance, it

can take founders 12 to 24 months to optimize performance, secure

advisers, and ﬁnd a buyer. And things don’t always work out: Less than

a third of small businesses ﬁnd a buyer, according to research from

Project Equity. Passing ownership on to heirs, employees, or charitable

trusts often takes even longer because of the need for estate and

# leadership-succession planning.

To ensure a smooth transition, you should draft a detailed plan that

## outlines key milestones, responsibilities, potential risks, and metrics

for tracking progress. A good plan will prevent critical elements from

slipping through the cracks and allow for necessary adjustments along

the way. Next set up regular checkpoints. Are your milestones being

met? Have external conditions changed? Is the company responding

well to leadership shifts? If the plan isn’t delivering the expected results,

## adjustments—whether in ownership structure, governance, or ﬁnancial

strategy—must be made before the actual transition of ownership.

Weekley eventually divided ownership into thirds: One-third went to

## employees, one-third to the community through a charitable trust

that he had set up, and one-third to his family, which retains voting control. He moved into a newly created “founder’s oﬃce” next door

to headquarters, and as of the writing of this article, he’s still easing

himself out of meetings. A decade into this process, how does he know

he’s made the right decision about the long-term fate of the company? “It’s reaﬃrmed on a daily basis,” he says. “We are not a sexy company,

but our purpose is ‘building dreams and enhancing lives’ for our team,

our customers, and our community. I think we’ve done just that.”

It’s never too early to start thinking about your legacy. Choices

about a founder’s ﬁnal act should be just as intentional as those

made during a company’s launch and growth phases. They should

be made strategically, with research and thought. By deﬁning success

early, exploring your options, learning and experimenting, and ﬁnally,

executing a plan with built-in ﬂexibility, you, as a founder, can be the
