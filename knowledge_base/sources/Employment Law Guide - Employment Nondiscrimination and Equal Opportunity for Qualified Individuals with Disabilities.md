Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended

# Who is Covered

Section 503 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973, as amended, 29 U.S.C. 793, ("Section 503") is administered by

the Oﬃce of Federal Contract Compliance Programs ("OFCCP"). Section 503 requires employers with Federal contracts or subcontracts that exceed $15,0001, and contracts or subcontracts for indeﬁnite quantities

# (unless the contracting agency has reason to believe that the cost in any one year will not exceed $15,000), to

# treat applicants and employees without discrimination on the basis of disability and take steps to hire, retain,

and promote qualiﬁed individuals with disabilities.

The following types of contracts and subcontracts are exempt from Section 503:

Those not exceeding $15,000;

Those for indeﬁnite quantities where the agency determines that the cost in any one year will not exceed

$15,000;

Those for work that is performed outside the U.S. and for which employment activity decisions were made outside the U.S.; and

Those with state or local governments, except for the speciﬁc government entity that participates in work

# on or under the contract.

The Director of OFCCP may grant a waiver from the requirements of Section 503 in the following

# circumstances:

For speciﬁc contracts, subcontracts, or purchase orders, if special circumstances in the national interest

require such an exemption, or for groups or categories of contracts where it is in the national interest; where

it is found impracticable to act upon each request individually; and where such waiver will substantially

contribute to convenience in administration of the act;

For facilities not connected to performance of the Federal contract, upon the written request of the contractor, if certain conditions listed in the regulations are met. This type of waiver will terminate, at the

very latest, two years after the date on which the waiver is granted, and earlier under certain speciﬁc

# circumstances; and

Contracts and subcontracts involving national security, if the head of the contracting agency determines

both that (1) the contract is essential to national security, and (2) noncompliance with a particular requirement of the regulations with respect to the process of awarding the contract is essential to national

# security.

Under Section 503 and its implementing regulations, an "individual with a disability" means a person who has a physical or mental impairment that substantially limits one or more major life activities, has a record of such

impairment, or is regarded as having such an impairment.

A "qualiﬁed individual" means a person who satisﬁes the job-related requirements of the employment position

he or she holds or is applying for, and who, with or without reasonable accommodation, can perform the

## essential job functions of that position.

Additional information on the deﬁnitions of "individual with a disability" and "qualiﬁed individual with a

disability" can be found in the regulations and in several of the Enforcement Guidance documents published

by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC), as these deﬁnitions are consistent with Title 1 of

the Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990 (ADA), as amended.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

Under Section 503 and its implementing regulations, covered employers with Federal contracts or subcontracts ("contractors") must not discriminate against applicants or employees on the basis of disability.

This obligation covers the full range of employment and personnel practices, such as recruitment, hiring, rates

of pay, upgrading, and selection for training. Covered employers must also take steps to employ and advance

in employment qualiﬁed individuals with disabilities. All covered contractors must also include the clause at 41

## CFR 60-741.5 in each of their nonexempt contracts and subcontracts.

Under the regulations implementing Section 503, certain contractors and subcontractors are required to have

a written program for employing and advancing in employment individuals with disabilities. Speciﬁcally, each

contractor or subcontractor that (1) has a Federal contract or subcontract of $50,000 or more and (2) 50 or

more employees must prepare, implement, and maintain a written program for each of its establishments. The

contractor must review and update the program annually and must make it available for inspection to any employee or applicant for employment, as well as to OFCCP.

Employees of and applicants for employment with a covered Federal contractor or subcontractor have the

right to ﬁle a complaint with OFCCP if they believe that a Federal contractor or subcontractor has

discriminated against them on the basis of a disability. Anyone may call OFCCP with a question about

interpreting the regulations, ﬁling a complaint, or any other related matter. Additional telephone numbers are located on OFCCP's Oﬃce Contact webpage.

# Complaints

By statute, Section 503 provides for a prompt investigation of employment discrimination complaints based

on disability status. See 29 U.S.C. Â§ 793(b). Employees and applicants of covered contractors, third parties, and authorized representatives (e.g., a family member, personal representative, or union representative) may

ﬁle a complaint on behalf of an individual or group. Complaints may be submitted via fax, mail, or online.

# Recordkeeping, Notices and Posters

Contractors are required to display the "Know Your Rights" poster. The poster must be displayed in

conspicuous places available to employees and applicants for employment such as the personnel oﬃce,

work-out facility, lunchroom, or company bulletin board. The contractor must ensure that applicants or

employees with disabilities are provided the notice in a form that is accessible and understandable to the individual applicant or employee (e.g., providing Braille or large print versions of the notice or posting a copy

of the notice at a lower height for easy viewing by a person using a wheelchair). With respect to employees

who do not work at a physical location of the contractor, a contractor will satisfy its posting obligations by

# posting such notices in an electronic format, provided that the contractor provides computers that can access

# the electronic posting to such employees, or the contractor has actual knowledge that such employees

otherwise are able to access the electronically posted notices.

The "Know Your Rights" poster is available in multiple languages. There is no requirement to display the

poster in languages other than English. There is no particular size requirement.

Contractors must also notify the representatives of each labor union with which the contractor has a collective

bargaining agreement of their Section 503 obligations.

Contractors that have the obligation to develop a written Section 503 program must post a notice at each establishment providing the location and hours it may be viewed. Additionally, the policy statement required

by the Section 503 regulations must be displayed on company bulletin boards, and made available in

accessible format, if necessary (e.g., providing Braille or large print versions of the notice, or posting a copy of

the notice at a lower height for easy viewing by a person using a wheelchair) so that applicants and employes

with disabilities are informed of the contents of the policy statement.

Personnel records. Federal contractors are required to maintain any personnel or employment records made

or kept by the contractor. Examples of records that must be maintained include:

## Job descriptions Job postings and advertisements

# Records of job oﬀers

# Applications and resumes

# Interview notes

## Tests and test results Written employment policies and procedures

# Personnel ﬁles

Federal contractors and subcontractors with fewer than 150 employees or a contract of less than $150,000

must keep records for one year from the date of the making of the personnel record or personnel action,

# whichever occurs later.

Federal contractors and subcontractors with 150 or more employees or who have a government contract of

$150,000 or more must keep employment records for two years from the date of the making of the personnel

## record or personnel action, whichever occurs later.

In addition, all contractors with a Federal contract or subcontract of $50,000 or more, and 50 or more

employees, must retain certain records related to outreach and recruitment, the utilization goals, and data analysis, for a period of three years from the date of the making of the record.

## There are no reporting requirements under Section 503.

Note that contractors may be asked to submit AAPs and other employment records to OFCCP if selected for

## a compliance evaluation or because of a complaint investigation.

# Penalties/Sanctions

OFCCP conducts compliance evaluations and complaint investigations assessing whether Federal

contractors and subcontractors are in compliance with Section 503. If a violation of Section 503 is found

during compliance evaluations or complaint investigations, OFCCP will ask the Federal contractor or subcontractor to enter into conciliation negotiations. If conciliation eﬀorts succeed, the contractor will enter

into a binding conciliation agreement with OFCCP that includes corrective actions the contractor will take and

may also include the submission of follow-up reports from the contractor, for a ﬁxed period of time, to assure

compliance. If conciliation eﬀorts fail, OFCCP may refer the matter to the Solicitor of Labor with a

recommendation for the institution of enforcement proceedings to enjoin the violations, to seek appropriate relief, and to impose appropriate sanctions, or any combination of these outcomes.

If OFCCP ﬁles an administrative complaint, the matter will be referred to an Administrative Law Judge ("ALJ"),

who hears the case and recommends a decision to the Department of Laborâ€™s Administrative Review Board (â€œBoardâ€). If the contractor, subcontractor, or OFCCP is dissatisﬁed with the ALJ's decision, they may appeal the decision to the Board. In both situations, the Board will then issue a ﬁnal agency decision. Thereafter, either party may ﬁle a petition with the Board for further review by the Secretary. If a majority of the

Board determines that the petition presents a question of law that is of exceptional importance and warrants

review by the Secretary, the Board will refer the case to the Secretary. Where the Secretary accepts review, the

Boardâ€™s decision does not become ﬁnal unless and until the Secretary completes the review. If the

Secretary does not accept review, the Boardâ€™s decision becomes ﬁnal. The Secretary may also exercise discretion to direct the Board to refer the case.

If the Board ﬁnds that a violation of Section 503 has occurred, it may order the contractor or subcontractor to

provide appropriate relief, which may include back pay and beneﬁts, and restoration of employment status, for

the victim(s) of discrimination. Depending on the circumstances, violations also may result in cancellation,

# suspension, or termination of contracts, withholding of progress payments, or debarment.

If the contractor or subcontractor is dissatisﬁed with the Board's decision, it may appeal that decision to the

# Federal district courts.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

Section 107(b) of the ADA required agencies with enforcement responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 (e.g., OFCCP) and under Title I of the ADA (i.e., the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission) to

develop procedural regulations to ensure that complaints ﬁled under these laws are addressed in a manner

# that avoids duplication of eﬀort and prevents application of inconsistent or conﬂicting standards for the same

# requirements under the two laws. These regulations are found at 41 CFR Part 60-742.

# Compliance Assistance Available
