It’s been nearly four years since we ﬁrst met Amir and Ria as they

were navigating the early months of Covid with two jobs and two young

# children at home.

Now, with both kids in school and sports, and with hybrid work setups

and increased work travel, Amir and Ria have been trying to establish

a routine that works. Despite their eﬀorts, they’ve been feeling like

they’re running into each week bracing themselves for dealing with the

inevitable moment something breaks or that they miss a key reminder,

# pickup, or plan.

They’re not alone. Amir and Ria are a composite of the thousand-plus

families I’ve worked with over the past ﬁve years as I’ve been building

Milo, an AI-powered tool to help them manage the invisible “logistics

load” — the behind-the-scenes work of running a family. That logistics

load has been growing heavier for working families: Kids today have a

high number of scheduled events — between school, extracurriculars

and social plans — while parents are juggling hybrid schedules and

work travel. Information and reminders feel like a ﬁrehose (Crazy sock

## day! Early dismissal! Swim registration!) in the age of instant emails

and messaging. At the same time, because more parents are working,

families have fewer safety nets when things go awry — a sick parent, a

meeting running late, a surprise homework assignment.

After working with families across the country, I’ve identiﬁed three

main culprits that drive the majority of the logistical challenges each

# week:

- The ﬁrehose of information, particularly from schools, plus the

## sheer number of scheduled commitments for each family member

increases the likelihood of unexpected conﬂicts or forgotten things

# each week.

- Decision fatigue. Families leave many small but important decisions

to the spur of the moment — what’s for dinner, who’s doing pick-up —

leading to cognitive fatigue and suboptimal decisions.

- Surprises. Inevitably each week something doesn’t go according to

plan and there has to be a scramble to ﬁx it: childcare falls through

or someone gets sick. Often there is a “default” parent who steps

in, driving frustration and tension when that choice is frequent and

assumed.

Over the years, we’ve tested many approaches to solving these three

challenges and the one that has unfailingly been the most successful,

(and the simplest!), is what I call a “Weekly Preview”: 20 minutes at the

start of each week, reviewing what’s ahead in the next seven days (for

our users in North America we call it the “Sunday Scan,” though the day

you choose to conduct your preview may diﬀer). By dedicating even just

this short amount of time to planning, you can avoid surprises, make

decisions more eﬀectively by batching them, and prepare agreed-upon

# backup plans.

# Prepare for your preview

Here’s how to set up your own weekly preview:

Commit to 20 minutes before the start of each week. Make a

commitment to do this with the other core decision maker(s) for your

child, if any (your partner or co-parent, for example). To make sure

you stay consistent, link this to something that you do each week, and

ideally make it something fun. Perhaps you and your partner do it after

the kids are in bed and have your weekly Netﬂix date after. Or you do it

before your Sunday workout. The key is consistency. If it’s easier, begin

by committing to just four weeks and see how it goes.

Choose your documentation approach. Here’s the template we use

with Milo families, but a simple email, a shared Apple Note, or a text

overview can work just as well. Whatever you choose, it should be in a

format that can be easily updated with inevitable mid-week changes.

Gather all of the information. To make this process really work, it’s

## critical make everything explicit and visible in one central place —

# especially events.

I strongly recommend a dedicated family calendar (ideally a digital one

like a Google Calendar). In the long run, it works better than sending

each other one-oﬀ invites from separate calendars, or, even worse,

having one person just hold all the events in their head. A dedicated

calendar tends to mean that more events and reminders will make it on,

which makes it easier to spot and plan around conﬂicts.

In the week leading up to your preview, both partners should add all

family-related commitments onto this calendar, whether it’s weekly

## soccer, a dentist appointment, a work dinner or weekly “bring library

books” reminder. Include work meetings that might run over and

impact evening plans. Enter any changes in availability from caregivers.

# Preview the week together

The night before your week begins, meet with your partner or other key

decision-maker and go over the coming days in the following steps.

- 1. What’s happening?

While ideally you’ll have entered all of the week’s events in your

calendar already, in reality, we’ve seen that that is rarely the case. So

spend the ﬁrst few minutes of your preview making sure that everything

important has made it from your personal calendars onto the shared

one. You can track events, reminders, and information as it pops up by

taking a picture or screenshot to include in your preview document.

Then go over those events together as follows.

Big rocks and top to-dos. Begin by identifying the family’s “big rocks”

for the week — the things that matter most, such as a family dinner, a

workout together, a library run, or this weekly preview. If it looks like

there isn’t time to make them happen, make adjustments to the time

you’re spending on the “pebbles” and “sand.” Use this process to also

prioritize the most important 3–5 to-dos for the week. List both on your

# preview document.

One-oﬀs. Then identify the one-oﬀs for the week. Regular, recurring

commitments such as school, sports, cleaners, and childcare are more

ﬁrmly embedded in our brains and need less attention. But what’s

diﬀerent tends to have a blast radius far beyond the actual time it takes

## up on the calendar and often impacts those regular events. List these

one-oﬀs in a separate section of your review or just circle them in red to

spotlight them (in our template they go in the Heads Up section).

Key reminders. Finally, write in any weekly reminders: Return library

books, bring an instrument, take extra diapers to daycare, and so on. Get

those in so you can run out the door conﬁdently each morning. (These

go in the Heads Up section too.)

- 2. What’s the plan?

Once you know what’s happening, make plans together for key logistical

## decisions such as childcare, pickup and dropoﬀ, and meals.

I used to resist doing meal planning because it felt like extra eﬀort.

But it turns out having to decide what you’re eating each day at 5 p.m.

leads to worse outcomes: more takeout (which means less healthy, more

## expensive food), more food waste, and an overall feeling of pressure and

daily decision fatigue. This applies to other top logistical decisions as

# well.

To avoid this, identify your top 2–3 key logistical decision-making areas

for the week. Then decide what the plan is and who is on for each. Even

if it seems obvious — if the after-school sitter is preparing a meal, or

you already have groceries, or a regular weekly pick-up plan — I strongly

recommend you still cover these because it’s when things are assumed

that issues crop up: “Oh, I thought you knew we had soccer and were

going to pick up dinner on the way home.”

Finally, ﬁnish up by looking at the top 3–5 to-dos that you identiﬁed and

decide who the owner will be for each and a quick plan and timeslot to

get it done.

- 3. What’s the back-up plan?

“No plan survives ﬁrst contact with the enemy,” as the saying goes. But

without a safety net, every change in the plan feels like a ﬁre. Worse, it

often falls to one “default parent” to change their plans to be on hand for

# the kids.

To avoid this, identify the trickiest moments in your week and set a

back-up plan. Decide who will be called in when. For example, say, “I

have a board meeting Wednesday, so I can be back-up Thursday and

Friday if you can take Monday through Wednesday.” Or, “Wednesday

looks really tricky. You’re away and I think I can handle it but if I get an

afternoon meeting added to my calendar I’m going to need to call my

dad in to help. Let’s let him know now.”

. . .

That’s it! Once you’ve completed your preview each week, share your

preview document with all key collaborators — all the people who will

be involved in helping to make this week go to plan. This includes local

grandparents, neighbors, step-parents and nannies. Whether you print

it out, email it, or share the digital doc, the key is to share the plan with

# anyone else in the mix.

The goal of this weekly preview is not to create an unnecessary

additional burden, but rather to create structure that in fact lightens
