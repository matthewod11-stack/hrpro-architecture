Quiet Quitting Is About Bad Bosses, Not Bad Employees Decades of research shows that workers are much more likely to go the extra mile when their managers invest in them. by Jack Zenger and Joseph Folkman

Every employee, every workday, makes a decision: Are they only willing

to do the minimum work necessary to keep their job? Or are they willing

to put more of their energy and eﬀort into their work?

In the last few weeks, many of those who choose the former have self-

identiﬁed as “quiet quitters.” They reject the idea that work should be a

central focus of their life. They resist the expectation of giving their all

or putting in extra hours. They say “no” to requests to go beyond what

they think should be expected of a person in their position.

In reality, quiet quitting is a new name for an old behavior. Our

researchers have been conducting 360-degree leadership assessments

for decades, and we’ve regularly asked people to rate whether their

“work environment is a place where people want to go the extra mile.”

To better understand the current phenomenon of quiet quitting, we

looked at our data to try to answer this question: What makes the

diﬀerence for those who view work as a day prison and others who feel

that it gives them meaning and purpose?

Our data indicates that quiet quitting is usually less about an

employee’s willingness to work harder and more creatively, and more

about a manager’s ability to build a relationship with their employees

where they are not counting the minutes until quitting time.

# What the Data Shows

We looked at data gathered since 2020 on 2,801 managers, who were

rated by 13,048 direct reports. On average, each manager was rated by

ﬁve direct reports, and we compared two data points:

- Employees’ ratings of their manager’s ability to “Balance getting

results with a concern for others’ needs”

- Employee’s ratings of the extent to which their “work environment is a

place where people want to go the extra mile”

The research term we give for those willing to give extra eﬀort is

“discretionary eﬀort.” Its eﬀect on organizations can be profound: If you

have 10 direct reports and they each give 10% additional eﬀort, the net

results of that additional eﬀort are increased productivity.

The graph below shows the results. We found that the least eﬀective

managers have three to four times as many people who fall in the

“quiet quitting” category compared to the most eﬀective leaders. These

managers had 14% of their direct reports quietly quitting, and only 20%

were willing to give extra eﬀort. But those who were rated the highest

at balancing results with relationships saw 62% of their direct reports

willing to give extra eﬀort, while only 3% were quietly quitting.

Many people, at some point in their career, have worked for a manager

that moved them toward quiet quitting. This comes from feeling

undervalued and unappreciated. It’s possible that the managers were

biased, or they engaged in behavior that was inappropriate. Employees’

lack of motivation was a reaction to the actions of the manager.

Most mid-career employees have also worked for a leader for whom they

had a strong desire to do everything possible to accomplish goals and

objectives. Occasionally working late or starting early was not resented

because this manager inspired them.

## What to Do If You Manage a “Quiet Quitter”

Suppose you have multiple employees who you believe to be quietly

quitting. In that case, an excellent question to ask yourself is: Is this a

problem with my direct reports, or is this a problem with me and my

# leadership abilities?

If you’re conﬁdent in your leadership abilities and only one of your

direct reports is unmotivated, that may not be your fault. As the above

chart shows, 3% or 4% of the best managers had direct reports who were

quietly quitting.

Either way, take a hard look at your approach toward getting results

with your team members. When asking your direct reports for increased

productivity, do you go out of your way to make sure that team members

feel valued? Open and honest dialogue with colleagues about the

expectations each party has of the other goes a long way.

The most important factor is trust. When we analyzed data from more

than 113,000 leaders to ﬁnd the top behavior that helps eﬀective leaders

## balance results with their concern for team members, the number

leader, they also assumed that the manager cared about them and was

concerned about their wellbeing.

Our research has linked trust to three behaviors. First, having positive

relationships with all of your direct reports. This means you look

forward to connecting and enjoy talking to them. Common interests

bind you together, while diﬀerences are stimulating. Some team

members make it easy to have a positive relationship. Others are more

challenging. This is often a result of diﬀerences (age, gender, ethnicity,

or political orientation). Look for and discover common ground with

these team members to build mutual trust.

The second element of trust is consistency. In addition to being totally

honest, leaders need to deliver on what they promise. Most leaders

believe they are more consistent than others perceive them.

The third element that builds trust is expertise. Do you know your

job well? Are you out of date on any aspects of your work? Do others

trust your opinions and your advice? Experts can bring clarity, a path

forward, and clear insight to build trust.

By building a trusting relationship with all of your direct reports,

the possibility of them quietly quitting dissipates signiﬁcantly. The

approach leaders took to drive for results from employees in the past

is not the same approach we use today. We are building safer, more

inclusive, and positive workplaces, and we must continue to do better.

It’s easy to place the blame for quiet quitting on lazy or unmotivated

workers, but instead, this research is telling us to look within and

recognize that individuals want to give their energy, creativity, time,

and enthusiasm to the organizations and leaders that deserve it.
