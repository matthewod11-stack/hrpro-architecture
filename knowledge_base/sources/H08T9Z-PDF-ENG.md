My client, Alex, never meant for his boss to see the email. It was a

## moment of frustration after a demoralizing team meeting in which his

ideas were dismissed, yet again. So he vented to a colleague, “I swear she

shoots down anything that doesn’t come from one of her ‘favorites.’” He

continued, “It’s exhausting trying to prove I belong.”

Then he hit send, only to realize moments later that he had accidentally

cc’d his boss! And it was too late to recall the message.

There was no immediate reply. No confrontation. But over the next

week, Alex was left out of a key client meeting. Then another. His

weekly 1:1 with his boss was abruptly canceled. When he did ﬁnally

speak with her, she was curt and made little eye contact.

Alex knew he’d crossed a line with carelessness and emotion. He had

undermined the trust between himself and his manager and had to

repair it. We worked on a plan, and he followed these steps to rebuild the

# relationship:

Reflect objectively before reacting.

Jumping into an apology or confrontation without clarity can make

things worse. It’s crucial to reﬂect for a moment on how the mistake

happened, what role your emotions played, and how your actions could

be perceived. Understanding the full picture is key before deciding your

# next step.

Ask yourself: Why was I so frustrated? What are the facts that led to the

mistake? What could I have done differently? Identify the exact behavior

that caused the tension in your mind and whether your boss would

# perceive it the same way.

Alex knew instantly he messed up. But instead of running to his boss’s

oﬃce to apologize, he took time to reﬂect on his behavior and the

emotions he felt about her, not just that he mistakenly sent the email.

He realized quickly that feeling dismissed in meetings triggered a

deeper emotional response from being undervalued in previous jobs,

and that reaction had fueled his impulsive email. That helped him

understand that his boss’s intent may not have been to dismiss him

but to move the meeting along in a timely fashion.

Have the conversation sooner rather than later.

When you’ve made a mistake with your boss, avoiding the conversation

in hopes that it will blow over rarely works. Silence becomes its own

message, often interpreted as avoidance, defensiveness, or a lack of

accountability. Add changed body language and skipped check-ins

and you have compounding quiet signals of discomfort, which creates

further emotional distance that will be harder to bridge later.

That’s why it’s critical to initiate the conversation within 24 to 48

hours of the misstep. This gives you time to reﬂect and ground yourself

emotionally, while also signaling maturity and urgency to resolve the

# issue head on.

Alex waited just over 24 hours before using simple language to request

a 1:1: “Do you have a few minutes? I’d like to touch base on something

# important.”

Alex knew he didn’t need to resolve everything right away, including his

perception of being dismissed. But quickly showing up signaled that he

was serious about taking responsibility for his actions. Waiting too long

risks making the issue bigger than it needs to be, or worse, gives the boss

time to form a ﬁxed impression you’ll later struggle to undo.

Own your part without over-explaining.

Taking accountability builds trust. Excuses or blame-shifting erode it.

Therefore, the goal is to authentically apologize—concisely and without

groveling, because leaders respect integrity, not insecurity.

Alex’s awareness of his emotional response helped him take

responsibility for his actions without it spiraling into justiﬁcation. He

didn’t try to downplay what he did or deﬂect the blame on his boss, even

though he was still frustrated. Instead, he kept it simple and focused

on the impact: “I want to acknowledge that my email was inappropriate

and unprofessional. I let my frustration get the better of me, and I own

that. I value our working relationship and I’m committed to working

with you to rebuild trust.”

That was it. Clear. Direct. No over-explaining, no “but I felt dismissed…”

detour. Framing the conversation as a collaboration, not a confession

helps avoid justiﬁcation of the behavior. Further, acknowledging the

impact, not just intention, will help your boss realize you’ve put thought

# into the conversation.

Propose a path forward.

Once Alex demonstrated accountability, he shifted the conversation

from the past to the future. A sincere apology shows remorse, but oﬀering a way forward demonstrates maturity, initiative, and emotional

intelligence. You’re not just saying “I messed up.” You’re saying “Here’s

how I want to do better.”

As the conversation progresses, propose a path forward with a starting

point for rebuilding trust and improving the relationship. Frame it as

an invitation to collaborate or receive input. For example, “Moving

forward, I’d like to be more mindful of how I communicate concerns

and bring them directly to you to ensure I’m contributing in a positive

way. I’m open to feedback. If there’s anything speciﬁc you’d like to see

from me, I’d appreciate the guidance.”

This approach keeps the door open for dialogue and collaboration. It

shows that you’re not just interested in damage control; you’re invested

in growth and learning from your mistake.

Actions rebuild credibility more than words. Be intentional about

means continually demonstrating emotional maturity without passive-

## aggressive behavior, gossip, or defensiveness.

Rebuild the relationship over time.

Trust isn’t restored in a single conversation. It’s rebuilt through

consistent, everyday behavior. After owning your mistake and

proposing a way forward, the real work begins: showing up with

## professionalism, follow-through, and emotional maturity day after day.

Be present and more attuned to your tone in meetings, show up

prepared, and stay steady under pressure. Small acts such as responding

promptly, supporting your boss’s priorities, and contributing solutions

will create a new narrative about you over time. Don’t force closeness

or expect instant warmth; focus instead on reliability and respect. Let

your actions quietly but clearly say: You can count on me. That’s how

reputations are repaired and relationships are renewed.

. . .

Alex has been slowly rebuilding trust with his boss over the past few

weeks. When she rejected another one of his ideas in a meeting, Alex

waited until their 1:1 to be curious and dive deeper into the reason

behind the rejection. Instead of reacting defensively, he listened. He

asked questions. He focused on the relationship, not just the outcome.

Repairing a rupture with your boss will happen quicker if you can show

that you’ve learned from it and demonstrate those learnings the next

time a situation arises. Alex showed emotional control, humility, and

the courage to keep showing up, even when the relationship still felt

tenuous. Everyone makes mistakes at work. What deﬁnes your career

isn’t the mistake itself. It’s how you respond, and how you rebuild.
