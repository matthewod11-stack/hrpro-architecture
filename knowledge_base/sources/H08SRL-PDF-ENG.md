Global business travel has always come with logistical challenges, but

today’s shifting political landscape is prompting many companies to

reassess when, where, and why they send U.S.-based employees abroad,

as well as how international employees enter and exit the U.S.

“Corporate travel managers have what’s known as a ‘duty of care

obligation’: a ﬁduciary responsibility to ensure their employees’

whereabouts, safety, and compliance with federal requirements,” says

Vik Krishnan, senior partner at McKinsey who advises companies in

the aviation and travel sectors. “No travel manager wants trouble for

any employee, so they set rules that account for the lowest common

denominator of risk.”

That’s much more complicated when baseline risks are elevated and

rules and requirements change by the day. President Trump’s new travel

ban is a prime example. As of June 9, citizens of 12 countries, including

Iran, Somalia, and Afghanistan, are banned from visiting the U.S., while

those from seven other nations are facing restrictions.

More changes could be in store, says Malcolm Goeschl, principal

attorney for Goeschl Law, a San Francisco-based ﬁrm that specializes

in business immigration advice. “It would not be surprising if new

travel bans are announced in the future that are broader in scope, that

is, applying to more nationalities or classes of individuals,” he says.

Indeed, as of this writing, reports suggest that the administration is now

considering banning as many as 36 additional countries, the majority of

which are in Africa.

As organizations navigate an increasingly unpredictable global

environment, experts recommend building a checklist that covers both

technical and people-related travel policies. Here’s how to get started.

Clarify which employees are working under temporary authorization

Getting a clear picture of your U.S.-based workforce—including

which employees are on sponsored visas or short-term work status

and monitoring any upcoming renewal deadlines—is a helpful

place to begin. “Most companies already track this information, so

considerations in this environment aren’t necessarily more onerous

than what’s already standard,” says Krishnan.

Goeschl also recommends advising foreign nationals on staﬀ who may

have status violations to speak with the company ahead of any travel.

Anyone who isn’t a U.S. citizen and has had legal issues, whether criminal like a D.U.I. or a non-criminal oﬀense, could have diﬃculty

coming in and out of the country. This could also apply to visa-holders

who’ve spoken out about political issues, either in the press, in social

media, or elsewhere, Goeschl adds. “Reach out to foreign nationals and

make sure they know what to expect, including their rights—or lack

# thereof—at ports of entry.”

Establish a framework for weighing the necessity of each trip

Krishnan recommends putting in place a process to evaluate travel

opportunities based on how essential the trip is and whether there are

other ways to meet the same need. In other words, he says: “Is this

trip customer-facing and critical to top-line growth—and is being there

in-person going to make the diﬀerence between winning a contract or losing it to a competitor?” Or could a Zoom meeting suﬃce?

Other factors come into play, like equity and fairness, Krishnan adds.

Consider two sales managers: one holds an American passport that

allows them to travel freely, while the other holds a passport from

another country that might not aﬀord the same privilege. “Are both

being given equal access to do their jobs and reach their potential?”

The solutions are not always straightforward, and leaders need to be

ﬂexible. Krishnan likens the situation to what happened during the

Covid-19 pandemic when some borders were open while others closed.

“Companies had to adapt: tweaking reward mechanisms, making one-

oﬀ adjustments, even redrawing territorial jurisdictions to ensure

employees had equal opportunity.”

Brief employees on entry requirements and provide guidance on potential challenges

If employees are visiting the U.S. for business, they’re required by law

to have proper documentation, which could include a visa or a valid

## Electronic System for Travel Authorization (ESTA), depending on the

# country of origin.

Border control agents have always had the authority to deny visitors

who didn’t have the required paperwork, and companies should prepare

employees for edge cases, such as the possibility of being turned away at

the border due to stricter enforcement, says Krishnan. “What used to be

seen as low-probability scenarios are now part of the planning process,”

he says. “Companies are taking an abundance of caution.”

Indeed, amid growing geopolitical tension, international travel can be

more complicated for some employees, Goeschl notes. For instance,

people from places with strained relations with the U.S. might encounter diﬃculties at the U.S. border. Even employees from visa-

waiver countries can run into trouble with U.S. immigration authorities,

he adds.

Goeschl advises developing guidelines to help employees know what

to expect when traveling, including any complications they might face,

even if the risk is low. Outline the company’s support structures, such

as legal resources and HR contacts to help employees if their status

is questioned or travel policies change. And oﬀer direction on how to

# prepare for border screening.

Some companies might be reluctant to share this kind of information,

worried about causing panic. But there are real risks—like employees

having their phones seized and inspected, Goeschl says. It’s important

to prepare, and bear in mind that the situation is evolving.

Devise contingency plans for policy shifts affecting travel

Many companies routinely bring in their top leaders from around the

world for internal meetings in the U.S. But if those employees suddenly

can’t get into the country, you’ll need a Plan B.

“Smaller meetings are easier to relocate, but certain meetings and

conferences—just based on the scale, the number of visitors, number

of hotel rooms needed, and logistics—are relatively hard to repot,” says

# Krishnan.

When travel is necessary, leaders can often ﬁnd ways to manage the

risk. Approaches vary, says Goeschl. Leaders might, for instance, route

employees through cities like Dublin, where they can go through U.S.

immigration before they board their ﬂight. That way, problems are

addressed on the front end, not after they’ve ﬂown halfway around the

world, says Goeschl.

The new travel ban adds to the complexity. The ban prohibits visitors

to the U.S. from Afghanistan, Myanmar, Chad, the Republic of Congo,

## Equatorial Guinea, Eritrea, Haiti, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and

Yemen. The order also puts heightened restrictions on visitors from

## Burundi, Cuba, Laos, Sierra Leone, Togo, Turkmenistan, and Venezuela.

The travel ban is narrower in scope than those attempted during

Trump’s ﬁrst term, Goeschl notes. It does not restrict people from those

countries who are green card holders, currently in the U.S., or already

have a valid visa to the U.S. Still, Goeschl says the new rule underscores

the importance of securing visas ahead of time for employees to reduce

the risk of being aﬀected by future bans. Goeschl says he’s also observed

more ESTA applications being denied or delayed, so he recommends

submitting them well in advance, too.

## Balance cautious awareness with practical decision-making

Organizations need to be pragmatic and aware that some staﬀ could

face issues at U.S. borders, like being detained or turned away. But

experts also stress the importance of staying calm. “On an individual

risk-adjusted basis, most travelers face minimal risk,” Krishnan says.

And being overly conservative isn’t always the best approach. “That’s

kind of like a doctor telling you not to leave the house without a hazmat

suit and a mask and goggles during ﬂu season,” Goeschl says. “It’s

important for leaders not to be too paranoid, because that could impact

their ability to do business.”

Goeschl recommends planning thoughtfully without letting fear take

over. Your goal as a leader is to ﬁnd the sweet spot between caution and

# practical decision-making.
