Sex-based harassment is pervasive in the workplace, and it’s

disproportionately experienced by women. It can include sexual

harassment but is more broadly deﬁned, including any behavior that

derogates, demeans, or otherwise humiliates someone on the basis of

their sex. One study of women in the military and law found that nine

out of 10 had experienced gender-based harassment in their careers.

Most victims stay silent about their experiences. Studies suggest that

victims stay silent because they fear consequences at work or feel that

nothing will happen as a result of speaking up. What has been studied

less is how this silencing occurs.

In 2016 we set out to learn about how female victims are silenced —

who inﬂuences them and what exactly happens when they try to speak

up. We interviewed 31 early and mid-career academics employed in

## business schools at nine research-intensive universities in the UK.

We asked women whether they or others they knew had experienced

insulting, hostile, and degrading attitudes that made them feel bullied,

excluded, or both due to their gender. We encouraged them to describe

events as vividly as possible and to reﬂect on how they and others they

knew felt at each moment.

Our interviewees described a plethora of incidents that they or others

they knew had experienced, including sexist remarks, harassment

during pregnancy and after giving birth, gender-based bullying, and

sexually motivated advances. We asked them whether they stayed silent

# about their experiences.

Contrary to what we expected, all of our interviewees told us they

shared their experiences with line managers, HR personnel, and

professional colleagues to make sense of and seek redress for what

happened. Then they described how they were ultimately persuaded

to move on and stop raising the issue.

We noted three barriers that victims encountered when they started to

speak about experiences of sex-based harassment: First, they were told

they had to prove that their experience was uncommon and signiﬁcant;

second, they were expected to “trust the system” to resolve their

issues; and third, they faced severe consequences, such as a damaged

reputation, when they challenged the system.

## Proving an Experience to Be Rare and Signiﬁcant

Victims were often told that their experiences didn’t amount to

harassment — that they were common and insigniﬁcant — and

that if they wanted to ﬁle a formal complaint, they’d need to show

otherwise. One assistant professor we talked to, Alaina, explained how

her line manager responded to her complaint about a senior colleague’s

# unwanted advances:

He was super nice in the beginning, but then he always wanted to

do work in the evening over a drink. I was ﬁne with this, but he

kept complimenting me about the way I look, which made me quite

uncomfortable. People were looking at us as if we were a couple. He

was not bothered by it — it was good for his ego, a young woman

on the side. My head of department was the only person I trusted,

so I told him. He listened very carefully and laughed it off, saying

that these kinds of things happen all the time, I shouldn’t take it so

seriously. After all, this person has not forced himself onto me, and I

agreed to go to all the places he invited me to. And so on. I ended up

feeling embarrassed… He is the head of department; he should know

what he is talking about, I guess. I don’t know what to do.

By suggesting that Alaina’s experience wasn’t serious, her manager

positioned her as an individual who had misinterpreted her

circumstances. He also hinted that she may have “encouraged” her

perpetrator because she had agreed to meet him in various places,

making her feel partially responsible for her fate and invalidating the

# importance of her claim.

As a result, Alaina felt deeply embarrassed. While she did not

completely buy her manager’s verdict, his seniority in the organization

somewhat legitimized his opinion — she felt that she had no case to

challenge the system. Alaina reluctantly chose to stay silent.

# Trusting the System to Resolve Issues

When women complained to HR, they were often urged to be

patient and allow the issue to be quietly resolved. Senior researcher

Neev explained what happened when she complained about a senior

colleague who harassed her:

I wasn’t included in many things — there were several areas of

work that I was stronger in than all of my group members, but I

wasn’t asked to be involved. It was clearly a boys’ club. I felt that I

was treated differently to everyone else in our group, and there was

aggression too when I tried to complain about things. I couldn’t take

it anymore, so I went to HR. They told me to calm down and said that

they will look into things. They came back to me almost immediately

and said that people speak very highly about this person. But then

they were sympathetic about how I felt, they had talked to this

manager, and they were very willing to help me to better integrate

into my team. And that was it.

In their view my problem was solved, and they hinted that I

should not talk about these things to anyone because these are

very conﬁdential issues. They made me feel like an overly dramatic

person and they then offered to help me to deal with my issues. That

manager is now nice to me — but it is patronizing; it does not change

what he did. I guess they would have to talk with him. I think I

deserve some justice for what I went through. But after my experience

with HR, I am confused. I feel that I have a point which has not been

recognized, but they seem to think it has been solved. I feel really low

and I don’t talk to anyone in the organization much unless I really

have to.

The HR oﬃcers attempted to “solve” Neev’s issue by asking her

perpetrator to be nice to her. As far as they were concerned, Neev was oﬀered support and her issue was solved. But Neev felt extremely

patronized and embarrassed for being seen as a “melodramatic”

individual. She believed that she still wasn’t being treated fairly, and

HR’s interest in archiving her complaint left her confused.

## Suffering Consequences After Challenging the System

The women we talked to were also advised by well-meaning colleagues

to not voice their discontent, because of career repercussions and social

isolation that might ensue. Abbey told us how many people cautioned

her against complaining about a senior colleague who harassed her:

He made my life miserable during maternity leave, hinting that I

strategically chose to have children during the grant. But my team

members were like, “Even if you leave the organization, getting the

wrong person on your bad side can effectively ruin your career,

especially if it’s someone in your area. So just keep quiet. You don’t

want to be known as a parasite.” Of course I don’t want to be known

as a parasite. So I am scared to open my mouth, to be honest,

although I really want to.

Abbey’s maternity leave was not respected, but her close colleagues

insisted that she should not raise the issue any further, because bringing it up would position her as a “troublemaker” and negatively aﬀect her

career. This instilled a sense of fear that led Abbey to stay silent.

# Ending Complicity with Harassment

Based on our ﬁndings, we argue that sex-based harassment isn’t just a

result of one individual’s actions: It’s accomplished by the complicity

of various third-party actors. Each of these cases shows how managers,

HR, and colleagues can be complicit in silencing people who experience

harassment, encouraging them to trust the system and urging them to

keep these experiences to themselves.

This complicity not only provided a safe haven for perpetrators to

operate, as they were spared punishment, but also made victims feel

confused, unsupported, and, ultimately, compelled to acquiescence. As

victims felt demoralized, they disengaged from work and from the social

fabric of the workplace, behavior that is known to hurt productivity,

# organizational commitment, and proﬁt.

We oﬀer a few recommendations for organizations and employees. First,

it is important to legitimize complaints about sex-based harassment.

Managers should proactively let people know that they can complain,

and companies should introduce policies that protect employees who

speak up.

Second, it is important not only to have channels for people to

report harassment but also to have a policy that clearly deﬁnes what

constitutes sex-based harassment, outlines the procedure for dealing

with reported cases, and establishes mechanisms to support people

## through the grievance process and afterward.

Third, it is crucial to ensure that victims feel heard, their concerns

are validated, and their complaints are taken seriously. They should

be ensured action will be taken to hold culprits accountable and

to prevent such cases from happening again. If people believe that injustice is covered up by the organization, this can negatively aﬀect

# their commitment and motivation.

Finally, employees should reﬂect on how they respond to colleagues’

concerns. Their actions have repercussions. By encouraging individuals

to remain silent, they contribute to creating a culture of harassment.
