In navigating today’s turbulent business environment, open and

collaborative relationships are increasingly essential. This is a point

recognized by many executives and endorsed by more than 80% of

contract negotiators. Yet our recent global study reveals a startling

truth: most companies remain stuck in an outdated, adversarial

approach to deal-making. This conﬂict-oriented mindset not only

hampers innovation and growth but also leaves signiﬁcant value on the

# table.

So, why are we stuck and how do we make the shift?

Businesses must fundamentally reimagine their approach to contract

negotiation, moving from a mindset of conﬂict prevention to one of

collaborative value creation. This shift isn’t about being “nicer” in

negotiations; it’s about unlocking hidden potential, driving innovation,

and creating sustainable, mutually beneﬁcial relationships. And part of

that is getting better at selecting partners we trust.

Our comprehensive study of the most-negotiated terms, surveying

937 organizations worldwide, and representing both multinational

corporations and small-to-medium enterprises (SMEs), paints a clear

## picture of the current state of contract negotiations:

- Misaligned priorities: The top ﬁve most negotiated terms (limitation

## of liability, price changes, indemniﬁcation, termination, and payment

options) focus primarily on risk mitigation and worst-case scenarios.

The primary message they send is: “I don’t trust you.”

- Disconnect between negotiation and reality: While companies

spend considerable time haggling over legal protections and penalties,

## the most common sources of disagreement during contract execution

are practical issues like pricing, scope, and delivery.

- Power imbalances: Negotiations are driven by power. Fifty-seven

percent of negotiators say they regularly encounter situations where

the counter party is a non-negotiator, aiming only to impose their

template terms, regardless of suitability. The power imbalance is

## particularly acute in large-small business relationships, where 88% of

SMEs report facing inﬂexibility from larger partners, and only 34% of

large ﬁrms recognize SMEs’ strategic importance. This dynamic isn’t

just ostensibly unfair; it’s increasingly unsustainable in an economy

## where agility and innovation drive competitive advantage.

- Missed opportunities: This failure to engage on “the things that

matter” means that important conversations are missed. Only 16%

of negotiators believe that they focus on the right topics, and only

39% believe that their contracts contribute to successful business

# outcomes.

- Misunderstanding of risk: The legal/ﬁnancial stranglehold over

contracting continues to prioritize mitigation (the false assumption

that risk can be controlled with contractual terms) over meaningful

risk management (a broader approach of understanding, monitoring,

and actively addressing risks throughout the relationship).

This adversarial approach to negotiation comes at a signiﬁcant cost:

- Wasted resources: Companies spend inordinate amounts of time and

money negotiating terms that rarely come into play, neglecting the

## operational details that truly drive success and inﬂuence cost and

# value.

- Stiﬂed innovation: When negotiations focus on risk mitigation and

the imposition of standards, they leave little room for exploring

## creative solutions or novel partnership structures.

- Damaged relationships: The entire approach to bidding and

negotiation typically generates an atmosphere of competition rather

than cooperation. It’s an environment where transparency and

openness are notable by their absence — and where contracts are

divisive, rather than unifying.

- Missed value: By focusing on protecting their own interests,

organizations often overlook opportunities for mutual gain and value

# creation.

## A New Framework for Collaborative Contracting

These ﬁndings reveal the importance of new thinking in business

## contracting and an escape from the “mitigation mindset.” Our research

identiﬁes three interconnected strategies that characterize successful

# collaborative contracting:

Leading organizations are shifting from risk transfer to value creation.

This means focusing on terms that directly impact operational

success and creating integrated negotiation teams that bring together

## commercial, legal, and operational perspectives.

Success requires aligning negotiation priorities with operational realities.

Organizations achieving this alignment prioritize practical terms that

impact day-to-day operations and create frameworks for handling

scope changes and delivery challenges. Those making this shift report

## signiﬁcantly fewer disputes and stronger partnerships.

Modern contracts need structured ﬂexibility.

Rather than trying to predict every contingency, successful

organizations are building in mechanisms for collaborative adjustment

and establishing governance frameworks that enable rather than

restrict. This approach isn’t about leaving terms vague — it’s about

creating clear paths for evolution.

Our research shows that 72% of respondents believe simpler contracts

improve understanding and reduce negotiation time, while also making

negotiations more accessible for smaller partners. This isn’t just theory

— one business services company in our study increased contract

acceptance rates from 10% to 70% through targeted simpliﬁcation

eﬀorts, while another reduced negotiation time by 68% by adopting

# market norms in their standard terms.

These results demonstrate how simpliﬁcation can transform business relationships while simultaneously improving eﬃciency. The approach

moves beyond making contracts easier to read to becoming a strategic

tool for creating more equitable and eﬀective business partnerships.

# Making Collaborative Contracting Work

The transition to collaborative contracting requires systematic change

across multiple dimensions. Our research identiﬁes ﬁve critical

implementation elements that distinguish successful transformations:

# Executive leadership as the catalyst.

Leadership commitment must go beyond verbal support to active

championing of new approaches. This means executives need to visibly

prioritize practical terms over risk mitigation in their own deal reviews.

Leaders must actively challenge the traditional focus on liability and

indemniﬁcation terms, redirecting attention to operational success

factors. They must become clear about their approach to risk and

set internal measurements accordingly, freeing their negotiators to act

# diﬀerently.

# Process integration and planning.

Successful organizations establish structured approaches to bringing

stakeholders together early. Our research reveals that fragmented

processes are a key barrier to eﬀective negotiations. Rather than

having legal teams focus on protecting against risks while commercial

teams concentrate on practical terms, leading organizations create

integrated teams that develop a common deﬁnition of success. This

integrated planning should involve commercial, legal, and operational

stakeholders from the outset, ensuring that key business terms like

scope, delivery, and service levels are prioritized alongside necessary

# protections.

# Capability development.

The capability gap in negotiations is particularly pronounced in

## relationships between large and small organizations. Progressive

companies of all sizes are implementing comprehensive support

systems for understanding and evaluating key terms, establishing

market norms, and developing eﬀective planning techniques.

# Technology and process enablement.

Rather than using technology merely for contract storage and

basic workﬂow, leading organizations are leveraging it to transform

their negotiation approach. Our research reveals opportunities to

use technology, such as generative AI, for negotiation planning,

## identiﬁcation of market norms, analysis of term eﬀectiveness, and

## support for simpliﬁed contract creation and management. The data

shows that organizations systematically implementing technology

enablement achieve signiﬁcantly better outcomes than those taking a

# piecemeal approach.

# Critical success factors.

Success in this transformation requires clear metrics that measure both eﬃciency and relationship quality. Organizations must regularly review

and adjust negotiation practices based on actual dispute patterns,

while maintaining ongoing investment in capability development

across all stakeholder groups. Active executive sponsorship and

monitoring of implementation progress remains crucial throughout the

# transformation journey.

# A Call for Change

The evidence is clear: traditional approaches to contract negotiation,

heavily focused on risk mitigation, are increasingly misaligned

with business needs. Our study shows that while companies spend

considerable time haggling over legal protections, the most common

sources of disagreement during contract execution are practical issues

# like pricing, scope, and delivery.

The path forward requires a fundamental shift in how we approach

negotiations. This isn’t about abandoning risk management — it’s

about recognizing that the best risk management strategy is often

creating clear, practical agreements focused on mutual success.

Organizations that make this shift are seeing tangible beneﬁts: faster

## negotiations, better acceptance rates, and most importantly, more

successful business relationships. By reimagining contract negotiation

## as an opportunity for collaborative value creation, companies can

unlock new sources of growth, foster innovation, and build the kind of

resilient, adaptive partnerships needed to thrive in an uncertain future.

The question is no longer “How can we win this negotiation?” but rather

“How can we use this negotiation to create lasting value for all parties

involved?”
