Speed has a bad reputation in business, much of it deserved.

Discussions of quality problems at Boeing or the collapse of FTX or even

Quibi’s dramatic ﬂameout often zero in on speed: Things were moving

too fast for anyone to see the obvious ﬂaws in leadership or culture or

# business model.

We fear speed’s standing has gotten worse over the last few weeks,

as parts of the U.S. government have been dismantled at a dizzying

## pace, without much visible concern for the strategic price or collateral

damage of the campaign to slash federal spending.

The assumption embedded in this style of operating—encapsulated by

Silicon Valley’s famous “move fast and break things” ethos—is that we

can either make progress or take care of people, one or the other. A

certain amount of wreckage is the price we have to pay for creating the

# future.

We’ve spent the last decade helping business leaders clean up that

wreckage, and one of the main lessons from our work is that this

tradeoﬀ is false. The most successful change leaders we know solve

problems at an accelerated pace while also taking responsibility for the

## success and wellbeing of their customers, shareholders, and employees:

They move fast and ﬁx things.

Consider some of the most prominent corporate turnaround leaders of

the last 20 years, from Alan Mulally at Ford to Indra Nooyi at Pepsi

to Satya Nadella at Microsoft. They all jumpstarted stale organizations

with a sense of urgency and remade them into sharper, faster, more

strategic organizations. They let go of people and programs as they went —eﬃciency was a priority for them all—but they did so carefully and

towards the explicit goal of building more competitive companies.

Our advice to leaders tackling big problems in both the public and

private sector is not to slow down, but it is to take a breath and take

a few mission-critical steps before sprinting. In our work, we call it

earning the right to run. This means:

- 1. Make sure you’re solving the right problems.

Too often, we’ve seen change leaders attack the symptoms of problems

and not their root cause, losing precious time and gaining little traction.

We worked with one leadership team at an early-stage tech startup

that was convinced they had a culture problem embodied by a “clash

of generations” between older and younger employees. In fact, they

had a strategy problem: The company’s unwillingness to focus had

driven employees to take refuge with other like-minded employees. By

the time the team called us, they had been trying to solve the wrong

# problem for months.

The risk of superﬁcial analysis is even higher when we’re in what

conﬂict researcher Amanda Ripley calls a state of “high conﬂict,” an

emotional position that leads us to miss important signals and turn

our opponents into two-dimensional enemies. This pattern had begun

to show up in the interpersonal dynamics at the young tech company,

as Gen X and Gen Z faced oﬀ against each other. And it seems to be

happening in our polarized political environment, for example, in the

## characterization of laid-oﬀ federal employees as members of a nefarious

# deep state.

Distorting other people is a common response to conﬂict, but it also

makes leadership harder by severing your links to reality. As you turn

other people into caricatures, you risk becoming one yourself.

The way out of this muddled mental posture is a mix of humility and

curiosity. Don’t assume your take is necessarily right, particularly if

you’re surrounded by people with strong incentives to agree with you.

Toyota’s famous “Five Whys” practice codiﬁes a way to expose the true

origins of a problem faster. This approach, among other things, enabled

them to build one of the most eﬀective operating systems in the world.

- 2. Build more trust as you go.

Trust in leadership is a byproduct of logic, authenticity, and empathy,

a pattern that goes all the way back to Aristotle’s observation that

persuasion requires a combination of logos, pathos, and ethos.

Our take on the American people’s trust in the current government eﬃciency campaign is that it gets high marks for authenticity (we

believe we’re seeing the real Elon Musk in action), the beneﬁt of

the doubt on the logic of the cuts (reducing government waste is a

reasonable goal), but decidedly low marks for empathy. As Rep. Rich

McCormick (R-Ga.) told CNN’s Manu Raju, the GOP should do a better

job of showing “compassion.” Compassion is also a core American value.

We see ourselves as decent people and want our leaders to embody that

# decency.

Our work suggests that low empathy is a big deal, as people don’t trust

leaders who seem to be primarily in it for themselves. When we worked

with Uber’s senior team to rebuild trust after its own crisis in leadership,

the company quickly made it clear to drivers, riders, and regulators

that it also cared about their interests—not just the enrichment of their

# shareholders.

This is a “show don’t tell” challenge. For example, Uber’s leaders

showed drivers they cared about their experience by responding to

their demands for in-app tipping functionality. They showed riders that

they were listening to their concerns by adding safety features to the

rideshare experience. These eﬀorts helped to rebuild the foundation

of stakeholder trust that has enabled the company’s successful run in

# recent years.

- 3. Involve people you don’t know—and who know more than you do.

Decision quality rises when the stakeholders who are most impacted

by those decisions—often the same people who know the most about a

problem—are at the decision-making table. For example, social media

platforms often miss the mark on child safety, we argue, because

parents are underrepresented in their workforces.

In our work we push leaders to constantly “make new friends” and break

their pattern of overreliance on familiar networks to solve problems.

The colleagues who make us comfortable don’t necessarily make us

# better.

Musk is at risk of making this classic mistake, relying too heavily on a

small group of technologists who are similar to him in terms of skillset

and ideological worldview. This group appears to have little experience

## with the federal government or with most of the problems government

is trying to solve.

We’re encouraged that the challenge of reducing staﬀ now seems to

be shifting to agency heads, who presumably know more about the

agencies they’re charged with shrinking—or have access to teams who

do. Our advice is to incorporate much more of this kind of domain

expertise at a much faster pace. Find the people who believe in your eﬃciency goals but also know how to make your organization work.

- 4. Tell a better story.

Storytelling is an essential part of change leadership, and getting it right

has been a critical part of every successful transformation we know.

When Alan Mulally turned around Ford, he talked incessantly about

his “One Ford” plan. He started every meeting by reviewing it, and he

distributed it on wallet-sized cards to every employee. That’s the type

of message discipline you need for people to truly understand where

you’re leading them.

When it comes to the current eﬃciency eﬀorts in Washington, the

American people need to understand the payoﬀ of all this change

and uncertainty. What Americans want most is a government that’s

responsive and competent, not one with diminished problem-solving

# capacity.

JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon recently oﬀered a narrative more aligned with these goals in an interview with CNBC. The eﬃciency eﬀort “needs

to be done,” he said, adding it also needs to be reframed so it’s “not just

about the deﬁcit. It’s about building the right policies, procedures, and

the government we deserve.”

As Dimon suggests, the answer may be to make a persuasive case

that government gets better, not just smaller, on the other side of the

disruption. But this story has to be told credibly—and retold—for people

to believe it.

. . .

The Navy SEALs have a famous adage that “slow is smooth, and

smooth is fast.” We interpret this to mean, among other things, that

while reducing friction can take some extra time in the near term,

investments in good process ultimately yield a faster pace.

None of the steps on this list need to take a long time. Think weeks

not months. And in the long run, these eﬀorts increase speed and

decrease cost by reducing friction and the likelihood of rework, a word

that understates the stakes in the case of the U.S. government, charged

with such sober responsibilities as managing global health threats

and ensuring consumer safety. “Rework,” in many scenarios, will be

measured in lives irreparably harmed—or even lost.

Speed is not the problem here. Speed releases the energy in an

organization. It makes it clear to everyone that you take the problems

you’re solving seriously. Speed is an essential change leadership

variable in any successful change campaign. Just ask Alan, Indra, and
