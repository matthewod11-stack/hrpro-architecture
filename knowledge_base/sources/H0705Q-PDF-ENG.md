We all want to believe that we see the world as it is. But as many

behavioral psychologists have demonstrated, we actually see the world

through a dirty windshield of bias, assumption, and judgment. So,

how can we tease out and identify the mental mistakes that cloud our

windshield and impede clear thinking? And once we identify our biases,

how can we control for and counter them to make better decisions?

## HBR / Digital Article / Make Better Decisions by Challenging Your Expectations

One of the best ways to thwart bias is to confront our underlying

expectations, namely the assumptions and judgements that undergird

# our decision-making process.

Expectations aren’t passive actors. They have a momentum of their own

because they lead us to act on assumptions that may or may not be

true. Without examining our expectations, we won’t know what kind of

momentum we’re generating. Are we opening ourselves up to inquiry

and connection with others? Or are we shutting down pathways and

## opportunities for inclusion and more holistic problem-solving?

Expectations can inform — even dictate — our decision-making process

because even when we’re looking forward, our thinking is shaped by our

past actions and perception of past outcomes. We often don’t recognize

that we’ve set expectations because we jump into the decision-making

process without making the implicit explicit.

# The BIAS Framework

So how do we understand and account for our expectations? I’ve

created a framework that asks you to consider your decisions from four

## vantage points: your behavior, your information, your analysis, and the

structure, or environment around you as you make your decision. I call

this the BIAS framework, taking the the ﬁrst letter of each vantage point.

The goal is to use a structured approach to keep your mind open, further

## your analysis, and prevent paralysis, because the best decisions, even if

shaped in part by instinct, are better for being the product of a process

# of thinking, not just a thought.

To illustrate how to use the BIAS framework, I want to introduce Bill,

the middle-aged son of aging parents. Bill’s parents wanted to move out

of the multi-story home where they had raised their family. They came

to Bill to help them with this high-stakes decision. Together they would

decide where Bill’s parents would go next. All three assumed the move

would be diﬃcult both emotionally and physically. They believed that a single move to an eldercare facility that oﬀered a continuum of care

would be easiest. But was that really the best option?

# Behavior

The ﬁrst step in challenging expectations is to confront your

## assumptions about your own behavior, as well as the behavior of anyone

else involved in your decision-making.

Bill had never had to help his parents with a decision of this magnitude.

He was ﬂattered that they had asked him but having tangled with them

on other high-stakes decisions, he was eager to be supportive. Bill also

recognized his discomfort with diﬃcult, emotional conversations. So,

when his parents focused their search only on eldercare facilities that oﬀered a continuum of care because they didn’t want to face multiple

future moves, Bill happily joined them. He assumed they would reject

# any option other than a single move.

In examining his behavior, Bill recognized that his acquiescence with

his parents’ focus on eldercare facilities was partly driven by his desire

to avoid diﬃcult conversations. Bill identiﬁed an anchoring and a

framing bias in his behavior that could lead him — and his parents —

astray. The decision they needed to make was not about simplifying the

moving process; it needed to be about the kind of lifestyle Bill’s parents

wanted now, and what they might need in the future.

To more clearly understand how your expectations around behavior

impact your decision-making, ask yourself:

- Is there a behavior around your upcoming decision that may impact

your ability to see the situation more objectively?

## HBR / Digital Article / Make Better Decisions by Challenging Your Expectations

- How are past decisions driving your behavior? And how is this decision

# diﬀerent from past decisions?

- How do you expect the other stakeholders to behave?

Biases to look out for: framing bias (making decisions based on the way

in which information is presented); anchoring bias (relying heavily on the

ﬁrst piece of information received).

# Information

The next step is to understand your expectations around the

information you need and want to make your decision.

Bill is comfortable gathering information; indeed, he likes data-

gathering. As he and his parents began researching local facilities, he

assumed he’d be able to get transparent pricing information, and a list of services and quality-of-life amenities each place oﬀered — and that

this data would be the important data.

Bill expected that his parents would care about information relating to

how they could live independently now and that they would want to be

assured of having whatever care they need in the future when they need

# it.

As Bill examined his assumptions about what information they all

would need, he again circled back to the behavioral expectation step:

If he and his parents began solving the problem from an incorrect frame

(i.e., only one move), they weren’t actually collecting the information

they needed. How could they possibly assess his parents’ future needs

accurately? Further, would they be able to assess how a particular

institution would be able to meet those future needs? Might they

assume that a lot of care equaled good care? This is called conﬁrmation

# bias.

To more clearly understand your expectations around information and

its impact on your decision-making, take a look at your information-

gathering habits. Ask yourself:

- How is this decision like others you’ve made in the past and how is it

# diﬀerent?

- What are the expectations you have about the kind of information you

will be able to gather?

- What information do you expect the other decision stakeholders will

# contribute?

Biases to look out for: conﬁrmation bias (looking for, favoring, or

interpreting information in a way that conﬁrms your existing beliefs);

attentional bias (focusing more on some pieces of data than others).

# Analysis

The way we analyze information can also introduce bias into our

# decision-making process.

Bill usually begins with a pro/con list to assess his options. However, he

realized that his analysis of the situation might not be relevant for this

decision. Decision ownership actually belonged to his parents. It was

their future home that was at stake, not his.

This step made it clear to Bill that he did not want to push his parents

toward what he believed was best. That could introduce a projection

bias, a common feature of our thinking where we believe others have the

same priority, attitude, or belief that we do. Bill realized that he needed

his parents to share how they’d like to analyze their living options so that he might best support their eﬀorts.

In addition, Bill knew that his parents were focused much more

on maintaining their current freedoms than on future potential and

unknown problems. This overweighting of a single, data point, called

salience bias, might incline his parents to favor information about

services catering to their current lifestyle while ignoring undetermined

# health needs down the road.

By making these concerns explicit, Bill could have a conversation

with his parents ahead of time about how they would analyze the

information. He realized that maybe the decision should not be made

by the three of them alone. He decided to ask his parents about meeting

with each one’s primary care doctor to get some professional advice

about the kinds of future health care services to focus on given their

# speciﬁc medical histories.

To more clearly understand how the way you analyze information might

impact your decision-making, ask yourself:

- What analysis do you typically conduct? Is that relevant for this

# decision?

- What are your expectations about your ability to synthesize and

understand the information related to the decision you currently face?

- What can the other decision stakeholders contribute to the analysis

# process?

Biases to look out for: projection bias (believing others share our same

priorities, attitudes, or beliefs); salience bias (overweighting a single data

# point).

# Structure

The ﬁnal step is to examine the structure, or environment around you as

you make your decision.

Bill’s parents did have a deadline, although it was a self-imposed one:

They wanted to be out of the house before winter. Their budget was

also ﬁxed: They would have the sale money from the house and a

# comfortable monthly pension.

While Bill felt that he and his parents were allowing enough time to

make a decision without too much time pressure, he realized that they’d

all focused on annual costs without a good understanding of what

future medical expenses might be. But perhaps that was unknowable;

there was likely a limit on how much the family could really plan.

Although Bill’s parents found two facilities that met many of their

criteria, each had a fatal ﬂaw. At one place, although they could buy

in to the type of housing they needed now, there was no guarantee that

housing with more care would be available when they needed it. The

second facility, they realized, meant they would have to change primary

care doctors because the drive would become too long. Both very much

wanted to maintain their relationship with their primary care doctors,

as they each had complex medical histories.

To more clearly understand how structure might impact your decision-

making, ask yourself:

- What are the opportunities and limitations of the decision you are

about to make?

- Is there a time deadline?

- Might the decision be ﬂexible or constrained by money or other

# external pressures?

- Are the other stakeholders under any constraints?

Biases to look out for: planning fallacy (underestimating the time it will

take to complete a future task, despite knowledge that previous tasks

have generally taken longer than planned); status-quo bias (preferring

the current state of affairs resulting in a resistance to change).

. . .

After applying the BIAS framework to their decision-making, Bill and

his parents realized that they were solving for the wrong problem. They

didn’t need an eldercare facility, and by trying to shoe-horn themselves

into one to prevent a second move, they could have made an expensive

and unhappy decision. They simply needed a house without outdoor

## stairs and with a master bedroom on the ﬁrst ﬂoor.

When Bill turned the decision over to his parents and pushed them to

make their expectations explicit, they were all able to see that it was

anxiety and stress that led them to focus on the single move.

William Shakespeare once wrote, “expectations are the root of all

heartache.” When we face a diﬃcult decision, we often unconsciously

set expectations — for ourselves and for others — about both

the decision-making process and the outcome. Embedded in our

expectations are our biases, which are always part of our thinking, so

can be very hard to bring to light.

The BIAS Framework breaks down what is knowable into its

components — our behavior, our information, our ability to think critically about our decisions, and the external forces aﬀecting the

decisions. This framework allows us to examine our expectations

and habits so that we may check and challenge bias, assumption,

and judgment to better engage with others and with our decisions.

Heartache is a part of life, but expectations don’t have to lead there.
