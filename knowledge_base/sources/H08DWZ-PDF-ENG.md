Diversifying the workplace has become a central objective for many

employers, with U.S. ﬁrms spending nearly $8 billion annually on

diversity eﬀorts. While the many beneﬁts of diverse teams have been

widely studied, attracting a diverse talent pool has proven challenging

for some companies, and many groups, like women, remain severely

underrepresented across industries. The push for gender diversity is

especially crucial for startups, who risk accruing “diversity debt” — the issue of correcting a lack of diversity that becomes increasingly diﬃcult

as the ﬁrm grows.

Parallel to this emphasis on gender diversity, companies are

increasingly adopting ﬂatter organizational structures, characterized

by fewer managerial levels. Companies like Valve and Zappos are well-

known examples of ﬁrms that have eliminated traditional hierarchical

roles, positioning ﬂat hierarchies as more egalitarian and ﬂexible

environments. To compete against established ﬁrms — which can oﬀer

## applicants more attractive ﬁnancial incentives and greater job security

## — startups often highlight unique non-monetary attributes that may

appeal to diverse groups of potential employees, including references

## to their ﬂat organizational hierarchies in recruitment materials. This

led us to question whether mentioning ﬂat hierarchies in recruitment

materials actually encouraged more women to apply.

In new research, published in the Strategic Management Journal,

we found that, surprisingly, when companies reference their ﬂat

hierarchies, it actually deters women, relative to men, from applying

or being interested in the role.

To reach these ﬁndings, we ﬁrst conducted a ﬁeld experiment. We

partnered with a U.S. health care startup and created two recruitment

emails for two open jobs at the company. One email highlighted

the startups’ ﬂat hierarchy, and the other made no mention of

organizational structure. The emails went out to 8,167 actual U.S.

job seekers on ZipRecruiter whose proﬁles identiﬁed them as good

applicants for the roles. While highlighting the startup’s ﬂatter

hierarchy did not signiﬁcantly impact the number of job applicants

between the two groups, the email that emphasized a ﬂat hierarchy

had 28% fewer women applicants in their pool. Women applicants were

also 14% less likely to show an interest in the position (measured by

whether or not they clicked a link in the recruitment email that led to

the application) when the recruitment email mentioned a ﬂat hierarchy.

To understand why women may be relatively less attracted to

ﬂatter hierarchies, we conducted a large-scale follow-up experiment,

surveying 8,498 new U.S. participants. Our ﬁndings unveiled several

# potential reasons:

- Compared to the male participants in the survey, women perceived

ﬂatter hierarchies as more challenging to ﬁt into. Several women in

our survey expressed concerns, including that “a ﬂat hierarchy will run

like a boys’ club” and “be harder to ﬁt in.”

- Women also anticipated a disproportionately higher workload in

ﬂatter organizations. In this respect, many women participants voiced

concerns about an “overwhelming” or “heavy” workload in such

# environments.

- Compared to men, women expected relatively fewer opportunities for

career advancement. As one woman participant noted, “I think of

[a ﬂatter structure of having] prejudice in the workplace preventing

## upward mobility of marginalized employees.”

Our research demonstrates that emphasizing ﬂatter hierarchies in

recruitment eﬀorts may unintentionally hinder startups’ ability to

## enhance gender diversity in their workforce.

## Why Referencing Flat Hierarchies Isn’t Enough

While ﬂatter hierarchies seem to promise work cultures with attractive

features, like less rigid oversight and more autonomy, clearly that does

not match women’s expectations of those environments or address the

associations with ﬂat hierarchies that women see as obstacles.

Our research provides interesting considerations for companies looking

to attract diverse applicants.

Examine what employees value

First, talk to your employees and recruiters about what workers,

## particularly underrepresented workers, value in an organization. What

makes them feel welcome and like they belong? Have they felt that

they’ve had a hard time ﬁtting into the culture? Do they experience a

heavier workload? Fewer opportunities to advance? How can you design

your company’s structure to promote an inclusive and fair workplace

environment? How can you describe those eﬀorts in recruitment? This

could help signal to other star performers how seriously you take

their work experience and make sure they have what they need to be

# successful.

## Interrogate potential negative associations

Second, our study suggests that companies need to carefully craft

their recruiting eﬀorts. In particular, companies should consider

what organizational attributes may have unintended associations for

prospective hires. Hiring managers should identify and address aspects

of their organizational structure and work culture that could discourage

diverse candidates from applying, and ensure these concerns are

reﬂected in their recruitment materials.

. . .

To attract a diverse pool of applicants, startups need to ﬁnd ways

to distinguish themselves from established ﬁrms that can oﬀer

more ﬁnancial incentives and job security. While some features, like

ﬂat hierarchical structures, may appeal to certain job seekers, our

research suggests these features may have unintended consequences,

particularly in attracting a gender-diverse applicant pool. Our work

shows that to attract top talent, it is crucial that companies carefully

assess recruiting strategies to determine and work toward cultivating
