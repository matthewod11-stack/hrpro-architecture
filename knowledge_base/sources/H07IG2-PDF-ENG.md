In the 1990s, business process reengineering was all the

rage: Companies used budding technologies such as enterprise

resource planning (ERP) systems and the internet to enact radical

changes to broad, end-to-end business processes. Buoyed by

reengineering’s academic and consulting proponents, companies

anticipated transformative changes to broad processes like order-to-

## cash and conception to commercialization of new products.

But while technology did bring major updates, implementations often

failed to live up to the sky-high expectations. For example, large-scale

ERP systems like SAP or Oracle provided a useful IT backbone to

exchange data, yet also created very rigid processes that were hard to

change past the IT implementation. Since then, process management

typically involved only incremental change to local processes — Lean

## and Six Sigma for repetitive processes, and Agile Lean Startup methods

## for development — all without any assistance from technology.

Now, a version of this idea is making a comeback in some companies,

and we expect to see it in more. It will require not only an

appreciation and understanding of AI, but also a renewed appreciation

of business processes as a structure for improving work. As AI emerges

as a universally applicable, general-purpose technology, it appears

increasingly possible that it can enable the kind of radical redesign of

business processes originally envisaged by reengineering’s proponents.

(One of us — Davenport — wrote the ﬁrst book on the topic.)

# Updating Reengineering

The technologies enabling reengineering in the 90s were primarily

transactional and communications-based. They enabled eﬃcient data

capture and transfer within and across organizations. AI, on the other

hand, enables better, faster, and more automated decisions. In essence,

most AI deployments in large organizations involve learning from large

datasets to make a prediction or classiﬁcation, which in turn helps

business with making a better operational decision. Better operational

decisions, in turn, enhance eﬃciency by producing better outcomes. A key diﬀerence is that present AI systems are a true general-purpose

technology, and have brought about dramatic changes not just in

## production planning and control, but also visual image recognition and

inspection, autonomous operations, and generating new content.

While the methods fueling this growth of AI have been around for

decades, the cost of implementing them has dropped precipitously.

Previously the domain of data scientists only, modern AI-based solutions are now mature enough to be oﬀered “oﬀ the shelf,” greatly

lowering the technical barriers to entry. Falling computing costs —

driven by the wide availability of the cloud, the growth of low-cost

bandwidth, and reduced cost of sensors — have drastically lowered

the price of model-driven prediction. AI-based decisions can also be

included within the wider context of automation. Technologies such

## as robotic process automation (RPA) help to structure the ﬂow of work

and automate information-intensive back-oﬃce processes. RPA is rule-

based, which limits its ability to employ data-based decisions. But

combined with machine learning as “intelligent process automation,”

it can deal with much a greater variation of tasks.

This AI-driven reengineering is already taking place. Banks are using

it to transform wealth management advice for clients. Insurance

companies are using AI to make client onboarding and underwriting

much easier, and automating claims estimates for auto and home

damage with deep learning analysis of photos taken by the insured.

Industrial ﬁrms are reshaping maintenance and engineering processes.

Even in health care, where there is considerable research on AI

but much less clinical adoption, diagnosis and treatment are being

reshaped by AI-based telemedicine in some countries.

All of this has important ramiﬁcations for the way we use AI, how work

is being performed, and how companies are being organized. To take

advantage of these potential beneﬁts, companies need to bring back an

end-to-end process perspective on their businesses, and think carefully

about how AI can transform them. In essence, companies need to

explore where they are generating suﬃcient data to extract patterns that

could be used to support operational decisions.

# AI Drives Process Reengineering

As AI brings new capabilities to a business process, companies need

to rethink what tasks are needed, in what frequency, and who does

them. When AI is accompanied by partial automation, companies also

need to decide what humans will do and what machines will do in

their processes. Most AI applications to date seek to improve a given

task. But this is missing the larger picture; smart companies are viewing

the introduction of AI as the rationale for a new look at end-to-end

# processes.

At its most basic level, process analysis often involves a mix of

constraints and opportunities. For example, at DBS Bank in Singapore,

## the manager of transaction surveillance (anti-money laundering and

fraud detection) said in an interview they were frustrated at the high

false positive levels identiﬁed by the rule-based system required by

banking regulators. That is an unavoidable constraint on the process,

but he saw an opportunity to use AI to predict and score the fraud risk

of each positive result using machine learning. Transactions with low

fraud probabilities could simply be put in a “cooler” for several months

to see if they recurred with the same customer. Machine-learning based

AI systems to detect outliers are well-established in the fraud detection

arena. But when the machine learning system was combined with a

## new workﬂow platform and a relationship network analytics system

(to identify fraud network members), the productivity of surveillance

analysts increased by a third.

Another good example is at Shell, where one of us (Jeavons) leads

AI initiatives. Shell has long been a process-focused company, and is

presently engaged in a major AI initiative in areas like supply chain,

operations, and maintenance. As part of this, Shell is reengineering its

# work processes.

For example, consider the work of monitoring and inspection at energy and chemical plants, pipelines, oﬀshore facilities, and wind and solar

farms. This work used to be exclusively done in person by inspectors

and maintenance technicians, but AI can ease that constraint. Now

many low value-adding inspection tasks can instead be done remotely

by robots and drones. Some Shell facilities are so large that it would

previously have taken years to inspect everything manually — now

drones and robots are being introduced to automate these processes

and help shorten the cycle time.

## As a result of these changes, inspectors and maintenance technicians

can now rethink their day-to-day work. They can focus on higher-value

activities such as prioritizing projects or, if they’re on site, performing

more advanced veriﬁcation. At the same time, new tasks are emerging,

such as annotation for images to improve inspection algorithms or

managing the training processes for the thousands of machine learning

models now working in production. What were previously physical work

processes are now managed by multidisciplinary teams doing largely

# digital tasks.

This shift involved some resistance. At ﬁrst, it was hard to convince

the inspectors, but gradually they are being persuaded as they’re shown

that the processing of the images provides similar accuracy in much less

time. Furthermore, Shell is engaging these engineers in rethinking their

work processes with the remote surveillance centers, empowering them

to drive the change.

Shell is ﬁnding that this process of AI-enabled reengineering is

becoming a permanent way of operating. Each individual project may

take only a year or two, but the more they use digital, data, and

AI to redesign processes, the more they see opportunities for going

further. This is particularly important as the company is transforming to

become a net-zero emissions energy company.

## Who Should Lead AI-Enabled Process Change?

Process improvement has traditionally solely been the domain of

operations managers. For that reason it has been somewhat rare for

organizations to have an explicit reengineering initiative in conjunction

with their AI projects. To truly leverage the power of AI, process

design and improvement activities should be incorporated within the

AI initiative. The most successful such initiatives are increasingly

being orchestrated by “product managers” who have the successful

deployment of the system, including the needed business changes,

as their objective. Shell designates a product owner to manage the

business change, and a product manager who is responsible for

technical delivery. Some organizations also engage in “design thinking”

exercises, which overlap in part with reengineering-style analyses of

how workﬂows and activities need to be redesigned to meet customer or

# internal needs.

While we have seen multiple instances in which reengineering

takes place alongside AI development, not enough organizations yet

recognize the need for process change. A more explicit callout of the

reengineering role and activities — including high-level design, detailed

process ﬂows, measurement of before and after costs and cycle times,

and analysis of needed skills and training — would be helpful, whether

it is called “reengineering” or not. The activities are too important to the

success of AI projects to leave them to chance or an astute manager who

remembers the reengineering movement.

Because automation-focused projects have a direct impact on process

ﬂows and are more likely than other forms of AI to involve only

incremental change, they are more likely to include a formal set of

process improvement steps. At Voya Financial, for example, the process

improvement group has an automation center of excellence within it,

and no automation project takes place without a process improvement eﬀort ﬁrst. The group’s head told us that automation at the company

is as much a process-oriented engagement as a technical one. We’ve

found several other companies that combine process improvement

and automation, but we’d like to see both more aggressive process

## change and the more powerful AI technologies like machine learning

# in combination as well.

AI is fast becoming a ubiquitous technology. Once the hype recedes

it will become as standard as ERP systems, statistical packages, or

even spreadsheets. AI platforms can be used by a much larger pool of

companies to reengineer their processes. AI is a means to an end, not

an end in itself. Firms that understand how to use it as a new tool in

the broader context of process reengineering will arguably get the most

# from AI in the long run.
