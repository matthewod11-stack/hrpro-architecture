When I stepped in to run the company that would become Kaspi.kz in

2007, it was a bank with no online presence that had been struggling

to survive amid a global ﬁnancial crisis. Today, it is the most widely

used platform in Kazakhstan for ﬁnancial and government services,

payments, and e-commerce. It serves 75% of the population and

## generates $2 billion in annual net income on revenues of just under

$5 billion. The U.S. equivalent might be having PayPal, Amazon, Capital

One, Booking.com, and Instacart all in one app. How did we eﬀect such

a dramatic transformation? With an unwavering focus on creating and

delivering more value to customers.

There’s no better illustration of this than our decision to create a single

superapp to house all our services. At the time, marketing experts told

us people wouldn’t want to hold savings or checking accounts with

the same brand they bought kitchen appliances and clothing from.

IT experts told us we needed diﬀerent interfaces for each business

because diﬀerent online activities required drastically diﬀerent user

experiences. But was it best for customers to download multiple apps

and deal with numerous passwords and log-ins? Or to get everything

they need to manage their lives in one place?

The answer was clear. Our mission was and still is to improve people’s

lives through innovation, making everything we touch cheaper, faster,

and more convenient. We knew the superapp was the best way to do it.

And in the years since, we’ve been proven right. Not only do we have the

greatest penetration in our home market of any technology company,

we have the highest engagement too. Seventy percent of the people who

use our app do so daily—something no social network can boast. Our

customers conduct an average of 73 transactions per month—more than

PayPal sees from the average North American user in a year. And we

process more than 10 billion transactions annually—four times what

Visa and Mastercard do in Kazakhstan combined.

We’ve watched the development of superapps in other geographies

—most notably China—with interest. But having designed our

## organizational culture, structures, processes, and incentives to

prioritize customer needs, we believe we have a unique story to tell.

Now, as a Nasdaq-listed company expanding into Türkiye, we’re keen to

## share insights into our business model with the rest of the world.

# An Untapped Market

I grew up in Georgia—the country, not the U.S. state—in a family that

always prioritized learning. Even if we didn’t have the money for meals,

my parents found a way to pay for my math, physics, and English tutors.

After earning a bachelor’s degree in business from the European School

of Management, I partnered with some classmates and professors to

set up a strategic advisory and auditing ﬁrm, which grew to be one of

the largest in our country. In 2001, while I was in the MBA program at

Harvard Business School, the company became part of Ernst & Young.

After graduation, I knew I wanted to remain an entrepreneur in the

high-opportunity Eastern European market, so I reached out to the

leading private equity ﬁrm in the region. The managing partner said

he didn’t have any openings, but I told him I would work for free;

eventually he hired me, saying, “I don’t know what you’ll do, but we’ll

ﬁnd something.” Working out of our Moscow headquarters, I evaluated

## businesses across Georgia, Ukraine, Kazakhstan, and the rest of the

region and within a year made partner. In 2006 we invested in a bank

in Kazakhstan, Kaspiyskiy Bank; when the global economy faltered not

long after, the value of that investment plummeted. My ambition had

always been to take an operating role in one of our portfolio companies.

Here was my opportunity to step in and not only turn a business around

but also build it into something special.

At the time, ﬁnance industry observers were warning that technology

companies would soon oﬀer online services to usurp the role of

traditional banks. My thought was that Kaspi needed to preempt

that disruption by transforming itself into a technology company,

and I wrote a six-page business plan for the new vision: Rebranded

as Kaspi.kz, we would “improve people’s lives by creating innovative

services.” Finance would be our foundation, but we would branch out

into any area of customers’ lives that we could make better.

# Launch and Enhance

The ﬁrst step was building online payment services that would allow

people to pay household bills—electricity, gas, water—online instead

of with cash or checks, which usually required service fees. Our goal

was to make the process fast and free, and we did. Over time we’ve

gotten increasingly ambitious. In 2014 we launched an e-commerce

marketplace, and most recently we’ve introduced government services,

from birth registrations to driver’s license renewals.

To an outsider it might seem like we’re moving at breakneck speed,

## but within Kaspi the pace—of both product launches and development

—feels measured and deliberate.

Consider e-commerce. The impetus for getting into this business was

my 2013 attempt to buy a new computer. I went to a store and found one

I liked, but when the salesperson mentioned that a sister store nearby

was oﬀering a grand-opening discount, I decided to go there instead.

By the time I arrived, the model I wanted was gone. I returned to the

original store, but now the only option available was a display model—

so I went to a third store, which had the computer I wanted but not

the matching printer. For that, I had to go to a fourth store. The whole

process took several days, and I still wasn’t completely conﬁdent that I’d

bought the right model at the right price. Then and there, I knew this

kind of hassle was a consumer pain point Kaspi should tackle.

We initially kept it simple, creating a marketplace for electronics—

mostly smartphones—and oﬀering only the ability to buy now and

pay later, with one merchant at a time, only via store pickup. Later,

of course, we added an online shopping cart, more payment options,

and delivery. Why not include more functionality and products more

quickly? Because our aim is to address one use case extremely well

before moving on to the next.

The winnowing of ideas starts early on. Anyone in the company can

suggest a new product, but to be selected for development, it must

have high potential to add everyday value for customers. Next, we focus

on features. The team might have four suggestions, all of which will

contribute to making the product superb. But we don’t work on all of

them at once. We start with the most important and launch with it—ﬁrst

internally, then to family and friends, then to a limited group of users.

Only after that do we layer on the second, third, and fourth features

in ensuing quarters, starting with just 5% of users and expanding from

# there.

This staged approach not only makes the work more manageable for our

teams, it also helps us to avoid overwhelming our customers. Adoption

rates for simple oﬀerings are much better than for complex ones. We

also learn how people use the ﬁrst feature, which informs and improves

the rollout of the rest. Within a year, we have the originally envisioned

product, but it’s been co-created with the customer.

# Maintain and Refine

We are just as systematic about maintaining and reﬁning our existing

products and services. To that end, we now have around 50 product

teams across the company, each backed by dedicated product owners, engineers, UX experts, data analysts, risk oﬃcers, customer service

reps, and more, who are directly responsible for each of our oﬀerings.

They’re expected to deliver at least one high-quality add-on innovation

per quarter, and their collective performance is measured by the Net

Promoter Score (NPS) users give their product or service.

When we adopted our mission statement centered on improving

people’s lives, we didn’t want it to just be something written on a wall—

we wanted it to become a mantra we lived and breathed. To accomplish

that, we needed a clear, simple metric to track our progress and hold

ourselves accountable. In the beginning, we used two questions: “Would

you recommend this to a friend or family member?” and “Why or why

not?”

Today we gather more detailed information. For example, instead of

asking “Are you happy with our e-commerce shopping?” we ask “Are

you happy with express delivery?” or “…with the payment process?” or

“…with our locker network?” But the goal is the same—to understand

how we can better serve customers. If any of them share negative or

## neutral sentiments about anything, our independent feedback teams

follow up to solicit more information. At product meetings we often

play the recordings from those calls. Picture it: 120 of Kaspi’s key people

listening intently as users describe exactly what they like and don’t like

about our oﬀerings in their own words. It’s an eye-opening experience.

Getting that kind of feedback is how we chose to kill what most

companies would have seen as a successful credit card line. Though

it accounted for a third of our proﬁts, it was NPS negative, which meant

the credit cards were improving our bottom line but not people’s lives.

Thus, we concluded it wasn’t a good long-term business for us and got

# out.

Our monthly NPS surveys, which go to half a million customers, also

point us toward how to improve. Teams review all the ideas raised as

well as those we generate internally, including through our operations

unit, which reports back from direct dealings with customers. Then

preliminary research is done on 10 or so suggestions. After that, we

abandon the least promising half and advance the remainder to the next

level. Each suggestion must get a three-page explainer document that

answers questions such as “Why this change or feature? How does it

add value? What will it change about the user experience?” If everyone

on the team ﬁnds the case for the new feature sound, we move into

development, targeting implementation within three to six months.

# The Future

We took Kaspi public in 2020 in part to allow our private equity owners

to sell their shares but also because we wanted to showcase the future of

corporate Kazakhstan on a global stage. The country might be known

for its natural resources, but we are capable of developing unique

business models too. We opted for the London Stock Exchange ﬁrst

because its investor base tends to better understand Eastern Europe.

## In 2024, amid more interest from the U.S. investment community, we

moved our listing to Nasdaq, raising both our proﬁle and our liquidity.

This year we closed on a 65% stake in Hepsiburada, one of Türkiye’s

largest e-commerce companies. It has a pioneering, mission-driven

vision and a strong, well-respected brand that is very much like Kaspi’s.

Just as we are the only company from Kazakhstan on Nasdaq, it is the

only Turkish one, and together we have the same goal of delivering

customer-led innovation. Of course, with a population of 90 million,

Türkiye represents a much larger market, but we are excited about

enhancing Hepsiburada’s oﬀerings with Kaspi-style quality and speed.

Over the past decade we have created a one-stop shop for people in

Kazakhstan to save and spend money, buy and sell consumer goods and

services, book travel, buy groceries, pay taxes, and obtain government

credentials. As our makeup shifted from 90% retail bank to an even split

among ﬁntech, marketplace, and payments, we have helped to shift

the country’s economy from 85% cash-based to 85% cashless, and we

are one the top ﬁve corporate taxpayers there. And most important, we

make our customers happy—with NPS ratings of 80 to 90 across the

# board.

We are proud to have become a symbol of national pride in Kazakhstan.

We believe we can ﬁnd success in other areas of our region by

continuing to focus relentlessly on improving customers’ lives. And we

hope to inspire other companies to do the same in their own parts of the

# world.
