landscape at all levels, and those on the hunt for a new opportunity can

no longer ignore AI’s impact on their job search strategy.

Understanding how companies are leveraging AI for hiring is critical

for landing your next job. Here are ﬁve ways to prepare for an AI-based

hiring process, from your resume to interviews.

# Applications, Resumes, and Cover Letters

With such a competitive market, recruiters don’t have time to look

at every application. Consider these tips to help ensure your resume

## surfaces to the top of the candidate pool.

Change your narrative.

When updating your resume, develop a strong narrative that shows

recruiters and hiring managers your unique, AI-resistant capabilities.

Start by mapping out your current work. Determine which tasks might

soon be accomplished through AI and automation or whether your

entire job could become obsolete.

For example, some big banks have said they’re looking to automation

to replace much of junior investment analysts’ work. Therefore,

current investment analysts may need to pivot within the ﬁnance

sector to a new role by developing skills technology will likely never

master: work that requires a human touch, such as relationship-

## building, decision-making, personalization, inﬂuence, and stakeholder

alignment. Identifying your skills outside of what can be automated will

help you clearly articulate how your capabilities can complement or

even enhance new technologies as they proliferate your ﬁeld.

As AI and automation advance, you may need to adapt your expertise

to emerging ﬁelds. To understand what job and industry may interest

you, start by reﬂecting on what excites you about your current role.

Going back to the investment analyst example, maybe you enjoy the fast

## pace, complex problem-solving, or the impact of data-driven decisions.

Understanding what drives you can help you identify new career

paths that align with your interests. Explore opportunities in AI-related

ﬁelds such as such as cybersecurity, AI ethics, or AI training, and use

## resources like the Bureau of Labor Statistics’ Occupational Outlook

Handbook to research potential roles. Once you ﬁnd the right ﬁt, you

can craft a compelling narrative that highlights your transferable skills

# and value in the new ﬁeld.

# Understand AI-assisted resume screens.

While AI isn’t expected to entirely replace recruiters, many

organizations are relying on AI-powered applicant-tracking systems

to screen potential candidates for applicable skills. Systems such

as Workday, Oracle HCM, and Greenhouse will surface qualiﬁed

candidates from internal and external talent sources and then evaluate

and rank those candidates for the strongest ﬁt. That’s why it may feel

like you’re sending hundreds of resumes and cover letters to a black

# hole.

With 83% of companies reporting they’re using AI features to screen

resumes, if your resume doesn’t incorporate nearly all the keywords

from the job description, it may never be seen. For example, if

you’re applying for a job in business operations and leave out the

most obvious core competencies (i.e., keywords) for this type of role—for example, strategic planning, operational eﬃciency, process

## optimization, performance metrics, continuous improvement, digital

transformation, and change management—the AI program could

determine you’re not qualiﬁed for the position, even if you know your

skills are perfect for it.

# Use AI…sparingly.

Just because companies are using AI to screen candidates doesn’t

mean you should rely on AI to draft your resume and cover letter

from scratch. Companies are becoming savvier to AI-generated content,

which may not work in your favor. In 2023, Gartner reported that

69% of HR professionals surveyed used applicant-tracking software to

## spot applications or resumes with AI-generated copy. Further, nearly

half of respondents revealed they have a separate evaluation process

for AI-generated resumes, with 8% reporting that they deprioritize

AI-generated resumes and applications. Even AI company Anthropic

is asking job applicants to certify that they didn’t use AI in the

application process because it prevents them from assessing applicants’

# communication skills.

While Gemini, ChatGPT, or Copilot may be helpful in creating concise

bullet points, they don’t know your accomplishments and may create

## similar-sounding language for anyone applying for the same job.

Therefore, you should only rely on AI tools to align your already drafted

resume with the keywords for speciﬁc careers. For example, you could

use a prompt like, “Provide me all possible keywords for hard and

soft skills for business operations jobs.” Or you could input the job

## description and your resume into the AI program and prompt, “Tell me

what keywords and responsibilities from the job description are missing

from my resume.” Then review the keywords or responsibilities that are

relevant to your speciﬁc experience and organically incorporate them

# into your resume and cover letter.

It’s not just resumes that shouldn’t be created from scratch with AI.

## AI-generated cover letters sound inauthentic, lack passion, and can

read as generic, formal, or too “perfect” compared to how a human

would communicate information. If you prompt AI to “Draft a business

operations cover letter,” for example, everyone else who asks the same

question will be submitting the same cover letter, and companies may

dismiss your application without taking the time to understand whether

you have the exceptional written communication skills you purport to

have on your resume.

Bottom line: Use AI as a ﬁnishing tool, not a starting tool. Take the time

to write your own resume and cover letter, then use AI to reﬁne them for

# clarity and conciseness.

# Interviews

AI is also taking the place of human interaction at the beginning of the

interview process. Many job seekers now need to impress an algorithm

instead of creating that instant human connection.

# Prepare for AI-assisted interviews.

Many companies are using AI technology such as HireVue,

## VidRecruiter, CodeSignal, and Brazen to pre-screen candidates through

written and video questions. These programs assess the answers to

surface top candidates for recruiters. But simply receiving a request for

a video interview doesn’t necessarily mean you’re in the hiring process

—some companies send these questions out to everyone who applied

for the job or to a selection of people whose resumes were surfaced by

# AI-screening software.

So what’s the key to advancing in this process and eventually getting to

talk to a human? You need to get comfortable talking to a screen that

has no reaction or follow-up questions and gives no indication whether

you’re answering the questions well.

AI-generated screening questions tend to be basic, so prepare answers to

## the most common questions in advance. Think:

- What makes you unique?

- Can you tell us a little about yourself?

- Why are you the right ﬁt for the role ?

- Why do you want to work here?

- How does your skillset match the position?

- What else would you like to contribute to this interview?

Next, practice answering these questions in advance, and record

## yourself. AI tools such as Interview Prep AI, Interview AI, Huru, and

## Interview Warmup ask you common interview questions and then

## assess your answers for completeness and use of keywords. Some tools

can even give feedback on your body language and vocal delivery. This

type of feedback can help you feel conﬁdent about answering questions

with the right energy, body language, and information before doing any

# interviews with a human.

Note that, when you’re invited to record answers for a pre-screen

interview, many companies will provide up to three minutes to answer

the question. Recruiters I spoke with while researching my most recent

book recommend using no more than two minutes to answer a question,

because at all levels, you’re expected to know how to synthesize

information into concise, clear answers using applicable keywords

aligned with the roles and responsibilities in the job description.

Overtalking won’t increase your chances of passing the screen.

Ask about AI progress.

Because the tech landscape continues to change rapidly, once you get

the opportunity to interview with a human, you’ll want to get a sense of

whether and how the company is using AI. For example, you might ask,

“How is the company and this speciﬁc function innovating with AI and

automation?” and “What kinds of upskilling and reskilling programs

does the company oﬀer for those whose jobs will be made obsolete by

AI?”

Understanding an organization’s progress in AI implementation can

give you insight into what your long-term success might look like

there. Why? Because McKinsey & Company is reporting that AI could

automate up to 70% of business activities by 2030, and Goldman Sachs

says 300 million jobs could be displaced. If you determine that you’re

applying to a company already implementing AI, you may have less fear

that your job will disappear in a year or two because the company is

already seeking new competencies to complement their AI programs.

Companies that aren’t AI innovators quite yet may be hiring for skillsets

to keep them operating while discussing AI implementations, which

could put your job at risk in the future.

. . .

Being knowledgeable about how AI impacts the hiring process and your

job can give you an edge in making sure your application gets to the top

of the pile. Further, in your interviews, you’ll be able to position yourself

not only as a capable professional, but one who’s eager to evolve your

skillset along with AI.
