Family businesses are infamous for nepotism and inﬁghting à la

Succession, especially when it’s time to appoint a new CEO. To be

sure, that’s the reality for many. But when a research team set out

to help family ﬁrms improve their leadership transitions, it found

that large family businesses had much better succession practices

than their nonfamily counterparts did—and they outperformed

on several measures after new appointees took the reins. “This

completely upended our expectations,” says global talent adviser

## Claudio Fernández-Aráoz, a member of the research team.

The researchers analyzed all CEO transitions and subsequent

organizational results at 58 large U.S. and Canadian publicly owned

family ﬁrms—those with $1 billion or more in revenue at some point

from 2010 to 2018; family voting rights of at least 12.5%; and family

members serving as managers, shareholders, or directors. They also

looked at 1,406 S&P 1500 ﬁrms in the same industries and region.

Their analysis covered more than 3,000 transitions from 1994 to 2020.

It showed that in the three years after appointing a new CEO, the

family businesses improved their cash-ﬂow performance much more

than the others did—by a full percentage point more, on average. They

experienced signiﬁcantly less risk, with just 62% as much variability in

cash-ﬂow performance as nonfamily ﬁrms. And they had greater odds of

high performance and lower odds of poor performance, boosting their

ability to safely take on debt.

Drawing on the analysis and their combined decades of experience,

Fernández-Aráoz and his colleagues identiﬁed several factors driving

those ﬁrms’ success.

# Best Practices for Succession

First, a caveat: These practices are far from ubiquitous among family

ﬁrms. When the researchers looked at CEO transitions and outcomes

at smaller family businesses, they found a very diﬀerent picture. Eighty-

four percent of those ﬁrms’ CEOs were family members, compared with

only 13% for large family ﬁrms. The smaller ﬁrms didn’t see the same

superior outcomes, and they too could beneﬁt from the guidance below.

## Approach succession proactively and strategically. The nonfamily

ﬁrms in the study hired new leaders reactively, usually after sharp

## declines in operating performance and steep increases in cash-ﬂow

performance risk. Their operating income dropped by a percentage

## point, on average, in the couple of years before the leadership transition.

By contrast, large family ﬁrms undertook CEO changes independently

of short-term performance issues, reﬂecting a more strategic focus and a

# longer time horizon.

Bring on a few highly engaged long-term directors and empower

them to lead the process. The family and nonfamily ﬁrms in the

study appointed CEOs from within the organization at similar rates

—roughly 70% of the time. But large family ﬁrms did much better

## than their nonfamily counterparts in the subsequent three years, with

better cash-ﬂow performance and much lower risk. That’s because

family members who lead searches typically have deeper knowledge of

internal prospects than professional board members do, the researchers

concluded. Nonfamily ﬁrms could ﬁnd similar advantage by seeking

genuinely motivated directors, retaining some of them for longer

than is customary, and empowering them to participate in candidate

assessments. A mix of long- and short-term directors can shore up

succession practices while leaving room for fresh voices, especially from

## members of historically underrepresented groups.

The large family ﬁrms in the study were also better at bringing

in successful outsiders. Their internally and externally hired CEOs

produced the same low levels of cash-ﬂow performance risk, whereas

the external hires of nonfamily ﬁrms were associated with 27% greater

risk than that of internal hires. And external hires at family ﬁrms had an

## equal chance of top cash-ﬂow performance and less chance of inferior

performance than did external hires at nonfamily ﬁrms.

Several factors contribute to the diﬀerence, the researchers say. As

noted, long-term family directors have a broader and deeper perspective

than nonfamily directors typically do on what their organization really

needs. And work by other scholars has shown that one of the most

important predictors of competence in interviewing and assessing

candidates is motivation. It stands to reason that a family member,

who usually has more skin in the game, would have an especially

strong incentive to get this critical choice right. Think, for example, of

William Ford’s intense involvement in the CEO search that led to the

hiring of Alan Mulally, who returned the car company to proﬁtability

after his appointment, in 2006. Bringing on some deeply committed

board members for long tenures can help nonfamily ﬁrms with external

# searches as well.

## Don’t obsess about formal planning and documentation. More

important than amassing large numbers of candidates and carefully

documenting your plans—the approach taken by most nonfamily public

companies—is doubling down on the rigor of your assessments. Prior

studies have shown that the value of additional prospects declines

## sharply after the ﬁrst few and virtually disappears after about a

dozen. “You can put on a show and generate an inﬁnite number

of candidates,” says coresearcher Greg Nagel, a professor at Middle

Tennessee State University. “But it doesn’t result in better outcomes.”

In fact, the more that large family ﬁrms engaged in sweeping searches

and communicated about them to their shareholders, the worse their

subsequent cash-ﬂow performance was.

Empower new leaders from the start. It’s not just that large family ﬁrms

appoint more-competent CEOs; they do more to support their eﬀorts

## from day one, presumably because of their deeper knowledge of and

trust in their appointees. Looking at insider CEOs with less than a year’s

experience on their company’s board—the case at most public ﬁrms—

the researchers found that the leaders of large family ﬁrms immediately

embarked on successful major corporate investments three times as

frequently as their nonfamily counterparts did. “Family members and

long-serving directors know their new leaders thoroughly,” explains

Egon Zehnder consultant and coresearcher Sonny Iqbal. “They’ve been

watching them constantly regardless of time served on the board.

So they really trust them and are willing to give them considerable

# freedom.”

The study’s ﬁndings hold lessons for investors as well. When a family

ﬁrm brings in an outside CEO, the market pays a premium, the

researchers found—but that’s not justiﬁed, given that insider CEOs in

large family ﬁrms do just as well. In addition, “the stable cash-ﬂow

performance in large family ﬁrms makes them worth about 13% more

than comparable nonfamily ﬁrms,” says coresearcher Carrie Green, the

## director of equities at the Tennessee Consolidated Retirement System.

“But that isn’t reﬂected in their stock price.” By taking a page from

large family ﬁrms’ succession playbooks, the researchers conclude,

smaller family ﬁrms and nonfamily businesses of all sizes can bolster

their chances of appointing high-performing CEOs—and by heeding the

implications for organizational results, investors can make smarter bets,

# too.

What’s been most important in your

# CEO transitions?

Having a strong board, involving it deeply

in the planning—and listening to it. The

CEO choice has never been a whim of

mine. We always give ourselves enough

time to plan. Our Apex council—an

# internal advisory group—tracks talent in

all our companies and asks the CEO of

## each for two or three potential successors

# Jason Grow

# under various scenarios: If a new CEO

were needed tomorrow, who’s ready? Who

will be ready in three years? In five?

There’s always a plan for the CEO and executives two or three levels down.

What are your must-haves in a new leader?

We have a few cultural non-negotiables: integrity, respect for individuals’

dignity, good citizenship. If there’s even an inkling of dissonance with

those values, the candidate is out of the running. From there we look

at relevant competencies. Finally, we assess whether the candidate will

provide inspirational, collaborative leadership. There’s a Hindi phrase that

means “Show me the way.” The ability to do that across the company is

# critical.

How do you ensure a pipeline of people who are ready?

The Apex council rotates talent within and across our companies. It ensures

## development opportunities for people on a fast track—both internal and

external management programs. One activity is essentially a Renaissance

weekend for leaders; it involves discussions with experts in psychology,

literature, music, and so on. It helps people understand how to develop the

right side of the brain; that’s as important to leadership as the left side.

What’s your view on outside candidates?

You should always have someone in the mix who’s not a long-term insider.

But I’m usually not a fan of hiring complete outsiders; there are too many

imponderables. Take Anish Shah, who succeeded me as group head in

- 2021. He joined us in 2014. I brought him in then, with no guarantees

about succession, because I wanted to have a new element to present

to the board when I was ready to step down. I’m also not in favor of a

huge number of prospects; it’s not necessary or even helpful. When we use

headhunters, we ask them to give us two or three names. We’ll do as many

interviews with the headhunter as it takes to learn what we need, but we

don’t want a long list of candidates.

Do you ever consider family members?

Very few have had any interest in joining the business. If one of my

grandsons wanted a role, we’d evaluate him as we would anyone else. If

he didn’t have extraordinary hunger and competence, we’d give him an

office and put him on a board—that’s it. Professional managers helped my

grandfather and great-uncle create the company. My uncle was in charge

next, but he was followed by two nonfamily executives. Professional leaders

have always been in our DNA.

How do you empower new CEOs?

My uncle gave me an enormous amount of space, and I made a commitment

to do the same. I said to Anish, “You have a clean sheet. Nothing is

off-limits; if you don’t like a program I created, kill it.” I don’t push for

involvement; he pulls on my time when he wants it. A friend once told me,

“Be a well; let people come to you for water when they need it. Don’t be

a brook, bubbling into everybody’s business.” As long as new leaders are

adding value, they have the freedom to decide how they want to do things.
