For many working women, their relationships with female colleagues are critical to their workplace

satisfaction, emotional well-being, and career advancement. Yet too many women miss out on

relationships because they don’t know how to navigate relationships with women with different

social identities, such as race, ethnicity, and sexual orientation at work. This is particularly true when

# it comes to race, as we heard from women again and again while researching workplace relationships

# and in our many years of coaching.

In surveys and interviews, we found many instances in which white women felt free to counsel their

black female colleagues about their dress, sociability, and speech. Perhaps unsurprisingly then, time

and again, we heard from black professional women who spoke of the tiresome and dispiriting efforts

they make at work to “fit in.” Said one woman, “Every day I dress for work as if I were going to a

meeting with the CEO. I am always kind and sweet to everyone, and I always smile until my cheeks

hurt. I want to be sure I am not seen as an angry black woman. Every night I drop into bed exhausted

from the effort.”

The question then is how women can do better. Based on our many years of coaching, we believe that

this can only be done when women are willing to enter into honest, often uncomfortable

conversations with one another. And while our research focused primarily on women and race, these

tips are applicable for many relationships, including those between men, or between men and

women. What they’re really about is creating an opening to honestly and caring-ly address cultural

differences and allow each person in a relationship to be authentic to themselves. These

conversations can often be very difficult, but many missteps can be avoided with these four simple

# tips.

Don’t Be Defensive And Don’t Provoke Defensiveness. If you feel the need to defend yourself—“I am

not a racist”—stop and ask yourself why you feel threatened. If you become defensive, you are

unlikely to understand what is being said, and you are unlikely to say what you really want to say.

By the same token, avoid saying anything likely to cause the other person to become defensive. For

example, saying “I’m sorry you feel that way” devalues the other person’s feelings and accomplishes

# nothing positive.

Seek To Understand, Not Demonstrate You’re A Good Person. Your objective in having a

conversation with a woman with different social identities is to understand where she is coming

from, what her vulnerabilities are, and how you can make it clear to her it is safe to have this

conversation. Forget about establishing the validity of your own point of view. Your aim should be to

do better, not to prove you are a good person.

Don’t Start A Conversation Unless You Are Ready. Effective conversations about improving

workplace relationships depend on a willingness to listen to what may be uncomfortable comments.

Saying something like, “Let’s not go there, it will only make things more difficult,” is worse than not

starting the conversation in the first place. Workplace relationships will not improve unless women

refuse to treat any topic as off limits or to be tiptoed around.

Some Surefire Conversation Killers. Several things should never be said. Among them are, “No

offense, but . . ,” “Don’t be so sensitive,” “Can’t you take a joke?”, “I am not a racist,” “I have many

# black (white/Asian/Hispanic/LGBTQ) friends,” and “You are different.” These statements shut down

conversations, not open them up. Instead say, “I want your help so I can do a better job with our

# relationship.”

Differing intersectionalities can make same-gender workplace relationships difficult, but it is

important for women to understand how they can make their relationships with women with

different social identities strong and mutually supportive. We have seen it happen over and over

again. Sure there are risks in trying to have these conversations, but the relationships that follow can

be extremely valuable.
