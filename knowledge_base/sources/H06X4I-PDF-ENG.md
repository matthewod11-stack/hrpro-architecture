Imagine a consultant telling a C-level executive in 2019 that huge

swaths of their company could transition to remote work with only a

few days’ notice, they would experience a productivity boost after an

adjustment period, and many of those workers would not want to return

to the oﬃce. The consultant’s contract likely wouldn’t be renewed. Even

so, surveys conducted independently by both authors indicate this is an

forced experiment with remote work over the past two years has shown

some organizations the upside of approaches to work they would never

have otherwise considered. It also showed workers that they aren’t as

locked into the traditional, in-oﬃce 9-5 at one company as they might

have thought. For both, there’s no going back.

Hybrid and remote work aren’t the end of the story, however. The new

capabilities organizations have for remote work have opened up new

possibilities, and now is the time for leaders to assess how other changes

to the employment model could work for them.

A ﬂexible or open talent model is particularly worth considering.

Flexible and open talent are broad terms, covering scenarios from

local freelancers coming on-premises to globally distributed online

contractors to innovation sourcing through tournaments or contests. The deﬁning feature is project-based or temporary work that is staﬀed

with workers who are not permanently attached to a company. If done

correctly, these ways of working can help organizations access skilled

talent while providing the ﬂexibility that many workers increasingly

# crave.

Just like with remote work prior to Covid, companies have been slow to

adopt these models. As the chief economist of a large work marketplace,

Upwork, and an academic who has studied open talent for more than

a decade, we tracked a slow uptick in enterprise use of open talent in

the years prior to the pandemic. But now, as remote work has become

normalized, we’re seeing a rapid change.

To help companies understand and take advantage of new possibilities

that open talent allows, we want to highlight some trends in the

ﬂexible/open talent landscape, comment on what jobs or tasks are most

amenable to this model, and outline considerations for managers to get

started.

# Why Use Flexible and Open Talent?

Flexible models have traditionally served three purposes.

- First, ﬂexibility allows organizations to scale staﬃng up and down,

accommodating labor demand variability.

- Second, ﬂexible models allow small-task outsourcing for situations

where hiring a full-time equivalent would not be justiﬁed and where

## the overhead requirements of traditional temporary staﬃng solutions

would slow the project or be cost-prohibitive.

- Third, ﬂexible talent strategies provide access to innovative or diverse

skillsets beyond traditional recruiting pipelines. Industry leaders like

Netﬂix and NASA have found that contests with external participants

## often beat internal innovation benchmarks for similar projects.

Still, there have been barriers to organizations adopting the open

model. At Upwork, a leading online labor market, the sales team saw

some common stumbling blocks from potential clients. Discomfort

with remote work was one of the most signiﬁcant, as ﬂexible talent

is disproportionately remote. Resistance also comes from enterprise

## inertia or bureaucracy, concerns about IP or security risks, and a lack

of familiarity with the tools and management practices that make open talent eﬀective. As a result, companies sought talent primarily in their

## local labor markets or de-facto recruiting networks, and primarily for

# traditional hiring arrangements.

Things are beginning to change, however. In surveys conducted by

Ozimek from a representative panel of ﬁrms, more than half of hiring

managers indicated that remote work has opened up their ability or

willingness to utilize remote freelancers, both during the pandemic and

going forward.

The supply of workers interested in these models has simultaneously

swelled. Self-employment rates have surged over the past year,

supporting anecdotal reports that many considering adding to the Great

Resignation were seeking more ﬂexibility and control over their lives.

In a representative survey of working-age people in the U.S., one out of

ﬁve respondents who could work mostly remotely during the pandemic

reported considering freelancing to stay remote. Among those who

would consider freelancing, a more ﬂexible schedule was what they

# value most.

In a series of Upwork surveys, respondents reported both opportunities

for and interest in using more freelance options. Respondents who had worked with or hired independent staﬀ in the last year said that,

without the external help, they would have done the work themselves

(35%) or asked their teams to do it (28%) — options that could contribute

to burnout. Twenty percent said they would have hired an outside

service company; 3% would have hired a staﬃng ﬁrm. Just 8% said

they would have made new full-time hires, and 6% said the work simply

wouldn’t have been done.

Respondents also reported having contracted signiﬁcantly more

freelancers during the pandemic (53% said they made more use of

remote freelancers compared to their pre-pandemic baseline, vs. just

6% who hired fewer freelancers) and planned to make more use of it

# over the next two years (47% vs. 11%).

## What Jobs or Tasks Are Most Amenable to the Flexible/Open Talent Model?

The ﬂexible/open model has proven eﬀective for a wide range of

jobs and tasks. The top skill categories on Upwork are administrative

support (including relatively rote tasks like data entry) and web/

software development. These skills run the gamut from easy-to-ﬁnd

to rare, highly specialized, and highly compensated. Other platforms,

such as Topcoder, concentrate on contests — a model that has

## proven incredibly valuable for innovation — with typical tournaments

containing high-level programming or machine learning work or more

# subjective design work.

Given the range of skills available on open platforms, there are a

few situations where it makes particular sense to use open talent.

# Speciﬁcally, when:

- 1. Insiders cannot be redeployed easily.

- 2. Outsiders are less expensive than hiring a new insider or paying

overtime to existing ones.

- 3. Highly specialized skills are needed and they are not available

# internally.

- 4. Returns on exceptional solutions are high.

In the ﬁrst three situations, companies are responding to a simple need

for talent, but the last underscores another important motivation: In

many contexts outsiders have been found to beat insiders head-to-head. Outsiders can provide many diﬀerent approaches or solutions to a given

problem, allowing the organization to choose the best one.

But, perhaps even more important than the situation that brought ﬁrms

to open talent, there’s the nature of the task itself. There are a few

important variables that companies should weigh before deciding how

to utilize open/ﬂexible talent.

For one, the level of ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge required for a project

will typically tip the balance between insiders and outsiders. While

freelancers can build complex database-driven web applications from

scratch — perhaps more eﬃciently than the internal employees of many ﬁrms — a project that requires interfacing eﬀectively with existing

applications that require signiﬁcant ﬁrm-speciﬁc context will mean

either: a) an internal employee is needed to form the bridge; b) the

freelancer must learn the internal systems (potentially at higher cost

than an internal employee); or c) an internal employee will serve an

integration role that builds on the freelancer’s work.

Then there’s the question of whether a project or task is recurring.

All hiring and onboarding has some costs — whether screening a

freelancer, setting up a contest, or hiring a full-time role. If a project

or task is going to be repeated over time, the scale tips toward making

a more permanent hire to economize on these costs, especially if they

involve training a new hire on ﬁrm-speciﬁc processes. On the other

hand, a repeated task can be suitable for open talent if it involves

common skills and requires little ﬁrm-speciﬁc context.

Finally, there are integration costs of incorporating work from an open

talent solution into the larger organization. These tend to be low for

projects that require little ﬁrm speciﬁc knowledge and can be very high

## for a project for highly ﬁrm-speciﬁc tasks.

# Low

# Medium

# Large

# One-off

# Use open/flexible

Open/flexible can be used if integration costs are low enough

Use traditional employees unless tasks can be broken down to remove need for firm-specific context

# Recurring

Open/flexible can be used if recruiting/ screening costs are low enough

Open/flexible can be used if integration costs and recruiting/screening costs are low enough

# Use traditional employees

With these factors in mind, we believe that remote work is hastening a

shift that reduces hiring, screening, and monitoring costs for managers

and lessens burdens on workers to understand ﬁrm-speciﬁc context.

A few important changes have brought us here. First, we’ve seen

a mindset shift around remote work. Hiring managers for remote

positions are now more comfortable interfacing with people they have

not met personally, opening the door to work from anywhere — and

to open/ﬂexible hiring. Second, companies have invested in virtual

communications tools (e.g., video calls and screen sharing) that make

it easier to troubleshoot problems remotely and give outside workers

a way to interface and get/give feedback. Third, remote work and

tools like Slack have forced companies to better deﬁne tasks, codifying

processes and speciﬁcations, making it easier to write speciﬁcations that

a worker with little ﬁrm-speciﬁc knowledge can understand, which can

enable opening up a company.

So, where should companies start?

# What Managers Should Do

Platforms are the primary way freelancers and companies ﬁnd each

other for open/ﬂexible work, and help establish trust for both workers and employers. For the freelance workers, they oﬀer protection through

## payment guarantees and dispute resolution mechanisms, and the

ability to establish a veriﬁed track record of feedback and reputation scores — a kind of virtual resume. For employers, this track record oﬀers

conﬁdence when hiring from a global talent pool. They don’t need to

understand the speciﬁcs of a local labor market — how a college ranks,

which employers signal particular ability, etc. — to ﬁnd the right person

# for a job.

If hiring managers decide to use platforms, there are a few things to

think about as you navigate them.

Platforms make hiding failure much harder, which is likely to be

especially useful for those who don’t have the skills to evaluate

a new hire (e.g., poets who want to hire quants and quants who

want to hire poets). Market signals from past buyers help with that

screening process, and the platforms provide objective measures of

past performance — something that’s nearly impossible to come by in

traditional HR. And because every transaction contributes not just to

## current earnings but to future earnings through public signals of on-the-

job performance, the threat of poor feedback serves as a disciplining

device that likely improves contract fulﬁllment rates.

Platforms primarily make money from successful matches, as up-front

fees are minimal. As a result, clients can hire a freelancer for a short-

term project without making a huge investment before deciding to

hire them on a permanent basis. As remote work expands the pool of

# HBR / Digital Article / Remote Work Has Opened the Door to a New Approach to Hiring

## both potential employers and employees, the opportunity for better

matches increases, making “try before you buy” with ﬂexible talent

# more valuable than ever.

If you begin your journey outside of platforms, use the insights for why

platforms exist so that you can design your own processes to circumvent

the information problems platforms attempt to solve.

This likely means you need some way to screen applicants, like with

employment histories, or to use a format like contests that make

employment histories irrelevant. Incentive alignment in this case

cannot come from the promise of a public signal of good feedback,

but instead may come from a pathway to a permanent position or a

# substantial bonus upon project success.

Hiring managers should be aware of ﬁrm-speciﬁc context and try to

minimize it, while making sure any solution you procure from outsiders

can be integrated. For example, Netﬂix was able to get more than 2,000

submissions in their famous prediction challenge by providing an easy-

to-understand database of movie ratings that didn’t force participants to

understand the underlying architecture of Netﬂix’s backend systems.

You also can run some experiments and horserace diﬀerent models.

Try to measure the results of comparable tasks or projects done in diﬀerent ways (internally and through open talent). This will allow you to measure productivity under diﬀerent conditions. We believe

the idiosyncratic nature of most production means an experiment

is more valuable than broad advice. Experiments may also include trying diﬀerent formats — contests or hourly contracts — and diﬀerent platforms with diﬀerent mixes of contractors.

# with your progress.

Finally, many organizations may worry about information leakage,

especially around trade secrets or intellectual property. However,

even before the pandemic, freelancing and contest platforms evolved

to address many of these problems, and their lessons are useful

for managers thinking about hiring any remote worker, not just

a freelancer. Many platforms contain support for non-disclosure

agreements and other legal agreements that can help to protect IP. It’s

also possible that the decontextualization that helps to facilitate using

## open talent reduces IP risk — for example, information leakage without

context tends to be a less useful datapoint than seeing the big picture. In

fact, many quantitative hedge funds manage IP risks in similar ways. As

a result, the open model can potentially create siloes that, in some cases,

## protect IP better than traditional working arrangements.

# What Will This Mean in the Long Run?

What will a broader move to ﬂexible talent mean for pay? Managers who

are used to leveraging an army of consultants or temps from staﬃng

agencies might expect to pay a premium for ﬂexible talent, whereas

those who have outsourced work to low-cost areas may expect cost

savings. Managers should recognize that increases in the willingness

to use open talent will mean competition with the best ﬁrms for the

best talent. In a globalized, online economy, Western ﬁrms won’t just

## compete with local Indian ﬁrms for the best Indian talent, but instead

with anyone willing to pay for digital work. As a result, we expect

that open talent will help democratize access to opportunities, and will

potentially raise living standards in places where local opportunities are

# scarce.
