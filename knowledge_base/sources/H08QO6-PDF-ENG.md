Delegating to your direct reports is simple. They report to you, so when

you assign work, they know it’s part of their job. But with peers, it’s

trickier. Take what happened to Preston, who had recently stepped

into a VP role leading Customer Experience. His ﬁrst major initiative

involved rejiggering workﬂows across Sales, Support, and Product—all

## overseen by fellow VPs with aggressive quarterly targets of their own.

“I used to just tell my team what to do,” he told me. “But now I spend

half my day convincing colleagues to prioritize my projects alongside

# theirs.”

The higher you rise, the more your success depends on delivering

results through people who don’t report to you, namely your peers.

Sometimes you need specialized expertise, like a forecast from Finance

or a contract from Legal. Other times, you simply need more hands to

deliver at the scale and pace your projects demand, requiring you to

# delegate sideways.

It’s hard to ask for time and attention from colleagues who have

demanding roles just like yours and wouldn’t appreciate someone

else’s work being dumped onto their plate. Delegating across means

managing egos, politics, and invisible dynamics, so here’s how to share

the load and enlist the help you need, without overstepping.

Assess which tasks fit the bill.

You’re likely asking your peer to mobilize multiple members of their

team, reallocate resources, and potentially delay their own deliverables,

which is why you have to be selective about what you hand oﬀ. Before

you ask a peer to take something on, gut-check whether it truly makes

sense for their team to own it. Delegating the wrong kind of task—

## something too far outside their domain or clearly low-priority for them

—could strain the relationship and likely result in a fast “no” (even if it’s

# a polite one).

Consider delegating tasks that naturally fall within their expertise,

rely on tools or processes their team already uses, or will ultimately

beneﬁt them more than it beneﬁts you. For example, if you’re leading a

customer-facing project that requires analytics support, it makes more

sense to ask your peer in Data to take the lead on reporting, rather than

trying to do it yourself and then looping them in later. When the work

supports their goals, makes them look good, or makes their job easier in

the long run, they’re more likely to see it as a win-win, not a one-sided

# favor.

# Frame requests as partnerships.

Skip the direct language you’d use with your team (“I need you to handle

this”) and start with context to set the stage for collaboration. Open with

something like, “As we think about upcoming training needs, I want to make sure we’re eﬃcient…” or “Looking at where this process should

# live long-term…”

Acknowledge their expertise and signal that you see them (or their

team) as the best person for the job. That could sound like, “Since you’ve

built these client relationships over the years…” or “Given your track

# record with similar implementations…”

Then highlight the mutual beneﬁt and invite discussion. For example,

“This would give you more direct input into how we handle X. Would

it make sense for your department to own this going forward?” or “This

could help both of us avoid duplicate work and streamline things. I’d

love your thoughts on having your team drive this.”

Contract to create accountability.

Getting the initial “yes” from a peer is one thing; making sure the

work actually gets done is another challenge. Questions are great to

clarify ownership without imposing. Try phrases like, “Could we map

out checkpoints that work for both of us?” or “what timeline could you

reasonably commit to?” Let them suggest milestones where possible and

make the tracking process feel lightweight:

- “I think touch bases every other week would be useful. Does that work

for you?”

- “How about we create a shared document so we can both check in

# easily?”

When you have non-negotiables, be direct: “I want to be up front. We

need this by March 1st for the board meeting. If that timing doesn’t

work, let’s ﬁgure out a diﬀerent approach now rather than hitting an

issue later.”

Document your agreements. Oﬀer to send a quick email summarizing

what you discussed, including deadlines, check-ins, and your respective

# roles.

# Address pushback with curiosity.

If your peer says they don’t have bandwidth, dig deeper: “Tell me more

about what your team is juggling right now.” Maybe you can extend the

timeline, break the work into smaller pieces, or take on more of the

up-front lift before handing it oﬀ.

If your colleague seems hesitant about the commitment, ask directly,

“What concerns do you have about taking this on?” Their reluctance

might stem from a past experience, a lack of clarity, or competing

priorities—things you can problem-solve together if surfaced.

And if the objection is, “This doesn’t feel like it should be our job,” stay

open. For example, say, “Help me understand what parts don’t feel like

a natural ﬁt?” If you still believe they’re the best owner, don’t shy away

from saying so. Try something like: “I hear your concerns. The thing is,

your team is already the go-to for this type of reporting. Bringing us in

would create confusion.”

Follow up without overstepping.

Checking on delegated work with peers requires ﬁnesse. Instead of

“Where are we at with this?” which may seem like checking up on them,

try, “Is there anything you need to keep this moving forward?” or “What

obstacles can we help clear?”

Rather than “Is this done yet?” try, “I’d love your thoughts on what

you’re seeing in the data so far” or “I’m curious how the new process is

working from your perspective.” Show you value their judgment, while

subtly getting details about the status.

Maybe they agreed to updates but you’re hearing nothing, or they

respond with vague answers. Refer back to your shared agreements:

“When we kicked oﬀ, we talked about weekly recaps. We count on those,

so what can we do to get those each Monday?” or ask, “When you say it’s

moving along, what stage are we at?”

. . .

At ﬁrst, sideways delegation can feel slower and more cumbersome than

handing something oﬀ to your team. But once trust is built and you’ve

dialed in your process, you can each achieve unprecedented results.
