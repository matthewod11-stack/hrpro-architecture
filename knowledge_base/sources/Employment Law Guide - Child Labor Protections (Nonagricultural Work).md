## Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), as amended (PDF)

(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf)

(29 USC §201 et seq.(http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/201.html); 29 CFR Parts 570 to

## 580(https://www.dol.gov/dol/cfr/Title_29/Chapter_V.htm))

# Who is Covered

The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are administered by the Wage and Hour

Division (WHD). These provisions are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and to

prohibit their employment in jobs and under conditions detrimental to their health and well‑being. In

nonagricultural work, the child labor provisions apply to enterprises with employees engaging in interstate

commerce, producing goods for interstate commerce, or handling, selling, or working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for interstate commerce. For most ﬁrms, an annual dollar volume of

## business test of not less than $500,000 applies.

Employees of ﬁrms that do not meet the $500,000 annual dollar volume test may be subject to the FLSA's

child labor provisions in any workweek in which they are individually engaged in interstate commerce, the

production of goods for interstate commerce, or an activity that is closely related and directly essential to the production of such goods.

The Act covers the following employers regardless of their dollar volume of business: hospitals; institutions

primarily engaged in the care of the sick, aged, mentally ill, or disabled who reside on the premises; schools

for children who are mentally or physically disabled, or gifted; preschools, elementary and secondary schools,

# and institutions of higher education; and Federal, state, and local government agencies.

While 16 is the minimum age for most nonfarm work, minors aged 14 and 15 may work outside of school

hours in certain occupations under certain conditions. Minors may, at any age: deliver newspapers; perform in

radio, television, movies, or theatrical productions; work for their parents in their solely owned nonfarm

businesses (except in mining, manufacturing, or in any other occupation declared hazardous by the

Secretary); or gather evergreens and make evergreen wreaths.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The child labor provisions of the Act include restrictions on hours of work and occupations for youths under

age 16. These provisions also set forth 17 hazardous occupations orders for jobs that the Secretary has

declared too dangerous for those under age 18 to perform.

The permissible jobs and hours of work, by age, in nonfarm work are as follows:

Minors age 18 or older are not subject to restrictions on jobs or hours

Minors age 16 and 17 may perform any job not declared hazardous by the Secretary, and are not subject to

# restrictions on hours

Minors age 14 and 15 may work outside school hours in various nonmanufacturing, non-mining, nonhazardous jobs listed by the Secretary in regulations published at 29 CFR Part 570 under the following

conditions: no more than three hours on a school day, 18 hours in a school week, eight hours on a non-

school day, or 40 hours in a non-school week. In addition, they may not begin work before 7 a.m. or work

after 7 p.m., except from June 1 through Labor Day, when evening hours are extended until 9 p.m. The

# permissible work for 14 and 15 year olds is limited to those jobs speciﬁcally listed in the Secretary's

# regulations. WHD's regulations provide some exceptions to these limitations on hours worked for 14 and 15

year olds enrolled in an approved Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) or Work Study Program (WSP).

Detailed information on the occupations determined to be hazardous by the Secretary is available from a local

## Wage and Hour Division oﬃce and in 29 CFR Part 570.

By regulation, employers must keep records of the dates of birth of employees under age 19, their daily

starting and quitting times, their daily and weekly hours of work, and their occupations. The FLSA provides that an employer that has on ﬁle an oﬃcially-issued employment or age certiﬁcate showing that the minor is

the minimum age required by the FLSA is not liable for violating the child labor provisions if that

documentation proves to be incorrect. Age or employment certiﬁcates issued under most state laws are

generally acceptable for this purpose. See 29 CFR 570.5.

# Employee Rights

The FLSA also gives an employee the right to ﬁle a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division and testify or

in other ways cooperate with an investigation or legal proceeding without being ﬁred or discriminated against

# in any other manner.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Every employer of employees subject to the FLSA's minimum wage provisions must post, and keep posted, a

notice(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm) explaining the Act in a conspicuous place in all of their establishments. Although there is no size requirement for the poster, employees must be able to

readily read it. The FLSA poster is also available in

Spanish(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsaspan.htm),

Chinese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwagecn.pdf),

Russian(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/FLSAPosterRuss.pdf), Thai, (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageThai.pdf) Hmong,

## (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageHmong.pdf)

## Vietnamese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageViet.pdf), and

Korean(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageKorean.pdf). There is no requirement to post the

poster in languages other than English(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm).

Covered employers are required to post the general Fair Labor Standards Act poster; however, certain

industries have posters designed speciﬁcally for them. Employers of Agricultural Employees (PDF)

(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/wh1386Agrcltr.pdf) and State & Local Government Employees

# (PDF)(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/wh1385State.pdf) can either post the general Fair Labor

# Standards Act poster(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm) or their speciﬁc industry poster.

There are also posters for American Samoa (PDF) (https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/americanSamoa/ASminwagePoster.pdf) and Northern Mariana Islands (PDF)

## (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/cnmi.pdf).

Every employer who employs workers with disabilities under special minimum wage certiﬁcates is also

required to post the Employee Rights for Workers with Disabilities/Special Minimum Wage

## Poster(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters/section-14c).

# Recordkeeping

Every employer covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) must keep certain records for each

covered(/elaws/whd/ﬂsa/overtime/glossary.htm?wd=covered), nonexempt(/elaws/whd/ﬂsa/overtime/glossary.htm?

# wd=non_exempt) worker.

There is no required form for the records. However, the records must include accurate information about the

employee and data about the hours worked and the wages earned. The following is a listing of the basic

payroll records that an employer must maintain:

Employee's full name, as used for Social Security purposes, and on the same record, the employee's

identifying symbol or number if such is used in place of name on any time, work, or payroll records Address, including zip code

# Birth date, if younger than 19

# Sex and occupation

## Time and day of week when employee's workweek begins

Hours worked each day and total hours worked each workweek Basis on which employee's wages are paid (e.g., "$9 per hour", "$440 a week", "piecework")

# Regular hourly pay rate

## Total daily or weekly straight-time earnings

# Total overtime earnings for the workweek

All additions to or deductions from the employee's wages Total wages paid each pay period

Date of payment and the pay period covered by the payment

For a full listing of the basic records that an employer must maintain, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact

# Sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements under the FLSA(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs21.pdf).

Employers are required to preserve for at least three years payroll records, collective bargaining agreements, and sales and purchase records. Records on which wage computations are based should be retained for two

years. These include time cards and piecework tickets, wage rate tables, work and time schedules, and

## records of additions to or deductions from wages.

The FLSA does not contain any speciﬁc reporting requirements; however, the above referenced records must be open for inspection by the Wage and Hour Division's representatives, who may ask the employer to make

extensions, computations, or transcriptions. The records may be kept at the place of employment or in a

# central records oﬃce.

# Penalties/Sanctions

The child labor "hot goods" provision of the Act prohibits the shipment or delivery of goods in interstate

commerce that were produced in or about an establishment where a child labor violation occurred in the past

30 days. It is also a violation of the Act to ﬁre or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for

ﬁling a complaint or for participating in a legal proceeding under the Act.

Employers are subject to a civil money penalty of up to $11,000 per worker for each violation of the child labor provisions. In addition, employers are subject to a civil money penalty of $50,000 for each violation occurring

after May 21, 2008 that causes the death or serious injury of any minor employee - such penalty may be

doubled, up to $100,000, when the violations are determined to be willful or repeated. When a civil money

penalty is assessed, employers have the right to ﬁle an exception to the determination within 15 days of

receipt of the notice of such penalty. When an exception is ﬁled, it is referred to an Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and determination as to whether the penalty is appropriate. Either party may appeal the decision

of the Administrative Law Judge to the Department of Labor's Administrative Review Board. If an exception is

not ﬁled within the 15 days, the penalty becomes ﬁnal.

The Act also provides for a criminal ﬁne of up to $10,000 upon conviction for a willful violation. For a second

conviction for a willful violation, the Act provides for a ﬁne of not more than $10,000 and imprisonment for up to six months, or both. The Secretary may also bring suit to obtain injunctions to restrain persons from

violating the Act.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

Many states have child labor laws. Nothing in the FLSA excuses noncompliance with a state law that establishes a higher standard than that provided in the FLSA. See 29 U.S.C. 218(a).
