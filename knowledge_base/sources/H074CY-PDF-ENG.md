Dissatisfaction with performance appraisals is pervasive. They are

seen as time-consuming, demotivating, inaccurate, biased, and unfair.

A McKinsey survey indicates most CEOs don’t ﬁnd the appraisal process

in their companies helps to identify top performers, while over half of

employees think their managers don’t get the performance review right.

A Gallup study is more negative: Just one in ﬁve employees agreed that

their company’s performance practices motivated them.

These attitudes create a self-reinforcing dynamic. Managers do cursory

reviews that are really up or down compensation announcements,

not feedback. Employees then see the “appraisal” as non-existent or

unfair and approach the next review with that attitude. Busy managers

facing quarterly goals then try to avoid the unpleasantness and do even

more cursory, drive-by reviews, and a downward spiral continues that

promotes a culture of underperformance.

Some ﬁrms have stopped performance ratings entirely. As another

McKinsey study notes, however, when “organizations scrapped

the performance ratings, they found a need for a form of

annual documented administrative evaluation to make employment

decisions, such as promotions and raises. To address this need,

these organizations often implemented ‘ghost’ ratings—a system of

evaluation that is, ultimately, just another annual performance rating.”

In other words, meet the new boss, same as the old boss.

In this article, I examine performance review best practices and attempt

to help managers reﬁne how the process is planned, conducted, and

repeated. Following these recommendations can improve employee

performance, while also giving managers a more eﬀective structure for how to have these sometimes diﬃcult, but necessary, conversations.

# Rethinking Performance Reviews

Rethinking performance reviews should not mean getting rid of this

essential managerial responsibility. So, what’s the purpose and key

## components of an eﬀective performance review process?

The purpose of reviews is two-fold: an accurate and actionable

evaluation of performance, and then development of that person’s

skills in line with job tasks. For recipients, feedback has intrinsic and

extrinsic value. Across ﬁelds, research shows that people become high

performers by identifying speciﬁc areas where they need to improve

and then practicing those skills with performance feedback. Multiple

career studies indicate the importance of on-the-job versus other types

of experience. One study from as far back as 1988 (and updated

20 years later with similar results) found that work experience (job

## assignments, organizational relationships, and especially performance

## feedback) accounts for about 70% of the professional-development

learning relevant to career advancement, with about 15% each for

## formal training courses and life experience (hobbies, interests, family:

the other things you do and love outside work).

For the giver of feedback, the process is key to getting people to practice

the right things, prioritize opportunities, and clarify accountabilities

owned by the individual versus the manager or the company. It’s also

key to eﬀective leadership. The higher you rise in any organization,

the more dependent you are on subordinates’ performance. This reality

has implications for what managers must do before, during, and after a

# review.

# What to Do Before the Review

In ongoing work with their employees, managers must ﬁrst make clear

the standards, including ethical standards, by which performance will

be judged: what’s important and how much you expect. This may

seem obvious, but it’s often not done because new managers are

unsure or uninformed about how unit goals align with strategy; because

experienced managers may have lost touch with market or strategy

## changes; or because over time turnover in management results in mixed

# signals about performance.

Second, performance reviews are about what people do for a living and

often their pay and job assignments. These important topics take time

to discuss. You must make time on your calendar to avoid quick reviews

that leave people feeling confused or unvalued. Managers must also

take the time to pay attention to peoples’ behaviors far in advance of

the actual review date if they’re going to be helpful about the impact

## of those on-the-job behaviors on others in or outside the organization.

You want people focused on the relevant causal relationships and not

just enacting the natural human tendency to ascribe credit for good

outcomes to oneself and the causes of bad outcomes to someone or

# something else.

Third, eﬀective reviews require a judgment about causes of a person’s

performance. For example, are performance issues the consequence

of deﬁciencies in motivation or ability? Some people may work hard,

but lack certain capabilities: Can training and coaching enhance those

capabilities? Others may have the abilities but lack motivation: Can

diﬀerent incentives or processes increase motivation? Still others may

seemingly lack both motivation and relevant ability: Is this the right

job for that person? Can a performance improvement plan help, or a

diﬀerent role where their abilities can be better utilized? Or is it time to

replace this person?

Finally, stars often have both high motivation and ability: What can be

done to reward, retain and learn from the stars’ behaviors?

These are not easy judgments to make about human beings. But they’re necessary and imply diﬀerent action plans. Without them, it’s diﬃcult

to be mutually productive during the review.

# What to Convey During the Review

Here are ﬁve steps useful in guiding a performance review conversation:

Convey your positive intent.

A review is about feedback aimed at increasing the recipient’s

eﬀectiveness. If you don’t really have this intent— for example, if you

believe that issues of motivation and/or ability overwhelm the potential

contribution, then you’re not really having a performance conversation,

and you can ignore the following steps. The conversation you should

have is one in which you discuss moving that person out of that job.

By contrast, consider a review with a promising employee with whom

you have invested time. You might clarify your intent by noting,

“You’ve done a good job settling into the role and orienting yourself

to our ﬁrm. Your challenge now is to transition to more independent

roles over the next year. That means less speciﬁc task direction or

intervention is available for you when problems arise. So I’m counting

on you to handle more on your own, and I’ll be evaluating that at our

# next review.”

That employee might respond, “I understand, but can you then sponsor

me for training in areas where I’ll be more independent and clarify

the judgments and decisions where you want to stay involved versus

those where I now have more say-so?” Both parties are now working on

agreed-upon behaviors, not simply slogans like “be more strategic” or

# “demonstrate leadership qualities.”

Describe speciﬁcally what you have observed.

## The more speciﬁc and descriptive your feedback about strengths

and weaknesses, the more likely the other person will understand.

Describe illustrative or critical incidents which indicate the impact

on performance. Too much performance feedback is of the “do good

and avoid evil” variety. That may sound harmless, but overly general

feedback increases feelings of defensiveness, rather than openness

to behavior change, because it involves broad judgments and invites

counterpunching rather than discussion.

For example, saying “Your presentation was bad” is little more

than a perception and an exhortation to “get better.” Saying, “Your

presentation didn’t include information on demographics, total life-

cycle costs, and payment terms” makes it easier to receive negative

comments and take corrective action because both manager and

employee can now concentrate on elements that can be improved.

State the impact of the behavior or action.

Many employees are unaware of the impact of their actions on

outcomes. That’s why we have managers. But managing means

discussing cause-and-eﬀect linkages between behaviors and outcomes.

For example, it’s one thing to say to a salesperson, “You didn’t connect

with the buyer.” It’s quite another to say, “You interrupted people

throughout the meeting, and this resulted in that buyer being less open

to listening to your ideas.”

Remember that people won’t change their personality after a

## performance review. Focus on the behaviors within a person’s control.

This also helps to minimize a common cloning bias in organizations: Is

there a problem with that person’s performance or is their performance

achieved using a style that their manager would not use to do the job?

Always be clear about the diﬀerence.

Ask the other person to respond.

Eﬀective reviews are a two-way transfer of information, not only

directions from a manager. Most people want to know about their

performance. But the Rashomon eﬀect is alive and well in ﬁrms;

two people can observe the same event or outcome yet interpret it

# diﬀerently.

Dialogue is important, therefore, not just because it’s polite and

typically characteristic of eﬀective organizational cultures, but also,

because it tests assumptions and reasoning. Does my view of your

interactions with colleagues make sense? Here is the data or other input

I’m using to make this assessment: What am I missing? Is it an issue of

resources or something else? Here are the priorities in our unit: Do you

understand, and do you agree? If not, why not?

Dialogue also opens other relevant purposes of a review: the possibility

that the manager’s behaviors, policies or management style may be part

## of the performance problem and opportunity.

# So What? Now What?

A review is incomplete without a discussion of next steps in which

both parties take appropriate responsibility for change options. But

responsibility for this closure rests with the manager. On what assets

can you capitalize to increase eﬀectiveness? Are there assignments that

can increase learning, deliberate practice, or other elements relevant to

core tasks? Can HR help? What is the timetable and benchmarks to use

in measuring progress after the review?

# What to Do After the Review

The biggest impact from performance conversations is often what

happens after the review. Too often, nothing happens: The review is an

isolated annual event and therefore has little real impact. But research

on behavioral change and the continuous improvement required for

innovation highlights the importance of setting goals and providing

ongoing feedback about progress toward goals.

Put regular follow-ups on the schedule.

Technology is lowering the costs of doing this. For example, a study

of programs designed to increase peoples’ savings ﬁnd that follow-

up text messages, simply informing the person of their savings rates

versus others, are about 80% as eﬀective as in-person meetings. Other

studies, in areas ranging from health care to voting to energy usage to

drinking habits, ﬁnd that these reminders signiﬁcantly aﬀect behavior

and improve outcomes.

Managers can use these technologies to provide regular feedback. The

key is making follow-ups an iterative process from which individuals

# and the ﬁrm derive value.

# Look for patterns.

Regular follow-up also provides managers with the opportunity to look

for patterns and create a virtuous cycle of assessment and investment

by potentially reallocating money, time and people to align better with

# strategic imperatives.

For example, in a ﬁrm facing a complex technical sale with a 24-to-30-

month selling cycle, the VP of sales detected the following pattern that

emerged from reviews: It was taking nine to 12 months to complete the

trial or proof-of-concept portion of the selling task — a cash-drain for

a VC-funded startup. He also saw commonalities in what reps said that

customers wanted in trials. So, the ﬁrm developed a platform that took

## customers through the process with the assistance of the operations

group, not salespeople. The result has been to reduce the selling cycle to

12 to 14 months and make better use of limited sales resources.

The venerable maxim still applies: “People join companies, but they

leave managers,” because feedback and coaching are crucial for

professional growth and development. It’s striking how many successful

people, when asked about their careers, point to a manager who

provided them with useful (even if initially unwanted) feedback. In

turn, they come to realize that, as managers, they must demonstrate

that they care about their people and are worthy of trust in assessing

# performance.
