Everyone beneﬁts when employees feel comfortable speaking up.

Whether you’re a team lead seeking product design ideas, a manager

sourcing feedback on a new policy, or a top executive looking for input

on a major strategic decision, it’s critical to create an environment

in which people are encouraged to candidly share their ideas and

# opinions.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Unintended Consequences of Asking for Employee Input

However, our new research (forthcoming in the Journal of Applied

Psychology) suggests that the approach many managers take when

trying to create such an environment — that is, actively inviting

employees to provide their input — can have unintended negative

## consequences: Through a ﬁeld survey and an experimental study with

a total of nearly 1,000 working professionals in the U.S. and India, we

found that the more managers solicited input from their employees, the

less likely they were to reward employees for speaking up. This could

be highly demoralizing for the employees, who had invested time and

eﬀort in developing and speaking up about ideas that could help their

# teams.

Why does this happen? Let’s say you’re a manager on a software team,

and your employee, Susan, just shared a potential solution to a known

product issue. If Susan spoke up unprompted, you would likely view

her as a very proactive employee, and a strong candidate for a raise,

high-proﬁle project, or promotion. On the other hand, if Susan shared

the same idea, but only did so after you asked for her input during a

meeting, you might think that Susan only spoke up because you told

her to. In this situation, you might credit yourself for Susan’s actions,

and thus not reward Susan as highly — even though she oﬀered equally

# valuable input in both cases.

This is an easy trap for managers to fall into. It’s generally hard to

tell how valuable an idea will be upfront, and it’s often necessary to

produce many “bad” ideas in order to uncover a few good ones. As such,

managers don’t often reward employees solely based on the apparent

value of the ideas they contribute, and instead focus on rewarding

employees’ proactivity in coming up with and expressing ideas.

The problem is, when managers actively solicit employee input, it can

lead them to discount the proactivity it still takes for employees to

come up with and express their ideas. Rather than rewarding employees

for that eﬀort, we found that managers would often take credit

themselves for creating an environment that they felt had enabled

employees to speak up. In other words, soliciting input led managers

to assume (consciously or subconsciously) that their employees were

only speaking up because they were asked to, making them less likely to

# reward employees for those ideas.

Of course, this is not to suggest that managers shouldn’t invite their

employees to contribute ideas. Explicitly soliciting input is a great

way to gather new, innovative ideas from employees who might not

otherwise feel comfortable or conﬁdent enough to speak up. But our

research illustrates how it can also make managers less likely to reward

employees for speaking up, and thus potentially reduce employees’

motivation to continue sharing their ideas.

# Acknowledge Your Biases

To address this tension, managers should ﬁrst acknowledge that they

may be susceptible to a bias that leads them to credit themselves for

their employees’ actions. This is not an entirely new concept: There is a

body of research documenting a related bias known as the Romance of

Leadership eﬀect, which refers to how people tend to see leaders (rather

## than employees) as the main cause of positive outcomes on a team.

As with any bias, managers’ acknowledgment of their own tendency to

discount employee eﬀort and overly credit themselves is the ﬁrst step to

overcoming it.

# Recognize That Good Ideas Are Co-Created

Next, managers can further reduce the potency of this bias by

recognizing that on a team, ideas develop via a process of co-creation

between leaders and employees. Even if managers take steps to create

conditions that are favorable for idea generation, such as ensuring a

welcoming, inclusive environment and actively seeking out employees’

viewpoints and suggestions, they should not invalidate the eﬀort it

still takes for employees to provide that input. Employees often invest

substantial time and eﬀort into analyzing work processes and products,

identifying issues and problems, developing solutions, and expressing

## their thoughts in an appropriate and persuasive manner. Managers

shouldn’t let their own eﬀorts in soliciting input be a reason to negate

the eﬀort employees demonstrate when they speak up.

Ultimately, it’s up to managers to create a work environment where

employees are empowered to openly share their ideas and concerns.

That means not only rewarding proactivity, but also demonstrating

that all input is valued and recognized — regardless of whether it was

solicited or oﬀered without prompting.
