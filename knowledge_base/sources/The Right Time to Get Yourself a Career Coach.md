mentoring can occur in a one-oﬀ meeting or in a years-long professional relationship, coaching relationships typicallyhave a clear timeline that involves evaluating improvements inyour behaviors and developments in your skillsets.

While mentors don’t need professional training to land the role(anyone who is willing and committed can do it), career coachesoften have gone through trainings and are certiﬁcated in theirﬁeld of expertise.In the past, coaching was expensive and reserved for topleadership, but today it’s become much more accessible.

leadership role by helping you develop skills that are criticalto your career progression.Here are some signs that you’re ready to go on this journey:

Perhaps you’re successful at work, but you know you canaccomplish more. Why aren’t you the one to lead that newinnovative project? Why aren’t you selected to present at the nextconference? Why aren’t you getting promoted? You feel youdeserve something more, but you don’t know what you need to doto prove yourself.Or maybe your family members, peers, and mentors give youcontradictory feedback, leaving you confused.

colleges andalumni relations offices offer no- or low-cost career coachingthrough their career services center. Coaching associations, likethe

Now that you understand better what a coach is and is not, andwhere you can find one, let’s take a look at how you can findyourself the right coach.

Before you reach out to a coach, reflect on what you want to getout of the relationship. Do you want to step up into a leadershiprole? Are you looking to start a new business? Or are you justtrying to figure out what kind of role will make you feel fulfilled?You need to know what you want in order to choose the rightperson to guide you towards it.

As you look into different coaches, pay attention to theirbackgrounds and expertise. Many coaches will include a shortdescription of their focus areas in a bio or in their online profiles.What did they study? What services are they specialized in? Dothey work with a lot of young professionals? Read up on anyarticles they’ve written to get an impression of whether yourperspectives match and if you’d like to work with this person. Youcan start to put together a shortlist of a few people whom you’reinterested in.

Hi, Erna. I got your contact from Mark Dupont. I’m lookingfor some help with my career. I feel stuck in my job and I’mnot sure if my decision to get into creative services was theright one. When I accepted the job, I believed this area wasmy strength, but as time goes by, I feel I’m more suited tobusiness development and winning the contract for theteam, not actually doing the creative work. I’m looking forsome guidance, and I’d love to chat with you aboutpotentially working together. Do you have some time thisweek? Thank you. Best regards, Priya.

Don’t just go with the first person who responds. Even the coachwas referred, it doesn’t necessarily mean they’re going to be a fit.It’s okay to have a few conversations and decide who you’d like towork with and who you can trust. Most coaching engagementswill last many months and making that journey with somebodyyou feel comfortable with is important. Here are some practicalquestions you might ask coaches when you interview them.

What is your coaching expertise? Have you worked withyoung professionals before? Make sure your coach hasexperience and/or certiﬁcations and can share some successstories. Expect the more experienced coaches to be pricier.

What is your coaching style? Coaches use diﬀerentapproaches, and some might match your needs better thanothers. Do you prefer a more action-oriented coach or a coachwho will require you to be more introspective?

Will the sessions be online or face to face? Some people feelmore comfortable interacting online than face to face.Understand what type of interactions you prefer, as well as theﬂexibility of the coach.

A coaching relationship is intimate. To get real work done, you’regoing to need to be vulnerable with this person. During theinterview, be mindful of how you feel: Do you feel the coachlistens to you intently? Are you psychologically safe enough toexpress yourself? Are they talking more than you do? Do theyalready have an agenda before hearing your particular needs?It could take a few tries to find the right coach. Don’t shy awayfrom doing a few introductory sessions. But remember, coachingisn’t magic. In order to make the most of it, you’ll have to make aneffort. If you’re ready to take your career to the next level, now is agood time to engage with a coach.
