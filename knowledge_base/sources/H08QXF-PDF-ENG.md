Organizations often urge employees to report abusive behavior,

believing that doing so is key to addressing misconduct. But our

research shows that whether a report leads to corrective action doesn’t

just depend on what is reported, but also who is doing the reporting.

In our forthcoming paper in Organization Science, we analyzed

thousands of workplace reports, combining archival data from U.S.

government employees with ﬁve experiments, to examine how reporter

gender shapes corrective action. We found that reports made by women

are less likely to be taken seriously than identical reports made by men.

This gap is widest when reports lack supporting evidence, something

our data show is especially common in workplace abuse cases.

In order for leaders to address the gendered biases that impact how

misconduct is handled, they need to understand why they occur. We

analyze our data to oﬀer insights and recommendations for companies

to help them build the kind of equitable systems that their employees

can trust.

# Why Reports from Women Are Discounted

When a report lacks clear evidence, decision-makers tend to fall back on

judgments about credibility. Our research shows that women’s reports

are signiﬁcantly less likely than men’s to be seen as credible. This

reﬂects long-standing stereotypes that women are more emotional or

# less objective than men.

In one study, we analyzed publicly available data from the 2016

## Merit Principles Survey, a large-scale and systematic survey of federal

workers. Across over 2,000 employees, our data revealed that reports

made by women were less likely to result in corrective action. This eﬀect

held even after accounting for factors like employee rank and abuse

# type.

Next, we conducted a series of online experiments to replicate our

eﬀect in a controlled environment. We recruited employed adults and

asked them to evaluate diﬀerent reports of abuse. We used artiﬁcial

intelligence to create identical voice recordings that diﬀered only in the

reporter’s gender. As we found previously, participants were less likely

to escalate reports made by women versus men, even when the alleged

abuse was exactly the same.

However, in one condition, we added corroborating evidence, such as

chat logs. Here, we found that reports by men and women were treated

the same. This pattern suggests that ﬁnding ways to ensure that reports

without strong initial corroboration are investigated is critical to close

# this gap.

## How Organizations Can Build Fairer Systems

Many organizations already have formal systems for reporting

misconduct, but these systems often fall short in practice. Recent

data suggests employees are more likely to report concerns to their

managers rather than hotlines. This means that informal processes

often determine which reports are acted on and which are quietly

dropped. Indeed, in many organizations, managers have wide discretion

over whether to escalate a report.

Even when employees use formal tools, like hotlines or online

platforms, organizations may apply them inconsistently or without suﬃcient follow-up. Improving these procedures isn’t just about adding

new tools, but rather it’s about redesigning the process to ensure

every report gets a fair evaluation. That is, to build fairer systems,

organizations should limit informal judgment and ensure all reports are

evaluated consistently.

- 1. Separate report evaluators from report receivers

Managers shouldn’t decide which reports to act on. All allegations of

abuse should be forwarded to a trained, centralized entity—regardless

of the manager’s personal judgment. For example, Novartis’ SpeakUp

platform is staﬀed by professionals who are trained to evaluate reports

of misconduct, including reports that initially lack strong corroboration.

Separating intake from evaluation helps ensure decisions are based on

# evidence, not assumptions.

- 2. Standardize how reports are evaluated

Create a consistent, formal process for assessing all reports of abuse or

misconduct. One eﬀective strategy is to redact identifying information

(e.g., name, gender, role) to reduce the inﬂuence of identity-based

assumptions and eliminate penalties tied to anonymous reporting.

- 3. Commit to following up on every report

Establish a clear policy that all reports—regardless of who makes them

or how much evidence is provided—will receive a formal, documented

follow-up. An eﬀective system will not only provide updates to

reporters, but do so in a timely manner.

- 4. Create alternative and protected reporting channels

Ensure employees don’t have to rely solely on their manager to raise

concerns. Oﬀer multiple, safe pathways for reporting. For example,

considering creating reactive channels (i.e. formal whistleblowing

hotlines) and proactive channels (such as “pulse surveys” implemented

by McKinsey that solicit employee concerns).

- 5. Support reporters with follow-up tools

Give reporters the option to provide additional information after their

initial report and make it easy for others to add corroboration if

they witnessed similar events. For example, certain platforms allow

employees to add information or anonymously chat with investigators

after ﬁling reports.

Reports of workplace abuse are serious signals—of abuse of power,

mistreatment, or other systemic problems. But when those signals are

ﬁltered through informal systems, organizations risk reinforcing the

very inequities they aim to solve. By creating more intentional and

is treated with the seriousness it deserves, no matter who makes it.
