## Our previous article on the persistent negative impact of resume gaps

received a good deal of reader attention. It’s not surprising, given

the events of 2024 in the white-collar talent market. From the very

## start of the year, companies like Amazon, BlackRock, and Citigroup

announced white-collar job reduction eﬀorts. In the fall, the Bureau of

Labor Statistics reported one in four American workers who lost their

jobs last year came from the business and professional services sector.

## HBR / Digital Article / How Costly Is a Resume Gap for Executives?

In September alone, nearly half a million such jobs were eliminated,

the highest number for such positions in two years. Tech, media,

consulting, and ﬁnance jobs are drying up at alarming rates.

As expected, full-time MBA applications soared last year, indicating that

young professionals saw fewer work opportunities, making the option of

taking some time to invest in learning more attractive. But even among

the top MBA programs, recent job placements are dropping.

Of course, not everyone has the option to consider going back to school.

More and more are looking for jobs, and it is taking longer to ﬁnd them.

In February, the Department of Labor reported that more than 7 million

people were looking for work, up 19% from the same time in 2023, and

1.5 million have been looking for work for more than six months. Now,

it takes more than ﬁve months to ﬁnd another job, half a month longer

than it did in 2023. Not surprisingly, the impact of this tightening job

market falls on white-collar workers, the same group that witnessed a

surge in hiring just two years before.

The looming prospect or current predicament of being between jobs

## creates understandable interest in the age-old question: How much will

resume gaps hurt my career?

In our last article, we polled executives on LinkedIn and found that

61% of respondents viewed resume gaps negatively. We examined

data among company-switching executives and found that while those

without resume gaps captured a 22% raise, those with gaps averaged

a 14% raise. We also looked at ﬁndings from a ResumeGo survey that

indicated that gaps could lower the chances of getting a callback for a

job application, particularly if the gap was longer than two years.

These ﬁndings sparked discussion on LinkedIn, so we decided to revisit

this topic. We asked more than 2,600 LinkedIn commenters: As an

employer, do you think a resume gap is relevant? Similar to our previous

ﬁndings, about two-thirds believed that resume gaps matter.

This time, we also asked if recency mattered. Among those contending

that gaps matter, more than half indicated that the negative signal

persists over time—that there is no expiration date on the impact of

gaps. This was consistent with our analysis of executives with resume

gaps who switched companies: We found the recency of the gap did not

measurably change the size of the negative ﬁnancial impact.

An analysis of the comments also pointed to some fresh angles:

If you’re going to have a resume gap, take control of the narrative.

In a previous HBR article, we discussed the compensation beneﬁts

of intentionally controlling our personal narratives. There is power in

owning your story and presenting your experience in a way that aligns

with the professional opportunities you’re seeking.

Our analysis indicates that for individuals with resume gaps, having

a richer digital professional proﬁle might help mitigate some of the

adverse impacts of a career gap. In our previous article on resume

gaps, we reported that job-switching executives without gaps received

an average 22% raise, but those with gaps only received 14% on

average. When we examined the digital professional proﬁles of the same

executives with resume gaps, we found those with stronger proﬁles

received an average 17% raise, while those with weaker proﬁles saw an

# average raise of only 13%.

## In reaction to our previous article, nearly half of LinkedIn commenters

argued that attitudes were changing and that employers were more

understanding of circumstances, such as caregiving, that could lead to

resume gaps. They also argued employers were beginning to recognize

that positive growth and development could occur during these gaps.

While it is encouraging to observe that taking control of your digital

narrative seems to mitigate some of the negative eﬀects of resume gaps,

the numbers still show gaps have a negative impact. This suggested to

us that there are still circumstances where gaps will matter more.

The effects of career gaps differ by region.

We know that pay raises diﬀer by region—what about the impact of

resume gaps? Our data showed regional diﬀerences here as well:

- In Asia, pay raises for executives without career gaps was 27%; this fell

# to 12% for those with gaps.

- In North America, pay raises for executives without career gaps

average 23%; this fell to 17% for those with gaps.

- In Europe, pay raises for executives without career gaps average 19%;

this fell to 12% for those with gaps.

- In Australia and New Zealand, the raises for both those with and

without gaps remained about the same—20%.

Publicly traded companies are less forgiving of career gaps.

Public companies are under more scrutiny compared to privately

held ones, as they must communicate and justify their approaches to

# investors and other stakeholders.

For publicly held ﬁrms, this added visibility can increase sensitivity to

visible signals in hiring. We were curious if this translated to higher

penalties for those with resume gaps. Our data shows that appears to be

the case. Among executives hired by public companies, raises for those

without gaps averaged 30%. That dropped to 16% for those with resume

# gaps.

Raises for ﬁrm-switching executives who were hired by private ﬁrms

were lower than public ﬁrms, around 16%. But for those with resume

gaps, the raise was still 14%, indicating far less of a penalty for having

# career breaks.

## The impact of career gaps varies by functional role.

We expected the impact of career gaps to vary depending on the

role and how readily transferrable their skills are to a new setting or

employer. Those with highly portable skills may suﬀer less, since they

are ready to plug into many settings. Moreover, the more enduring an

individual’s skills or expertise is over time, the less risk there is when it

comes to career breaks.

We found that a resume gap can be a big deal for those in general

management positions. Those without gaps had an average raise of 17%,

while those with gaps did not get any raise at all. Resume gaps also

had a signiﬁcant negative impact for those who worked in operations,

dropping from 25% raises for those without gaps to 8% for those with

# gaps.

The impact for sales and marketing executives was negative but less

severe. The 29% raises among sales executives without career gaps were

cut nearly in half to 15% for resumes with gaps. Marketing experienced a

# similar drop from 24% to 13%.

Finance executives stand out as having no measurable drop in raises

due to resume gaps. Regardless of whether there was a career gap, the

raises for ﬁrm-switching ﬁnance executives was 25% on average.

Bigger firms have bigger penalties.

As larger ﬁrms pay more and are more likely to adopt more formal

hiring processes, we thought they might also be choosier, adhering to

stricter selection criteria in hiring executives. Our data showed that

executives moving between ﬁrms employing more than 10,000 people

received an average 27% raise, compared to a 16% raise for those who

moved between smaller ﬁrms. Executives with career gaps who moved

between large ﬁrms saw an 18% average raise, a nine percentage point

drop. Raises for those with gaps moving between smaller ﬁrms were 11%,

# just a ﬁve percentage point drop.

Credentials don’t have offsetting effects.

Extra credentials can make you stand out. For example, those with

degrees from prestigious programs or who have MBAs are seen

as bringing something extra, and these qualiﬁcations are generally

associated with higher pay.

We suspected that such credentials might have a dampening eﬀect on

those with resume gaps, but our ﬁndings don’t support this. MBAs with

a resume gap suﬀered a ﬁve percentage point drop in average salary

compared to MBAs without gaps, similar to the broader population.

Having an Ivy League degree did not help, either.

## MBAs and Ivy Leaguers on average receive higher pay than their

counterparts from other schools, so we thought they might be

inoculated from the negative impact of resume gaps. But our data found

they don’t suﬀer any less from resume gaps.

. . .

Do resume gaps still matter, or have we moved into a world where they

can be explained? There is truth in both these positions. Career gaps can

have reasonable explanations. Since the pandemic, nearly everyone has

experienced ﬁrsthand the challenges of managing demands between

private and work lives. While the data indicates proactively telling your

story can help, the negative impact still lingers.

The shared experience of challenges beyond our control may have

ushered in a new age of empathy and openness to variety in career

paths, but resume gaps still matter, no matter how well we explain
