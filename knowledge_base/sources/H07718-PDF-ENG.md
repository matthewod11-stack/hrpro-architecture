Is sharing your personal political views in public worth the risk? If

your stances are aligned with those of your customers, employees, or

followers, taking a side is likely pretty harmless — and of course, if

you feel strongly enough, moral considerations may outweigh strategic

ones. But many leaders hesitate to take sides on controversial issues out

of fear that speaking out might alienate people who disagree with them.

abortion rights, a supervisor managing a team with divergent opinions

## on gun control, or just an individual chatting with coworkers about the

news, conventional wisdom suggests that staying neutral is often the

safe option. But is it?

While the desire to “stay out of it” is understandable, our recent

research suggests that this approach can backﬁre. We conducted a

## series of experiments with more than 4,000 participants across a wide

variety of workplace contexts, and we consistently found that people

tend to be more suspicious and less trusting of coworkers, managers,

and public ﬁgures who decline to take sides than of those who openly

express an opinion — even if it’s an opinion with which they disagree.

Furthermore, we also found that conspicuously staying neutral can

cause people to assume you’re trying to hide the fact that your views

oppose those of whomever you are addressing (even if they don’t),

making you come across poorly even to people who actually share your

# views.

For example, in one experiment, we showed participants a video clip

of a press conference in which the owner of an NFL team is asked

whether he believes players should be permitted to kneel during the

national anthem. He responds by saying he’d rather not take a side.

Most participants reported that they would ﬁnd the owner more honest,

sincere, and trustworthy if he took a position, even if that position went

against their own moral views. In addition, when participants were told

that the owner was being interviewed by a liberal news station, they

assumed he held conservative beliefs, but when they were told that he

was being interviewed by a conservative news station, they assumed

he held liberal beliefs. In other words, regardless of the owner’s actual

opinions, they suspected that that he was refusing to take sides because

he secretly disagreed with whoever he was talking to, making him seem

# insincere and untrustworthy.

In another experiment, we told participants that they would be working

with a partner on a cooperative task, and we gave them the choice

between a partner who disagreed with them about gun reform and one

who declined to share their opinion. We found that people preferred

to work with someone who openly disagreed with them than with

someone who wasn’t willing to take a stand either way, in large part

because the potential partners who refused to share their opinions were

perceived as less trustworthy.

It’s also important to note that this phenomenon isn’t limited to

controlled lab settings: Similar eﬀects are evident in countless real-

world environments. Taylor Swift, for example, was met with some

suspicion when she tried to stay neutral on political issues, eventually

causing her to shift to a more forthright communication style. Disney

CEO Bob Chapek also ran into trouble after brieﬂy attempting to remain

neutral over Florida’s controversial “Don’t Say Gay” bill (angering

liberals who opposed the eﬀort) before half-heartedly committing to

ﬁght against it (angering conservatives who supported it).

Within organizations, managers and employees who refuse to

participate in the political discussions of the day — even if their reasons

for doing so are sound — risk provoking the same moral suspicion.

Whether you’re talking with a handful of colleagues in a Zoom meeting

or releasing a public statement to millions of fans, trust is key — and

the longer you wait to weigh in, the more suspicious people are likely to

# become.

Of course, there is certainly a place for thoughtful neutrality. In our

studies, participants were generally much more tolerant of neutral

messaging if it seemed to reﬂect genuine uncertainty or middle-ground

beliefs, rather than coming across like a strategic dodge. Moreover,

people don’t punish neutrality that they don’t notice: If you can avoid

taking sides entirely by steering clear of forums in which politics come

up, inconspicuous silence will not incur the same trust penalty as

## conspicuous neutrality. But as customers and employees increasingly

## demand words and actions from leaders on the political causes they

care most about, trying to avoid the conversation — or oﬀering little

more than a cagey “I see the merits of both sides” or “I really can’t say

what I think” — is likely to provoke distrust and animosity.

Whether you are leading an organization, conducting a meeting, or

having dinner with friends, political topics are bound to come up.

The urge to avoid these hot-button issues is natural, but our research

demonstrates that trying not to take sides can backﬁre, causing you

to seem less trustworthy and pushing people to assume you secretly

disagree with them. In an increasingly polarized workplace and world,

building trust hinges on ﬁnding ways to discuss our beliefs and values,

even (and especially) with people who disagree. So if someone asks for

your opinion, be considerate, thoughtful, and respectful — but don’t be

afraid to take a side.
