Generative AI is reshaping industries by automating tasks and

augmenting human decision-making. However, as organizations

embrace AI, they must remain mindful of its impact on leadership and

governance structures. Firms have started experimenting with diﬀerent

ways of integrating AI into their board meetings, including for minute-

taking, agenda creation, and meeting documentation. And new AI-

powered board-management software is emerging to oﬀer advice and

# guide board discussions.

We’ve been conducting ongoing research into how board chairs have

exercised their power. A series of recent interviews highlighted several

ways in which AI could inadvertently diminish that power and

inﬂuence. Understanding and mitigating this “encroachment risk” AI

poses to board chairs is essential to maintaining eﬀective leadership

and ensuring AI supports rather than undermines their strategic

# objectives.

## The Role of Power-Conduit Tasks and Encroachment Risk

We interviewed 27 board chairs of companies listed on the Toronto

## Stock Exchange, with average assets of $9.04 billion and average

revenues of $3.7 billion. Industries included industrials (22%), energy

(17%), materials (17%), real estate (13%), information technology (9%),

ﬁnance (9%), consumer discretionary (9%), and healthcare (4%). Using

semi-structured interviews that averaged 54 minutes in length, we

discussed in detail how board chairs exercise power in their roles.

Multiple independent coders reviewed transcripts to identify speciﬁc

power-conduit tasks, or actions through which leaders exercise the

# power inherent in their roles.

Power-conduit tasks, such as setting meeting agendas and establishing

board committees, may appear routine but are vital for enabling leaders

to exert their inﬂuence. Encroachment risk occurs when board chairs

use AI applications to automate their tasks, but the use of AI ends up

weakening or eroding the board chair’s inﬂuence over power-conduit

# tasks.

# Board Chairs’ Power-Conduit Tasks

We identiﬁed three critical power-conduit tasks used by board chairs:

Managing the agenda

The board chair strategically determines which topics will be discussed

and in what order, inﬂuencing the priorities and ﬂow of board meetings.

Managing the agenda may seem straightforward, but around 30% of the

chairs said this was a major way they exercised inﬂuence. It’s not just

about listing the topics to be discussed; it’s about shaping the entire

ﬂow of the conversation: where each part goes, what gets emphasized,

and what’s not discussed at all or only when speciﬁcally prompted. (For

example, a chair might intentionally hold oﬀ on a contentious topic

until everyone is on the same page or the groundwork is set.)

“The role of the chair is like a conductor in an orchestra,” as one board

chair told us, “where you don’t actually play—you don’t make any

sounds, you don’t play any instruments, but you’re responsible for the

# ﬁnal sound.”

Leaving the task of creating the agenda to AI—based on, for example,

how long each item has taken to discuss in the past—completely

bypasses the chair’s strategic thinking.

The chair also exercises behind-the-scenes inﬂuence over the ﬂow of

information that AI cannot easily replicate. They guide how information

is presented, manage who speaks and when, and ensure people interact

constructively. For example, using their judgment, considering the

business environment, and anticipating the mood, a chair may coach

the CEO on how, when, and what materials to present. Setting the tone

for the meeting is one of the most underrated and least-understood

aspects of a chair’s role, and it comes from years of experience and

# insights.

# Discussion summarization and theming

## Chairs synthesize discussions, reframe issues, and guide board

## members toward alignment and decision-making.

Summarizing may sound like something AI could handle easily, but it’s

a powerful way for the chair to shape how the board understands things

and the conclusions they reach. It’s about listening carefully, ﬁnding the

main threads of the conversation, then putting it all together in a way

that builds consensus and moves things forward. If there’s confusion or

discord among the board members, the chair must step in and provide

the context they need. Summarizing diﬀerent viewpoints enables chairs

to subtly guide the narrative.

While AI can summarize a conversation, it can miss nuances, such as

the things people aren’t saying or shifts in mood, that a good chair

can pick up on and use in their summary. It’s about reading the room,

adding context and reframing, and making decisions.

## Board member performance, review, and recommendation

Chairs play a key role in evaluating board member eﬀectiveness,

inﬂuencing tenure, and shaping future board composition.

The chair must make sure the board as a whole is functioning well

and has the right mix of skills and experience. This isn’t something an

optimizing routine of AI can do. It might require having some tough

conversations and even removing dysfunctional elements from the

board. The chair also gets involved in setting board committees, such

as the audit committee and compensation committee. It’s the chair’s job

to identify the right personnel from the board, balancing the right skill

sets and ensuring that the dynamics of the committees are in the best

# interest of ﬁrm stakeholders.

## A Three-Step Process to Minimize Encroachment Risk

To safeguard against AI’s unintended consequences, board chairs

should adopt a structured approach to AI integration:

# Identify key strategic roles

Determine which leadership positions are most susceptible to

## encroachment risk, such as board chairs and C-suite executives. Board

## directors and board-appointed individuals such as executives and

chairs are chosen for their ability to shape the organization’s direction

—not just to carry out day-to-day operations. This means that their

value lies not only in managing internal tasks, but in guiding long-term

strategy, setting vision, and representing the company to stakeholders.

Consider Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft. He wasn’t hired just to

manage internal operations, but to lead Microsoft into new areas

like cloud computing and AI. And during her time as chairperson

of PepsiCo’s board, Indra Nooyi inﬂuenced the company’s long-term

## values and public positioning toward healthier product lines and long-

# term sustainability goals.

# Identify power-conduit tasks

Once you’ve identiﬁed the key strategic roles, work with those

individuals to pinpoint tasks that are central to their ability to

## exert inﬂuence—and therefore not good candidates for automation

with AI. For example, deﬁning the company’s long-term mission

and vision requires deep understanding of market trends, social

values, and motivations of key stakeholders. An executive in charge

of local operations may have to persuade local leaders, build trust,

and respond to social cues. This requires in-person interactions and

personalized communications with local leaders to build trust, as

well as local knowledge derived through experience. A CFO must

manage the company’s reputation while having tough conversations—

like explaining a disappointing earnings report as part of a broader

turnaround story—that are best delivered in an authentic, personalized

way. A CEO often must decide on whether to speak out on a

## controversial public issue, such as racial justice and climate policy.

Negotiating with worker unions requires overcoming skepticism while

strategically using trust, bargaining, and informal power dynamics.

# Fence and control AI involvement

With those power-conduit tasks in mind, establish clear policies for

where AI can be used and where human oversight must be maintained,

ensuring AI supports rather than replaces strategic decision-making.

“Fencing” a task means setting boundaries on AI’s role in executing

it. This doesn’t mean rejecting AI outright but rather deﬁning clear

conditions under which AI may assist while preserving human

oversight. For example, AI may suggest agenda structures, but the ﬁnal

decision should rest with the board chair. Similarly, AI may generate

discussion summaries, but the chair should review and reﬁne them

to ensure alignment with strategic objectives. By fencing AI’s role,

organizations can ensure that automation enhances rather than erodes

# leadership inﬂuence.

. . .

AI should be implemented thoughtfully to enhance rather than

diminish the strategic inﬂuence of board chairs. By identifying

## key strategic roles and power-conduit tasks, as well as fencing AI

involvement, board chairs can strike a balance between technological

advancement and eﬀective governance. The goal should not be to resist

AI but to integrate it in a way that preserves leadership inﬂuence and

strengthens the board chair’s strategic objectives. With careful planning

and oversight, AI can be a powerful ally in governance—one that

supports, rather than supplants, the individuals entrusted with leading
