# Abstract

A thorough probe into managerial coaching effectiveness is rare in the literature. To fill this research gap, this study examines the relationship of managerial coaching and employees’ performance more profoundly. This research probes the direct relationship of managerial coaching with task performance and contextual performance, and indirect relationship through intervening role of thriving at work. The self-designed questionnaires were used to collect data from 280 employees of pharmaceutical sector of Pakistan. The hierarchical regression analysis reveals that managerial coaching directly influences job performance, and indirectly influences job performance, organizational citizenship behavior toward individual and organization (OCBI-OCBO) as well via mediating role of thriving at work. The Sobel tests also confirms and shows the significance of mediating role of thriving at work in the conceptual model. This research provides empirical evidence regarding usefulness of managerial coaching grounded on social exchange theory in the context of Pakistan. The contribution of study, future directions and limitations are also discussed.

Keywords: managerial coaching, employee performance, organizational citizenship behavior-individual, organizational citizenship behavior-organization, thriving at work, pharmaceutical sales representatives, pharmaceutical sector.

- 1. Introduction

The corporate atmosphere has been varying swiftly because new competitors are entering with sustainable competitive advantages, new technology and improved methods of production. To compete with this kind of competition and sustainable development, organizations need to put extra-ordinary effort by using modern tools (Hagen, 2010; Pousa & Mathieu, 2015; Delery & Roumpi, 2017). It is important to improve employee performance through managerial coaching effectiveness (Pousa & Mathieu, 2010; Pusan et al., 2017). If organizations are managed by poorly management techniques, then the existence and development of the organization will be a question mark. So, to gain sustainable competitive advantages and to increase sales volume, coaching is considered a particular managerial technique (Deeter-Schmelz, et al., 2008; Dahling et al., 2016; Pousa et al., 2017).

Experts, organizational psychologists, and HRD researchers have commenced probing the significance and effectiveness of managerial coaching (Kim et al., 2013). Kim et al (2015) found a negative relationship of managerial coaching and turnover intention rate. In-role performance can be enhanced through managerial coaching by providing resources, goals and clear pathways and also, found the indirect relationship of managerial coaching and employee performance (Kim et al., 2014). Managerial coaching can be understood as a favor of manager for employees achievement and development, so reciprocally employees put extra efforts towards extra performance enhancements (Boyatzis et al., 2012). Moreover, employees understand organization to support, as they contemplate manager as a true demonstration of the organization (Kim, 2010), then they tend to reciprocate organizational citizenship behavior directed at the organization (Kottke & Sharafinski, 1988). Kim and Kuo (2015) found a positive relationship of managerial coaching and OCB. Supervisor or manager provide coaching to their subordinate.

The purpose of this management action is to boost employee learning, effectiveness, and participation (Ellinger et al., 2010; Park, 2007; Peterson & Hicks, 1996; Ratiu et al., 2017). Different experts in management considered an effective method for sustainable competitive advantage for managerial coaching (Hagen, 2010). Job performance is the most important outcome of managerial coaching (Ellinger et al., 2003; Kalkavan & Katrinli, 2004; Evered & Selman, 1989; Peterson & Hicks, 1996). Moreover, organizations are now shifting gears and tasks of HRD professionals to supervisors and executives, including employee coaching (Liu & Batt, 2010; Jones et al., 2016). These managers were previously into the roles of administration, control, and supervision and now more being encouraged to develop human capital so that strategic goals can be attained in the long run (Ellinger et al., 2003; Evered & Selman, 1989; Muhlberger, & Traut, 2015) through managerial coaching (Kim et al., 2013; Ellinger et al., 2011; Turner, & McCarthy, 2015) instructors (Hyman & Cunningham, 1998), trainers (Frisch, 2001) mentors (Cohen & Tichy, 1998; Senge, 1990) and counselors (Booth, 1996). Furthermore, to enhance the effectiveness of the organization in terms of in-role and extra-role performance, a manager should be accepting the ideas of employees, act as a role model, develop good relationships with subordinates (Colquitt et al., 2007), whereby employees would then accomplish their responsibilities with energy (Ellinger et al., 2010).

Together, with the managerial coaching, individual outcomes such as employee performance could be enhanced through thriving at work. To do so, this study deliberates the role of thriving with relating to employee job performance. The idea of “thriving at 791

work” is fresh and new in attaining attention in auspicious workplace conduct. Thriving at work theorize into two dimensions learning and vitality (Spreitzer et al., 2005). Recently, scholars conceptually and operationally defined under three broader dimensions i.e., affective, behavioral, and cognitive elements (Abid & Ahmed, 2016). The learning component includes acquisition and application of new information and skills (Elliott & Dweck, 1988) and vitality meanings narrated by Nix et al (1999) positive feelings about energy and enthusiasm. Porath et al (2012) have probed both vitality and learning individually. But latest developments are more directed at employee thriving at work; also depicting the effectiveness and expediency of considering learning and vitality together, for the reason that both of these emotional situations at work are linked to optimistic outcomes (Spreitzer et al., 2012). Thriving is considered a self-regulatory mental state and can be inclined by innovation (Wallace et al., 2016).

Thriving is a key determinant of innovative work behavior, performance, absenteeism, commitment, well-being, positive health, voice behavior, turnover intention, and engagement. Moreover, empirical studies support these key determinants of thriving at work is key, absenteeism and job performance (Porath et al., 2012), turnover intention, job satisfaction, and innovative work behavior (Abid et al., 2015; Abid et al., 2016). Employees do innovative actions when they thrive in their workplace as a result of quick feedback, clear paths of goals, get learning opportunities in their work environment and these can be obtained by managers when they act as a coach. In these days, at the point of sales, providing services manually employees may not satisfy the numerous requests and the unpredictability of customers with service manuals only. Therefore, to fulfill these requirements, employees necessarily work creatively and perform extra performance. So currently, it needs to explore the OCB and creative actions of workers as the result of managerial coaching actions (Oh & Tak, 2016). Thus, this study will provide empirically support to fill this gap.

The significance and usefulness have been increasing of managerial coaching (Beattie et al., 2014), but a thorough probe of managerial coaching effectiveness is rare in the literature (Boyatzis et al., 2012). There are few outcome variables have been examined in the literature (Hagen, 2012; Kim et al., 2013), one of these is employee job performance. There are few intervening variables has been investigated in previous literature like (role clarity; Kim et al., 2014 and trust; Kim and Kuo, 2015) between the relationship of managerial coaching and job performance. There is no empirical evidence regarding thriving at work as an intervening variable between the relationships of managerial coaching and employee job performance. In Eastern countries rarely examined the in-role and extra-role performance broadly through thriving at work with the help of managerial coaching (Beattie et al., 2014).

Grounded on the previous literature and social exchange theory, present research will fill the said research gaps, where the purpose of our exploratory study is to look at the relationship between study variables and answer the following questions: (cid:32) What is the impact of managerial coaching on job performance including in-role

# performance, OCB-I, OCB-O)?

(cid:32) Does thriving at work mediate the relationship of managerial coaching and job

- 2. Literature Review

The Perceived organization support theory (POS) is an underlying framework to identify and establish the direct association of managerial coaching with employee job performance as well as indirect influence via thriving at work (Eisenberger et al., 1990). The employees need support from their organization to cope with a challenging work environment and psychological satisfaction (Abid et al., 2015). The employees within organizations consider the actions and behaviors of their supervisors and leaders as representative of the organization Kottke and Sharafinski (1988). The employees show favorable attitudes and behavior toward the organization in exchange for perceived well-being and positive actions from their employer (Levinson, 1965).

The behaviors exhibited by supervisors and leaders in the coaching environment of the organization are considered by their subordinates as their well-being and organizational support. The supervisors communicate the expectations to the subordinates regarding their role in the organization, provide timely feedback to enhance their performance, recognition of their contrition toward the organization, fair compensation, learning and development opportunities for job, and play the role of learning facilitator (Kim, 2014). When employees perceive favor from the organization in the form of coaching behaviors of their supervisors (Sonenshein et al., 2013), in exchange employees respond to these favourable actions in the shape of improved job outcomes like thriving at work, extra role performance and in role performance as well (Colquitt et al., 2007; Kim & Kuo, 2015). POS improve employee attitude and behaviors in the workplace. A recent research study on managerial coaching analyzed the influence of managerial coaching on employee outcomes such as organizational citizenship behavior toward individual, organizational citizenship behavior toward organization, and in role employee performance through mediating effect of trustworthiness of manager perceived by the employee (Kim & Kuo, 2015), provided POS as a basis for considerate the functioning of managerial coaching in organization to improve various employee outcomes. This research focuses on developing the association between MC and job performance as well as the intervening role of thriving at work which is the contribution of this research.

Based on the discussions above, this research focuses on the first question which is about managerial coaching about employee job performance. Therefore, next section pertains to this unique relation which is also the novelty of this research.

## 2.1 Managerial Coaching and Employee Job Performance

Managerial coaching is “a form of coaching that is provided by a supervisor or manager serving as a facilitator of learning (Ellinger et al., 2010). The manager or supervisor enacts specific behaviors that enable the employee to learn and develop thereby to improve performance”. The day to day interaction between supervisor and subordinates, individualized close contact with the supervisor, helping behavior of a supervisor, is considered as a managerial activity to enhance learning, development, and job performance of the employees (Grant, 2006; Jones et al., 2016). Manager as a coach exhibit different behavior such as guiding, supporting, and developing employee in the organization rather traditional management practices such as commanding and controlling the subordinates. MC becomes the cause of regular interaction among manager and subordinates (Boyatzis et al., 2012; Muhlberger & Traut, 2015). Moreover, MC focuses on providing regular feedback and helping the employee to improve performance by overcoming the

793

## Managerial Coaching on Employee Performance and OCB

weaknesses (Kim et al., 2013). According to Kim & Kuo, (2015), employee job performance is the key outcome of managerial coaching. The various skills of supervisors comprise the managerial coaching such as relationship development, effective listening skills, putting the analytical questions, accepting the ideas of employees, focusing on team approach, open communication with the employees, giving preference to the individual needs of employee, and facilitate their development result in their improved job performance (Cox et al., 2010). The following is developed based on the above discussion: (cid:32) H1: Managerial coaching will have a positive impact on employee in-role

# performance.

Kim and Kuo (2015) described that managerial coaching enhances the employee’s OCB-I and OCB-O. Based on previous literature further than that, about the second research question, the next section deals with the unique or novel relationship of managerial coaching and OCB, which is discussed as under:

# 2.2 Managerial Coaching and OCB

Employees are involved in different behaviors within organizations as a result of psychological states, managerial practices, and societal norms (Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994). The extra role is defined as the cooperative and social behavior of individuals within organizations which is not the part of their job description (Van Dyne, 1995). Furthermore, OCB consist of those behaviors of individuals which are beyond their formal duties and responsibilities within the organziation (Organ et al., 2005), which in includes organizational citizenship behavior toward individuals which is beneficial for the coworkers (OCBI) working in the organization and organizational citizenship behavior toward the organization (OCBO) (Williams & Anderson, 1991).

As per social exchange view of managerial coaching within organizations, employee considers managerial coaching as a form of organizational support (Kim, 2014), and managerial support (Boyatzis et al., 2012). The open communication with the employees, participative decision-making approach, servant leadership (Podsakoff et al., 1990; Bester et al., 2015), and one-on-one interaction between the supervisor and manager during the coaching process encourages employees to perform the extra role behaviors in the organization. Furthermore, Ellinger & Cseh, (2007) revealed that managerial coaching positively influences the OCB. Based on above discussion and literature we can develop the following hypothesis: (cid:32) H2: Managerial coaching will have a positive impact on employee OCBI. (cid:32) H3: Managerial coaching will have a positive impact on employee OCBO.

Based on the thorough discussion above, pertaining to the second research question, the next section deals with the unique or novel mediating role of thriving at work, which is discussed as under:

# 2.3 Mediating Role of Thriving at Work

The supportive supervisors express their commitment to the welfare of their subordinates, exhibit helping behaviors, acknowledge their contribution toward the organization and build the strong relationship (Zhang et al., 2008). These behaviors of supervisors develop a supportive environment for subordinates which result in their favorable behaviors toward the organization. When an employee perceives support from their organization and supervisor, they become ready to take the risk (Abid et al., 2015; Kahn, 1990). Moreover,

794

# Raza et al.

the major contribution perceived by employees from the employer is organizational support (Zagenczyk et al., 2010). The supportive organization acknowledges the contribution of their employees toward achievement of organizational objectives which result in increased enthusiasm, creativity and innovation, and adoption of latest knowledge. This supportive environment increases the employees’ level of thriving at work (Wiesenfeld et al., 2001; Xu et al., 2016). Moreover, as a coach, manager provides the timely feedback to the subordinates, provide clear expectations regarding goal achievement, act as a role model for the employees, create learning environment, to improve the employees in the role as well as extra role performance to enhance the organizational effectiveness (Colquitt et al., 2007).

The review of the literature showed that in-role performance of employees’ is positively influenced by the thriving (Porath et al., 2012). A study of public sector university shown that employees having a high score on the thriving at work had a high level of job performance (Porath et al., 2012). One more study of six different organizations shown results similar to other studies which resulted that 125 % employees shown less burnout, 46 % were satisfied, and 32 percent were committed to the organization. The employees with high thriving at work had more opportunities to learn, grow, develop and perform within the organizations (Porath et al., 2012).

Porath et al. (2012) revealed in a comparative study of executives that thrived leaders are more effective in the organization as compared to the non-thriving leader. Thriving at work grows the perception about leaders as a role model for the subordinates and care taker of their well-being. They also become the reason for thriving at work among the subordinates as well. Thriving at work is also a reason for developing good working relationship with other organizational members and promote the well-being of the colleagues (Spreitzer et al., 2005; Abid et al., 2015) as a result of addressing their issues in the workplace and encourage their behaviors like organizational citizenship behavior.

If the structure and mechanism understood the relationship of managerial coaching behavior and organizational outcome, then the application of managerial coaching may be more effective in an organization. So, this effect can be done by applying mediating role in the relationship between managerial coaching behaviors and organizational outcome to understand the mechanism. Thus, in this study thriving at work tries to arouse employees’ abilities fully, in return employees behave optimistic attitude (Kwon, 2015) and positive views (Yang et al., 2015) towards their goals and duties. Then, they gain a sense of organizational commitment and belongings and feel thrive in their workplace, which enhances performance, OCB-I, and OCB-O, which they would perform beyond their job scope regardless of any advantage just for the sake of their organization.

So, it can be hypothesized that the association among managerial coaching and employee in a role and extra role behaviors are mediated by the thriving at work. (cid:32) H4: The relationship of managerial coaching and employee in-role performance will

be mediated by thriving at work.

(cid:32) H5: The relationship of managerial coaching and employee OCBI will be mediated

by thriving at work.

(cid:32) H6: The relationship of managerial coaching and employee OCBO will be mediated

by thriving at work.

This section presents the procedure of data collection and study sample. Furthermore, measurements of variables for data collection are described below. Lastly, the data analysis strategy is discussed. 3.1 Data Collection Procedure and Study Sample The population of this research study has been constituted by the employees of Albro Pharmaceuticals (Pvt.) Limited, Shaf Pharma Lahore and Alpha Chemicals (Pvt.) Limited, Lahore in Pakistan. The nature of this study is quantitative and cross sectional. This model applies to all sectors, but the population has been taken from this industry because it is best suitable for the pharmaceutical sector in Pakistan. The pharmaceutical industry is more actively exercising or adopting such motivational managerial skills to boost up their sales and market share through their workforce practically. The environment of this industry is more conclusive to respond to this model or these research questions. The support of human resource managers has been available for data collection and other relevant information. The questionnaires were sent through email to 350 respondents with their informed consent to participate in this study. The survey questionnaires have two forms (form A is meant for having responses of employees for managerial coaching and thriving at work and form B is meant for having responses of managers for performance and OCB-I, OCB-O of employees). Three constructs related to employees’ feedback and two constructs for the feedback of manager. Firstly, to rate managerial coaching and thriving at work by

796

# H1

# Raza et al.

employees, one set of survey questionnaire was sent to employees. Secondly, when first response forms were returned by employees, then to rate employee performance and OCB- I, OCB-O, another set of survey questionnaire was sent to their corresponding managers. For a clear understanding of the respondent, questionnaires were translated from English to Urdu (Brislin, 1980). The sample of the study consists of 280 (with a response rate of approximately 80%) respondents as chosen through simple random sampling technique. The technique is used to avoid response bias and other unwanted effects by the respondents.

Features of the respondents that 76.4% were male and 16.2% were female employees. The highest percentages of respondents that 54.1% have master education and other employees’ education was below to master, 54% were 26-30 years old respondents, and the experience of 52.7% employees was 1-5 years.

# 3.2 Measurement

Already available five-point Likert scales in prior literature were adopted in this research study. Table 1 presents the short detail of the scales:

# 3.3 Common Method Variance

This study used self-reporting measures for the measurement of managerial coaching and thriving at work; a common method variance may occur in this study. Podsakoff et al (2003) describe the method for diagnosing the common method bias, which is Harman’s single factor test. In accordance to, Mattila and Enz, (2002), as stated in Harmans’s test, “if a single factor emerges from the exploratory factor analysis or one factor accounts for more than 50% of the variance in the items, methods bias is present”. In our study, single- factor showed only 24% of the total variance which revealed that there is no common method bias.

# 3.4 Analysis Strategy

SPSS (version 22) was used for statistical analysis. The descriptive analysis described the mean, standard deviation, and correlation matrix. For evaluation of the measurement model, reliability via Cronbach’s alpha, convergent validity using average variance extracted (AVE) and discriminant validity based on Fornell-Larcker criterion were ensured. Cohen and Cohen (1983) technique of hierarchical regression analyses was used to observe the direct relationships of managerial coaching and employee outcomes. Baron and Kenny (1986) technique were used to observe indirect relationships. This technique is mostly used in psychological literature; therefore, this technique is used in this study (Preacher & Hayes, 2014). For measuring the significance of mediation effect, sobel test was used (Sobel, 1982, 1986). This technique is enhancement of Baron and Kenny method for checking significance of mediation effect, therefore this technique is used (Kraemer et al., 2008).

- 4. Results

Correlations, means and standard deviations are presented in Table 2. Correlation coefficients were lower, so there is no any problem regarding multicollinearity (<0.70; Tabachnick & Fidell, 1996). Results showing that managerial coaching is significantly correlated with thriving at work (r = 0.401, p < .01), in-role job performance (r = 0.482, p < .01), OCB-I (r = 0.250, p < .01), and OCB-O (r = 0.138, p < .01). When managers provide coaching to their employees, then they feel thrive in their work and return enhance their performance. Thriving at work is significantly correlated with in-role performance (r = 0.525, p < .01), OCB-Individual (r = 0.381, p < .05), and OCB-Organization (r = 0.533, p < .01). When people feel thrive in their work setting, then they perform better and do their work activities efficiently and effectively and perform beyond their routine duties for the organization. These correlations provide initial support to the hypothesis of this study.

Table 3 describes reliability values of the scale. Through Cronbach alpha technique reliability of the scale was assessed. All reliability values are above 0.70 (> 0.70, Kline, 2005), which proves for further analysis, because data is reliable.

# 4.1.2 Convergent Validity

The present study support for construct validity because a correlation between all the study variables was lower. Construct validity was checked for convergent and discriminant validity. For convergent validity, the value of AVE should be (AVE ≥ 0.5). The values of AVE are described in the following table. The results show that all the five latent variables Cronbach alpha exceeded over 0.7 and AVE values greater than 0.5. So, in this study convergent validity seems to be attained (Hair et al., 1995).

# 4.1.3 Discriminant Validity

For discriminant validity, Fornell-Larcker criterion was used which compares inter- construct correlation values and the square root of AVE. As per this test, discriminant validity exists among construct if the square root of AVE is greater than the correlation of a variable with other variables in the model. The following table compares these values. That is, all the correlation values less than the square root of AVE values and so, the discriminant validity is acceptable (Kim, 2010).

In table 6 (β value (c`) = 0.324, t=4.303 >2, F=38.244>5 & sig=0.000), which is showing that managerial coaching has a positive impact on in-role performance. This demonstrates that one unit change in managerial coaching carries 0.324-unit change into in-role job performance, which supports H1. A study conducted by Kim and Kuo, (2015), found no relationship between managerial coaching and in-role performance, but in this study this relationship is exist. Because, when managers act as a coach and build good relations, support their subordinates, valuing the work of their employees, then these behaviors build a learning and healthy environment, then reciprocally employee perform bettter. In this study further found an intervening effect by multiplying a*b, 0.401*0.395=0.1584, which support H4. It means employees who feel thrive in their workplace; they perform better as compared to those who didn’t get coaching and thriving environment.

In table 7 Sobel test showing within a limit value (3.645), which should be Z> -1.96 and +1.96 at p<0.05, for assessing the significance of mediation effect, which supports H4.

There are three conditions for assessing mediation effect; first, find out relationship between independent and dependent variable; second, find out relationship between independent and mediating variable; third, find out relationship between mediating variable and dependent variable. If, these three conditions fulfill, then there is partial mediation. If first condition not fulfill and two and three conditions fulfill, then there is full mediation.

So, managerial coaching has a direct and indirect impact on employee job performance through thriving at work. It’s a partial mediation.

- 5. Discussion

By using social exchange theory, this research explored the relationship between the managerial coaching and the employees’ outcomes under the mediating role of thriving at work. In this study, results showed that 1, 4, 5 and six hypotheses were supported as well as 2 and 3 were not supported. The results of this study are alike previous researchers in different countries (Organ et al., 2005), where managerial coaching had a substantial indirect influence on employee OCB-I and OCB-O (Kim & Kuo, 2015) through employee’s awareness of managerial trustworthiness. Another research also contemplated

managerial coaching as a worldwide instrument where the previous researches observed the major and interactional special effects of two traditional societal variables (Collectivism and GE) and gender on managerial coaching. The previous research portrayed that woman managers spectacle more coaching behavior than their male colleagues (Ye et al., 2016) suggesting that coaching is not a gender-neutral spectacle. It is an operative and effective way for the women managers to exhibit the directing and managing behavior and to advance their talents and capabilities.

Another research, where the managerial coaching was positively related with two dimensions of work performance of employees: in role behavior and innovative behavior (Hahn, 2016). This depicted that employees who perceive that they had received coaching from their managers appear to perform better at assigned tasks. Managerial coaching improves job performance of employees (Zemke, 1996). In turn, improved job performance exhibits innovative behavior, including generating and implementing novel ideas at work with managerial coaching (Hahn, 2016).

Furthermore, results revealed that the managerial coaching did not have a significant relationship with OCB-individual and OCB-organization. This could have been because of lack of managerial coaching including listening, clear goals, communication analysis, interviewing, observation and quick feedback (Joo et al., 2012). Effective and quickly feedback, build a good relationship with the subordinates (Steelman & Wolfeld, 2016). Furthermore, managerial coaching shall result in psychological ownership and learning goal orientation, both of which are associated positively with organizational citizenship behavior and creative behaviors, respectively (Oh &Tak, 2016), ultimately increasing OCB-organization. OCB-organization can be further increased through managerial coaching where procedural justice environment is also quite low. This is because when practical justice climate is low, the impact of operative coaching turns authoritative for OCBs of employees (Ozduran & Tanova, 2017).

Furthermore, in this study results revealed that managerial coaching is positively associated with OCB- individual and OCB-Organization with the mediating effects of thriving at work. These results are consistent with the previous researches where thriving at work is made up of two components including learning and vitality (Prem et al., 2016). Thriving at work is further instigated through the challenge stressors, where complex levels of time stress, employees feel that they get better and improve at work than with minor levels of task stressors and higher hindrance stressors. Furthermore, cognitive evaluations play a part in triggering thriving at work, where learning and strength are all exaggerated by one particular type of cognitive evaluation. Thriving at work could be increased with the moderating impact of autonomy orientation, which could further enhance change oriented OCB (Li et al., 2016). Literature suggests that OCB could be further enhanced with five categories of thriving including, recognition for achievement, the climate of the counseling center and campus, lower levels of burnout factors, lower levels of personal difficulties and challenges and personal therapy (Sim et al., 2016). Further than that, individual innovation increases through employee involvement climate via thriving (Wallace et al., 2013).

Supportive behaviors of supervisors develop a supportive environment for subordinates which result in their favorable behaviors toward the organization. When an employee perceives support from their organization and supervisor, they become ready to take the risk (Abid et al., 2015). When employees perceive favor from the organization in the form of coaching behaviors of their supervisors (Sonenshein et al., 2013), in exchange 805

## Managerial Coaching on Employee Performance and OCB

employees respond to these favourable actions in the shape of improved job outcomes like thriving at work, extra role performance and in role performance as well (Kim & Kuo, 2015). This study determined that when managers build good relations, and support their subordinates, valuing the work of their employees, then these behaviors, build a learning and healthy environment, then reciprocally employee feel thrive at work. Employees who feel thrive in their workplace, they perform better as compared to those who didn’t get coaching and thriving environment.

- 6. Limitations and Future Directions

This current research has numerous prospects for further and advance research, but it has several taken from eastern culture pharmaceutical industry, this raises a question for the generalizability of the study. So, the further research can be conducted from western culture and other industry. Secondly, the research design of this study was cross-sectional so that future studies can use experimental and longitudinal research design (Babbie, 2012). Thirdly, the sample consists of the male dominated industry so that further investigation can be done in female oriented or equal basis industry. Fourthly, further research can be conducted to explore other possible mediators and moderators for better understanding the relationships of managerial coaching and employee performance outcomes. Fifthly, hypothesis 2 and three were not supported, means managerial coaching not directly impact on extra-role performance (OCB-I, OCB-O), so future studies can be done to explore these relationships and by using other measure of these variables. Finally, this research is the basis for future studies for better understanding the role of thriving at work and managerial coaching. Sixth, future studies can be conducted for international comparison of coaching behavior effectiveness in different culture, because in specific cultural setting specific coaching behavior is suitable. Seventh, future research can be conducted to integrate managerial coaching with leadership style and skills, because it is unclear to date which leadership style and skills are effective for coaching. Eight, future studies can be conducted to explore other job- related outcome like organizational commitment, job satisfaction, deviant workplace behavior, job involvement, perceive organizational support, turnover intention and employee engagement through mediating effect of thriving at work. Nine, the future studies can be explored relationship between managerial coaching and performance outcomes via mediating role of job ambivalence and explore the role of tenure for the effectiveness of coaching relationship between supervisor and subordinate. Lastly, job stress and perception of organizational politics as a moderator can be explore between the relationship of managerial coaching and job performance outcome.

- 7. Implications for Research, Theory, and Practice

The managerial coaching is growing in organizational development and HRD strategy on the workplace, but lacking the empirical evidence regarding its effectiveness. To address aforementioned gap this study provided the empirical evidence to enhance the understanding of managerial coaching and affective low-cost training and development strategy. This study enhances the social exchange theory, because this study provides that the exchange between supervisor and subordinate is crucial for improving the employee job outcomes on the workplace. This study also provides social exchange as a framework for understanding the coaching and performance relationship for the future study as well. The findings of study show that the managerial coaching behaviors of managers should be rewarded at the workplace to increase this developmental relationship between supervisor

and subordinate. To promote managerial coaching on workplace, the coaching skills of managers should be analyzed during the recruitment process.

- 8. Conclusion

The managerial coaching has less empirical support for effectiveness and the mechanism of relationships with job performance and OCB in previous literature. So, the current study considered the benefits of managerial coaching and the intervening role of thriving at work to enrich the literature and the empirical investigations. The employees feel thrive at work, when manager act as a coach, openly communicate with subordinates, accept ideas of others, give performance to individual’s needs, and rely on team approach to enhance the subordinates learning which further enhance job performance, OCB-I and OCB-O. This research will consider initial step to understand the mechanism of managerial coaching and job-related outcome.
