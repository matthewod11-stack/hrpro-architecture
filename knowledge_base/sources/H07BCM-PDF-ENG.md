A recent Microsoft study of 30,000 people revealed that 46% of

workers are considering a major career pivot or transition after the

Covid years. For many, this search goes beyond just a change of role and

into the realm of personal renewal or reinvention. In our experience,

## many of the professionals who such express an interest in reinvention

ultimately fail to follow through.

The hardest part, we’ve found, and where many professionals get stuck,

is simply getting started on leaving the status quo. This is particularly

true for senior executives. Personal reinvention requires reappraising

life choices and imagining alternate paths — but this becomes more

diﬃcult when the path a leader is on is seen, at least outwardly, as

successful. Because leaders’ identities are so dependent on their work, it can also be hard for them to consider diﬀerent possibilities. And while

these executives have been educated in strategic planning and change

at the organizational level, reinvention at a personal level is not part of

# the curriculum at most business schools.

More ironically, there are also habits that are core to executives’ success

that stand squarely in the way of personal reinvention. In our work

teaching and coaching thousands of managers, we have identiﬁed four

traps – self-suﬃciency, overthinking, procrastination, and searching for

the answer – that prevent leaders from taking the ﬁrst steps necessary

for considering and exploring possible new versions of themselves for

# the future.

In our work, we have found ways to help leaders recognize which traps

they are falling into and start imagining a way out — largely inspired

by design thinking principles such as rapid prototyping, making ideas

visual, and getting quick feedback. Understanding what these traps are

can help you take those ﬁrst steps — and succeed in your quest for

# reinvention.

# Self-sufficiency

Leaders often talk of their self-suﬃciency with pride. These leaders

rely on their own contributions, work well independently and seldom

require motivation or management from others – behaviors that have

earned them their senior roles. However, self-suﬃciency has a ﬂip side:

It can limit connections with others, resulting in restricted access to

new ideas, feedback and encouragement. It can also hide a leader’s

doubts and insecurities from others. Individuals who are highly self-

suﬃcient need others to help them overcome this trap of self-suﬃciency

and asking for help may seem obvious, but it also takes courage,

especially when admitting to career vulnerability.

Fritz, a ﬁnance executive in the pharmaceutical industry whom we met

on one of our workshops, is a classic example of an executive trapped

by self-suﬃciency. His considerable self-reliance meant he took the lead

on most work projects and presentations and believed that working

with others and delegating slowed him down when he could do things

himself. His self-reliance had initially helped him succeed in his career,

as he developed a reputation as a “go-to person.”

However, his habit of self-reliance was particularly unhelpful when the

company he worked for began restructuring, as he felt adrift and out-of-

touch with the changes taking place. He got the sense that he was being

pushed out, yet had no one with whom to discuss the situation. His

self-reliance nearly got in the way when a colleague asked whether he

wanted to have lunch and a chat.

About to respond with his usual “No, I’m ﬁne thanks,” he realized

that he was not ﬁne and that a conversation might just be helpful to

hear some other perspectives on what was happening in the company.

Saying yes to that conversation was the start of him getting out of his

## own way and a longer exploration of reinvention.

If you tend to be reluctant to ask for help, or to accept it when oﬀered,

it may be a sign of the self-suﬃciency trap. If so, ﬁnd someone you

trust and let them know that you would like to talk things through. Jack

Welch, former GE CEO, stretched this remedy to “reverse mentoring”

where senior executives turn to younger digital natives in order to

# master digital convergence.

# Overthinking

Sharp analytical skills are critical to good problem solving and

leadership through complex situations. However, when reinventing

themselves executives can get stuck claiming they simply need “a little

more time to think things through” before actually taking any steps

to make a change. The overthinking trap is born from a dependence

on analysis and logic as the way to solve problems that overlooks

other ways of knowing — emotional, intuitive, visual or embodied.

This overthinking leads executives to miss signals from these neglected

sources of data and prevents learning from experimentation. Yet

personal reinvention is an embodied, experimental experience and

executives cannot simply think their way into the future.

Take Em, for example — another executive we have worked with. A

## veteran of a 15-year career and responsible for the strategic direction of

a philanthropic organization, she found that her workload was wearing

her down and limiting the time she could spend with her young family.

She was surprised to ﬁnd that she felt disconnected from a job she had

once loved. Every time she started to imagine doing something else,

she reasoned that the job had once been engaging and that there were

others lining up for her role. Her rationalizations prevented her from

paying attention to her felt sense of disquiet and of imagining a new

# future.

We asked Em to literally draw a prototype of a possible next step for

her. She sketched a journey with diverging paths and herself with an

inner compass that was fueled by intuition. She considered each of the

possible future paths, asking herself: How energizing it would be? How much it ﬁt her own skill sets? And, how it would aﬀect the rate and

direction of her career progress? She realized it was time to leave the

organization she had loved. Em followed her inner compass of intuition,

resigned from her executive role to pursue an advanced degree in

psychology to prepare for the next step in life and have more time with

her family. She tells us that stopping her overthinking about her past

role created space for her to dare to imagine a possible future that she

ﬁnds exciting and energizing.

If you catch yourself frequently saying “let me think that through,”

you are likely overthinking. Instead, notice other often-overlooked

sources of data — emotional and intuitive — and take an experimental

approach. Personal reinvention is best served by doing, rather than

thinking: Trying things out and learning from the outcome. Attention to

physical cues, your intuition about how the experiment worked, as well

as others’ reactions can provide sources of data that can help you get out

of the overthinking trap.

# The Right Answer

Our society teaches that there are “right” and “wrong” answers from

our schooldays right through to the workplace. But, often, there are

no discernible right answers when looking out over the unknown of a

reinvented life or career. Executives who have conﬁdent replies at the

ready in the context of their current roles become suddenly silent when

they’re asked about their personal futures.

As a scientist, Sam had been educated to ﬁnd the right answer to the

problems in front of him. After 20 years as a chemist in a large German

ﬁrm, he started to feel ready for a change of direction and yet he found

himself searching for the elusive right answer to what that direction

should be. As a result, he remained in his role despite the feeling within

him that something needed to shift.

When we began to work with Sam, it was clear that as a scientist

he understood the language of experiments very well. So, our work

with him emphasized the need to conduct experiments in order to

make progress on the work of reinvention. We asked Sam to bring the

same level of curiosity to examining his life that he brought to his

experiments. We encouraged him to conduct experiments to identify

sources of fulﬁllment in life and at work. Within time, he realized that

there was no “formula” nor right answer, but many exciting options,

and the choice was his to make. He decided to stay in his role for the

next two years and to deliberately make time for some experiments to explore options. He set one professional experiment in place by oﬀering

support to a local start-up and one personal experiment to rekindle his

love of music by joining a choir.

If you tend to search for the “right” answer when evaluating choices,

this may be a sign that you might shy away from embarking on

experimentation or accepting mistakes as a pathway to learning and

growth. It can be useful to ask what alternate paths are there?

# Procrastination

The easiest excuse to avoid starting a reinvention process as an

executive is all the other urgent work you have to do. Successful leaders

are rewarded with ever-greater responsibilities, which means that they

have less and less time to focus on their own longer-term aspirations.

That limited bandwidth can also fuel anxiety: It can be hard to imagine

a nebulous future when weighed down with the very real demands of

today. More than this, personal reinvention can be scary. Who among

us hasn’t hesitated in the face of a big decision, not for more insight,

but simply in the hope of deferring choices to avoid the associated

anxiety and self-doubt? We also know from psychology that people

procrastinate to avoid ambiguous, diﬃcult and unstructured situations

or decisions — and personal reinvention checks all of these boxes.

Barbara had become disillusioned with her career in marketing. She

didn’t have much time for nurturing her aspirations, however, because

## of the demands of the job and attention to her young children.

Introduced to one of our workshops by a friend, she realized that the

real problem wasn’t a lack of time; it was that she didn’t know where

to start. At the workshop, we encouraged Barbara to more precisely

articulate and then visualize several possible future paths, much as we

had done with Em, and then appraise them analytically, in order to

be able to compare and contrast their attractiveness, suitability and ﬁt.

Doing this allowed Barbara to test these possible career journeys, and

select the path she felt was best suited to her goals and capabilities.

Barbara carved out some time to test some of the ideas she had drawn

and eventually found her new path as a graphic recorder.

If you tend to procrastinate, ask yourself why you are putting oﬀ

important decisions about your life? And, why you are choosing to

prioritize other tasks? The adage “just do it” can help take a ﬁrst step

and act as a reminder that reinvention is an iterative process, so taking

that ﬁrst step no matter how small is better than a perfect idea that

# remains untested.

The common denominator in these traps is that they aren’t bad habits

in and of themselves — quite the opposite. Executives follow strategies

that have worked well for them throughout their lives — self-reliance,

thinking their way to an answer and throwing themselves into work that

demonstrates their loyalty to the status quo. But it also keeps them safe

from the messy, emotional work of exploring new possibilities.

Only when executives recognize the dissonance between their inner

yearning and the status quo can they address existential questions

about who they are and what they want from life. Confronting the traps
