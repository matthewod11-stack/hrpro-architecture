If you’re like most seasoned leaders, you’ve heard a lot in recent years

# about the value of trust.

Employees who trust their organizations show higher engagement,

creativity, and productivity. Those who don’t experience more stress,

increased burnout, and are more likely to quit. Fostering trust,

therefore, represents a crucial imperative for any leader looking to

create a high-performing team.

## HBR / Digital Article / How High-Performing Teams Build Trust

Conversations about cultivating trust at work often focus on the

relationship between managers and employees. While useful, this

approach represents only half the equation. As important — if not more

so — is establishing trust between teammates. After all, most employees

work in teams, and the lion’s share of their daily experience involves

interacting with colleagues, often in the absence of a boss.

So, how do the best teams build trust among themselves?

To ﬁnd out, my team at ignite80 surveyed 1,000 U.S.-based oﬃce workers, with the goal of pinpointing behaviors that diﬀerentiate high-

performing teams and understanding we can learn from their approach.

To identify members of high-performing teams, we invited respondents

to complete a survey about their attitudes, experiences, and behaviors

at work. Embedded within our questionnaire were items asking workers to: 1) rate their team’s eﬀectiveness, and 2) compare their team’s

performance to other teams in their industry. Workers who scored their

team a 10 out of 10 on both items were designated members of high-

performing teams, allowing us to compare their behaviors against those

# of everyone else.

Our research found that high-performing teams are exceedingly rare;

only 8.7% of respondents gave their teams qualifying scores. We also

identiﬁed ﬁve key behaviors related to trust that set these teams apart.

## High-Performing Teams Don’t Leave Collaboration to Chance

When launching a project, many teams follow a predictable cadence:

They assign tasks and start working. High-performing teams, on the

other hand, are more than three times more likely to begin by ﬁrst

discussing how they will work together, paving the way for fewer

## misunderstandings and smoother collaboration down the road.

## HBR / Digital Article / How High-Performing Teams Build Trust

How exactly do you have a conversation about collaborating? In his

## new book, How to Work with (Almost) Anyone, Michael Bungay Stanier

provides a series of prompts teammates can use to conduct what he

calls “Keystone Conversations” before starting a project. Colleagues take

turns sharing: 1) the tasks at which they excel, 2) their communication

preferences, and 3) successful and unsuccessful collaborations they’ve

experienced in the past. Critically, Bungay Stanier also recommends

proactively creating a strategy for when things go awry, by inviting team

members to devise a plan for handling any breakdowns in collaboration,

should they occur.

Ultimately, the precise prompts your team uses to establish

collaboration norms matter less than engaging in a dialogue on how you

will work together. Doing so contributes to trust by signaling respect

for one another’s strengths and preferences, securing agreement on

process, and inviting team members to speak up when they notice

# opportunities for improvement.

## High-Performing Teams Keep Colleagues in the Loop

Another factor that diﬀerentiates high-performing teams is their

## tendency to proactively share information.

Greater transparency doesn’t just foster trust — it’s also been shown

to fuel creativity, performance, and proﬁtability. In contrast, when

colleagues withhold information from their teammates, there are

frequently deeper issues at play. “Knowledge hiding,” as it’s referred to

in academic literature, often suggests a lack of psychological safety or

# an underlying power struggle.

In our study, we found that members of high-performing teams are

signiﬁcantly more likely to take responsibility for keeping others

informed rather than expecting a manager to do so. In other words, they

don’t just avoid hoarding information — they go out of their way to keep

colleagues in the loop, creating a culture of inclusion.

# High-Performing Teams Share Credit

Receiving praise for a job well-done isn’t just rewarding, it also contains

## an important team-building opportunity — one that high-performing

teams leverage often.

Instead of soaking up praise alone, members of high-performing teams

are more likely to share recognition for their accomplishments with

teammates by acknowledging or thanking those who played a role

in their success. In so doing, they increase the likelihood of their

colleagues feeling appreciated and promote a norm of reciprocity, both

## of which contribute to the experience of trust.

It’s a clever approach — and not just because it fosters better

teamwork. Recent studies indicate that when we share credit for our

accomplishments, we appear more likable without seeming any less

# capable.

## High-Performing Teams Believe Disagreements Make Them Better

Years ago, psychologist John Gottman noticed something odd about

happy marriages: thriving couples often ﬁght more than unhappy ones.

## More important than the sheer number of disagreements, Gottman’s

research revealed, is the way a couple navigates them.

Happy couples do all sort of things that make for more productive

disagreements: They avoid name-calling and sarcasm, focus on what

they need instead of their partner’s failures, and use “I” statements to

communicate in a way that makes their partner less defensive.

Like thriving marriages, high-performing teams don’t experience less conﬂict. Where they diﬀer is the way they interpret and respond to

# disagreements.

Our ﬁndings indicate that high-performing teams are more likely

to believe that workplace disagreements lead to better decisions (as

opposed to damaging relationships). They also rate their teammates as more eﬀective at preventing disagreements from getting personal.

These two observations are likely connected. A workplace disagreement

can be perceived as an opportunity or a threat, and our interpretation

inﬂuences the way we respond. Among high-performing teams, viewing

conﬂict as a source of strength makes disagreement less harrowing,

reducing the frequency with which colleagues lash out.

## High-Performing Teams Proactively Address Tension

Members of high-performing teams don’t just interpret conﬂict more

adaptively — they’re also more prone to taking the initiative in resolving

it. In our study, we found that they are signiﬁcantly more interested

in “hearing if they upset a teammate,” and more willing to proactively

reach out if “something didn’t feel right between me and a teammate.”

Both responses reﬂect a broader tendency among high-performing

teams to embrace a growth mindset when it comes to colleague

relationships. This term is typically used to describe the way successful

people respond to setbacks: by believing that outcomes can be improved through eﬀort, learning, and perseverance.

Members of high-performing teams hold a similar perspective when it

comes to workplace relationships. In our survey, they were signiﬁcantly

more likely to agree with the statements “even the best work

relationships have their ups and downs,” and “most work relationships

can be damaged and repaired.”

In other words, they believe tension is temporary and, with a little eﬀort, thorny relationships can be salvaged. Those views make them

more likely to take action in the face of the occasional relational blip.

. . .

It’s no surprise that trust is at the core of high-performing teams.

What our research reveals is the degree to which that trust emerges

as a result of everyday peer-to-peer interactions that facilitate better

# communication and stronger teamwork.

Building trust in the workplace can’t and shouldn’t fall solely on the

shoulders of management. After all, trust isn’t relayed from the top

down. It’s built organically on a foundation of behaviors exhibited by all

team members that empower everyone to produce their best work.
