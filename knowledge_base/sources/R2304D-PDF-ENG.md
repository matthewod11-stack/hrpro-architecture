Business leaders today are confronting labor challenges of the greatest

consequence. Because of inﬂation and the pandemic, workers feel

less secure in their jobs and uncertain about whether they can aﬀord

a decent life—trends that have been mounting for decades. At the

same time, they want more from their jobs: In addition to higher

pay and digniﬁed working conditions, they expect their employers to

reﬂect their values. Thanks to social media, employees are able to

communicate their expectations, experiences, and grievances in new

## ways. They can share privately with one another and widely with the

public, in real time. They can connect with and enlist customers and

other stakeholders as allies more easily than ever, making it harder

for employers to suppress their voices. Given all these forces, it’s not

surprising that a growing number of workers, across a wide range of

industries and roles, are organizing.

In fact, worker interest in joining a union is at its highest in decades—

and in the United States public support for unions is as high as it was

in 1965. Urged on by a new generation of labor leaders, many workers

actually see organizing as an expression of care for their companies.

We expect this trend—which includes unions (organized by occupation,

company, or otherwise) and many other forms of organized labor, from

## informal employee petitions and walkouts to more-formal structures

## such as mutual aid groups and worker cooperatives—to intensify in the

# years ahead.

Most companies aren’t prepared for this new wave of organized labor.

For much of the past century, when workers organized to demand

change, companies’ knee-jerk reaction was fear that unions would

hurt shareholder value by raising labor costs or slowing innovation.

CEOs responded with one strategy: Fight, at all costs. This was brutally

eﬀective. In the last half of the 20th century, with companies perfecting

the skill of union busting and labor laws too weak to deter it, unions

lost much of their power and inﬂuence—so much so that most business

leaders now have little experience with organized labor.

If companies continue to assume that organized labor destroys value

and to reﬂexively ﬁght all collective-action eﬀorts, as has been

happening at Starbucks, Amazon, and elsewhere, they run an enormous

—even existential—risk. They may permanently disenchant their

workforce and stamp out employees’ investment in their company’s

success. They also risk harming their brands: U.S. consumers now

consider the treatment of workers to be the most important of

environmental, social, and governance issues. Even some shareholders

are starting to look positively at organized labor.

Business leaders can choose a diﬀerent path: They can start working

to reinvent corporate America’s relationship with labor so that more

people can share in the rewards and companies can compete and

grow in new ways. Choosing that path will require leaders to learn

how to work with, rather than against, labor. Indeed, in the next 20

years, the skill of leading an organized workforce—or leading as if your

workforce is organized, regardless of its union status—may well become

# the critical leadership skill.

To be sure, the unions’ old playbooks need updating, too. In

conversations with labor leaders, we’ve heard that the societal shifts

## that challenge companies also prompt disruption and soul-searching

among traditional labor organizations. Both must evolve.

In this article, building on insights from a roundtable we host with the

## Aspen Institute’s Economic Opportunities Program and MIT’s Institute

for Work and Employment Research, we lay out a more collaborative

—and eﬀective— approach to leading the organized, and organizing,

workforce. We’ll focus on the U.S. landscape in this article, but we’ll

also highlight approaches that work in Europe and around the world.

Ultimately, we hope to build a foundation for overdue discussions about

how business and organized labor need to modernize, and how to bring

about changes in the law to accommodate new realities.

# The Balance of Power

## Every step of the labor-organizing process presents an opportunity

to build trust and act in the interest of long-term success—or

to hamstring progress. If companies and unions forge successful

relationships, workers and companies reap beneﬁts. These include

better employee satisfaction (and retention), training opportunities

(union apprenticeships are some of the best training available),

improved customer service, new ways of introducing technology, and

# more.

While not every union representative will be a willing partner in

a constructive relationship, the workers they represent generally

want respectful engagement from both sides. Stakeholders—including

## employees, customers, investors, and others—may look to the party

with more power to set the standard. Despite what it may feel like to

a CEO during an organizing campaign, companies typically have much

more power than their workers do. So we recommend that employers

lead by taking the high road, whether or not their organized labor

counterparts start there.

Leaders have many choices in responding to organizing—choices that

## respect workers’ rights and result in a stronger company. Options

range from voluntarily recognizing the union without requiring a

## National Labor Relations Board–administered election (an increasingly

popular approach), to remaining neutral and leaving your employees to

decide whether to organize (as Microsoft recently did), to respectfully

communicating why you don’t think organizing is the answer to

# employee concerns.

Ironically, the labor organizations likely to be most valuable to

business will be the strongest ones. Good partnerships require partners

with balanced power. Strong unions cultivate deep relationships with

workers and are their legitimate, democratically elected representatives.

A labor organization capable of deploying a full range of methods

—collaborating, yes, but also building coalitions with customers,

community leaders, and investors; seeking a role in corporate

governance; and, as a last resort, striking—might be exactly the balance

of power that will serve business best in the long run.

If your employees do organize, how do you build a relationship that

## serves your needs for ﬂexibility and productivity and also meets

workers’ new demands? Companies need to take an active role in

relating to organized labor, rather than passively accept whatever a

worker organization wants. A good relationship requires two attentive,

## powerful parties. Traditional arm’s-length labor-management relations

and collective bargaining fail to meet workers’ expectations for a

## greater voice and impede business opportunities for ﬂexibility and

# productivity.

Getting to a Contract

The foundation of most union work in the United States is collective

bargaining: reaching a contractual agreement between a company and

its workforce as represented by a union. Contract negotiations can go

well or poorly depending on how the company and the union manage

them. Here are some guidelines for getting started.

Assume that you don’t understand your own workers. Many

companies argue that a union is a “third party” that has ulterior

motives—for example, building its own membership regardless of

potential harm to companies or even some workers. Companies use that

assumption as an excuse to ignore valid worker concerns.

That’s a damaging starting point. Every organized group of workers has

asks. Your ﬁrst step is to learn what they are—and the way to do that is

to pose questions and listen. Invite elected leaders to spell out their asks

and the underlying problems that give rise to them. Most executives

know surprisingly little about what life is like for their workers. To really

understand what they want, you also need to get out to the front lines

and engage workers directly in conversation.

While many union leaders want to see companies succeed, some are

indiﬀerent to causing a company harm. In that case, you’ll need to

ﬁgure out who else at the union you can appeal to. Build relationships

with union representatives who recognize that when companies thrive,

their workers also thrive.

Invest in training. Given how long unions have been in decline, your

company may lack the leadership skills necessary to build a relationship

with a labor organization. If that’s the case, invest in training.

Consider Kaiser Permanente, which, when it started building a labor-

management partnership 25 years ago, teamed up with union leaders

and invested in training managers, supervisors, union representatives,

and all new hires in how to collaborate successfully with one another.

That investment paid oﬀ—for example, in avoiding job loss when the

company transitioned to electronic medical records. Prior to forming

the partnership with the unions, Kaiser had suﬀered a decade of losses;

since the partnership, it has managed two decades of strong returns

while paying industry-leading wages. At times, relationships with the

unions have been fraught, like any partnership—and that’s OK.

To help steer your company through negotiations, whether smooth

or rocky, you should consider sending union and management

representatives to oﬀsite training programs together, to develop

everybody’s skills while strengthening their relationships.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Labor-Savvy Leader

## Seek advice from an expert who shares your goals. Some companies

retain an outside lawyer or consultant to negotiate with their

workforces. Rule out anybody associated with a ﬁrm that specializes

in “union avoidance.” No matter what lip service those ﬁrms pay to

the idea of partnership with the other side, they often delay or avoid

reaching an agreement, damage company reputations, and fail to build

# a productive relationship with labor.

The labor organizations likely to be the most valuable to business will be the strongest ones. Good partnerships require partners with balanced power.

If you hire a consultant, make sure that the person has a successful

track record in negotiating ﬁrst contracts, always a challenging task, and

understands the importance of laying a foundation for an innovative

and trusting relationship. Steer clear of contract language that protects

“management prerogatives” by minimizing the union’s inﬂuence.

Remember that while your negotiator will represent you, you’re the

one who has ﬁnal say. Successful high-road negotiations require senior

management to get directly involved and to avoid overdelegating to

# consultants.

Whether or not you hire an outside negotiator, you’ll need an internal

negotiating team staﬀed with managers from a variety of departments

who understand your approach and share your goals. Your toughest

discussions may not be with the union team across the table but within

your own team, so do everything you can to ﬁnd and empower internal

allies. Even if your company had a hostile posture toward unions in the

past, you will ﬁnd people eager to turn over a new leaf and collaborate.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Labor-Savvy Leader

Set the ground rules. This involves “bargaining over how to

bargain.” Meet early with union representatives to deﬁne rules for the

negotiations—for example, when and how to use sidebar caucuses, the

frequency of meetings, how both sides should communicate with the

media and constituents, and whether to use subcommittees. Working

out these rules can make it much easier to get started and can shape

how later, more-substantive negotiations will fare.

This process can be diﬃcult. As we’ve seen at Starbucks and at some

universities, many younger workers demand open negotiations in

which the outside world can experience events at the bargaining table

in real time—via Zoom, Twitter, or the like. Old-school labor negotiators

may pull their hair out at the thought, but remember: Management

needs to experiment to discover new solutions.

Set the tone yourself. Many unions fear that companies’ management

teams aren’t interested in negotiating in good faith and would prefer

to delay and confuse matters for as long as possible. That fear

is valid, given the traditional playbook of many newly unionized

companies, so reassure your union representatives right from the start.

## An appropriately senior member of your management team, even the

CEO or the head of the relevant business unit, should set the tone

in the opening session by expressing a sincere desire for frank, civil

discussions in which people listen actively, ask lots of questions, and

introduce ideas with a collaborative “What if we…?” framing. Guides

to negotiation—among them the classic Getting to Yes—encourage

participants to focus on the other side’s interests rather than their own

demands. That’s good advice for labor negotiations.

How does this look in practice? Consider how Dennis Rocheleau,

a retired head of labor relations at General Electric, once opened

# negotiations:

We are not so naive as to believe that our mutual interest in

a peaceful, equitable settlement will automatically produce a

consensus on how such an agreement should be deﬁned. If we both see

the world in precisely the same relief and hues, one of us is probably

unnecessary. We recognize that the world is wide, and there is room

enough in it to accommodate an expansive range of opinions and

## attitudes…listen to others’ perspective on an issue, explore many

alternatives, eschew a reﬂexive retreat to the homey conﬁnes of your

preconceived ideals or traditions.

Bargaining is emotional, and ﬂare-ups, walkouts, and showboating on

both sides of the table are common. Expect this. Tolerate some of it. But

call out personal attacks or actions that violate the norms and rules of

the game that you agreed to at the outset.

Decide what to bargain over. Labor law mandates only a few topics for

bargaining—notably, wages, hours, and working conditions. However,

workers today interpret “working conditions” to include not only

## physical safety but also voice and respect, company values, climate

change, and other social policies. Whether or not the law requires you to

bargain over these issues, you’re better oﬀ addressing them head-on if

you want a process that builds trust.

DEI has ﬁgured prominently in recent

# negotiations in many industries, as in

provisions negotiated by SEIU Local

# 1199NW (a union of nurses and service

# workers) and Seattle-based Swedish

Hospital, and in the wind-farm industry,

where union agreements often include

explicit provisions for recruiting a diverse

# workforce.

# Thomas Heinz

## Another increasingly important bargaining

topic is how to introduce technology into

the workplace, especially given shifts in manufacturing technologies

and advances in artiﬁcial intelligence. Unions like SAG-AFTRA in the

entertainment industry and UNITE HERE in hospitality are negotiating

with companies like MGM Resorts, Caesars, and others to get advance

notice of technological plans and to create opportunities for worker

# input in the design of new technologies.

Ask yourself: What’s good for everybody? The holy grail in labor

negotiations is a contract that gives workers what they want and

strengthens the company. If you see a negotiation as a zero-sum game

where any gain for workers costs you, then you’ll miss opportunities to

invest in worker success that will beneﬁt the company. There are no

cookie-cutter approaches here, so you and the union have to innovate

to ﬁnd shared wins. (And if you’ve built a healthy negotiation process,

you’ll ﬁnd it’s easier to innovate from a place of trust.) Eventually, yes,

labor negotiations come down to tough trade-oﬀs. Experiment where

you can, and make sure you know your limits.

If you’re concerned that the union will protect weak performers, say

no to contract terms that do that (for example, allowing for promotions

based on seniority); in exchange, provide more for workers in other

areas (for example, adding more pay based on performance, as some

independent Canadian unions have negotiated).

As in any negotiation, each party will look for ways to gain advantage.

That’s normal. Just make sure you set boundaries that prohibit behavior

that’s either wrong (like researching union leaders’ personal lives

and embarrassing them, a surprisingly common tactic recommended

## by “union avoidance” consultants) or destructive to your goal of a

## productive relationship with your workforce.

These practices will help you get oﬀ on the right foot, but deadlocks

or strikes are always possible, even in well-structured, good-faith

negotiations. That’s why you need to do more than just negotiate a

# contract.

# Beyond the Contract

As in any constructive business relationship, you should follow a

no-surprises principle to engender trust. Engage your labor-leader

counterparts in an ongoing dialogue and keep them informed about

business developments. You’d rather that labor leaders hear about a

change from you than have them read it in the press or hear it from

a disgruntled union member.

Consider creating teams that bring together management

representatives with workers and labor leaders to problem-solve in an

ongoing way. These teams can improve the operations of your company

and give workers a more direct voice in their work. Kaiser Permanente

has nearly 4,000 such teams, which it (and some other health care

organizations) calls “unit-based teams.” Similarly, Harley-Davidson,

Ford, and others have made extensive use of continuous-improvement

# teams at the plant level.

Bargaining is emotional, and flare-ups on both sides are common. Expect this. Tolerate some of it. But call out personal attacks that violate the norms you agreed to at the outset.

Companies achieve the best returns on investments in new technology

when they merge implementation with complementary changes in work

processes, employee training, and worker input. Labor can help with

this, too. The United Brotherhood of Carpenters union, for example, has

created an expansive training center in Las Vegas that oﬀers courses to

## its members on the latest technologies and state-of-the-art leadership

techniques that are as good as those that elite business schools provide.

The center brings in prototypes of new materials and production

## techniques from companies as diverse as Lincoln Electric, 3M, Duke

Energy, and others. It both trains members, so that they can return

to their jobs and train others, and oﬀers vendors feedback on their

products. It’s a modern way of practicing what Japanese carmakers like

Toyota said years ago: It is workers who give wisdom to the machines.

Through negotiated provisions in collective bargain-ing agreements,

unions run some of the largest training institutions in the country.

These are often governed collaboratively—by labor-management trusts,

## apprenticeship programs, and internal company training programs.

One of the most highly respected union training programs is UNITE

HERE’s Culinary Academy, also in Las Vegas. The program trains

workers for newly emerging jobs in hospitality, allows them to move

from one occupation to another (for example, from housekeeping to

restaurant positions), and serves as a one-stop center for supporting

immigrant workers, teaching English as a second language, and

referring workers at risk of or experiencing layoﬀs to new jobs.

# Beyond the American Model

So far, we’ve focused on the legacy American model of the relationship

between unions and management. But there are other models, notably

in Europe, and some companies will need to embrace them. That’s the

case for the growing number of companies whose workforce includes

## many independent contractors, or other types of workers—middle

management, domestic workers—whom current labor law ignores or

excludes. And, of course, there are occupations where workers organize

## without a union—as in professional associations in law and medicine, or

# local worker centers.

However strong your company’s culture and communications may be,

and whether or not your employees are unionizing or unionized, you

can make your ﬁrm’s relationship with its workforce even stronger by

aﬀording your workers as much direct agency as possible over the issues

# that matter to them most.

Consider creating joint management-labor teams that can advise on

## such issues as safety and health; diversity, equity, and inclusion;

and technological innovations. Many companies already have in place

employee resource groups (ERGs) that provide a forum to people of

color, women, LGBTQ+ employees, and allies; ERGs with an expanded

remit could serve as a model for other advisory teams.

Some companies put a worker-elected representative on their board of

directors, as software company Honeycomb does. In many countries,

especially in Europe, this “codetermination” is common. A worker with

a ﬁduciary duty to the company can create a channel for employees to

## better understand corporate strategy, pass information directly to the

board in an open way, be heard, and ensure that workforce questions

become a regular item on the board’s agenda. The process of electing

representatives can also bring employees closer together and give them

practice resolving issues as a group. In Germany, where workers sit

on company boards by law, those workers promote higher rates of

## investment, higher stock values, board-member gender diversity, and

better knowledge ﬂows between management and employees.

To ensure that workers have an economic stake in the success of the

ﬁrm, some companies broadly distribute employee ownership. At ﬁrms

that are unionized, this is a useful tool that gives a labor organization

the incentive to see the company thrive. Many venture-capital-backed

companies have done this by granting stock options to employees.

## Private-equity-backed companies (some with the help of the nonproﬁt

Ownership Works) look for ways for workers to share in the value they

## help create, through proﬁt-sharing and other programs.

# Beyond Your Company

As companies embrace the idea of experimenting with organized labor,

best practices will emerge and may serve as a basis for ﬁxing long-

stagnant U.S. labor law. For example, in Europe, companies allow for

workplace or companywide “works councils” elected by workers to

advise on a range of issues—and U.S. law could change to make it easier

to form similar councils, which are currently illegal.

Solutions will also emerge at the industry level. In the United

States, most unions are organized by workplace or company. This

## creates unusual incentives for unions and an uneven playing ﬁeld

for companies: Firms that are unionized and pay good wages have

to compete with nonunionized rivals that pay lower wages. A better

approach would be to introduce sectoral or industry-level bargaining, a

practice that was once more common in the U.S. This is an area where

companies can organize—for example, by seeking bigger bargaining

groups that cover enough of their industry to remove the competitive

“I’m unionized, but they’re not” dynamic. Companies can then focus

on competing on areas other than labor costs: quality of service,

# innovation, and more.

Another way to revive sectoral bargaining is to create employment

## standards boards that bring business, labor, and government together

in a single industry at the local level. Last year, California passed

legislation to create one such board in the fast-food industry. Similar

boards operate in major cities around the country.

The federal government now encourages companies bidding for

government contracts to work with labor organizations in oﬀering high-

quality jobs. Business leaders should use these opportunities to show

they can collaborate with organized labor to meet critical national

# needs.

by the war, and work needed to evolve to reﬂect the new reality. After

years of often-violent struggle, employees at big companies organized

and bargained for regular raises, health care, weekends oﬀ, retirement

plans, and more. In 1950 General Motors and the United Auto Workers

negotiated the so-called Treaty of Detroit, which pegged wage increases

to increases in the cost of living and the national rate of productivity

growth. That eﬀort set a new standard that spread quickly to other

companies and ultimately brought a new social contract into being that

would govern employment, drive growth, and help workers share in

prosperity for decades to follow.

Today, our society and economy have transformed again, encompassing

everything from new technology to a tighter labor market, rising worker

## expectations for a voice in decision-making, increased public demands

to hold businesses accountable for treating employees fairly, and even

## the risks of political extremism that stem from workers’ discontent.

Workers are calling for a new social contract. If business leaders stretch

to create a new playbook for working with organized labor, we can again

set our economy and society up for prosperity for workers and thriving

success for companies in the decades to come.
