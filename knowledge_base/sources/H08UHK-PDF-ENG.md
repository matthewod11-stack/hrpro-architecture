Effective communication is the foundation of high-performing

organizations, particularly in an era of remote work and an expanding

## array of digital tools like Slack, Teams, WhatsApp, and internal digital

bulletin boards. Yet many leaders fail to set clear communication

norms, resulting in burnout, ineﬃcient onboarding, wasted time, and

reduced productivity.

## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Streamline How We Communicate at Work

Consider a few real-world breakdowns. A manager sends a detailed

memo ahead of a decision-making meeting—only to discover no one

read it. A colleague misses an urgent Zoom call because the alert was

sent via Slack, which they rarely check. A CEO delays approval of a

six-page memo because the sender didn’t include a summary in the

email body. And a leader preparing for a board meeting receives ﬁve inconsistent reports from ﬁve diﬀerent business units, wasting hours

harmonizing them.

These examples illustrate the friction that arises when communication

norms are unclear. As AI-assisted writing becomes more prevalent,

written communication volume will only grow. This makes it even more

critical to establish clear norms that prioritize readability—ensuring

that human readers can easily process information, no matter whether

it’s authored by a person, an AI, or a collaboration between the two.

We’ve conducted hundreds of randomized experiments on eﬀective

communication and coached dozens of organizations on improving

## their writing cultures—from the U.S. Army to Microsoft, from the Mayo

Clinic to startups. And we’ve learned that there are several essential topics that leaders and teams must address to build their own eﬀective

writing culture—and avoid the kinds of problems described above.

# Responsiveness Expectations

One of the bigger stressors in workplace communication can be

mismatched urgency expectations. Research on “email urgency bias”

shows that recipients often feel pressured to respond faster than

senders actually expect. Conversely, some messages requiring quick

decisions go unnoticed for days. Both scenarios create unnecessary

friction and slow teams down.

To prevent these misalignments, organizations should establish clear norms for response times across diﬀerent communication channels. For

instance, a team might agree that emails require a 24-hour response,

while Slack or Teams messages need acknowledgment within a few

hours. Just as importantly, teams should have a shared practice for

letting senders know when a timely response isn’t possible—preventing

# frustration and bottlenecks.

In addition to response speed, teams must clarify when employees are

expected to engage. Without explicit norms, after-hours communication

can blur work-life boundaries, leading to burnout and uneven

workloads. To prevent this, some organizations establish “quiet hours,”

implement automated reminders about communication boundaries, or

encourage the use of “send-later” features to delay messages outside of

working hours. By proactively setting these expectations, leaders foster

a work culture that balances responsiveness with well-being—ensuring

employees know when they need to be available and when they can

# fully disconnect.

# Specific Channels for Specific Uses

A manufacturing CEO we have advised expressed frustration that

updates arrived inconsistently across multiple platforms, making it easy

to miss critical information. “I have to check every platform… it leads

to me missing key information, getting time-sensitive updates too late,

and wasting too much time.”

People and teams vary in how they use diﬀerent communication

channels. For some, urgent requests are sent through text message

or WhatsApp, for others it’s Slack or Teams. For others it’s email or

short memos. As the CEO quoted above laments, this can lead to

costly ineﬃciencies. Mapping common activities to speciﬁc channels

can solve this. Explicitly setting these norms can save time and reduce

the risk of missing key information. As with every topic we discuss,

there is no single right answer. Being inconsistent within teams, though,

can be costly.

# Make Reading Easy

## Writing for Busy Readers: Communicate More Effectively in the Real

World (co-authored by Todd along with Jessica Lasky-Fink), lays out

six science-based principles for writing so busy people will actually

read and respond. The core idea? Make it easy for skimmers. While

the speciﬁcs vary by context, teams that establish clear norms around

readability can ensure that their messages get through with minimal

# wasted time.

One of the most important principles is less is more. As Blaise Pascal

famously wrote, “I’m sorry this letter is so long. I would have written

a shorter one if I’d had more time.” Our research supports Pascal’s

wisdom. In one experiment, we randomly assigned 7,000 elected and

appointed leaders to receive either a 129-word request to complete a

survey or a version where we removed the middle sentences so it was

only 49 words. When we tested both versions with an independent group, most assumed the longer one would be more eﬀective. But the data told a diﬀerent story—cutting words nearly doubled the response

# rate.

However, brevity isn’t always the ideal approach. A team at the United

Nations that one of us (Todd) worked with encountered an unexpected

challenge: Reports were capped at 6,500 words, and most submissions

predictably reached that limit. While a shorter, 3,000-word report might

be more reader-friendly, it could also be perceived as the writer not

doing a thorough job. In this case, the word limit unintentionally

became a word-length expectation—reinforcing the idea that anything

shorter was incomplete. This is why leaders must be publicly committed

to resetting the organizational norms. Without buy-in, less could still be more eﬀective, but more could be seen as better.

. . .

Eﬀective communication isn’t just about writing less—it’s about making reading easier. But ease looks diﬀerent in diﬀerent settings. That’s why

teams should explicitly deﬁne their communication norms, ensuring

## clarity and consistency in everything from emails to reports. Once those

expectations are clear, organizations can reinforce them across their

# teams and workﬂows.
