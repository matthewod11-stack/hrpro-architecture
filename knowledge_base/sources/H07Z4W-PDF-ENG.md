Workplace ﬂexibility ranks as the most important element to workers

today, second to salary, according to global nonproﬁt The Conference

Board. Hybrid work schedules, where individuals split time working

from home and from the oﬃce, help put work in its rightful place. Such

ﬂexible working schedules allow people to prioritize personal goals

like physical activity and spend more time with their family. This is

signiﬁcant given that Pew Research Center ﬁnds 73% of U.S. adults say

family time is one of the most important things in their life.

Beyond the personal beneﬁts, workplace ﬂexibility is also good for

workplace diversity. Women and younger generations are more likely to seek ﬂexible work, making it an attractive oﬀering for employers

seeking to recruit a diverse workforce and improve workplace equity

# and well-being.

## Yet, amidst the uptick in return-to-oﬃce mandates, hybrid work

schedules can be an emotional and complex topic. According to Stanford research, hybrid working does not typically aﬀect worker

productivity but some managers simply don’t feel their employees

are as productive when working from home. These types of concerns,

and not knowing their employer’s stance on hybrid work, can make it

awkward for employees to broach the topic of pivoting to a ﬂexible work

# schedule.

Consider the following scenario:

## Allison, a valued part of the leadership team at a large ﬁnancial

organization, recently hit her 3-year tenure. She recognized the

company’s broader commitment to well-being but felt like she had

previously hit roadblocks when speaking up about efficiency and

productivity. Allison wanted to shift to a hybrid schedule but her day-

to-day work and life responsibilities left her with little time and space

to prepare her best case for a more ﬂexible work schedule. Then,

one day, in a one-on-one meeting, her manager told her that she’d

love to see her practice diverse thinking, using logic and evidence to

challenge thought processes creatively. This got Allison thinking…

Allison’s scenario is a real one, not hypothetical — we worked together.

In our coaching, we discussed how her manager’s comment could be

used as a springboard for her ﬂexible working request. This article

outlines ﬁve strategies that Allison used — and that you can use, too

— to conﬁdently and respectfully negotiate a hybrid work schedule.

- 1. Understand your employer’s side

Research ﬁnds hybrid work is trending up, from 35% in January

2022 to 41% in March 2023. Yet, remote work is still a young

concept. And young concepts carry both excitement and uncertainty.

Approximately two-thirds of business leaders surveyed by the Federal

Reserve Bank of New York in August 2023 say remote work negatively

impacted four areas: workplace culture, cohesiveness and team

## environment, communication among employees, and training and

mentorship. On the ﬂip side, the same survey found that more than

half of respondents believe work-from-home policies make it easier to recruit staﬀ, and more than two-thirds of respondents said such policies help to retain staﬀ.

Appreciate that your company may be riding a similar wave of

excitement and uncertainty. Here are some tips to better understand

your employer’s perspective around remote work, and to help you

prepare for and conduct a productive and empathetic discussion:

- Speak with key people like your manager (and, if you have one, your

## skip manager), clients and customers, and your colleagues in Human

Resources to learn their perspectives on the upsides and downsides of

hybrid schedules. Gathering insights from the research and data that

your company may be using to inﬂuence work-from-home policies

will also help you build your business case for a shift to hybrid work.

Be sure to understand the CEO’s stance and plans around in-person,

remote, and hybrid work. Being mindful of various perspectives and

insights signals you’re operating as an inclusive team player who’s

committed to the company’s success and growth.

- Take care when crafting your questions. Psychologists sometimes

refer to “why” questions as philosophical and theoretical — an avenue

to discourage learning and keep us in the past. An alternative question

like “how come” may invite a less threatening, more solution-focused

dialogue. Try to use words that prompt an emotional response,

like “feel” or “thoughts.” You could ask, “How do you feel about

my productivity when working remotely?” If your manager voices a

concern, you can ask, “What are your thoughts on how I might address

this?” Or, better yet, proactively suggest a solution.

- Finally, rewire yourself to listen and repeat. Your thoughts about

your manager or coworkers may be clouded, especially if there’s

tension or if you’ve worked with them for a long time. If that’s the case,

you’ll need to be intentional about not letting your biases distort your

understanding of a situation. Summarize what you’re hearing from

others with phrasing like, “So what I’m understanding is…” or “What

I hear you saying is…” By listening closely and repeating what you

hear, you’ll increase the likelihood of being on the same page, be better

prepared to empathize, and be able to go into future conversations

# with an open mind.

- 2. Own your rationale(s)

A long commute is often top of mind as a reason not to go into the

oﬃce, but there are other rationales. Think through your rationale(s) and own them. Maybe your team is based across diﬀerent global or

U.S. time zones and it would make sense to conduct some of your 40-

hour workweek during times when the oﬃce is closed. Perhaps you’re

## a caregiver to a young child or a parent with Alzheimer’s. Perhaps

you’re managing your own medical condition. Leesman, an employee-

experience research ﬁrm, ﬁnds “between 15-18% of workers self-select

as having an impairment that impacts them at work.” Maybe you’re

going through the grieving process. According to Option B, a nonproﬁt co-founded by Sheryl Sandberg, 60% of employers still only oﬀer up to

three bereavement days. If that’s the case at your company, then your

hybrid schedule ask could also test out a low-risk bereavement-support

# option.

Whatever your rationale(s), it may pave the way for a short-term trial

run while you build your case for a long-term hybrid work arrangement.

- 3. Strengthen your ask with purposeful priming

Priming, in this context, means reiterating key points to prepare

and warm someone up to your ideas. In priming talks with your

manager, look for opportunities to prove you’re trustworthy, eﬃcient,

and productive in order to calm fears around the previously mentioned

## remote-work concerns: negative impact on workplace culture, team

## environment and relationships, communication, and training and

mentoring. Here are some ways you can do this:

- Demonstrate your value. Are you consistently working smarter, and

not harder, to drive clear business impact? Can you show that you’ve

done some of your best work while working remotely? Perhaps you can

also think of times when you’ve deepened connections and built trust

while working remotely. Keep these stories top of mind. Now is the

time to toot your horn.

- Demonstrate your communication skills. Indirect communication

— such as email, text, chat, and videoconferencing — can often lead

to misinterpretation and misunderstanding. Have you shown you’re

a strong communicator across these mediums? According to a WFH

Research survey of more than 1,900 employees, hybrid workers spent

around 50% of their time in meetings, while that number was roughly

## 24% for fully remote workers, and about 22% for in-person workers.

What are you doing to reduce or streamline meetings, and make them more eﬃcient? How can you show the impact of your eﬀorts?

- Demonstrate your ability to maintain your workload.

Communicate your strategy for documenting your workload. Think

about what stops you from accomplishing your key objectives — it’s good to know who or what takes you oﬀ track, and if a hybrid schedule

could help. Proactively documenting your workload makes you and

your projects more visible to your manager, which lessens their mental

## load. Task management tools like Trello or Asana, or even a simple

checklist on Google Sheets, can be helpful resources.

- 4. Propose a thoughtful, logical schedule

Microsoft’s data points to three moments when in-person work is most

# beneﬁcial:

- strengthening team cohesion

- onboarding to a new role, team, or company • kicking oﬀ a project

If you’re in any of these moments, now may not be the time to request a

# hybrid work schedule.

If you’re not in any of these scenarios, then consider using data

to propose common days and times for in-oﬃce and remote work.

According to Pew Research Center, approximately 59% of hybrid

workers say they work remotely three or more days in a typical week,

while 41% say they work remotely two days or less per week. Tuesday to

Thursday are the most common in-oﬃce days, with Monday and Friday

being the most common work-from-home days.

## Sometimes, the root issue for in-oﬃce mandates or manager hesitance

to approve a hybrid work schedule is fear over the loss of familiarity

and control. You can tackle a small layer of this fear by proactively

and intentionally planning. When scheduling workplace days, 81% of

hybrid workers scheduled to work onsite on the day they were heading

into the oﬃce, while only 10% scheduled their days in the oﬃce

over a month in advance. (Sometimes you can stand out by doing

what the data shows most people aren’t doing but should be doing.)

Another way to demonstrate intentional planning is to schedule your

## in-oﬃce days when team-building, collaborative, and creative work

is happening, reserving your remote days for independent tasks and

# critical, analytical thinking.

To further increase buy-in, set a mutually agreeable timeframe to

trial your hybrid schedule, setting goals and expectations so you can

# measure success.

- 5. Be confident and respectful when making the ask

Now that you’ve done the groundwork, bring it all together in an ask.

## Schedule an in-person meeting with your manager sometime after your

formal annual review period. If that’s too far away, try a time when your

performance and impact shine bright. For example, set up a meeting

after you’ve received kudos for a high-visibility project.

In the meeting, your ask could go something like this:

Thank you for acknowledging my work [state a recent achievement or

measurable impact]. I’ve noticed common threads around when I do

my best work. This tends to be when I’m given space for deep thinking

and ﬂexibility, coupled with fun and efficient team collaboration.

We’ve spoken recently about how I’ve [highlight something from your

earlier priming conversations like how you’ve demonstrated excellent

communication skills while working remotely]. Because I’ve noticed

[something speciﬁc from understanding the employer’s side, such as

the CEO’s stance on the future of hybrid work], I thought this would

be a good time to ask for a hybrid schedule.

Whatever you say, you want to come across as assertive, thoughtful,

and respectful. If you follow this advice and your manager is still

unmovable, then be mindful that change brings resistance. Flexible

work isn’t an ancient concept — for most, this is new and unfamiliar

# territory.

If your employer rejects your request for a hybrid schedule, turn it into

a learning experience. Make sure you understand whether this is a “no,”

or a “not right now.” Is there an opportunity to revisit the discussion? If

# so, when and on what conditions?

. . .

The promising reality is that some companies are formalizing pathways

to remote or hybrid work. Under Meta’s new policy, for example,

some employees will be able to apply for fully remote positions after

18 months with positive performance reviews. Many companies have

employees who are solely focused on ﬂexible work. For example, Upwork has a director of Remote Organizational Eﬀectiveness,

## Cleveland Clinic has a Remote + Hybrid Work director, and Zillow and

Microsoft have directors of Flexible Work.

I’d like to conclude with this thought: Workplace ﬂexibility is important

but lingering, deeper workplace problems like burnout or languishing

require multiple cause-based solutions. If you sense you’re experiencing

these deeper issues, I recommend reﬂecting on your core values and ﬁnding diﬀerent ways to fulﬁll them. That may look like suggesting a

change in return-to-oﬃce messaging to include language that seems

less top-down and more empowering, being the architect of your

career by crafting your job, or setting ﬁrmer boundaries at work like

communicating preferences around when to include you on emails or

what constitutes “urgent.”

Building the muscle to advocate for yourself will make you a stronger

employee. After all, companies need employees who can tactfully speak

## up, demonstrate diverse thinking, and conﬁdently drive innovation.
