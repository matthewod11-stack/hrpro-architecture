Silos are a deﬁning characteristic of organizations of all sizes, even

in businesses that naturally operate as ﬂuid networks. For example,

management consulting ﬁrms are known for organizing around

temporary project teams, but they also have formal expertise silos (often

called practices) and ﬁxed regional structures.

Of course, we often hear about the negative side eﬀects of silos:

Boundaries may lead to insular mindsets that inhibit sharing or

collaboration between verticals, or worse, they could lead to ﬁnger-

pointing and turf wars. The incitement to “bust” or “break down” silos

appears frequently both in practitioner and scholarly journals.

But if silos are really such a bad thing, why then do they persist? Silos, or

verticals, exist for three good reasons:

- To aggregate expertise. They provide the focus and critical mass

required to develop expertise on an ongoing basis.

- To assign accountability. They provide boundaries and hierarchy

that make it possible to assign accountability. Responsibilities are

clearly delineated, objectives are well deﬁned, resources are allocated

ﬁrmly, and decisions are made and communicated quickly.

- To provide a sense of identity. They create stability and allow for

the development of collective behavioral norms and ways of working.

These, in turn, provide a sense of identity, security, psychological

safety, and predictability for the people who belong to the silo.

As verticals serve a clear purpose – especially in today’s turbulent

environment – we would like to mount a defense. Yes, verticals have

undesirable side eﬀects, but the solution is not to dismantle them. To

preserve the strengths of the inescapable verticals while minimizing

their side eﬀects, organizations should do two things: build bridges

## between verticals, and institute checks and balances.

# Building Bridges

The topic of building bridges between verticals has been well covered

## already elsewhere. Researchers André de Waal, Michael Weaver, Tammy

Day, and Beatrice van der Heijden have identiﬁed four examples of how

companies build bridges:

- Values. A company’s corporate values statement codiﬁes the behavior

that is expected from employees, and can serve as an eﬀective

compass for all. By including “one-company” behavior in its corporate

values, a company signals that people should think and act beyond

the boundaries of their verticals. It is no surprise that “collaboration”

ﬁgures eminently in studies about frequently cited corporate values.

- Operating model. People within a vertical know by routine how

they should go about their daily work. But they may feel less secure

and be reluctant to collaborate with people in other verticals. Such

collaboration can be facilitated by hardwiring the interfaces between

the verticals: Deﬁning clear procedures (for example for approvals,

consultation, and communication across boundaries) and providing

## an enabling infrastructure (for example, a common IT platform).

Responsibility models, such as RACI, PACSI and others, can help.

- Community and people. When building bridges, “softwiring” is

as important as hardwiring. Companies must create opportunities

for people from diﬀerent verticals to get to know each other’s

## capabilities and interests, for example, through joint training

## programs, cross-functional innovation initiatives, and company-wide

expert networks. Once familiarity is established, people will connect

## more easily whenever a concrete need for collaboration arises.

Likewise, companies must pay attention to networking skills when

recruiting people, designing training programs, considering sideways

career moves, and measuring and rewarding performance.

- Leadership. The eﬀectiveness of both hardwiring and softwiring

depends on the company’s leaders. They should have the skills

and incentives to collaborate, for example by having performance

indicators that measure the desired behaviors. They should

## demonstrate collaborative behavior themselves, for example, by

showing loyalty to the joint decisions made in the management team.

As the above list shows, bridges by and large call upon the enlightened

benevolence of people in diﬀerent verticals. That may or may not

work: While managers may genuinely acknowledge the beneﬁts of

collaboration, they still compete with one another for resources, senior

# management attention and power.

This is where checks and balances enter the picture: They enable

companies to minimize the side-eﬀects of verticals more forcefully than

bridges do.

# Checks and Balances

Let’s ﬁrst explain what we mean by checks and balances. A company’s

## corporate objectives and key performance indicators (KPIs) reﬂect

upper management and stakeholder expectations for revenues, proﬁts,

cash generation, ESG goals, etc. These are then translated into vertical-

speciﬁc objectives and KPIs that should be clear, motivational, and

actionable. That exercise, however, is complicated by two phenomena:

- Imperfect knowledge. Managers of vertical A often have to make

decisions on the basis also of knowledge that relates to matters in

vertical B. But since their knowledge of vertical B is imperfect, they

are bound to omit things and make mistakes. For example, at one

power company we worked with, the business development team has

to make assumptions about the evolution of maintenance costs over

the lifecycle of the plant. While the best knowledge of those costs

surely is within the maintenance department, we found that business

development – out of ignorance, lack of time, or for other reasons –

## didn’t inquire systematically with maintenance.

- Partial optimization. Managers of vertical A make choices to

optimize their vertical’s performance. Unfortunately, it may be the

case that their choices are detrimental to the company’s overall

## performance, either directly (because the corporate KPIs and the

vertical’s KPIs don’t perfectly align) or indirectly (by aﬀecting vertical

B’s performance negatively). For example, at the power company, the

business development team decided to hire technical staﬀ within its

own vertical, as opposed to working with the corporate engineering

team, thus reducing the latter’s scale and overall performance. Or

business development occasionally used less experienced contractors,

which led to hidden supervision costs down the road.

Checks and balances can mitigate these eﬀects. Checks identify critical

omissions, mistakes and other lapses that a vertical may have made as

## a result of its imperfect knowledge of the subject matter. Balances act

as circuit breakers when partial optimization threatens to damage the

system in its entirety. The following oﬀer examples of practical ways of

instituting checks and balances:

- Separate functions. Transferring a function from one vertical to

another changes its hierarchical reporting line and KPIs, so that it is

less constrained to do a fully objective job. For example, the power

company’s commercial-legal function was carved out from business

development and attached to corporate legal to ensure that all legal

aspects of a bid were duly considered.

- Matrixed positions. A wisely deployed matrix helps establish balance

so companies can change the reporting structures of certain roles.

For example, you could turn the role of the manager in charge of

a function within vertical A into a matrix position — that is, make

## the manager also report to a supervisor within vertical B. Traditional

corporate support functions (such as HR, ﬁnance, and legal) can play

an important role in deﬁning, rolling out, and supporting compliance

of cross-vertical standards, policies and methods — in particular

when the managers in charge of those functions are matrixed to

the verticals and their corporate function. For example, the power

company we worked with assigned its commercial-technical manager

## to both business development and corporate engineering.

- Governance. Assign critical decisions requiring a cross-vertical

purview to an existing or new cross-verticals body. For example, the

power company instituted a new investment committee to review

commercial tenders. Introduce thresholds to escalate approvals for

decisions to an existing higher-level body as a function of their

business impact and risks. If needed, make additional provisions such

## as veto rights or golden vote procedures.

- Three lines model. From a control perspective vertical managers

are the so-called ﬁrst line: They have the primary responsibility

to achieve the objectives assigned to their vertical and manage

the concomitant risks. But speciﬁc second-line functions (such as

## internal control, compliance, cybersecurity, sustainability, and risk)

can provide assistance with managing risks, including the risk of having an insuﬃciently enterprise-wide perspective. Third-line

functions (internal audit) provide additional checks and balances

# across verticals.

- Intervention tools. Institute ad hoc interventions using speciﬁc tools.

For example, the capital projects industry uses a so-called assumptions

book to ensure anticipation, explicitness, and transparency across

verticals. Peer reviews by people from other verticals, shared “lessons

learned” sessions or third-party audits are other examples.

The boundaryless organization is a chimera. Verticals exist for good

reasons: to aggregate expertise, assign accountability, and provide

a sense of identity. To temper the attendant insular mindsets and

behaviors, companies should build bridges between verticals and

# institute checks and balances carefully.
