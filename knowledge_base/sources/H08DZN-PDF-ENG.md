One of the oldest and most persistent gender stereotypes is that

women are too emotional. This stereotype hurts women’s leadership

prospects as they are seen as less ﬁt for leader roles because they are

perceived to be more likely to make irrational, emotion-driven decisions

# than men.

In our research, we contest this lay belief that women’s leadership

capacities are uniquely and easily overwhelmed by their emotions. To

the contrary, we predicted that in uncertain times marked by strong

emotional experiences, women may actually be less likely to act on

their emotions than men when leading. This is because women are

socialized to put others’ needs before their own. In uncertain times,

women will likely feel compelled to make sure that others are doing well

— especially others they have a responsibility for, such as their direct

## reports. Women may, therefore, act less strongly on their own feelings.

Research has shown that anxiety and hope are the two main emotions

experienced in the face of uncertainty and are often seen as two

opposite responses to a volatile environment. We examined leaders’

## experiences of anxiety and hope as well as their subsequent leadership

behaviors during the early stages of the Covid-19 pandemic — a time

of high uncertainty. Critically, anxiety and hope relate to people’s

perceptions of controllability in one’s environment; those experiencing

anxiety perceive very little controllability, whereas those experiencing

hope are more apt to believe they still have some control over their

# environment.

We draw on appraisal theories of emotions, which state that emotions

result from how a person appraises or interprets a speciﬁc situation.

One way that leaders experiencing anxiety may seek to restore some

control over their environment is by wielding power over their reports,

engaging in hostile, non-physical behaviors that can constitute abusive

supervision. By contrast, leaders feeling hope would perceive some

control and hence would be less likely to seek restoring control for

themselves. Rather, they may be committed to addressing uncertainty

by helping their subordinates. Speciﬁcally, we argue that leaders who

felt more hope would engage in family-supportive supervision, such as

seeking to help with their reports’ non-work demands, an especially

# salient need during the pandemic.

By integrating research on gender roles with appraisal theories of

emotions, we predicted that women may be less aﬀected by their

emotions. They instead engage in emotional labor and managing their

emotions, believing they cannot aﬀord falling prey to them due to their

responsibility for others. Women’s traditional gender roles dictate that

they are communal and helpful. This communal focus and the need

to take care of others should then be pronounced during uncertain

times, so instead of a self-focus on their emotions, their behavior will be

other-focused on their reports’ needs. That is, we expected that women

leaders would refrain from abusive supervision and engage in family-

supportive behaviors, regardless of whether they experienced anxiety or

# hope, respectively.

Women Leaders Tend to Be Less Affected by Their Emotions than Men During Crisis

In our research, we investigated 137 leader-report pairs working in

Europe (primarily the Netherlands) in the service (38%), public (28%),

## or information and technology (23%) sectors during the early phases of

the pandemic in 2020. The majority of leaders were men (56%), Dutch

(59%), white (92%), and heterosexual (95%). The majority of direct

reports were women (56%), Dutch (60%), white (89%), and heterosexual

(88%). These leaders reported their emotions during the pandemic; their

reports then rated their leaders’ behaviors.

Women leaders reported higher levels of anxiety regarding the

pandemic than men leaders. There were no gender diﬀerences in

feelings of hope toward the pandemic. When leaders’ anxiety was

higher, so was their abusive supervision, whereas when leaders’ hope

was higher, so was their family-supportive supervision. Critically,

supporting our hypotheses, we found that these relationships between

leaders’ emotions and behaviors depended on their gender. Leaders’

emotions were only related to their leadership behaviors if they were

men, but not if they were women.

## Namely, in line with gender role and emotional labor theory, women

leaders engaged in low levels of abusive supervision regardless of how

anxious they felt about the pandemic. By contrast, men leaders engaged

in more abusive supervision, including behaviors such as being rude,

ridiculing, yelling at, or lying to their reports when their anxiety was

higher. Women leaders also provided high levels of family-supportive

supervision irrespective of how hopeful they felt about the pandemic.

By contrast, men leaders provided family-supportive supervision only

when they felt more hopeful.

We also acknowledge some limitations of our study. Our sample was

relatively homogenous, including only leaders (and direct reports)

identifying as cisgender women or men, the majority of whom are

heterosexual, thus failing to represent other gender identities and

sexual orientations. Since our theories are based on research concerning

gender roles, it is crucial to extend this line of inquiry to leaders

with diverse gender identities and sexual orientations. Additionally,

our sample was predominantly white, and our study primarily reﬂects

those living and working in a developed economy (the Netherlands).

Research indicates that gender stereotypes and men’s and women’s

self-views may manifest diﬀerently across various cultural settings. For

instance, recent research found that Nigerian women rated themselves

as more agentic and communal compared to German women, whereas

Nigerian men rated themselves as more communal than German men

but similarly agentic. Consequently, our ﬁndings are limited to Western

gender roles. We encourage future research to explore whether these

eﬀects extend to non-Western contexts with racially and gender-diverse

samples of leaders. Such eﬀorts are necessary for more inclusive

## research and science that beneﬁts diverse populations.

## Defying Long Held Stereotypes and Default Theories

Our ﬁndings defy long-held stereotypes of women as solely emotional

leaders and men as solely rational leaders. In the context of uncertainty,

we show that whereas women’s leadership behaviors seem less aﬀected

by their emotions, men’s leadership behaviors were more driven by

their emotions — despite the fact that women reported higher levels

of anxiety surrounding the pandemic. Yet, they were focused on

caring and supporting others during this time of need, supported

by our ﬁnding that women engaged in family-supportive supervision

independent of whether they felt hopeful or not. By contrast, when they

experienced higher levels of anxiety, men leaders tended to engage in

# problematic and abusive behaviors.

It is also important to note that the stereotype of eﬀective leaders

being rational and not driven by emotions has persisted despite the

research indicating that leaders’ emotional tendencies aﬀect how they

lead. In fact, leading with certain emotions can be a strength. For

example, a 2015 meta-analysis shows that leaders’ positive emotions

are positively related with leadership eﬀectiveness, whereas leaders’

negative emotions are negatively related with leadership eﬀectiveness.

As such, leading with positive emotions is indeed eﬀective. Critically,

leaders’ displays of emotions are judged diﬀerently depending on their

gender. Women leaders are particularly penalized for more negative and

dominance-oriented emotions like anger and pride — but not showing

emotions is also harmful for women leaders as that may violate the

expectations that women are warm and communal.

Our work also highlights that classical and common psychological

theories, such as emotion appraisal theories, may not always apply

## to women. Importantly, many investigations of psychological theories

are based on men as the default. These theories may neglect gendered

expectations of how women should behave and gendered socialization

that can lead women to manage their emotions internally rather

than acting upon them. Yet, as our study highlights, women leaders’

experiences and managerial behaviors can diﬀer from those of men

leaders. This highlights the importance of representing many diverse

## populations in both research studies and theorizing.

## Why is This Important for Organizations and Leaders?

Although many people continue to refer to this “woman are too

emotional” narrative as a reason for why women are unsuitable to be

leaders compared to men, our research reveals that this stereotype

is inaccurate and fails to value women’s strengths. Women may be

more likely to experience certain emotions (such as anxiety during the

pandemic, as was the case in our research), but that does not mean

that they are more susceptible to their negative inﬂuence when leading.

Instead, we ﬁnd evidence of women putting others ﬁrst and leading

compassionately during uncertain times, highlighting their unique

# leadership advantages.

More broadly, our research highlights the importance of

leadership behaviors that emphasize care. In our current work

landscape, characterized by uncertainty and anxiety, workers report

wanting leadership that is more understanding and supportive.

Transformational leadership, known for its communal values, is one

such eﬀective approach. Studies show that women are more likely

than men to practice transformational leadership, though this is a

behavior that can be developed or trained. However, although this

leadership style boosts promotability for men, it does not do the

same for women. Therefore, encouraging leaders to compassionately

consider their reports’ needs alone is not enough. It is essential for

leaders and organizations to recognize that caring leadership behaviors

may be valued diﬀerently when adopted by women compared to men.

Recognizing gender bias and understanding how gender stereotypes

shape expectations and evaluations at work is an important step in

addressing the systemic inequalities that beneﬁt one gender over the
