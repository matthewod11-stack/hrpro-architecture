tumble economy — things can sometimes get chaotic at work. When

they do, maintaining your balance becomes a challenge. So, how can

you ﬁnd your footing? Where should you turn for support? And what’s

# What the Experts Say

Navigating turbulence at work is an inevitable part of professional

life, and it’s not often an enjoyable experience. When you’re grappling

## with your boss’s abrupt departure, or layoﬀs in your department, or

an unexpected team reorg, it can feel like the ground is shifting.

Just because chaos is an unavoidable reality doesn’t mean you have

to surrender to it, says Erica Roberts, an organizational leadership

development consultant and executive career coach. Learning to stay

centered is key. “There’s no stability in the world today,” she says.

“Change is constant, so rather than fear it, embrace it and adapt to it.”

Indeed, if you approach the chaos with an open mind and a measure of

resilience, it might even have some upside for your career, says Rebecca

Homkes, a lecturer at London Business School and author of the book,

## Survive, Reset, Thrive: Leading Breakthrough Growth Strategy in Volatile

Times. The goal, she says, is to “make the most out of the changes by

looking for new opportunities and possibilities.” Here’s how.

Give yourself grace. Hectic changes at work can “stir up anxiety, anger,

and frustration,” says Roberts. Being aﬀected by these dynamics isn’t a

sign of weakness. “Allow yourself to feel your feelings,” she says. Change

can be disorienting, so be gentle with yourself. It’s normal not to feel

normal for a while. “When something happens at work, many people —

especially high performers — think they need to go right back to thrive,”

meaning pushing themselves to operate at peak performance, according

to Homkes. “But you need to give yourself permission to be in survival

mode,” at least temporarily. This doesn’t involve “moping around and

feeling sorry for yourself.” Instead, it’s about taking “time to stabilize,”

she says. If you don’t, “how do you explore the right reset for you and

# your career?”

Build resilience. In the immediate aftermath of upheaval, “a purposeful

pause” is in order — but be careful not to let inertia linger. The risk is

that it becomes “a holding pattern of fear” and stagnation, says Homkes.

“When we talk about uncertainty we usually frame it as a terrible thing

we have to deal with and overcome,” she says. But she suggests thinking

## about uncertainty from a diﬀerent, and simpler, perspective: a series of

future events that may or may not occur.

Rather than obsessively ruminating on what lies ahead or worrying

about how things will unfold, Homkes proposes a thought exercise.

Consider: “What could make me and what could break me?” Such an

approach fosters resilience and helps you recognize that even in the

worst-case scenarios — losing your job, getting reassigned, or having a

project pulled — you wouldn’t be ruined. “You calm down,” she says.

The ultimate goal is to shift from a defensive mindset of self-protection

to fostering a growth mindset that embraces new possibilities.

Seek support. Research points to the many beneﬁts of having strong

work relationships — especially when things are hairy. “Hopefully,

you’ve already established connections with your team so when

chaos happens, you’re not isolated,” says Roberts. Decompressing with

colleagues can feel cathartic and some venting is to be expected. Still,

Roberts advises against relying too heavily on your colleagues for help.

“Be discerning about how you process your feelings about what’s going

on at your organization, and be careful about what you say even with

good work friends,” she says. Your comments might be misinterpreted

or shared without your knowledge. Whatever you do, resist the urge to

post about work chaos on social media. “There’s danger in oversharing,

and what you say could have future consequences, says Roberts. “It’s

safer to conﬁde in trusted personal networks outside of work,” such as

## your spouse, your friends, or a therapist.

Be positive and opportunistic… You might ﬁnd there’s a silver lining

to the turmoil happening at work. That’s why Homkes advises “being

heads up, not heads down” about everything going on and keeping an

open mind. Roberts recommends asking yourself three questions: How

do these changes aﬀect my current position? How do they aﬀect how I

## view the organization and/or my future in the organization? And what

opportunities arise from these changes that allow me to advance my

career or enhance my professional skills?

The answers might not be immediately clear, though a positive outlook

could make all the diﬀerence. “You can choose to look at the chaos as

an obstacle to overcome, or you can see it as an opportunity to grow,”

says Roberts. For example, you could think, “This downsizing is going to

hold me back because I will be saddled with more work and I won’t get

the direction I need from my manager.” Or instead, “This downsizing is

giving me the chance to demonstrate my leadership skills and take on

additional responsibilities that will expand my skill set.”

…But stay objective, too. While a dose of optimism is necessary in diﬃcult times, you mustn’t lose sight of the bigger picture. Upheaval

at your organization doesn’t necessarily mean that it’s in trouble

(although, of course, it’s possible). But constant upheaval and a lack

of clear direction might signify that your organization is struggling to

eﬀectively navigate challenges. “Every organization faces uncertainty,

but some organizations handle it better than others,” says Homkes.

“Change without a destination is unhealthy, and if you don’t see

a guiding purpose and midterm strategy, that’s a sign that your

organization isn’t good about how it communicates uncertainty with

# its employees.”

If your organization’s approach raises concerns or if you ﬁnd yourself

constantly questioning its strategies, it’s worth considering whether

you’re in the right place. While “pretending that certainty exists is

delusional,” it’s possible to ﬁnd an organization that’s more aligned with

your values, and where work feels less like a constant whiplash, says

# Homkes.

Reﬂect and reevaluate. The chaos and tumult could be a catalyst for

reevaluating your current position and considering what you want out

of your career, according to Roberts. “People don’t often take the time

to assess their strengths, talents, and priorities as it relates to their

work.” She suggests checking in with yourself. What do you want to

accomplish? What’s important to you? You might ﬁnd that you’re mostly

satisﬁed with your job and professional life; or you might decide it’s

time to explore new opportunities or make changes. “There are so

many things you don’t have control over, but you do have control over

deﬁning success for yourself and how you position yourself to achieve

it,” she says. “This might be the push you need to do that.”

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Give yourself permission to feel overwhelmed and unsure amid the

# chaos.

- Seek support from family members, friends, and others in your trusted

# personal network.

- Seize the opportunity for introspection — it might reinforce that

you’re satisﬁed in your job or it might prompt you to consider new

# opportunities.

# Don’t:

- Linger in defeatism. Instead, shift your perspective to view the chaos

as an avenue for growth, rather than an obstacle to overcome.

- Vent too much to colleagues. Be cautious about what you share with

them, as your comments might be misinterpreted or shared without

# your knowledge.

- Lose sight of the bigger picture. Constant upheaval and a lack of

direction at your organization might signal underlying issues.
