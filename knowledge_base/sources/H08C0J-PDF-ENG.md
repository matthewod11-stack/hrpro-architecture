Companies are preparing for climate change. They are building

seawalls around coastal facilities, relocating warehouses from ﬂood

zones, and building additional slack into supply chains to make them

more resilient to climate shocks. But many companies overlook one

## area: the threat from climate change to employee health.

Organizations’ most valuable assets — their people — face mounting

climate-related risks to their physical and mental health from wildﬁres,

extreme heat, hurricanes, ﬂooding, emerging diseases, and more. One

estimate suggests that four in 10 nonelderly workers are in occupations

at increased risk for climate-related health impacts. The climate crisis

has already taken employee lives in extreme heat waves and reduced

## workforce engagement during wildﬁres due to poor air quality and

even eco-anxiety, a condition marked by fear and hopelessness in the

face of environmental doom. As the eﬀects of climate change take

hold, multilayered risks lie ahead — for instance, multiple studies

have shown that worker attention and general cognitive performance

declines dramatically after even short-term exposure to wildﬁre smoke

# or extreme heat.

The impact of climate change on employee health will be enormous;

one estimate found that the direct health costs alone of climate change

already far exceed $800 billion per year in the U.S. The threat will

## also impact corporate ﬁnances, from higher healthcare-coverage costs

borne by employers, including from asthma, mental health, and chronic

conditions; performance and engagement costs given climate-driven

## health declines, lower employee engagement, and reduced productivity;

injury and disability costs; and reduced labor availability. Climate

events such as extreme heat already cost an estimated 2.5 billion hours

of labor in the U.S. and 490 billion hours globally on an annual basis.

I’m one of the few researchers studying this aspect of climate change

from a business lens and identifying organizational best practices.

Drawing from both the public and private sectors, I have gleaned ﬁve

key preventative steps that can help organizations prepare for the

# challenges ahead.

# Do a Climate Change and Health Audit

Companies need to understand where their workforce is most

vulnerable. Ways to approach a climate change and health audit can

## HBR / Digital Article / The Hidden Costs of Climate Change on the Workforce

vary depending on your company and sector. Broadly, it might involve

# several steps:

Mapping out risks and specifying how far-reaching they are.

This mapping should consider risks to both your physical assets and the

health and safety of employees, as these often overlap. For example, if

a company’s property and equipment are at risk in a certain geographic

area due to rising sea levels or hurricanes, it’s likely that employees

face threats to their health, safety, and housing in that area, too. (This

strategy also works when it’s time to turn to tactics: For instance, a

## company with robust emergency response plans for equipment failures

could adapt these same plans to focus on employee evacuation and

## communication during extreme-weather events.)

Also, larger, more dispersed companies will need to break down risks

based on several additional factors. These include geographic diversity

(i.e., local versus national versus international risks), industry (e.g.,

## higher-vulnerability industries such as mining and construction versus

lower-vulnerability industries such as retail banking and accounting),

## and historical local-exposure levels (e.g., “hot spot” regions along

# shorelines or wildﬁre-prone regions).

Deciding which tools to use to track risks over time.

Companies — particularly larger ones — are already using tools such

as climate-risk analytics, which have been developed by insurers,

consultancies, and investors to assess potential losses, and heat

mapping to help identify climate risks to physical assets over time.

These can be expanded to include employee data. Companies can track

## factors such as employee attitudes, well-being, commitment levels, and

## overall health and safety statistics from pulse surveys, well-being check-

## in scores, higher-tech sentiment analysis, and health and beneﬁts data.

Citigroup oﬀers a good example of this approach. They use heat maps

to understand how climate change aﬀects both their portfolios and their

employees, including workers’ productivity and ability to get to work

safely, and Citigroup has built a model that will help them predict how

## future and more-severe heat waves, ﬂoods, and other climate events

will aﬀect their business and workforce so that they can better prepare.

Beyond Citi’s own facilities, this same heat map framework is applied

to corporate and public sector portfolios with the potential to yield

## beneﬁts on both internal (employee) and external (portfolio) fronts.

For small and medium-sized businesses, developing similar solutions

in-house may pose a challenge. Tapping into consultancies with

expertise in these areas, as well as procuring well-designed third-party

solutions that ﬁt your company’s unique needs, can help ﬁll this gap.

Identifying areas where risks may be more subtle.

When performing these audits, it’s important to remember that climate

change will have subtle consequences that don’t immediately show

up on a balance sheet. For instance, it can undermine important

## nonﬁnancial corporate initiatives, such as diversity, equity, and

inclusion (DEI). Many disadvantaged communities bear the brunt

of climate-induced workforce risks, and climate change can worsen

existing disparities related to poor living conditions, racism, and

# psychological stress.

# Develop and Deploy Early-Warning Systems

The importance of timely information cannot be overstated when it

comes to climate change and employee health. Preventing an issue is far

more eﬀective than treating its consequences. For example, an email,

text, or app notice in advance of poor air quality can protect those with

chronic conditions such as asthma. Just as companies have systems to

warn of immediate security threats, similar early-warning systems are

needed for the growing public-health risks linked to climate change.

Google has such a system in place. In 2020, the company’s CEO, Sundar

Pichai, advised employees about an opt-in program that would track

staﬀers’ locations through an emergency notiﬁcation system run by its

security team, known as the Global Security and Resilience Services

(GSRS). The system tracks and reaches out to employees in areas

aﬀected by diﬀerent health, climate, and security risks to oﬀer guidance

and support, and the GSRS team organizes tips for employees on

preparing for poor air quality, evacuations, and power outages. During

widespread wildﬁres in 2023, for example, Google advised employees on

personal safety measures, including work-from-home advisories to limit

exposure to outdoor air.

## For companies with a complex global footprint, this type of response

may be especially challenging with multiple simultaneous climate

health risks, such as overlapping extreme heat and wildﬁres during the

summer, or if companies have locations in both hemispheres, wildﬁre

season in Australia at the same time as ﬂooding season in Europe, for

example. To address this, organizations should consider repurposing

their pandemic command center and cross-function teaming to address

a new frontier of health-risk response. Companies can tap into security,

HR, communications, and other teams to lead the charge on early-

warning systems — as long as there is a clear owner responsible for both

monitoring these systems and deploying solutions.

Companies will, however, need to be vigilant about data privacy. This is

especially true where geolocation and health data is concerned, given

the potential for data privacy issues over time. Firms should approach

## the ethical collection and use of data in early-warning systems with the

same rigor required for any other employee-monitoring program. Key

## principles like transparency, voluntary opt-in where appropriate, data

minimization, and robust security protocols are essential to build trust

and ensure the responsible use of employee information.

## Learn from — and Partner with — the Public Sector

While a few private-sector organizations are ahead in identifying and

reducing climate risks for employee health, leading organizations

generally come from the public sector. There are strong opportunities

for the private sector to leverage these insights. This could include

adapting public sector frameworks; learning from tested and well-

researched public-sector data, pilots, and case studies; and partnering

to leverage tailored expertise and advice.

Adapting frameworks.

Several of the resources that the public sector has developed to help

communities prepare for climate risks can be adapted by employers.

## For instance, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention

## (CDC) created a framework, Building Resilience Against Climate

Eﬀects (BRACE), that guides public health departments in forecasting

climate impacts, projecting related health outcomes, and implementing

interventions to protect vulnerable populations. While the tool kit targets health oﬃcials, it can easily form the basis of a corporate

program. This wouldn’t be the ﬁrst time that private ﬁrms have adapted

public sector programs; during Covid-19 many organizations used

## public health tools as part of their health, safety, and wellness strategies.

Learning from data, pilots, and case studies.

Before you adopt an employee health strategy, you will want to collect

and assess information about how it will help employees while also

being ﬁscally responsible. Plus, you may need this type of data to

convince company stakeholders that investing in employee health as

it relates to climate risk is a good return on investment.

To be sure, there is some data from the private sector that can

help make your case. For example, research on the ﬁnancial beneﬁts

of employer occupational health and safety expenditures shows an

## average return of 1.24x to 2.14x for manufacturing, transportation, and

construction sectors — which also happen to be some of the largest

at-risk industries for climate and health-risk exposure. This is true even

without accounting for broader factors such as reputational and brand

# risk.

But many of the pilot programs that have demonstrated long-term,

sustainable ROI related to climate change and health are from the

public sector, and they showcase important learnings for corporate

players. Financial beneﬁts can be seen, for example, in the Texas Heat

Stress Awareness Program, which reduced the odds of heat-related

illnesses in municipal workers by 91% and decreased the severity

of heat-related illnesses, cutting the median cost for related worker-

compensation claims in half. And Colorado public-sector-employer data

showed that the expanded adoption of sun-protection actions in 98 local

government organizations rang in at a “reasonable per-employee cost”

to address ultraviolet radiation, comparable to other standard worksite

health interventions. These actions included management training

around sun-safety practices, a tool kit for writing worksite policies and

conducting audits, and materials to distribute to employees, including

## educational tip cards and sunscreen discount coupons.

Creating partnerships.

When it comes to protecting the health of their employees from the

risks posed by climate change, companies don’t have to go it alone.

Teaming up with experts from hospitals or public health organizations

can provide the specialized knowledge and guidance needed to develop

eﬀective, long-term strategies. These collaborations help companies

tackle the nitty-gritty details of their plans, from ﬁguring out the

most-eﬀective approaches and estimating costs over multiple years, to

assessing what’s realistic and how to make the programs stick. Plus,

they send a powerful message to workers and the wider community that

a company is prioritizing people’s well-being and taking meaningful

action to address the challenges ahead.

For instance, in 2023, UPS faced signiﬁcant challenges related

to extreme heat, with over 100 workers treated for heat-related

illnesses and a tragic employee death. On the back of strong

employee advocacy and union negotiations, UPS engaged a network

of public sector experts, including top heat-safety specialists, to

develop a comprehensive heat-management program called Recharge.

## Collaborating with the Korey Stringer Institute (KSI) at the University

## of Connecticut, the Gatorade Sports Science Institute, and MISSION, a

company specializing in cooling fabrics, UPS equipped delivery drivers

with cooling gear and installed fans in package cars and facilities.

They also increased access to hydration resources like ice, water,

and electrolyte beverages for workers. This expert-driven approach

showcased UPS’s commitment to employee safety amid the challenges

posed by climate change.

Similarly, Delta Air Lines recently faced scrutiny over passenger heat-

related illness, making heat-health action planning important for both

workers and customers. In response, the airline is developing a written

## heat policy and heat-stress-management program with support from

KSI at the University of Connecticut, which will consist of “heat safety

## practices and heat safety education, as well as an action plan for

## exertional heat stroke and other medical emergencies.”

# Don’t Overlook Mental Health

Leaders need to tackle workforce psychological stress, including climate

## anxiety, as a major pillar of corporate climate response. More than

two-thirds of Americans experience some climate or eco-anxiety — and

younger workers are at higher risk. A recent survey of 16-to-25-year-olds

found that a staggering 45% report interruption to their daily lives due

# to worries about climate.

The American Psychological Association reports that weather events

associated with climate change, such as ﬂooding and droughts, have

been increasingly associated with cases of depression, anxiety, and

post-traumatic stress disorders. Risks can range from mild stress and

insomnia to high-risk coping behavior such as increased alcohol use,

with long-term and often large-scale eﬀects impacting overall well-

being.

What’s striking is how mental health impacts of climate change can be

felt across an entire workforce, even if only a subset of employees are

physically impacted by speciﬁc climate events at a moment in time.

For example, while California wildﬁres directly aﬀect local employees’

homes and communities, colleagues in other regions may experience

heightened anxiety, stress, and concern for their coworkers’ well-being

while they also grapple with the broader implications of the climate

crisis. Consequences can range from climate anxiety accompanied by

feelings of guilt, anger, and shame (which can lead to changes in mood

and behavior) to “solastalgia,” which describes the emotional distress,

sense of powerlessness, and lack of control felt due to environmental

# change.

The impact of employee mental health struggles on businesses is signiﬁcant, manifesting in decreased productivity, reduced eﬃciency,

and increased health-related costs. As such, companies must approach

## the topic of climate-driven mental health challenges with care and

comprehensiveness. My experience working across various industries,

from retail banking to telecommunications, has revealed a spectrum of

employer strategies to address climate or eco-anxiety. These strategies

include integrating eco-anxiety and grief into the overall company

mental health framework, as well as developing targeted initiatives to

tackle and engage employees on eco-anxiety speciﬁcally.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Hidden Costs of Climate Change on the Workforce

## Oﬀ-the-shelf public-sector playbooks with a focus on mental health

are particularly helpful in providing existing road maps that can be

tailored to an individual company’s needs. For example, the Canadian

## Centre for Occupational Health and Safety oﬀers Climate Change:

Workplace Impact, a report outlining and addressing the psychological

eﬀects of climate change, including direct, indirect, and social impacts.

Other employers are introducing focused coping behaviors as outlined

by the World Economic Forum for employees and their dependents,

with various types including problem-focused coping (making active

strides to address climate change), emotion-focused coping (managing

negative emotions related to climate change), and meaning-focused

coping (managing negative emotions while in parallel promoting

positive emotions, such as hope, by combating climate change).

## Lead by Being Transparent About the Climate Risk

Leaders need to openly communicate the potential health and well-

being impacts of climate change to their employees. This can be both

## broad in nature (for example, conversations across the entire workforce

around extreme weather or climate anxiety), and speciﬁc to the

unique health risks of a given workforce (for example, employees and oﬃces located near ﬂooding areas or groups of outdoor workers more

## susceptible to day-to-day climate extremes). Communication should

be empathetic, acknowledging that climate change can exacerbate

existing health disparities. Leaders should express a commitment

to ﬁnding solutions while also avoiding messages that inadvertently

highlight socioeconomic diﬀerences. For instance, one executive who

spoke at a town hall about smoke pollution described a high-ﬁltration HVAC system he had added to his home oﬃce, despite the fact that

## many in the audience likely couldn’t aﬀord such an expensive home

# improvement.

Instead, executives should start by focusing on how the company is

taking action to protect all employees. When Pichai, Google’s CEO,

engaged and advised employees as wildﬁres blazed across California,

his communication emphasized action-driven eﬀorts to enhance safety

and well-being via the GSRS I described earlier in this article, and he

made it personal and relatable by sharing anecdotes: “Like many Bay

Area Googlers, the ﬁrst thing I noticed when I stepped outside today was

the smell of smoke from nearby ﬁres.” He also oﬀered compassionate

acknowledgment, saying, “Fires burning across California and Colorado

have already prompted thousands to evacuate their homes and our

hearts go out to the many Googlers aﬀected.” This real-time, authentic

style of communication is crucial for building a trusted platform for

# subsequent action and engagement.

To be sure, employee education on climate and health risks will need

to involve more than just senior leadership. HR will play a major

role, driving engagement through multiple channels such as written

materials, live webinars, and events. For example, one company I

worked with held a “Connecting Health, Environment, and Well-Being”

series. What’s more, climate health and safety should be integrated into

onboarding processes to ensure all employees are informed from the

start. This could include education and access to tools around climate

change and health as early as an employee’s ﬁrst week on the job, just as

companies embed health and wellness into onboarding processes with

webinars and connections to beneﬁts portals and security apps.

Leaders should also be transparent when communicating with external

stakeholders about what companies are doing to protect employee

health. A logical venue for this communication is either a company’s

sustainability report or even their 10-K shareholder letter. However,

companies don’t currently do this in a standard way; when my Global

Corporate Advisory team at Cleveland Clinic looked at the sustainability

## HBR / Digital Article / The Hidden Costs of Climate Change on the Workforce

reports from the top 100 U.S. companies, we found vast inconsistencies

in how health and safety is reported — especially when it comes

to mitigating the health risks of climate change. For example, few

companies report quantitative data and many lack year-over-year

## comparative information. This lack of standard reporting prevents

the investors and the broader public from evaluating individual

companies and comparing them apples to apples as much as possible

— and it prevents the businesses themselves from seeing what other

organizations are doing to develop and spread best practices.

However, one company, global manufacturer Magna, exempliﬁes how

to comprehensively report on climate and workforce health risks in

a digestible manner. Their sustainability report dedicates a section

to climate change, health, and operational considerations, assessing

a wide range of climate-related exposures and mapping their global

footprint against identiﬁed risk zones. The report also outlines their

proactive approach to prioritizing employee safety and well-being

during climate events, including health audits and a global risk-

# mitigation program.

By adopting similar elements around sustainability reporting that

integrate climate change and employee health, companies can attract

new customers and investors who prioritize employee well-being

and sustainability. This approach also enhances talent attraction and

retention, as evidenced by a Honeywell global study showing that six

in 10 employees would resign if their employers fail to create a healthy

# indoor environment.

Moreover, increased reporting requirements are coming, such as

## Europe’s Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD). Eﬀective

this year, with ﬁrst reports due in 2025, CSRD requires companies

to disclose extensive data on their sustainability practices, including

value-chain requirements that reﬂect employee health and well-being.

This provides additional impetus for any company (especially those

with a global footprint) to quickly get ahead of forthcoming regulation.

. . .

Tackling climate change and safeguarding employee health is a major

opportunity for today’s corporate leaders. These actions not only beneﬁt

individual employees but also ease the strain on public health systems

and contribute directly to a stronger corporate bottom line. This

“triple win” — for employees, the public sector, and businesses — is

# undeniable.

While the beneﬁts are clear, organizations still face challenges in

implementing comprehensive climate and health strategies. Balancing

near-term costs with long-term gains, determining where to focus

eﬀorts in the face of diverse risks, and ensuring cross-functional

coordination are all areas where companies may struggle. But bold

leaders are needed to recognize the opportunity for positive impact and

to champion solutions that ensure a healthy future for both employees
