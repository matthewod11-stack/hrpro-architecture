The AI train is barreling down the tracks, scaring us, exciting us, and

making a heck of a din. It can write poems, detect climate-changing

weather patterns, and quasi-translate whale songs. Pew has predicted

that nearly one in ﬁve U.S. workers is in a job highly likely to be

transformed by AI. It is a game-changer.

But AI is not the most powerful force in business — not by a long shot.

When it comes to speedily generating patterns, AI is unparalleled. When

it comes to driving the behaviors of customers and employees, AI is

barren. And always will be.

I’ve spent my career studying excellence, beginning, back in 1990, with

a Gallup study of the very best housekeepers in Walt Disney World. I’ve

looked to uncover what the world’s best managers, leaders, teachers,

and salespeople have in common, and I’ve researched what drives

## the most engaged teams and the most loyal customers. Throughout

thousands of these qualitative focus groups and interviews, there’s been

one force that most powerfully drives customer and employee behavior.

This force is love.

We shy away from this word, relying instead on more corporately

palatable phrases, such as “employee engagement” or “customer

loyalty.” We feel quite comfortable talking about a “caring culture” or

“passionate service” or “customer satisfaction.” But we steer clear of

# love.

Today, with much of the corporate world besotted and distracted by the

promise of AI, is the right time to examine love, that most human of all

# feelings.

## At some point in my conversations with hundreds of thousands of high

performers, they all talk about speciﬁc moments or activities in their

work that they love. They don’t say “like” or “enjoy.” They say “love.”

And when they say “love,” it means they want to keep coming back to

this activity and seek out opportunities to do more of it. When they’re

doing this activity they love, they work more ﬂuidly and feel less stress.

My research has shown that workers who ﬁnd the love in what they do

are much more likely to stay in their job and to advocate their company

# as a great place.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Business Case for Love

The same applies to customers. I know a ﬁlm studio executive who says

that when he’s screen-testing his latest movie, what he’s listening for

isn’t “I really enjoyed that” or “I thought it was great.” He pays attention

only to how many times he hears someone spontaneously say, “I loved

it!” Because only then can he be sure that this person will tell others

to go see the movie — and even go back themselves to see it multiple

# times.

This is true for all customers of all products. It’s only when you’ve

managed to do something so compelling, so profound, so genuine, so

moving that the customer says, “I loved this experience!” that you’re

able to predict their subsequent behavior. In direct contrast, “liking” or

“really enjoying” or being “satisﬁed” tells us virtually nothing about a

person’s future behavior.

Love by the Numbers

We can see this quantitatively, in the data. Ask customers or employees

or moviegoers to rate some aspect of their experience on a scale of 1–5,

with 5 being extremely positive. The conventional wisdom is that these

feelings drive people’s behaviors, such as loyalty, advocacy, and spend

## for customers, or productivity, quality, and retention for employees.

Conventional wisdom also suggests that experiences rated as a 3 drive

slightly less of these desired behaviors than the 4’s, who, in turn, drive

slightly less than the 5’s. It’s this kind of thinking that leads us to

lump 4’s with 5’s into a “top-two box” rating, or a “percent favorable”

score, and then to focus our team on trying to move as many people as

possible into this category — in eﬀect, to move the 2’s to 3’s, and the 3’s

# into the 4/5 category.

Unfortunately, this thinking is not backed by the data. Moving 2’s to 3’s

and 3’s to 4’s drives very little in terms of desired customer or employee

behaviors — the line from 2’s to 3’s to 4’s might as well be ﬂat.

It’s only when employees or customers rate their experience as an

extreme positive — the 5’s — that we see a link between people’s

## feelings about an experience and their subsequent behaviors. In this

sense, 4’s are far more like 3’s than they are like 5’s.

Two implications follow from this data. First, no eﬀective leader should

ever “top-two box” employee or customer survey scores. This is lumping

apples with oranges, thereby obscuring the picture of what’s truly

happening with your employees or customers.

It also means that the 5’s — those people who rated their experience

extremely positively — are not just one step up from the 4’s. They are

something else entirely. When someone spontaneously uses the word

“love” to describe their experience, this isn’t just “lots and lots of liking,”

or “caring turned up to 11,” or “uber passion.” The feeling that causes

someone to say “I love that” is simply in a diﬀerent category altogether.

And so, leaders who want to drive productive behaviors in their

employees and customers must deeply examine this “love” category.

Only by taking “love” seriously as a separate and distinct experience will

leaders be able to deﬁne what happens to make people feel it. And once

they deﬁne it, they will be able to deliberately design it into every single

## aspect of the employee and customer experience.

# What Makes a Person Say, “I Loved That!”

Over the last quarter-century, I’ve conducted hundreds of thousands of

interviews and surveys on the 5’s. If you were to ask me today: What do

people truly mean when they report that they “love” something? I would

# oﬀer you this deﬁnition:

Love is the deep and unwavering commitment to the ﬂourishing of a

# human.

This is a profound feeling, yet you can ﬁnd it in people’s description

of even seemingly superﬁcial experiences. When you say, “I loved that

movie!” your use of the word “love” isn’t a careless exaggeration for

something you found entertaining. My interviews have shown you

choose the word “love” because something about the movie moved

you such that you felt bigger, more connected to others, more you,

more seen, even wiser. You loved it because it touched you. In some

recognizable way, the movie helped you ﬂourish.

When you say you “love” doing a certain activity, my research has found

you commit to this word because when you’re doing the activity, you

feel at one with yourself, at ease, in control, deeply absorbed in what

you’re doing. You are ﬂourishing.

When you say you love this teacher, or this doctor, or this team, or

this manager, it’s because, through explicit and implicit signals, you’ve

drawn the conclusion that they are deeply and unwaveringly committed

to helping you ﬂourish. They don’t see you as “head count.” They see

you. When you feel this, you feel love. And you call it as you feel it.

This deﬁnition reveals why AI solutions will always be unloving.

Regardless of how much data they crunch, or how large their large

language models are, we know that this algorithm doesn’t genuinely

want us to ﬂourish. It doesn’t even know what ﬂourishing is. It never

# can and never will.

# How to Design Love In

In the age of AI, the very best talent will want to work for organizations

that commit to being loving in all they do. This doesn’t mean these

organizations will be soft or lackadaisical — tough love is still love. It

means simply that the best talent will be acutely sensitive to whether the organization is doing things lovingly, rather than merely eﬃciently

# or cost-eﬀectively.

In the same way, the most discerning customers will become loyal to

only those companies that have intentionally designed love into every

# touchpoint.

To design love in, we can start by drawing a keen and clear distinction

between what “loving” and “unloving” looks like. Note: In the examples

below, I’m singling out speciﬁc touchpoints to help you distinguish

loving from unloving. My referring to these touchpoints does not

necessarily imply that the entire company is loving or unloving. A

loving company is built one touchpoint at a time.

The loving company tells its employees and customers what it stands

for and is not afraid to take action to reinforce its moral stance. Chick-

ﬁl-A refusing to open on Sundays is a clear signal of its values — it wants

its workers to be home with their families in their community for at

least one day a week for no good business reason other than they think

it’s the right thing to do.

Another example is In-n-Out Burger’s commitment to only serving the

freshest food to its customers. When I asked company executives a few

years back why they don’t serve breakfast, they told me that they knew

they couldn’t keep their ingredients fresh enough to meet their promise

to their customers. So, no breakfast. This commitment to freshness is

also why In-n-Out Burger’s drive-thru windows open up right into the

kitchen. Customers can see the shelves of fresh potatoes, tomatoes, and

lettuce, as compared to other fast-food restaurants that hide how the

“sausage” is made. The company has designed their customer oﬀerings

and experience in a loving way that shows its commitment to its values

and its customers’ ﬂourishing.

The unloving company, by contrast, is amoral and transactional, always

and only assessing how to maximize proﬁts or revenue. For example,

Delta’s recent changes to its frequent ﬂyer program are unloving.

Delta used to reward its most loyal customers with cheaper tickets

and upgrades. Under its new rules, a passenger’s standing with Delta

depends less on how often they ﬂy and more on how much they spend

on Delta’s credit card — it’s now a frequent spender program. This

change makes sense in a purely transactional world. But it confuses

who Delta is for its passengers, leaving them disoriented — which is an

unloving thing to do to those you serve. Perhaps sensing this, Delta’s

CEO recently announced plans to roll back some of these changes.

The loving company is thoughtful about its language. For example,

Home Depot calls its headquarters its “Store Support Center” to

reinforce its commitment to the locations where customers are served

every day. Capital One agents introduce themselves with their name,

their actual location, and a promise that “I’ll be your advisor today.” In

so doing, they not only personalize themselves to you, the customer, but

they also remind you of how they intend to serve you on the call.

Contrast this with those companies that refer to their employees by the

## transactional moniker “Full Time Equivalents” or FTEs.

The loving company designs its work around small teams, since humans

thrive only when they are paid attention to frequently by their team

# leader and team members.

The unloving company designs work around what makes sense on a

## balance sheet. Call centers with manager-to-direct report ratios of 1 to

70 are unloving. As are, sadly and ironically, hospitals. As the CHRO of a

large health care system shared with me, their nurse supervisor to nurse

ratio is also 1 to 70. With those ratios, it’s little wonder that we have such

a burnout crisis and a nursing shortage. It’s almost as if hospitals have

turned a blind eye to what their nurses need to feel nourished at work.

The loving company has a strong alumni program. After all, if to treat

your people lovingly is to have an unwavering commitment to their

ﬂourishing, it follows that this commitment persists even after the

person leaves. The unloving company sees each person as merely a

means to an end, and so, once an employee leaves, it’s as though they

never existed. Their names are rarely brought up in meetings, and their

contributions, whatever they may have been, are quickly subsumed

# beneath the broader company’s eﬀorts.

The loving company doesn’t use performance ratings, because they see

each employee as so much more than a number. Nor do they have a

high-potential program, because they believe every single worker has

room to learn and grow, and that, as such, opportunities and advantages

should not be reserved for the precious few with “potential.”

The loving company is super attentive to transitions. For example, a

recent loving move by a few forward-thinking hospitals is the creation

of the hospitalist role. This is a doctor assigned to you when you’re

admitted, and whose job is twofold: First to explain what every other

medical specialist is doing to you and for you and why, and second, to

explain your needs, fears, and routines to the specialists.

The unloving hospital is one where you’re handed oﬀ from one nurse

to another, to a doctor, to a diﬀerent doctor, to an administrator, and

are tasked with having to explain yourself anew to each one. In the

Love is the force that most powerfully drives customer and employee

behaviors — and strangely, businesses today don’t value it. They don’t

study it. They don’t even have a strategy for unleashing it. What a miss

## for the conventional majority — and what a massive opportunity for the

wise minority of business leaders who do.

Who doesn’t want to be recruited lovingly? Or checked into a hotel

lovingly? Or oﬀered ﬁnancial services lovingly? Who wouldn’t want a

loving meal out, a loving ﬂying experience as a passenger, an insurance

claim processed lovingly? We all would. And as the data show, we’d

behave so much more productively if we were given a more loving set

of experiences — employees show higher performance, customers show

more loyalty, and both become advocates for your brand.

The AI locomotive is almost guaranteed to shunt love from our lives.

AI can mimic at great scale, but it will never be committed to helping any one human ﬂourish. AI can, we hope, be deployed eﬃciently and

harmlessly. But since its stance toward us is amoral, it can never be

deployed lovingly.
