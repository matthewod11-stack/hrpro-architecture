The Power of Strategic Fit Aligning these seven factors creates greater value for a company and its stakeholders. by Darrell Rigby and Zach First

# Max Drekker

Near the end of a lengthy strategy session at a prominent S&P 500

company, a senior executive posed a simple yet profound question:

“Are we winning?” It sparked an intense discussion. On the one

hand, the company had been delivering impressive ﬁnancial results

for nearly two years, exceeding both internal plans and analysts’

expectations. As a result, most executives received healthy bonuses.

On the other hand, the company’s ﬁve-year stock price appreciation

was below the S&P 500 average, indicating that investors’ conﬁdence

in its future performance was below average. Employees were burned

out. Innovation was sluggish, and the release dates for next-generation

products kept slipping. Collaboration among operating units was

lacking. Some analysts valued the company at less than the sum of its

# parts.

The senior leaders resolved to increase the company’s value by breaking

down organizational silos and increasing teamwork to get everyone

working toward mutually beneﬁcial goals. As we write this article,

they are endeavoring to do that. In the process, they are addressing

fundamental questions that were swept under the rug for years: What

does winning mean to us? Are we using the right scorecard to measure

and manage progress? Which strategic factors are constraining our

# success?

In this article we will explain why maximizing company value for the

beneﬁt of all stakeholders is the right objective. We will identify seven

strategic factors and describe how to align them to unleash a company’s

collective strengths. Drawing on the inspiring example of Self Esteem

Brands, a ﬁtness, health, and wellness company, we will show how to

build an extraordinary organization that creates extraordinary value.

# The Current State of Strategy

Facing heavy pressure to improve the worth of their company, many

managers have turned to what we call “spreadsheet strategies.” They set

ﬁnancial goals suﬃcient to meet analysts’ expectations and then ﬁll in

row by row, column after column, tweaking the numbers to ﬁnd a plan

that appears plausible and then backing into ways to achieve it. That

approach has four ﬂaws.

First, it grants excessive credence to archaic accounting rules as the

best way to measure the value of modern companies. Accounting

rules designed for the industrial age are less relevant in an era of

digital technologies and powerful intangibles. Consider the valuation

of assets. An asset is any resource (tangible or intangible) controlled by

a company that can produce future economic value—though it might

take decades to ﬂow into income statements. Ocean Tomo, a provider

## of advisory services on assets, calculates that in 1975 tangible assets

—such as land, buildings, and machinery—accounted for 83% of the

market value of the S&P 500. By 2020 that ﬁgure had plummeted to

just 10%. The remaining 90% consisted of intangible assets such as

patents, trade secrets, and brand equity. Annie Brown, the valuation

director at Brand Finance, a brand advisory consultancy, told us that

today only 24% of those intangibles are disclosed on S&P 500 balance

sheets. In other words, nearly 70% of all assets driving the market

valuations of major companies are invisible on ﬁnancial statements and

spreadsheets. Nevertheless, those assets are the reason that the stock

price of Amazon (founded in 1994) soared even though the company

didn’t realize a quarterly proﬁt until 2001 or positive annual free cash

# ﬂow until 2002.

Facing heavy pressure to improve the worth of their company, many managers have turned to what we call “spreadsheet strategies.” That approach is flawed.

Second, spreadsheet strategies typically extrapolate positive linear

relationships ad inﬁnitum. For instance, if a $10 million reduction in

R&D spending correlated with improved proﬁts last year, then this

approach suggests that a $20 million cut would double the ﬁnancial

beneﬁts in the following year. If market share increased for eight

years but recently declined for two, spreadsheet regression functions

might persuasively predict that market share should soon return to

its upward-sloping trend line. Simplistic extrapolations overlook the

realities of diminishing returns and the complexities of competitive

# system dynamics.

Third, these strategies assume that practices are interchangeable. When

leaders allocate spreadsheet targets to individual operating units—

along with powerful incentives to achieve them—the heads of the

operating units often look to the “best practices” of other companies

with better ﬁnancial results. But strong ﬁnancial performers sometimes

succeed despite certain practices rather than because of them, and

transplanting practices from one complex system to another rarely

yields the same results. Various parts of a company may adopt diverse

management practices that serve their own purposes even when they

are misaligned with practices in other parts of the company.

Fourth, spreadsheet strategies divorce corporate strategy from unit

operations. Division leaders, tasked with achieving daunting ﬁnancial

targets, come to view corporate strategy sessions as irrelevant to their

personal responsibilities. They spend most of that meeting time on their

devices, communicating with their units instead of collaborating with

their peers. Eventually this disunity causes a company to operate like

a collection of loosely aﬃliated businesses—and its shares to trade at

conglomerate discounts. That leads to communication breakdowns, lost

synergies, and increased overhead costs associated with the additional

supervision and conﬂict resolution required to compensate for the lack

# of strategic ﬁt.

# What Is Strategic Fit?

Strategic ﬁt is the degree of alignment and amount of synergy in

a company’s business system. When a ﬁrm’s strategic ﬁt is optimal, it creates beneﬁcial multiplier eﬀects among all the components

of the business. One component, for example, is employees. When

employees are aligned with other components—such as the company’s

purpose—their engagement increases. Engaged employees develop

more-innovative products, the kind that create enthusiastic and loyal

customers. Enthusiastic customers attract other customers, improve

ﬁnancial results, and make employees’ jobs more fulﬁlling. Enhanced

ﬁnancial performance can generate the money needed to provide better employee beneﬁts, to invest in creating appealing customer oﬀerings,

and to contribute more to the community. Strategic ﬁt produces a

system that is nearly impossible for competitors to replicate—provided the company adapts eﬀectively to changing conditions.

This concept is sorely underutilized but

not completely new. In the mid-1800s

Charles Darwin popularized the phrase

## “survival of the ﬁttest,” explaining that

# groups with traits most advantageous to

their environment are most likely to

## survive, and that cohesive, collaborative

teams outperform selﬁsh, contentious

## groups. In the 1960s Alfred D. Chandler Jr.

showed how market changes and new

technologies necessitate strategy changes,

which drive organizational changes—leading to his “structure follows

## strategy” principle. In his 1996 HBR article “What Is Strategy?” Michael

Porter advanced the concept of strategic ﬁt, emphasizing that the

system of activities is more critical than individual parts, and warning

against attributing success to individual competencies alone. Roger L.

Martin and A.G. Laﬂey’s “strategy choice cascade” broke strategy

formulation into ﬁve key choices, with each reinforcing the others.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Power of Strategic Fit

Unfortunately, strategic ﬁt has been more easily described by academics

than done by executives. Even leaders who appreciate the value of

strategic ﬁt struggle to understand how to achieve and sustain it. Which

components must align? Is the process a cascading sequence of strategic

choices? How often should our strategic ﬁt be reviewed?

In previous books and articles, we have oﬀered executives methods to

improve components of their strategy. We have described, for example,

ways to develop a clear and compelling corporate purpose (see “What Successful Purpose Statements Do Diﬀerently,” HBR.org, March 1,

2024); how to create an operating model that increases organizational

## agility (see Doing Agile Right: Transformation Without Chaos, Harvard

Business Review Press, 2020); and how to increase value creation for

the beneﬁt of all stakeholders, including how individual companies can

model and measure it (see “How to Create a Stakeholder Strategy,” HBR,

May–June 2023). In this article we will explain how executives can tie

these and other essential components of a successful strategy together,

creating a synergistic system that continually increases company value

by improving strategic ﬁt.

# How to Create and Sustain Strategic Fit

Throughout the article, we’ll use the example of Self Esteem Brands

(SEB) to illustrate how strategic ﬁt works. (SEB has never been a client

of our ﬁrm. At the time of writing, it was in the process of changing

its name to Purpose Brands, following its merger with Orangetheory

Fitness.) We were introduced to SEB’s CEO a few months ago—after a

mutual friend, a longtime investor in the company, read several of our

articles and recognized SEB’s approach to strategy. The introduction led

to multiple interviews with Chuck Runyon, SEB’s CEO and cofounder,

followed by a deep analysis of the company’s business system.

In roughly two decades it has grown from a single ﬁtness center to

## the world’s largest portfolio of purpose-driven health and personal care

franchise brands. Today that portfolio includes Anytime Fitness and

Orangetheory Fitness (health and ﬁtness clubs), Waxing the City (high-

## quality hair-removal services), The Bar Method (barre-based workout

studios), Basecamp Fitness (high-intensity interval training studios),

## Stronger U Nutrition (online nutrition coaching), Provision Security

Solutions (security systems to protect property and safety—especially in

## franchisee facilities), and Healthy Contributions (a provider of wellness

programs). Along the way it has garnered numerous awards and

accolades. In 2013 Forbes named its original business, Anytime Fitness,

one of “America’s most promising companies.” Entrepreneur named it

the world’s number one franchise—ahead of ﬁtness competitors such

## as Gold’s Gym and icons such as McDonald’s and 7-Eleven—in both

2014 and 2015. In 2016 Club Business International ranked it as the

## fastest-growing ﬁtness club in the world for the eighth consecutive year.

The process of achieving strategic ﬁt begins by identifying seven

essential elements of strategy. Because they must remain aligned

under ever-changing and unpredictable conditions to deliver superior

performance, they should be developed concurrently and iteratively.

- 1. The mental model. Success hinges on understanding how a business

really works and how it can capitalize on changing market conditions. Eﬀective leaders develop mental models that approximate complex

realities yet are simple enough to guide daily decisions. As the

statistician George Box famously noted, “All models are wrong, but

some are useful.”

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Power of Strategic Fit

Unfortunately, strategic fit has been more easily described by academics than done by executives. Leaders have struggled to understand how to achieve and sustain it.

Runyon’s mental model begins with the following assumptions: The

company creates value by improving people’s lives; people are subject

to a complex range of human emotions; and his job is to unlock

people’s full potential. He believes that SEB must be an extraordinary

company to deliver extraordinary long-term value. He further maintains

that to do so requires SEB to align and balance four complementary

components: people, purpose, proﬁts, and play. Runyon told us that

these four Ps have become the strategic lens through which the

company views every aspect of its business and against which it

measures every decision. They help people navigate obscure and

shifting conditions, as if they were wearing night vision goggles while

competitors stumble in the dark. Virtually everyone in the company can

recite the four Ps, and the types of stakeholders that SEB ﬁnds most

attractive choose to aﬃliate with the company because they share its

values. The four Ps are not a marketing slogan for Self Esteem Brands.

They are a powerful tool for reaching diﬃcult decisions.

- 2. Purpose and ambitions. A company’s purpose and ambitions are

intertwined. Purpose is the reason the company exists and what it aims

to achieve for others, whereas ambitions are what the company hopes

to accomplish for itself, including ﬁnancial and operational goals. To

understand the true essence of a company’s purpose and ambitions, you

must look at its actions, not merely its words.

The purpose of Self Esteem Brands is to improve the self-esteem of

people all over the world. This perfectly ﬁts Runyon’s mental model of

creating value by improving people’s lives. It is an unusually bold and

broad purpose. To reinforce it throughout SEB, Runyon says, he and

his business partner, Dave Mortensen, talk frequently about feelings,

empathy, and emotions. And they collect data and stories about how the

company has helped people achieve greater personal fulﬁllment—not

## just physically but also mentally and emotionally.

Achieving such a bold purpose requires equally bold ambitions for the

company’s operating scale and ﬁnancial strength. In 2023, when SEB

had about 5,500 operating locations, Mortensen announced a goal of

10,000 units within ﬁve years. He estimated that the company had

made an impact on the lives of about 20 million people so far and aimed

to reach 100 million. Runyon recognizes that ﬁnancial performance is

a critical component of SEB’s growth strategy. He describes proﬁtable

operations as the gravitational force that pulls attractive customers,

the right investors, and high-potential employees into the company’s

business system and enables investments to strengthen the company

while creating superior value for all SEB stakeholders.

- 3. Stakeholder value creation. Stakeholders—the groups that aﬀect and are aﬀected by the activities of a business—include customers, employees, suppliers, communities, and investors. Each plays a

vital role: Customers generate sales and proﬁts; employees create

products and services; suppliers provide essential tools and materials; communities oﬀer the environment and permission to operate; and

investors supply the ﬁnancial resources needed to fund growth.

The goal of stakeholder value creation is to continually increase

the value that all stakeholders receive from and contribute to the

business. Leaders who subscribe to this goal work hard to convince

stakeholders that collaborating for their mutual beneﬁt is in their

personal best interest. Companies that excel at creating stakeholder

value attract and retain the most valuable stakeholders, gaining a

competitive advantage. Conversely, companies that fail to do so risk

losing key stakeholders to competitors, leading to inferior resources and

competitive disadvantages. Historically, many people have assumed

that striving to create value for all stakeholders comes at the expense

of shareholders. Bain’s analysis proves that this assumption is wrong.

truly beneﬁting stakeholders. Eﬀective stakeholder-value creation

aligns with the needs and values of targeted stakeholders. It ensures

that every action taken by the company enhances mutual beneﬁts and

# supports strategic goals.

SEB works hard to enrich the lives of all those who interact with its

businesses. That includes consumers, vendors, employees, investors,

franchisees, and the residents of communities where it operates. It

seeks the sweet spot Runyon calls “collective interest”—where the

organization’s self-interest intersects with stakeholders’ individual self-

# interests.

Let’s examine SEB’s strategic ﬁt between consumers and investors—

two stakeholder groups that some companies treat as rivals competing

for scarce resources. For SEB, an important measure of success is the

success of its members. According to nearly 1.5 million total body scans

in 2023, its customers collectively lost 1.57 million pounds of fat and

added about 872,000 pounds of muscle. The personal stories behind

such statistics are even more impressive. Runyon and Mortensen’s 2017

book Love Work describes a 69-year-old grandmother who recovered

from serious health issues and then set the Guinness World Record for

planking, an exercise in which a prone person balances on her toes and forearms while holding the rest of her body straight and oﬀ the

ground. It shares the story of a suicidal woman who lost 100 pounds and

regained her self-esteem, and of a gym owner who donated a kidney to a

member. Then there’s the story of a man who lost his legs and ﬁngertips

to ﬂesh-eating bacteria and was turned away by six competitor gyms.

Anytime Fitness trainers prepared him to participate in an endurance

race and carried him over the ﬁnish line.

It’s important to distinguish stakeholder value creation from mere do-goodism— charitable activities that drain company resources without truly benefiting stakeholders.

Purpose-minded customers grow more loyal when the company shows

commitment to its purpose—especially when that commitment is

expensive or diﬃcult. And it is far easier to do expensive or diﬃcult things that pay oﬀ only in the long term when investors are equally

# purpose-minded.

That’s why, in 2013, when Runyon and Mortensen needed to raise

capital for growth, they developed an unusual process. They wrote

an eight-page “investor manifesto” describing their mental models for

business, stakeholders, leadership, and life. They required potential

investors to read it and then write their own manifestos. This process

brought like-minded investors into the stakeholder system, turning

the ultimate commodity—money—into an ingredient in the company’s

One of the greatest challenges to maintaining this kind of strategic ﬁt is

and adapt their strategy to capitalize on emerging opportunities rather

## than struggle against unfavorable trends.

When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, in early 2020, everything changed

for ﬁtness centers. Many went out of business. Runyon and his team

recognized that they were responsible for a global network of small-

business owners (franchisees) who lacked the balance sheets or the

liquidity to survive such a crisis. So they sprang into action, helping

franchisees close down responsibly, negotiating with landlords and

banks to reduce or delay payments, forgoing all royalty payments

to SEB, and adapting to provide remote services. They created an

innovation department that built a reservation system to limit the

number of people working out at one time and developed virtual

coaching programs.

As the crisis faded, SEB helped franchisees reopen responsibly and

abide by the regulatory rules of their respective countries. Then,

## with the advantage of grateful franchisees, loyal customers, a strong

innovation department, and weakened competitors, SEB was better

positioned than ever to grow and gain market share.

Now it is facing another macro force: New GLP-1 receptor agonist drugs

such as Ozempic and Mounjaro are making weight loss and diabetes treatments easier and more eﬀective. As a result, diet companies and

some ﬁtness centers are facing declining demand for their traditional

products and services. Runyon is framing this development as an

opportunity, not just a threat. He believes that as people feel healthier

and more conﬁdent, they will be more inclined to join a gym or a

ﬁtness center that treats them right. And recognizing that as people lose

weight, they also lose muscle mass, SEB is developing special workouts,

virtual coaching, and customized nutrition programs for people taking

various GLP-1 medications. For instance, it is increasing cooperation

## between its Anytime Fitness gyms and its Stronger U Nutrition business

to help people develop strength.

Potential synergies among purpose, stakeholders, and macro forces are

causing SEB’s leaders to reexamine which markets and products will be

most valuable to the company’s future success.

- 5. Markets and products. Because complex systems are always

changing, companies must constantly consider where they will do

business—and where they will not. They spend signiﬁcant time and

money searching for the best markets for their products. But the

real challenge is determining what “best” means, since markets and

products that are blockbusters for one company may be ﬂops for

# another.

Bain & Company recently analyzed total shareholder returns for 4,228

## companies across eight industries from February 2019 to February

- 2024. The study found that the highest average returns (19%) were

## in technology. However, the top 10% of companies in every industry

outperformed the average returns of tech ﬁrms. In other words, entering

an attractive industry does not guarantee superior performance, and

a strategically ﬁt company can excel in even the toughest industries—

such as ﬁtness. In pursuit of its purpose to improve the self-esteem

of people all over the world, SEB has expanded in multiple directions—

adding product lines and geographic markets through internal growth

In an interview published in 2023 in Health Club Management

magazine, Mortensen was asked how SEB decides what market

expansions to explore and which companies to acquire. His response

focused immediately on leadership’s mental model: “Any brand we

acquire has to align with the four pillars—the four Ps—of our high-

performing culture….It must have a purpose that aligns with ours—

## something bigger than the individuals in the business and something its

team believes in. It can’t just be about ﬁnancials….They [the managers]

also need to convince us of the purpose in what they do, and how

this aligns with our mission to improve the self-esteem of the world.”

Mortensen further explained that the business must have the right

people to drive it, a shared focus on proﬁts and performance metrics,

and a sense of playfulness that makes working together fun.

SEB sees clearly that choices about markets and products must align

## with the company’s mental model and purpose as well as its competitive

# advantages.

- 6. Competitive advantages. Competitive advantages are unique

attributes or capabilities that enable a company to outperform

competitors. They are crucial to the performance and long-term success

of a company. They drive sales and proﬁt margins, attract top talent,

## boost investor conﬁdence, enhance resilience, and create signiﬁcant

barriers to entry for new competitors.

When the founders started SEB, they saw many opportunities to achieve its higher purpose through competitive diﬀerentiation. Traditional

gyms had limited hours and inconvenient locations, making it diﬃcult

for people with busy schedules to work out. The founders decided to oﬀer a 24/7 ﬁtness solution that would cater to people who needed

ﬂexibility in their workout schedules. They focused on opening smaller,

simpler neighborhood gyms that eliminated little-used racquetball

courts and had only the equipment that people most frequently wanted

to use. They implemented high-tech security systems and access

controls, ensuring that members felt safe while working out at any time

# of the day or night.

Many gyms had complicated membership contracts and used high-

pressure sales tactics that deterred potential customers. Those gyms

signed up thousands of members, hoping most would never show

up to work out. Runyon and Mortensen wanted to simplify the membership process, make it more aﬀordable without compromising

quality, and make signing up more customer-friendly. They introduced

straightforward membership plans without long-term contracts,

providing ﬂexibility and reducing the pressure on potential members.

They noticed that many gyms lacked a sense of community and

personal attention—members felt like just a number. Those gyms

turned away people with health challenges. Runyon and Mortensen

aimed to create a strong community feel. They focused on creating a

welcoming environment, boosting engagement, and helping members

# achieve measurable results.

Runyon told us that in the beginning, most competitors assumed the

business model couldn’t work. But once they saw SEB’s proﬁtable

growth, copycats emerged. By then SEB had created the competitive

advantage that would be hardest to replicate: a people-centric culture

that inspires everyone to be passionate about what they do. That culture

## views and treats people as partners and valuable assets rather than

# expenses.

Turning operational eﬀectiveness, culture, and loyalty into competitive

advantages requires an operating model that strengthens a company’s

capabilities and continually adapts to changing conditions.

- 7. The operating model. An operating model comprises the

## organization’s structure and accountabilities, governance processes and

metrics, leadership and culture, talent and performance management,

business processes, and technology and data. It is the organizational

engine that unleashes the power of people and fuels value creation.

Runyon sees the SEB operating model as its system for compounding

the culture. “We never felt that our advantage was our product,” he says.

“It was always cooperation with our stakeholders. We have to support

them better. We have to move faster. If we get better, if we out-execute

our competitors every day, we know we will win the market-share and

value-creation race.”

SEB’s impressive operating model is about to face its greatest challenge.

In April 2024 the company began a merger of equals with Orangetheory.

The economies of scale are obvious. The new operating model is not.

Leverton, to be the new CEO. Chuck Runyon, the CEO of SEB, and Dave

Long, the CEO of Orangetheory, will continue to serve on the board. The cultures are a bit diﬀerent. Glassdoor reviews show that Orangetheory’s

employees have been less satisﬁed than those at Self Esteem Brands (a

score of 3.7 versus 4.0). But a crucial test of any strategy system is how it

Maximizing company value requires unleashing the power of strategic ﬁt—creating beneﬁcial multiplier eﬀects among all the components

of a company’s business system. Eventually this value should show

up in its market value. But now that we have better ways to

measure the changing value of more-strategic factors and to model the synergistic eﬀects among them, executives can adapt to dynamic market conditions more quickly and eﬀectively. Intangible assets can

become more tangible and more easily valued inside and outside the

company. As executives gain experience with this way of thinking

and develop better data for measuring and managing progress, both

companies and markets will become more eﬃcient.
