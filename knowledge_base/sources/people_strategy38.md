## Thriving at Work: How Organizational Culture Affects Workplace Fulﬁllment

# By Thomas O. Davenport

Workplace culture is to employees as soil is to plants. In some organizations, cultural soil rich with nutrients allows people to grow and thrive. In other organizations, the earth is thin and rocky. In an impoverished social environment, people strain to survive and produce and their psychological and physical health may be compromised. Managers play a key role in determining whether the culture of an enterprise, as experienced by employees, contributes to or undermines employee well-being.

The Two Sides of Culture Edgar Schein, one of the leading academic theorists on corporate culture, defines culture as a pattern of shared basic assumptions that a group has learned as it solves problems of external pressure and internal cooperation. These assumptions have

tightly woven into the fabric of most companies’ work environment. Super- visors and managers, however, have great power to modify stressors and introduce stress-buffering conditions into the workplace. The best manag- ers don’t eliminate stress—they can’t. Instead, they alleviate its worst aspects and transform what remains into pos- itive energy. This transformation can not only reduce the unhealthy effects of stress, but also increase employee satisfaction and productivity. In these organizations people thrive.

Managers exercise their influ- ence over workplace stress in part by how they mold the culture of their work units. The manager tool kit for shaping local culture contains four principal approaches:

worked well enough to be considered valid, and so have evolved over time into norms and principles for behavior.

Results from a recent Towers Watson survey on workplace stress, manager behavior, and organizational culture lead us to conclude that organizational norms and values can be di- vided into two simple categories. The human side of culture encompasses the value placed on individual employees and their experiences as they go about their work and live their lives within the company. Culture’s human side incorporates four distinct elements, each of which can be anchored by a pair of semantically opposite end points, as shown in Exhibit 1.

- •

Calibrating work to fit individual abilities and aspirations Providing social support that builds employees’ productive energy

- Enhancing autonomy, giving individuals stress-reducing control over the what, when, where, and how of work • Ensuring that intrinsic and extrinsic rewards are commen- surate with employees’ perceived contributions

# HUMAN SIDE OF CULTURE

The work side of culture consists of five ele- ments incorporating the norms that influence how tasks are configured. Exhibit 2 shows the five work side elements and the semantic end points. Each pair of end points represents extremes on a continuum. In most cases, employee respon- dents define current culture as a point about midway between the opposites. But employees also tell us they believe cultural norms should become more compatible with employee physical, psychological, and emotional health. Our survey findings tell us what the shift would look like.

Culture, Workplace Stress, and Fulﬁllment An organization’s cultural environment can either increase or reduce employee stress. Work- place stressors, in turn, can take a dramatic toll on individuals and employers alike. A study by re- searchers at Stanford and Harvard estimates that workplace stress contributes to at least 120,000 deaths each year and accounts for as much as $190 billion in health care costs in the U.S. Elim- inating all stressors from the work environment is impractical. Some level of stress is simply too

Managers who skillfully put these techniques to use create a social environment that nurtures and sustains high levels of personal and organizational health.

Dealing with the Human Side In our survey of employees and their experiences of work- place stress, we discovered a number of gaps between the perceptions of current organizational culture and the cultural norms that define a high-fulfillment environment. The graph

than about 10 percent for any one element. But together, they define a set of culture movements that can make a significant difference in employ- ee well-being.

Survey respondents signaled that the larg-

est relative change would need to occur in the task-people element. Of the four manager performance areas, three in particular—calibrat- ing challenge; supplying resources and support; and providing a fair portfolio of rewards—can contribute to building a more people-oriented local work climate. In high-fulfillment cultures, for example, managers who excel at calibrating challenges receive favorability scores between the high 70s and high 80s (on a scale from 0 to 100) for their ability to: • Assign tasks that are well suited to individual

# skills and abilities

- Set appropriate goals for individual perfor- mance

- Challenge people with difficult but achievable goals

- Help employees to understand how organiza- tional changes will affect their jobs In cultures with high fulfillment potential, managers also get high scores for providing re- sources and support, reflected in how well they: • Ensure people have the logistical (for example, technology), collaborative (peer and manager assistance), and social (friendly work atmo- sphere) resources they need

- Create a supportive team environment • Make themselves available to help solve prob- lems

• Give people meaningful performance feedback

Managers who perform well at handling the always-chal- lenging distribution of intrinsic and extrinsic rewards also help to move the cultural needle toward the people-oriented side of the dial. They get high scores from employees for effectively differentiating between high and low performers, making fair decisions about reward distribution and provid- ing liberal opportunities for people to learn and grow.

Moving from a high-stress culture to one in which people can thrive emotionally and psychologically also requires that individuals have significant self-determination in the work- place. People are more likely to thrive when they have the lat- itude to decide how best to do their work. Conversely, heavy micromanagement is well established as a cause of workplace stress. Managers who enable and support employee autono- my consistently demonstrate their willingness to: • Ensure people have the authority they need to do their

findings reveal, as one might expect, that employees perceive greater opportunity for fulfillment when orga- nizations distribute decision-making authority widely rather than concentrating it in a few places. But the shift toward more distributed authority was smaller than might be expected—about half the magnitude of the shift toward a people-centric culture, for example (see Exhibit 3).

Do people actually value a certain amount

of central authority? We observed this phe- nomenon in our work for a Fortune 50 com- pany with an array of business units. When the top 200 managers across the organization were asked to identify the company’s most sig- nificant unrealized opportunity, many pointed to the difficulty of coordination across decen- tralized business units. This statement was typ- ical: “As a highly decentralized company we are not proficient at sharing information. Our systems are fragmented.” Another manager pointed out the strain associated with the problem: “Information shar- ing is a huge challenge. Unfortunately, this has become an after-hours, extra-effort endeavor, putting pressure on all of the regular work that has to get done.”

Judicious centralization of supporting activities—for example, customer information sharing, talent mobility, and collaborative innovation—reduces wasteful and stressful effort and improves the potential for work-related fulfillment. Burdensome centralization that slows decisions and impedes work efforts does the opposite.

In cultures that have adopted employee autonomy as a closely held norm, the manager role looks different from its conventional shape in most organizations.

In our culture analysis, employees said that opportunity for fulfillment would increase with a small move away from what is currently perceived as an individualistic cultural norm and toward a climate with greater emphasis on teamwork. This finding aligns with the well-understood importance of social support as a buffer against stress. According to 2014 data from the American Psychological Association, people who say they receive emotional support put their overall stress levels at 4.8 on a 1 to10 scale. In comparison, people who say they lack emotional sustenance gave themselves a 6.2 rating.

Managing the Work Side Exhibit 4 shows the relative magnitude and direction of change that employees believe would help make the work- side elements of the average organizational culture more conducive to high fulfillment.

As with the human-side cultural elements, these changes are individually small. Taken together, however, they repre- sent an important cultural shift in favor of employee and or- ganizational health. Exhibit 5 presents scenarios that reflect different situations on each of the five elements of work-side culture.

In each case, the most radical version of Scenario A would increase stress for most employees. Situations approximating the Scenario B examples, in contrast, would engender a more fulfilling work environment. Again, these are constructed to be stark examples—most work cultures will fall somewhere in the middle, and that is where employees are most com- fortable. Nevertheless, our survey suggests that work climates more like the Scenario B examples—less immediate pressure, more opportunity for creativity, less dedication to historical process, less attachment to quantitative analysis, and risk avoidance—are more compatible with increased productive energy and lower stress.

Manager skill at calibrating work challenge has a signifi- cant effect on how employees perceive the work side of orga- nizational culture. Managers deemed effective at helping to move workplace culture in the direction of greater fulfillment got high scores from employees for how well they: • Negotiate reasonable project time lines • Remove obstacles to doing jobs well • Involve people in the scheduling of their work • Encourage new ideas and new ways of doing things

Similarly, the degree to which managers succeed at en- couraging and enabling worker autonomy goes a long way toward determining whether the work side of culture is more stressful or more fulfilling. In cultures that have adopted employee autonomy as a closely held norm, the manager role

looks different from its conventional shape in most orga- nizations. For example, at W.L. Gore & Associates (manu- facturer of Gore-Tex fabrics and many other industrial and consumer products and perennial occupant of a spot on the list of great employers), managers are not bosses, but rather “sponsors.” Sponsors help employees find a fit between individual skills and the needs of a particular team. As CEO Terry Kelly describes Gore’s philosophy, leaders stay out of the spotlight and give power to others. Employees have broad latitude to choose the projects they work on and to manage their own workloads. They owe accountability to their teams rather than to a manager.

The Business Case Towers Watson research suggests a strong business case can be made for investment of manager time and effort in building a fulfilling social environment. We know, for example, that stress at work exacerbates the costly effects of employee absence and presenteeism. Our research suggests that the characteristics of a fulfilling work environment significantly mitigate these factors. Employees who say they work in a high-fulfillment environment rather than a stress- ful one also are: • Less likely to have been absent four or more days over
