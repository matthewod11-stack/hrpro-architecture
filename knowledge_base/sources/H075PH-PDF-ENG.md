Here’s a hypothetical scenario. Maybe you can relate.

Two department heads are leading a project for a tech startup on the

cusp of exponential growth. They don’t get along. In fact, they have

never gotten along. And working in close contact has exacerbated their

problems. As a critical deadline looms, their Slack channels are awash

## in snarky jabs, their direct reports bicker relentlessly with one another

over minutiae, and you, their supervisor, have just discovered that they

failed to assign a major task to anyone on the team because their

communication is so strained.

# Time for some team mediation? You bet.

## At the Morton Deutsch International Center for Cooperation and

## Conﬂict Resolution (MD-ICCCR) at Columbia University Teacher’s

College, we lead research that promotes conﬂict resolution and helps

people work through diﬃcult problems. Ten years ago, at the request of

the U.N., we undertook a review of empirical studies about mediation.

Through that work, we identiﬁed four primary reasons why mediation

can fail.

As a leader, before you step in to resolve a diﬃcult conﬂict like the one

above, it can be helpful to know the problems that often arise — where

your good intentions might go awry — so you can avoid them. First,

we’ll share the four chief reasons mediations get derailed, and then we’ll

highlight strategies you can implement to avert them.

# Four Reasons Mediation Fail

# High intensity

The higher the intensity of a conﬂict, the more likely it is for mediation

to collapse because the odds of one of the disputants storming out

or freaking out and further damaging the relationship goes up. In

our scenario above, the fact that the project is high stakes and the

department heads have never gotten along are factors that notch up

# the tension levels.

# Competitive relationships

Conﬂicts that occur between people or groups who are solely competing

against one another, especially over coveted resources, are also prone

to fail in mediation. For example, perhaps those two department heads

are ﬁghting over sparse funding allocations or even the attention and

recognition rarely doled out by higher-ups.

Limiting conditions Eﬀorts that are greatly constrained by time, law, norms, or other factors

are also prone to ﬂop. To suggest that two employees can work out their

issues in a single, two-hour meeting might be wrong. Working things out

takes as long as it takes, and mediation doesn’t always respond to the

parameters that organizations draw.

# Unspoken issues and hidden agendas

Problems can’t be resolved in open dialogue if important issues are kept

hidden. For example, perhaps there are tensions around gender equity in the oﬃce, and the department heads in this scenario are diﬀerent

genders. Mediations that involve issues that organizations aren’t talking

openly about tend to fail.

So how can you guide your staﬀ, your company, or other types of

## negotiations out of this these entrenchments?

One of us (Joshua) pilots conﬂict for a living as the chief strategy

## oﬃcer for the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service. His team

has settled major disputes over national railroads, a state-wide public

pension system collapse, and even the government’s largest-ever federal

## investment in transportation infrastructure in Native American land.

We share his lessons — learned from those experiences — to help any

## leader successfully navigate landmines in mediations.

The standard mediator’s role is ideally to open dialogue and then

disappear, allowing the parties to reach their own resolutions. Once the mediation is underway, you want to oﬀer a relational, non-judgmental

approach by asking questions, reﬂecting the answers, and reframing

what’s being said to help the parties expand their viewpoints.

But to do so, business leaders need to learn to navigate the four tripwires

we’ve observed in mediation failures. This is where mediators can assume diﬀerent roles (beyond the standard mediator role) to limit

the potential damage of a dispute and get it back on track. What’s

key is knowing which ﬂash points to watch for, and devising strategies

and developing skills for how to navigate each. We call this adaptive

mediation, and research shows that it works.

To explain the roles you may need to take as a mediator, we’ve devised

a cast of characters that allow you to role-play through these scenarios

# with success.

# The Medic

A mediator’s ﬁrst task is to gauge and control the intensity of a conﬂict.

For those highly volatile ones, it’s important to play the role of medic by

triaging the conﬂict to reduce its intensity. A mediator in medic mode

is active — they remain highly present throughout the process and

enforce communication guidelines like keeping people from going on

the attack. This does not necessarily require an overly ﬁrm intervention;

instead, the medic strikes a deft balance between allowing the parties

to vent while slowing them down long enough that they begin to talk.

Meanwhile, they reframe, rethink, and reﬂect the conﬂict back to the

parties and stay self-aware enough to keep themselves cleanly out of the

# dispute.

The medic’s best tools are controlling the process, managing emotions,

and providing a structure that ﬁnally lets the parties involved hash it

out, in a reasonable amount of time. Simultaneously, it’s up to the medic

to model a positive example of self-composure and self-expression,

and to reassure those involved, all while consistently evaluating and

reframing their problems. The medic’s authority as an executive helps.

A strong presence controls the room, and that control leads to better

outcomes. But don’t just walk into the room and take control — take the

time to get an accurate read of the situation and then be ready to adjust

rapidly to address the speciﬁc derailers at hand.

# The Referee

The next task for the mediator is to assess whether the dispute is

primarily a win-lose competition. If so, you need to be prepared to

support ﬁrm and fair negotiations between them. The referee models how to eﬀectively bargain and horse trade and eﬃciently settles

outcomes. The referee also gives guidance and direction and makes the

# rules of the process crystal clear.

The referee does this by carefully evaluating the fairness and viability of both sides’ proposals. And also facilitating compromise and trade-oﬀs

or ﬁnding ways to expand the pie to move the parties out of a win-lose

mentality. There may be more common ground than you think. For

instance, in the hypothetical example above, it may be that the budget

allocated to the project isn’t suﬃcient for either of the department

heads to get their jobs done. That shared perspective can help align

them toward working on a resolution together. One caution: Approach

this role carefully — the evaluative nature of the approach requires high

credibility to execute successfully.

# The Fixer

Another critical task is to identify any major constraints on the

mediation. Here the ﬁxer makes an assessment with the goal of pushing

restrictive situations toward new possibilities. Are there external

constraints like bad timing (a pressing deadline makes it impossible

to think), lack of privacy, restrictive HR procedures, or others that are

keeping the parties from working things out? If so, look at what you can

do to lessen those constraints; ideally you do this before bringing the

# disputants together.

The ﬁxer can address tight constraints by calling them out and if

necessary, discussing and solving them with the involved parties

to make the necessary accommodations. This can trigger a more

cooperative dynamic. The ﬁxer can also leverage certain constraints to

begin to lower the aspirations of anyone who’s completely stuck in their

position or is there only to prevail. For instance, if the ﬁnancial costs of

a stalled project are escalating due to the dispute, the ﬁxer might play to the budget concerns of the disputants to get them to budge oﬀ their

position. Note that playing the ﬁxer role well often requires a can-do

# attitude.

# The Counselor

Now for the tough part — to carefully surface unexpressed concerns

or hidden agendas. This is where the counselor role comes in. It’s best

to speak privately with each party to unearth those covert issues. The

counselor is a neutral coach who makes all parties feel safe, heard, and

understood. The private caucus is sacred space created by the mediator

for the beneﬁt and comfort of the parties. The counselor must set the

tone to show their employees, “Here is a safe space where we can get

work done.”

The counselor’s tools are listening, coaching, questioning, clarifying,

and probing the history of the dispute, all while taking their time.

This approach often gets frustrated parties to open up about sensitive

## issues like workplace inequity, such as concerns about wages, access to

## promotions, advancement opportunities, and an unequal distribution

of work. It’s often in these more open, candid conversations that

managers get a more accurate sense of the challenges some employees

# face.

In some mediations, you may need to play all four of these roles to move

things forward. Other times, you may lean heavily into just one. The key

is to assess which of the pitfalls the parties are at risk of falling into and

respond accordingly. Much like controlling the center of a chess board,

successful mediation is also about knowing which risk to address when

and how to get back to a smooth resolution process.
