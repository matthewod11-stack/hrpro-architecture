Many TV watchers are abuzz about the return of the hit HBO series Succession. The prestige drama doubles as a withering lens into the

complex relationships, power dynamics, and jargon often found in

corporate America. The ﬁrst episode of season four, which aired on

March 26, oﬀers a moment of reﬂection on the pitfalls to which business

leaders often succumb in high-stakes negotiations. And negotiations go

# wrong in real life all the time.

The show follows the Roy family, the wealthy and powerful clan behind

## the ﬁctional international media and entertainment giant Waystar

Royco. The family’s patriarch, Logan Roy, is a ruthless and much-feared

businessman facing health issues. His four grown children — Connor,

Kendall, Roman, and Siobhan (Shiv) — have their own ambitions and

ideas for the company’s future. They also have a ﬁnancial stake in

Waystar Royco. As the series progresses, internal and external crises

threaten the media empire’s stability and future.

In the ﬁrst episode of season four, power-hungry Logan is in

negotiations for digital media company Gojo to acquire his company.

He has yanked control of Waystar away from his three younger children

and has set his sights on acquiring Pierce Global Media (PGM), the

left-leaning media conglomerate he’s been eyeing since season two.

The company’s valuation has signiﬁcantly decreased, yet matriarch Nan

Pierce is eager to sell. Logan’s biggest obstacle in the negotiation isn’t

the price tag, it’s his own family. Kendall, Roman, and Shiv team up to

bid against their dad for PGM by liquidating their stakes in Waystar after

the company is sold to GoJo. Their decision sets the stage for a ﬁerce

# battle of wills and wallets.

Once they’ve decided to ﬁght Logan for PGM, the siblings waste no time

in meeting with the Pierces, who take advantage of the Roy family’s

internecine animosity to drive up the sale price. After a few bids, Nan

agrees to sell to the siblings for $10 billion without giving Logan a

chance to counter. Losing a bidding war to his own children is a hard

pill for Logan to swallow.

Notably, the PGN deal is contingent on the siblings liquidating their

Waystar assets, so it’s not a done deal just yet. Even so, the contest

highlights classic mistakes that business leaders frequently make in

(real) high-stakes situations. Here are words to the wise on what to take

# away.

Avoid offers you can’t justify.

When Logan Roy learns about the presence of rival bidders (his own

children), his advisors tell him he is “the solid option.” This leads him

to feel conﬁdent about his bid. So, when Nan Pierce calls asking for a

ﬁrm number, he replaces the “soft” $7 billion he ﬂoated earlier with a $6

# billion oﬀer.

In this case, Logan’s brazen conﬁdence got in the way. Overconﬁdence

leads negotiators to underestimate their counterparts, which in turn

leads them to make unrealistic demands or unreasonably low bids.

If the other party becomes oﬀended, impasse is likely. Overconﬁdent

negotiators also underprepare for talks and overlook potential risks

and weaknesses in their own position. As a result, they become overly

aggressive or dismissive of the other party’s concerns, which can damage relationships and make it more diﬃcult to reach a mutually

# beneﬁcial agreement.

There is a second problem with Logan’s $6 billion bid: It is an

aggressively low number, one that he did not bother to explain or

justify to Nan. Negotiators who provide explanations for their proposals

are more likely to reach agreements than those who do not oﬀer any

justiﬁcation, research shows. Compelling, well-reasoned explanations

show the other side that you’ve given considerable thought to your oﬀer

and that it is well justiﬁed.

Frame your proposal.

When Kendall, Roman, and Shiv meet with Nan Pierce in person to tell

her they are interested in making an oﬀer, she is quick to tell them that

she has a solid oﬀer already and that they made the trip in vain. Nan

seems to be well aware of the power of framing in negotiation — the fact

that the way an oﬀer is presented can inﬂuence its perceived value and,

ultimately, the negotiation’s outcome. In Nan’s case, she sends the clear

signal to the siblings that they will have to beat a solid oﬀer (Logan’s) if

they are truly interested in getting her attention.

Negotiators can increase the likelihood of their oﬀer being accepted

by framing their proposal in a way that emphasizes its beneﬁts and

minimizes its drawbacks. Roman, Kendall, and Shiv themselves could

have used framing to their advantage by highlighting the positive

aspects of their proposal while downplaying the negatives. More

generally, both buyers and sellers can powerfully impact negotiation

dynamics by framing their arguments thoughtfully.

Anchors are sticky.

When the Roy siblings tell Nan they can likely make a better oﬀer

than the bid she’s already received, she comments, “I feel like I’m in

a bidding war. Eight, nine, what’s next?” Enter the anchors that were

likely to draw future bids in their direction.

A powerful tool in negotiation, anchoring involves introducing a

speciﬁc reference point, or anchor, aimed at inﬂuencing the other

party’s perception of the value of subsequent oﬀers. Anchors are

generally used as ﬁrst oﬀers in negotiation. This means that the ﬁrst

oﬀer presented in a negotiation can have a signiﬁcant impact on the

ﬁnal outcome, even if it is not accepted. For example, a seller who

sets a high asking price for a car can anchor the buyer’s perception of

the car’s value, making subsequent negotiations more favorable to the

seller. Conversely, if the buyer sets the anchor with a lowball oﬀer, he or

she can shift the seller’s perception of the car’s value in their favor.

Nan Pierce dropped $8 billion and $9 billion anchors to signal the type

of bid she was likely to accept. After the Roy siblings take a few minutes

to think it over, Shiv returns with an oﬀer of $8 billion. Told this might

not cut it, Shiv and her brothers huddle again. They speculate that their

father may be bidding in the $9 billion range and decide to come back

with a ﬁnal bid of $10 billion to decisively beat him.

Initial anchors have a strong inﬂuence on ﬁnal oﬀers in negotiation,

research shows. However, the eﬀectiveness of our anchors depends on

whether we have enough information to set a proper anchor. Nan Pierce

did. But if we know little about the value of the item at stake, then we

may set an inappropriate anchor. Anchors become sticky numbers that

drive oﬀers that follow, like the Roy siblings’ extremely high $10 billion

# bid.

Emotions can derail negotiations.

## Throughout the bidding war between Logan and his siblings, emotions

are high. The siblings are so eager to beat their father that they

make oﬀers unjustiﬁed by thoughtful analysis. My Harvard Business

School colleague Deepak Malhotra and his colleagues have written

## about the dangers of competitive arousal, a psychological phenomenon

that occurs when negotiators experience strong emotions during a

# negotiation or auction.

Negotiators experiencing competitive arousal tend to make aggressive

demands and extreme oﬀers, and to become overly defensive or argumentative. This can escalate conﬂict and make it diﬃcult to reach

mutually beneﬁcial agreements. It can also lead negotiators to make

irrational oﬀers, as was likely the case for the Roy siblings. The desire to

win becomes more important than making sound decisions. Thus, the

well-known insight about M&A competitions: Buyers often overbid and

# overpay.

More broadly, emotions can derail negotiations in various ways.

## Negative emotions such as anger, frustration, and disappointment can

lead negotiators to make irrational decisions and engage in hostile

## behaviors. Meanwhile, positive emotions, such as excitement and

enthusiasm, can cause negotiators to overlook potential risks and make

overly optimistic oﬀers. Both negative and positive emotions can impair

negotiators’ ability to accurately assess situations and make rational

decisions — and make it challenging to achieve a successful negotiation

# outcome.

# Negotiate process, not just substance.

The type of bidding war that the Roy siblings and their father entered

into is dangerous territory, as it can lead to overbidding and overpaying.

To avoid this trap, the Roy siblings could have tried to negotiate the

process before making a bid. For instance, they could have asked Nan to

agree to a single-round auction with no “funny” bids (such as bidding a

dollar more than what the other bidder oﬀered).

Negotiating the negotiation process can include setting ground rules,

agreeing on a timeline, and establishing the roles and responsibilities

of each party. In a business negotiation, the parties might agree to

a speciﬁc meeting format, including how long each person will have

to speak and when breaks will be taken. Such rules establish a clear

structure for the negotiation and can help ensure that both parties feel

# heard and understood.

When the process is negotiated in good faith and agreed upon by both

sides, it can help establish a sense of fairness and transparency. This

can set up a more collaborative negotiation process and increase the

likelihood of reaching a mutually beneﬁcial agreement.
