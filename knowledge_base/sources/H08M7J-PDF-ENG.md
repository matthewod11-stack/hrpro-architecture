You’ve just arrived at the ofﬁce in the aftermath of yesterday’s layoﬀ

announcement. You sense the collective unease. You see it in peoples’

glances, and you ﬁnally hear it from a colleague: “I’m sorry your team

was let go. You’re lucky to stay.”

What that colleague may not know is that “lucky” has a bittersweet

taste. If this scenario feels familiar to you, you might be experiencing

# “survivor syndrome.”

And you’re not alone. Business news and social media are bursting with

announcements about layoﬀs around the globe. In 2024, the technology

sector alone laid oﬀ nearly 130,000 employees. Consider Intel, which

took the market by surprise in late summer by announcing a 15% global

workforce reduction, or Cisco, which laid oﬀ about 9,600 employees last

year. While tech has been severely hit, other industries, from industrials

to retail, also saw sweeping job cuts. For example, Boeing recently

announced it will cut 17,000 jobs, and German rail incumbent Deutsche

Bahn reported it will trim 9% of its workforce over the next ﬁve years.

In the consumer sector, Unilever shared plans to reduce a third of all European oﬃce roles by the end of this year.

Companies often overlook the negative impacts of change on those

who remain after a layoﬀ. These employees’ emotional, behavioral, and

psychological reactions have been characterized as “workplace survivor

syndrome,” a term that borrows its name from psychological studies

linked to surviving a disastrous or highly traumatic experience. When

your colleagues are laid oﬀ, the emotional and psychological toll of the

layoﬀs doesn’t end with their departure; it lingers, and it can alter how

you perceive yourself, your role, and your performance. You’re left to

navigate a mineﬁeld of emotions, uncertainties, and new expectations,

often without a clear roadmap for how to proceed.

If you’re a layoﬀ survivor, how can you regain a sense of control over

your work life? Once you have a solid understanding of the challenges

you’re facing, you can take steps to navigate your new work situation

with clarity and conﬁdence. Here are some speciﬁc challenges you

might experience:

# Emotional whiplash

Survivors of layoﬀs can ﬁnd themselves navigating a sea of emotions

that can shift unexpectedly from day to day. On the one hand, you

may experience happiness, gratitude, and relief that you were “chosen”

to remain. At the same time, you may also grapple with a profound

sense of guilt from having a job when others lost theirs and grieve

the departure of close colleagues and the organization you thought

you knew. You may feel exhausted as you struggle to reconcile and manage these conﬂicting emotions (e.g., “I should be thrilled, but I

don’t feel that way”). Emotional contagion can also ripple through the

organization, leading to a collective sense of loss and grief.

# Uncertainty overload

Uncertainty and anxiety about the future can be intensiﬁed for those

who remain (and even more so for remote workers). You may have

## questions about role clarity, organizational direction, job security, and

“what’s next?” As a survivor, you may ask yourself: What does my future

look like here? Do I still ﬁt within this new version of the organization?

In the wake of layoﬀs, restructuring can lead to ambiguous

reporting lines and unclear responsibilities. Some survivors experience

unmanageable role creep, ﬁlling in for team members who have left.

Others must revert to roles that do not fully capitalize on their skillsets,

risking lower engagement and performance.

This uncertainty can feel paralyzing, as it directly challenges the

underlying human need for predictability and control, leading to a drop

## in motivation and job satisfaction and decreased trust in leadership. As

a result, survivors often report increased levels of stress and burnout

symptoms following layoﬀs.

# Social strain

For survivors, navigating the social dynamics of a downsized workplace

can be as challenging as managing their internal turmoil. Questions

like “How are you holding up?” or comments such as “You’re so

lucky to still have your job” can inadvertently reinforce feelings of

isolation, guilt, or resentment. You may also feel judged by peers. Are

you perceived as deserving of your continued employment, or simply

a fortunate bystander? For some, this dynamic can trigger imposter

syndrome, leading to a cycle of self-doubt and peer detachment.

Pressure to perform

Regardless of their track record, layoﬀ survivors often feel an unspoken

expectation to “earn” their place in the organization, particularly when

roles have been consolidated or resources are stretched thin. This

pressure can manifest in overwork, perfectionism, or an unhealthy

drive to meet impossible expectations. For many, it’s an attempt to

demonstrate their worth and avoid becoming part of the next wave of

cuts. However, this survival mentality can lead to burnout and erode

# long-term productivity.

# How to Navigate the Aftermath of Layoffs

Facing the aftermath of layoﬀs can feel overwhelming, but it also oﬀers

survivors an opportunity to navigate this period with intentionality and

resilience. Furthermore, it may give you a rare chance to become an

architect of the “new” organization. By acknowledging the challenges

and taking proactive steps, you can regain a sense of control and

# purpose.

Here are four essential strategies to help you move forward in the ﬁrst

# weeks after the announcement:

# Acknowledge

The ﬁrst step in navigating survivor syndrome is recognizing that

your feelings and experiences are valid, whether they’re positive or

negative. Self-awareness is critical to understanding how these factors

are aﬀecting your mindset and behavior. Reﬂect on the challenges

## — emotional turmoil, uncertainty, awkward social dynamics, or

performance pressures — and identify which feel most daunting for

you. This reﬂection helps you avoid suppressing emotions that, if

left unaddressed, can compound over time. Journaling, speaking with

trusted colleagues, or seeking guidance from a mentor or coach can help

you process and prioritize your challenges.

# Assess

Take stock of your current reality. What emotions are present within

yourself, your team, and the workplace at large? What does the

organization look like? Who remains, in what roles, and how has the

dynamic shifted? Reﬂect on your own role. How has it changed? What is

the new “job to be done”? What are the implications for you?

Investigate the organization’s priorities. Ambiguity thrives in the

aftermath of layoﬀs, so don’t hesitate to proactively seek out the

information you need. Your manager or leadership team may not

have all the answers yet, but identify and note gaps in your own

understanding, whether they’re about changes to your role or team,

reporting lines, or the company’s overall strategic direction. Engage in

dialogue with your manager or leadership team to understand how your

role ﬁts into the company’s revised strategy and what success looks like

in this new context. Proactive engagement will signal your commitment

to the new strategic direction and help you align your goals with the

# organization’s.

# Reinvent

While the changes may feel discouraging, in the midst of upheaval,

there is often an opportunity to innovate or contribute meaningfully

to the organization’s future. Use this time to reﬂect on your own value

proposition and goals within the new organization. What renewed skills,

experience, and value can you contribute? Are there opportunities

to take on new challenges or responsibilities that align with your

ambitions? Are there speciﬁc skills that will position you for growth in a

# diﬀerent role or team?

Consider networking with multiple stakeholders to identify

## opportunities for collaboration, propose new initiatives, or simply

rethink how you approach your day-to-day work. By focusing on what

you can control, you can shift from feeling like a passive participant to

## an active agent in your career trajectory.

# Rebuild

Once you’ve gained clarity, it’s time to move from reﬂection to action.

Create a plan for your next 30 days with concrete, manageable goals that

will help you regain a sense of agency and purpose. This plan might

include setting priorities, engaging with decision-makers to signal your

aspirations, building relationships with new stakeholders who can

support you, and securing quick wins that demonstrate your value and

build momentum. Having a clear roadmap will help you navigate this

## transition with greater conﬁdence and clarity.

Throughout this process, focus on strengthening your resilience. To

operate at your best, be intentional regarding your social, emotional,

physical, and spiritual health. For social resilience, surround yourself

with people who provide constructive support, rather than those

who perpetuate negativity. While some venting can be helpful as an

emotional release, it can also become destructive if it happens too often.

Emotional resilience may involve mindfulness practices, journaling, or

therapy, while physical health can be bolstered through regular exercise

and good nutrition. For spiritual resilience, ﬁnding purpose — whether

in your work, personal life, or community — can be a powerful anchor

# during times of uncertainty.

Despite the immediate pressures of the new situation, “surviving” this

process is a marathon, not a sprint. Establish boundaries to ensure

you can sustain your productivity without sacriﬁcing your well-being.

Communicate openly with your team about workload and expectations,

and give yourself permission to rest and recharge. Remember, resilience

requires pacing, not overextension.

. . .

Layoﬀ survivors are more than just employees left behind — they’re the

foundation of an organization’s future. Yet the emotional, social, and

professional challenges they face are profound and often overlooked. By

acknowledging the impact of these changes, assessing the new reality,

identifying opportunities, and taking deliberate action, survivors can

## turn this moment of uncertainty into one of growth and resilience. The

road ahead may be uncertain, but with the right tools and mindset, you

can emerge stronger on the other side.
