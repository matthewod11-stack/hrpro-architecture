In her early thirties, Bethany was at a crossroads. After working for the

U.S. government in Washington, DC, she’d been accepted into a PhD

program in law in Australia, which she’d chosen in order to be closer

to her partner. But when the relationship abruptly ended just before

she enrolled, she felt as if the ﬂoor had dropped out from beneath her.

This was on top of an already hard year: Bethany’s father had passed

away several months earlier. Overwhelmed and disoriented, she worried

that she had “lost the ability to appreciate joy in life.” But instead of

seeking a diﬀerent PhD program or a new job, she did something radical

for a high achiever. She saved up for a year and then allowed herself a

# six-month sabbatical from work.

During this time, she volunteered and trekked in Latin America, visited

friends, and walked the Camino de Santiago, a historic pilgrimage in

Spain that spans roughly 500 miles. She emerged with a renewed focus

and vigor. “It opened up my eyes about what I can do as a professional

by giving me more conﬁdence to try new things,” she said. “I always

thought that the main goal in life was to get your ducks in a row, and

now I’ve realized that there are a lot of diﬀerent types of ducks and

they can be in any f—ing arrangement you want.” She went on to join a

ﬁrm dedicated to something she’d been passionate about in law school:

## California Tribal and American Indian law.

The perspective shift Bethany experienced is common among

sabbatical-takers. In my research with academic collaborators,

interviews I’ve conducted with more than 250 people who have taken an

extended leave from work, and my own personal sabbatical experience,

I’ve found that their impact is nearly always transformative. People

feel rejuvenated, with a sharper sense of their priorities, heightened

awareness of their place in the world, and improved conﬁdence,

creativity, and physical and mental health. Sometimes they strike out

in diﬀerent directions, focused on new career goals and armed with

the courage to tackle them. But just as often they pursue the same or

## similar paths with a fresh perspective and tweaked priorities. Whatever

the speciﬁc result, sabbatical alumni universally describe their time oﬀ

as a “peak life experience,” up there in importance with the birth of a

## child, marriage, or other life-deﬁning event.

## HBR / The Big Idea / The Case for Sabbaticals — and How to Take a Successful One

In an eﬀort to encourage more people to pursue sabbaticals — and to

reap the career and life rewards — I have spent the past seven years

studying the ins and outs of successful sabbaticals. Here I’ll answer the

most common questions about them: What distinguishes a sabbatical

from a long vacation? Who takes them and why? What challenges must

be overcome to do so, and how do you ensure a meaningful experience?

(To share your sabbatical experience and be included in my research,

take this survey.)

# What Constitutes a Sabbatical?

There’s no universally agreed-upon deﬁnition of sabbatical, even among

academics, where the practice originated as a way to learn about new

ﬁelds of studies and to rest and recover. For our purposes, the deﬁnition

is simple: an intentional extended leave from your job-related work.

Some employers oﬀer a formal beneﬁt of paid or unpaid sabbaticals.

But many people choose to take one without the promise or security to

## return to their same job or organization — or even career.

Other deﬁning attributes include:

Duration. Sabbaticals are measured in months, not days or weeks.

Ideally, they run from three months to a year. Most folks I’ve

interviewed said it took them up to eight weeks — much longer than

they’d expected — to even begin to detach from work. As one operations

manager who took a three-month stint abroad explained: “I had to be

forcibly removed from access [to my work routines]. Only after enough

time away from those patterns did the world suddenly feel so big again.

And I thought ‘Oh my God, there’s life beyond work.’”

Disconnection. True sabbaticals require full disconnection from any

work that is a part of — or even resembles — the taker’s prior job.

all messages during your entire time oﬀ.) That said, diﬀerent types of

work are allowed. For example, if you are a software engineer, you can

remodel a kitchen, but tech consulting is a no-go. Further, sabbatical-

takers should avoid actively searching for their next job. This is what

makes the break intentional: Regardless of why you take one, it’s vital

that, once you’re there, you commit to staying in the in-between. Ideally,

a proper sabbatical also includes geographic disconnection: physically

getting away — out of town or out of the country — for as long as is

feasible. Distance makes it easier to break from old routines. “There’s

something critical about…being in a new place where you don’t know

the rules and the players anymore,” an attorney told me. “I felt like I was

a diﬀerent person living a diﬀerent life.”

# Who Takes Them and Why?

The sabbatical-takers I’ve studied are regular workers, managers, and

executives who come from a wide range of industries and all over the

world. They represent all age groups, from precollege gap-year-goers

to those toeing up to retirement. The strongest predictor of whether a

person will take a sabbatical is if they know someone who has taken

one. However, around two-thirds of sabbatical-takers are also pushed

## into these breaks by sudden events in their professional or personal

lives — often negative catalysts, such as a death in the family, a health

# issue, or a career crisis.

Of course, while anyone can beneﬁt from a sabbatical, actually taking

one remains a privilege. Few companies oﬀer paid long-term leave,

so the demographics of those who take them skew toward those

who can more easily self-fund: college-educated, middle-to-upper-class

# individuals and their families.

## HBR / The Big Idea / The Case for Sabbaticals — and How to Take a Successful One

When people decide to take a sabbatical, they typically have one of three

goals in mind: to get things done, to answer big questions, or to recover

# from burnout.

The achiever. In 2018 Aarti, a community-organizer-turned-journalist,

was at a career high point, working as a national correspondent for NPR.

There was just one problem. She had a story that she felt she “needed to

tell in order to keep living”: the tale of her immigrant father’s wrongful

## treatment and imprisonment by the U.S. government in the wake of

9/11. NPR had a sabbatical leave program, and so Aarti took a break from

her career to write a book about her dad’s experience. Published in 2019,

it became a bestseller.

Aarti is a classic achiever. From the start of her sabbatical, she worked

hard, isolating herself at meditation retreats and in a small cabin in the

woods to plan and write. At the end of her time, she transitioned back

into work, exhausted and uncertain about her future but proud of what

she’d accomplished. From the outside, a journalist writing a book might

not seem like a true sabbatical. But for Aarti — like many achievers —

the turn toward a new personal goal, rather than a career-related one,

was the key to internal growth.

Achievers approach their time oﬀ with a productivity mindset, focusing

on what they get done more than how it makes them feel. They look

to benchmarks — such as ﬂuency in a foreign language, launching a

minimum viable product, opening a community garden, or completing

a set hike such as the Appalachian Trail — to conﬁrm progress. And

they emerge having accomplished something beyond their normal

# harried work to-do lists.

Their sabbaticals might not sound like fun, but I found that, from

a well-being perspective, achievers come away feeling signiﬁcantly

better. Indeed, high-eﬀort activities can be extraordinarily restorative.

As Aarti explained, “Writing that book was one of the most emotional

experiences of my life — akin to when I ﬁrst looked at my newborn

son.” The only regret she had was not taking a beat or two to rest at the

## beginning of her sabbatical, a common reﬂection among achievers.

The explorer. From the outside, Paul seemed to be a typical consultant:

whip-smart, comfortable in a host of business environments,

overﬂowing with air miles. He’d worked for Bain & Company prior to

business school and returned to the ﬁrm after graduating. At work, he

didn’t come oﬀ as particularly adventurous or antsy to change careers,

but he had a lot of questions about life’s possibilities. So every four

years or so, in between projects, Paul would take extended breaks to

test out potential paths for the future. During one sabbatical, he moved

to his parents’ native Estonia for a few months to study the language

and see how he’d ﬁt in. On another, he tested out his long-held dream

of running an eco-resort in retirement by working in the kitchen and

shadowing the owners of lodges in the U.S. Virgin Islands, Big Sur, and

# Hawaii.

His endeavors made real what psychologists call “counterfactual

thinking”: imagining an alternative to how things currently are. It’s one

thing to wonder if you’d be happy as a teacher; it’s another to actually

try teaching to ﬁnd out. Explorers run counterfactual experiments.

They enjoy the challenges of new experiences, learning more about

themselves and conﬁrming or dispelling notions about what they’d

rather be doing. As a result, whether they make a big change or return

to their routines, they feel more satisﬁed in their choices. Paul’s time

as an explorer helped him hone his thinking and his skills in travel and

hospitality, which led to a post-consulting career at Airbnb.

It’s worth noting that you don’t have to travel far to qualify as an

explorer. Plenty of folks ﬁnd ways to experiment with new futures closer

to home by volunteering in their communities, trying new hobbies, or

taking regional trips.

The burned-out. Mary spent her entire career at a sports-focused

nonproﬁt. The work was stressful but meaningful, so no matter how diﬃcult it got, she soldiered on. A decade in, a board member suggested

that Mary might want to take a paid sabbatical, supported by a local

funder who understood the pressures of serving others for a living. After

six months of preparation — clearing out her inbox and ensuring that

her colleagues could cover her absence — Mary took the time oﬀ. At

ﬁrst, she was paralyzed by the lack of responsibilities and found herself

continuing to do some work from home during her ﬁrst week oﬀ. But

once she was en route to France — with her laptop left behind at home

— she ﬁnally began to relax. Two months later, she returned to work

feeling reenergized and conﬁdent. She also realized that things needed

to change in order for her to re-up her tenure as leader. Mary lobbied the

board for a new executive hire to handle the increased workload she’d

taken on herself as the organization grew.

# Matt Carlson

I talked to a number of people like Mary, who took sabbaticals to

recover from or avoid burnout. My interviewees’ ailments included

ulcers, chronic pain, and insomnia, with doctors diagnosing work stress

as the cause. Their breaks involved activities that, as one interviewee

put it, made them “feel human again.” For example, another employee

suﬀering from burnout went camping to engage her “Neanderthal

self: focusing on keeping warm, dry, and fed while enjoying the

# surroundings.”

Of course, time oﬀ isn’t the only answer to burnout — organizations

have a role to play in ﬁxing the underlying problems in their workplaces,

too. That said, sabbatical-takers in this category agreed that the

experiences provided a respite and helped them realize that they had

been working in an unsustainable way.

## HBR / The Big Idea / The Case for Sabbaticals — and How to Take a Successful One

If you recognize yourself in one of these archetypes, you can determine

which sabbatical activities are right for you and what you truly need

# from your time oﬀ.

# What Challenges Must Be Overcome?

If you work for a company that has a sabbatical program — particularly

a paid one — taking time oﬀ is eminently manageable. What could be a

risky career decision is instead part of company culture — and possibly

lore. Unfortunately, this beneﬁt remains rare. So most people believe

taking an extended leave is out of their reach, no matter how alluring

the idea might be. This belief comes down to two things: responsibilities

and perception. Responsibilities are real and represent a tangible

commitment. Your mortgage company doesn’t care that you’re on

sabbatical, and family schedules can constrain possibilities. Perceptions

can certainly feel real, but they are intangible and contextual: how you

think about taking time oﬀ, as well as how you believe others will judge

# you.

Responsibilities. The decision to take a sabbatical should not be

made lightly. Most of us have obligations — professional, personal,

logistical, and ﬁnancial — that must be navigated before a long break

is feasible. But you can bridge the gap between your routine life and

## your sabbatical through thoughtful preparation.

To start, you may not need to quit your company. Many organizations

without formal sabbatical policies are still willing to make exceptions

for their most valued employees — if they’re intrepid enough to ask.

Less attractive options can also work for both parties, including taking

unpaid leave, departing without a guaranteed position on return, or

compromising on a later departure date to better ﬁt business realities.

If you’re worried about retribution for appearing less serious about

your job, ask colleagues if they know of anyone who has taken leave

before approaching your supervisors. And test the waters by identifying

a proposed sabbatical date years in the future to give your team and

# company ample preparation time.

On the personal front, if you have kids, you’ll want to investigate

schools in your potential destinations; if you have pets who can’t come

along, long-term sitters. Subletting your home, putting large expenses

on hold, and cutting oﬀ unnecessary recurring costs can help mitigate

the ﬁnancial burden. Even saving as little as 5% of your after-tax income

over a decade, much like you would save for retirement, can result

## in a self-paid sabbatical of sorts, thanks to the magic of compound

interest. (These are just a few strategies to consider; you can connect

with sabbatical alums or others who are in the planning stages for more

## ideas and best practices at The Sabbatical Project and in LinkedIn and

# Facebook groups.)

Some of my favorite sabbatical stories come from people of modest

means who were determined to make it work. One couple, both

teachers, saved up for a decade in order to travel with their children

from Arizona to the tip of Argentina — four people crammed into a

50-year-old Land Rover — on the cheap. The trip had such a big impact

on the father that he quit his teaching job to start a small business

restoring old Land Rovers.

Of course, there are many legitimate reasons not to take a sabbatical at certain points in your life. If you lack suﬃcient time or ﬁnancial

resources to fully step away from your work and routine life for

months, you’d be better oﬀ postponing until you can fully commit. In

the meantime, you can identify ways to take smaller breaks to help

you recover more regularly. But know that these comparatively brief

moments are not shortcuts to the outsize beneﬁts around purpose and

happiness that I’ve observed among sabbatical alumni.

## HBR / The Big Idea / The Case for Sabbaticals — and How to Take a Successful One

## Perceptions. The psychological hurdles that sabbatical-takers must

overcome fall into two categories: negative self-perception and fear of

others’ judgment.

For many people, self-worth is linked to performance at work. That’s

why our self-esteem takes a hit when we’re unemployed — even when

it’s by choice. Even sabbatical alumni who enjoyed their experiences

told me that they dreaded being asked “What do you do for a living?”

during their time oﬀ, especially if they had left their jobs. One way

to alleviate this feeling can be to adopt other work identities — for

Aarti, being a writer, and for Paul, an employee at a resort. Others may choose to lean into the discomfort, understanding that diﬃcult times

disproportionately produce positive growth.

Another concern is how current or future employers (or even your

in-laws) may view your sabbatical. This is not surprising when many

organizational and national cultures reward a devotion to work. People are lauded for staying late at the oﬃce, being available on vacations,

and generally prioritizing work over personal priorities. The pull to

conform is strong, but there’s growing evidence that more people,

including hiring managers, are beginning to view time oﬀ as a healthy

choice or a positive sign of a thriving inner life, curiosity, and desire

## for self-renewal. A survey I conducted among Harvard Business School

graduates 10 years out found that more than one-third had already

taken a sabbatical, and more than 90% of those who hadn’t taken time

oﬀ viewed extended leave-takers in a positive or neutral light.

One of the best ways to alleviate this worry is to ﬁnd an exemplar:

someone you admire who has taken a successful sabbatical. This makes

it easier to envision yourself taking one. If no one immediately comes

to mind, ask around, search your LinkedIn connections for those taking

advantage of its “career break” designation, or post in dedicated forums

on Reddit and Facebook. Once you ﬁnd them, sabbatical alumni are

almost universally helpful and passionate advocates for extended leave

for others. This approach will help you to imagine your own career

and life post-sabbatical, addressing — and potentially dispelling — your

# deepest fears.

# What Makes a Sabbatical Successful?

A person will need diﬀerent things from a sabbatical at diﬀerent times in their lives, so it’s diﬃcult to make broad recommendations. That

being said, I suggest keeping four things in mind as you plan and

execute a sabbatical.

First, you must set impenetrable boundaries around your time oﬀ.

There will always be opportunities to check in at work or peruse

LinkedIn to see what jobs are out there. But you might never get another

uninterrupted block of time to focus on what’s important outside of

# your life at work.

Second, get out of your head and into your body. Consider the ﬁrst

portion of your sabbatical to be a space for healing and restoration.

Instead of immediately striving to learn another language or work on a

startup idea, allow yourself some time to move your body (a multiday

## trek or yoga retreat, for instance) and work with your hands (maybe

a ceramics or art class) instead. Prioritize getting into nature for long

stretches and otherwise putting yourself in a position to be in awe of life

# again.

Next, prioritize spending your time on relationships. It’s no secret

that strong personal relationships lead to happier, healthier lives and

greater job fulﬁllment. Use your newfound ﬂexibility to visit the people

that matter to you on their timeline instead of waiting for your busy

schedules to ﬁnally sync. And don’t forget to prioritize your relationship

with yourself. Even if you’re partnered, make time for at least a weekend

solo retreat, and ﬁnd a therapist or coach who understands the issues

that often arise surrounding extended leave to help you synthesize

# learnings from your sabbatical.

Finally, don’t stay out too long. Many sabbatical-takers, especially those

between jobs, assume that they will have everything “ﬁgured out” by

the end of their time oﬀ: a dream job identiﬁed or a big life change

executed. While this is sometimes the case (remember Aarti?) more

often a sabbatical is an essential ﬁrst step to unlocking the next phase of

your life. Don’t let perfect be the enemy of good. It’s OK to extend your

sabbatical based on what you feel you need, but it’s better to reenter the

workforce wanting more than it is to resent yourself for not completely

transforming over the course of a relatively short span of your life.

# An Idea Whose Time Has Come

We don’t talk enough about how important it is to have the time and

space outside of work to do what’s important to us. Despite all the

talk about the Great Resignation, quiet-quitting, and work-life balance,

many of our cultures loudly lionize — and reward — overwork: the CEOs

who run multiple companies at once or the workers who sleep under

their desks. Even when we’re given paid time oﬀ, we fail to take it:

Almost half of Americans fail to take all their vacation days.* Leisure

time used to be something to aspire to — the hallmark of the wealthy —

but now the richest among us are the least likely to invest free time in

leisure. But that story is beginning to change.

Younger generations say they value ﬂexibility over compensation and

purpose over prestige. And with the Covid-19 pandemic, the cat is out

of the bag with the importance of ﬂexibility for knowledge workers,

as well as the reality that there are many diﬀerent ways to get a job

done, from many diﬀerent places and time zones. We may be a long way

from sabbaticals becoming the norm for all workers, but current trends

suggest that we should be moving in that direction.

We shouldn’t have to wait for something to break to give ourselves

permission to explore, for a little while, what makes life worth living.

So allow yourself to brieﬂy turn down the volume around boardroom

logistics, quarterly goals, or team dynamics, and let your quieter voice

emerge: What are things that light up your curiosity, either now or

when you were younger? Thus far in life, what do you most regret

not having done? Your answers can point you in a new direction. My

research suggests that a sabbatical is more than just a long vacation; it’s

# an investment for a better life.
