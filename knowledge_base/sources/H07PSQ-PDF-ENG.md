How do you manage an employee who’s been delivering lackluster

results and oﬀering only excuses? Getting angry isn’t the right solution.

And micromanaging only adds to your workload and teaches them

you’ll be accountable, so they don’t have to be. So what are your options

when you don’t trust someone to deliver?

The alternative is to switch from trusting the person to trusting the

# process.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Manage an Employee Who Always Makes Excuses

Let’s consider why an employee might fail. This will provide clues about

where a more robust process could remove excuses. First, they might

have no idea what you’re expecting of them or what doing a good

job requires. That’s an alignment issue. Second, they might lack the

knowledge or skills to accomplish the task — a competence problem.

Finally, they might lack the motivation to get over the line (or out of the

gate). To be successful, an employee needs to understand what to do,

know how to do it, and want to do it.

If an employee repeatedly fails, one or more of those foundational

pillars are missing. Your job is to create a process that acts as a

performance scaﬀold to strengthen their alignment, capability, and

motivation. This process should support the person from the moment

you assign the task until the moment they deliver it. It should also

negate their standard excuses. But of course, exactly which planks you

need in that scaﬀold depends on the person’s speciﬁc shortcomings.

# Provide Clarity on the Objective

One of the reasons employees let you down is that they don’t know

what showing up would look like. It’s common for managers to

## shortchange the upfront alignment conversations in the name of speed.

But that haste can cost you, especially with an unreliable employee. An

## investment in alignment upfront enables good performance and also

provides the framework to address poor performance if it persists.

Start by focusing on the purpose of the work. Establishing the objectives

will leave little room for excuses about divergent perspectives, motives,

or end goals. Starting with the purpose is also helpful if the person is

not strategic and wouldn’t see the big picture or if they’re self-serving

and prone to prioritizing their own success over that of the team. You’ll

want to spell out what you’re trying to accomplish. Who is this for?

How would the beneﬁciary deﬁne success? Where does this work ﬁt with

other initiatives or commitments? Answering these questions reduces

the opportunity for the person to claim they didn’t know what you

wanted.

Once you’re aligned on the purpose of the work, you can paint a picture

of what good, bad, and unacceptable outcomes would look like. But

unfortunately, this is another step managers commonly skip. I refer to

it as the Valentine’s Day eﬀect; failing to articulate what you want and

being disappointed when the person doesn’t deliver. And in the case of

an employee you’re already leery of, failing to deﬁne your expectations

is almost certainly setting yourself up for disappointment. To provide a

rubric for their work, describe the minimum standard. What would you

consider a home run? What outcomes would be worrisome or would you

see as a failure? Answering these questions eliminates the possibility

that the person will pass oﬀ shoddy work as “good enough.”

When you make the goals clear, you remove the alignment excuses.

# Align on the Optimal Approach

A second major reason an employee might be making excuses for poor

performance is that they don’t have the skills or knowledge to do what

you ask. If your trepidation is tied to gaps in the person’s capability,

your process must go beyond what they need to achieve and explore

how they’ll achieve it. Depending on your speciﬁc concerns, there are a

few ways to broach this.

When you suspect that the person might take shortcuts or neglect

essential components, get into some detail about the required steps.

Share eﬀective approaches and provide precedents from previous

projects. But don’t make the mistake of doing all the talking; their

nodding head cannot be interpreted as understanding. Instead, ﬁnd out

how they’re processing the request by asking them to share their plan.

Then you can provide any required course corrections with questions

that direct their attention, such as, “What steps will you take to ensure

ﬁnance is on board?” Answering these questions will remove the excuse

that they didn’t know how to tackle the project.

Another possibility is that you’re worried not about their technical but

their people skills. If you’re nervous that they’ll botch the stakeholder

relationships, make the interpersonal issues as salient as the technical

ones. Work together to map the key stakeholders, their stake in the

project, and any idiosyncrasies you might know. Who has sway over

the decision? What are they looking for? What inﬂuences them? And

beyond the decision makers and inﬂuencers, encourage the person

to think about other people with valuable perspectives they need to include. Answer these questions to avoid excuses about insuﬃcient

# support or ornery partners.

You can also mitigate capability gaps by contemplating the decisions

they might have to make and pre-qualifying the decision criteria. That

way, you can be more conﬁdent that they’ll make calls you’d endorse.

You can broach the subject in various ways, including asking about the

criteria the person will use to evaluate any decisions or trade-oﬀs. How

will they prioritize the criteria when there isn’t a perfect option? And

lest they get stuck trying to have it all, it’s helpful to clarify which

criteria should inﬂuence how they implement the decision but not

which decision they take.

When you agree on the process, you strip away many of the capability

# excuses.

# Raise the Stakes

We’ve discussed alignment and capability issues. The third possibility

for their failure is that they lack the motivation to get the job done. If

your loss of faith is associated with their lack of oomph, emphasize their

obligation and clarify what’s at stake if they fail to deliver.

You have both carrot and stick options if you need to add a little

incentive. Dangling the carrot would connect the successful delivery

of the work to a variety of positive outcomes, such as how it will aﬀect

their reputation or future opportunities. On the other hand, wielding

the stick entails listing negative ramiﬁcations if they don’t deliver. And

if possible, add some intrinsic rewards to those extrinsic consequences

by talking about what the person enjoys about this kind of work and

what reward they’d get from doing it well.

There’s one other motivation issue to prepare for; the person who starts

full of vim and vigor but throws up their hands at the ﬁrst hint of

adversity. In that case, your process should inoculate the person against

setbacks by preparing a plan B upfront. Spend some time anticipating

what could go wrong and creating a game plan. What issues do you

anticipate arising? How might they handle those types of problems? Be

sure to specify which circumstances warrant the person escalating to

you and which you’d expect them to tackle independently. Addressing

the contingencies and potential pitfalls will make it clear that you

expect the person to persevere.

When you articulate the consequences, you bolster the motivation.

If you’re managing a person who keeps letting you down and making

excuses for why it wasn’t their fault, don’t waste your energy hoping

they’ll miraculously become trustworthy. Instead, work through a

process that sets them up for success and removes the excuses in the

process. Then if the employee fails to deliver and falls back on the

“but, but, but…,” you’ve got all the fodder you need for a performance
