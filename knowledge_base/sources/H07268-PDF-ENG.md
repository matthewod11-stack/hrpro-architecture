There’s no escaping ofﬁce politics. It might get a bad rap, but the ability

to network, build relationships, and inﬂuence others is critical in any

workplace. Unfortunately, research has shown that all too often, oﬃce

politics is a white man’s game, as women and ethnic minorities often

have less powerful networks and beneﬁt less from engaging in politics

than their white, male counterparts do.

To make matters worse, attempts to address this inequity often focus

on “ﬁxing” the people who are excluded, encouraging them to develop

their political skills, get more comfortable with politics, or temper

their reactions, rather than acknowledging organizations’ roles in

creating cultures of toxic, non-inclusive oﬃce politics. Of course, there’s

## certainly a place for this well-intentioned advice for individuals — but

to make meaningful change, leaders must take action to foster more-

## inclusive cultures on an organizational level.

To explore what organizations can do to promote healthy oﬃce politics,

we conducted in-depth interviews with 40 mid-career ethnic minority

employees working in a wide range of industries across the UK. We

asked them to describe their experiences of politics at work, and

how their workplace environments inﬂuenced their own willingness to

engage in politics. We then used a statistical model to analyze their

responses and identify common proﬁles of more- and less-inclusive

# cultures.

Toxic cultures lead to disengagement from office politics

Unsurprisingly, many of the people we talked to shared extremely

negative experiences with oﬃce politics. They told us stories of feeling

excluded from informal relationships, being overlooked or pushed aside

by managers, and witnessing underhanded behavior from their peers.

One participant explained how it was “an impossible task to break into

those cliques and establish yourself.” Another vividly described the

brutality of their workplace, saying, “They’ll slit your throat in front

of you over there. They’ve got no issues about that.” Others recounted

times when they were scapegoated or stepped over: “I’d been sidelined

because [the managers] took the credit,” one participant recalled.

Our analysis also demonstrated that toxic oﬃce politics cultures can

be created and perpetuated at any level of the organization. One

participant described how their manager “started bringing his friends

in, so I got moved to a lower position,” while others described how

their peers “played the game” that was “all about trying to get the other

person down.”

In response to these toxic cultures, many of the people we talked to

disengaged from politics, keeping their heads down and redoubling their work eﬀorts rather than joining the political melee. For example,

one interviewee told us that participating in their workplace’s oﬃce

politics meant “you’re willing to bend the rules and you’re willing to

bully, you’re willing to step on people, and morally, to me, I don’t

agree with that, so I would not be part of that social club, so I haven’t

[progressed].” Another explained, “I didn’t get involved in the politics;

just did a good job and that was it.” Some even sought to leave their jobs

entirely: “I wasn’t conﬁdent I would succeed because of the cliquiness of

the organization,” a participant shared, “so I looked for jobs elsewhere.”

These reactions are understandable — but the problem with avoiding

the political arena is that it can lead employees to miss out on the vital

development opportunities and relationships they need to get things

done and advance their careers.

## Inclusive cultures foster participation in healthy office politics

The good news is, not everyone we interviewed experienced oﬃce

politics negatively. Some people shared stories of supportive cultures

in which managers proactively included minority employees in the types of political activity necessary to build relationships, be eﬀective

in their jobs, and advance in their organizations. For example, one

participant explained how their boss “ensured that [career growth]

was made easier, because she had done the engaging with all the

right stakeholders beforehand.” Managers in these workplaces actively

nurtured employees, leveraging politics to build connections rather

than keep people down: “Well, I wouldn’t like to use the word

politics,” another participant reﬂected. “It’s more like having a proper

and professional relationship with the people in authority; [they]

understand where I’m coming from [and] appreciate me for who I

am.” Other employees shared experiences in which both peers and

managers used their clout to stand up for them or provide them with

developmental opportunities: “There’s something about having the

right support…I’ve been put forward for things and people have thought

of me.”

Rather than feeling slimy or underhanded, politics in these

organizations were openly acknowledged and even taught to

newcomers. “You need to make sure that you’ve got supporters

within the organization and that you know how to network well,” an

interviewee explained, “and that’s sort of drilled home from a very early

point once you join.” Similarly, others described workplaces in which an

explicit “focus on involvement in relationships and connectivity [was]

ingrained in the culture of the ﬁrm” in a way that was helpful and

# inclusive.

As a result of this approach, employees in these environments felt more

comfortable engaging in politics. One worker shared that they used to

hesitate to participate in oﬃce politics, but after experiencing a more

supportive organizational climate, they became “a bit more political

in the way I interact with people and recognizing that it’s not just

about how well you do your work…it’s about how you go about doing

it.” Another described a newfound appreciation for a bit of healthy self-

promotion, recognizing that “you do need to get yourself known and

recognized by people in a position to help you.”

Of course, building an inclusive culture is easier said than done — but

it is possible. Through both our interviews and our broader research

on politics, leadership, and inclusion, we’ve identiﬁed ﬁve strategies to

help organizations foster healthier oﬃce politics cultures, in which all

employees are nurtured and supported:

- 1. Be transparent.

Talking about politics can be uncomfortable — but failing to do so

only beneﬁts those who already have easy access to the political

arena. To ensure that all employees are included, it’s critical to be

## transparent about both the existence and the importance of politics.

Leaders, managers, and employees at every level should be encouraged

to talk openly about the value of building connections, and to

make the informal practices of oﬃce politics visible through explicit onboarding processes, mentoring (both by peers and senior staﬀ), talent

## development programs, employee aﬃnity groups, and other initiatives.

In addition, as remote and hybrid work become the norm, it’s important

to consider where and how informal connections occur in online spaces,

and make sure that all employees are aware of and have access to these

# structures as well.

- 2. Ensure access to informal career development resources.

Many organizations aim to foster diversity and inclusion through

formal talent development programs. However, this approach doesn’t

help when it comes to the informal, unoﬃcial interactions that drive

oﬃce politics. Indeed, in our prior research, we found that successful

career growth requires a mix of both formal and informal resources,

and minority employees typically have less access to vital informal

resources. To close this gap, organizations should provide mechanisms

such as mentorship, sponsorship, and support networks to ensure

women and ethnic minority employees have access not only to formal

## professional development tools, but also to the informal processes that

are critical for growth.

- 3. Reframe politics positively.

In our interviews, we repeatedly heard from employees that they felt

it would be distasteful, perhaps even morally repugnant, to engage in

oﬃce politics. This assumption — that politics are, at best, a necessary

evil — can be deeply ingrained, especially among people who are used

to being left on the outside. But it is also an assumption that can be

challenged: Our prior research found that people’s views on politics

can change signiﬁcantly as a result of their professional experience. As

such, leaders should explicitly push back against the view that politics

can only be used for self-gain, and instead reframe it as a tool that

can help everyone build connections, access opportunities, and get

things done. This means ﬁnding ways to highlight the value of political

## behaviors such as negotiation, inﬂuencing, and relationship-building

at every level of the organization, as well as including political skills

alongside other core competencies that are prioritized in professional

# development programs.

- 4. Leverage politics to drive inclusion.

All too often, politics are seen as a system that’s designed to keep

power with those who have it, and exclude those who don’t. But what

if we instead used politics to disrupt entrenched inequalities? There’s

no denying that managers play a key role in gatekeeping the political

arena, but that also means they’re in the perfect position to encourage

fairness rather than favoritism. Organizations should train managers

## and senior leaders to share their political know-how and leverage

their political power across racial and gender lines. For instance, well-

respected sponsors can be encouraged to get involved in leadership

development programs speciﬁcally designed to support women and

ethnic minority employees. This both improves employees’ access to

senior leaders’ networks, and helps the sponsors better understand the barriers diﬀerent employees face. They can then use these insights

(alongside their political savvy) to advocate for their proteges and come up with more-eﬀective strategies to address obstacles facing employees

# across the organization.

- 5. Share success stories.

It’s easy to look past the details of the journey once someone has

made it to the top. To normalize politics as a typical component

## of a professional success story, organizations should formally and

informally encourage employees who have “made it” to share their

stories — and emphasize examples of times when they beneﬁted from

a helping hand, or leveraged inside information and relationships to get ahead or be more eﬀective in their roles. Publicly sharing these

experiences helps employees at any level envision a path forward for

themselves in which politics plays a positive role.

Oﬃce politics has long served as a mechanism for exclusion — but it

doesn’t have to. While the negative impact of toxic politics on ethnic

minorities and women in the workplace is well known, our research

shows that it is possible to build inclusive political cultures, in which

politics are instead leveraged for common good. With a thoughtful,

inclusive approach, organizations can help all their employees engage

and reap the beneﬁts of oﬃce politics.
