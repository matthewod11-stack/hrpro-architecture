In recent years many companies have become sensitized to the value

of diversity, equity, and inclusion. But in most organizations, DEI

initiatives focus largely on gender and ethnicity. A group that has

received less attention is people with disabilities, and that has led to

disparities in the workplace. In the United Kingdom, for example, the

employment rate for people with some form of disability (who make up

20% of the working-age population) is just 53%, far less than the 81%

# rate for people without disabilities.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Disability as a Source of Competitive Advantage

Employing people with disabilities is usually seen as a social cause—

one best suited to organizations that are not-for-proﬁt or in the public

sector. That is a mistake—and more important, a missed opportunity. In

many industries innovative companies are showing that the inclusion

of people with disabilities can lead to real competitive advantage and

# long-term proﬁtability.

Our research suggests that having employees with disabilities in its

workforce can build a ﬁrm’s competitive advantage in four ways:

(1) Disabilities often confer unique talents that make people better at

## particular jobs; (2) the presence of employees with disabilities elevates

the culture of the entire organization, making it more collaborative

and boosting productivity; (3) a reputation for inclusiveness enhances

a ﬁrm’s value proposition with customers, who become more willing to

build long-term relationships with the company; (4) being recognized as

socially responsible gives a ﬁrm an edge in the competition for capital

# and talent.

Let’s look at each of these advantages in turn.

# Special Abilities

Distinctive or unusual skills frequently go hand in hand with

disabilities. For instance, academics who study autism, notably

Cambridge University’s Simon Baron-Cohen, have found strong links

between autism and aptitude at tasks requiring attention to detail.

## Managers at the international IT consultancy Auticon, which oﬀers

## quality assurance and testing, report that their autistic consultants

are often especially adept at recognizing patterns, which makes them

better than others at seeing correlations and interdependencies in large

amounts of data. Moreover, they can often stay focused for unusually

long periods of time, even when doing work that is routine and

# repetitive.

Famously, the British intelligence service enlisted Alan Turing, who

as one study concluded was most likely on the autism spectrum, to

help crack the code produced by the German Enigma machine during

the Second World War. A brilliant mathematician who was generally

considered the founding father of computer science, Turing later would

become one of the pioneers of artiﬁcial intelligence.

Recently major corporations like SAP, HP, and EY have been

recruiting neurodiverse employees for speciﬁc tasks like quality control,

cybersecurity, and code checking. And the British intelligence service

still hires them too: Its Government Communications Headquarters

unit enlists relatively large numbers of people with dyslexia to analyze

surveillance data, because they’re unusually good at spotting anomalies

that others miss.

Dyslexia and autism aren’t the only disabilities linked with special

talents. Consider the Gran Estación shopping mall, in Bogotá, Colombia,

which employs many people with physical disabilities in a variety

of roles—for example, customer relations. People who want to meet

with someone in customer service are often upset and angry. Disabled

employees seem better able to defuse such emotions, according to

the mall’s general manager. One customer service rep who was in a

wheelchair told us, “As soon as they see me come in, they calm down.”

Her disability has proved to be an advantage in her line of work.

In some jobs aspects of a person’s disability may actually be a good ﬁt

with the tasks at hand. At Gran Estación the team working in elevator

shafts, which often can be very noisy, consists largely of deaf people.

The mall outsources security to a company called Seguridad Burns

de Colombia (now part of the multinational Securitas), which hires disabled people to work as security oﬃcers. A common problem at the

mall is pickpocketing, particularly when it’s crowded. As the managers

at Gran Estación explained to us, guards in wheelchairs are signiﬁcantly

better at spotting these crimes because they have better visibility at

pocket height. What’s more, when they need to rush to a scene or chase

a perpetrator, they can move faster than people on foot, and many have

superior upper body strength, which helps them restrain thieves. Since

2007, Securitas has been introducing the concept of wheelchair security

## guards at many customers across Latin America.

HBR commissioned the team from La Casa de Carlota, Barcelona, to create the illustrations for this article. The group’s work process begins with chaotic brainstorming among creatives with intellectual disabilities, design professionals, illustrators, and design school students. Little by little illustrations emerge that blend artfully with one another.

Examples abound of companies around the globe seeking out people

with disabilities for speciﬁc tasks. In Spain, for instance, the design

studio La Casa de Carlota puts people with intellectual disabilities, such

as Down syndrome, and with autism on all its project teams because, as

its creative director says, “these guys create details that are completely

## authentic and original.” The private health insurance company DKV

employs only people with disabilities in its DKV Integralia call center

because it found that satisfaction was much higher among customers

helped by employees with disabilities—even though the callers didn’t

know they were talking with disabled people. The center’s general

manager says these employees “show exceptional levels of empathy and

try to solve the problem as if they were helping someone from their

own family.” The point is not that a disability is always an advantage

## but that with various types of jobs—probably more than most employers

realize—certain types of disability may suit the work requirements.

# Organizational Culture

In many companies we studied, employees consistently told us that

working with disabled people fostered a more collaborative culture. Not

only is such a culture a recognized source of competitive advantage, but it’s also diﬃcult for rivals to imitate, which is why many businesses

invest considerable resources and eﬀort in trying to build one.

The challenge in nurturing a sense of community is overcoming

people’s tendency to compete for status and recognition. Employing

people with disabilities, however, can mitigate it. Because they may

need active support and assistance with certain things, working with

them can inspire their colleagues to develop more-cooperative habits

and attitudes. Employees at the La Trappe brewery in the Netherlands,

which hires people with disabilities for its production and hospitality

teams, explained to us that having disabled colleagues made them

realize the importance of helping one another out and being aware of

one another’s needs and abilities. In addition, it let them see that it’s

acceptable and even desirable to ask for help themselves. “It gives us

something special in the workplace,” the former chief executive of the

brewery, Thijs Thijssen, told us.

To investigate whether employers of people with disabilities in general

saw a positive eﬀect on their cultures, we worked with AESE, the

Spanish Association of Supported Employment, which helps people

with disabilities ﬁnd and maintain jobs. Through it, we surveyed HR

executives at 57 companies that had hired one or more people with

## disabilities about their experiences with those workers and about the

eﬀect they had on the organization as a whole. No fewer than 88% of

the HR professionals agreed that the internal culture of their ﬁrms had

improved signiﬁcantly since they had hired employees with disabilities

# (with 70% in strong agreement).

We then decided to dig a bit deeper into

# what that positive cultural change

involved. We provided the HR executives

## with a deﬁnition of psychological safety, a

concept developed by Harvard Business

# School professor Amy Edmondson: the

belief that within a team, people can ask for

## help and share ideas, concerns, or feelings

without risk of suﬀering adverse

# La Casa de Carlota

consequences, like being punished or

humiliated.

When we asked the HR professionals about changes in psychological

safety at their ﬁrms, 65% indicated that it had increased since the hiring

of employees with disabilities. What’s more, 74% observed that their

teams had begun to work better together, and 75% indicated that the

hires had enhanced the general atmosphere in their organization. One

respondent commented that having a disabled colleague on a team

“immediately improves team cohesion and creates new routines for

collaboration.” Another said, “Ever since a person with an intellectual

disability started working in the company, all of us have behaved in a

more humane way.”

Our case studies also suggest that colleagues of people with disabilities

don’t learn just to be more accepting of one another’s limitations. Seeing

coworkers with disabilities succeed can inspire other employees and

make them realize that they, too, can elevate their performance. The

HR director of Gran Estación observes, “The person who is next to

the person with a disability gets motivated because he realizes that if someone with diﬃculties has such good performance, then someone

who hasn’t got them also should be able to deliver it.”

## All of this results in high levels of employee engagement. Thijssen

told us that La Trappe’s employee attrition rate and absenteeism had

fallen to all-time lows. People didn’t want to leave the company and

hardly ever called in sick. Other companies in our study had similar

experiences: Twenty of the 57 ﬁrms that we surveyed reported a decline

in absenteeism after their companies had started hiring people with

# disabilities.

# Market Appeal

The employment of disabled people can be a signiﬁcant part of

a company’s value proposition to customers. Consider the large,

successful Dutch coﬀee chain Brownies&downies (B&D). It oﬀers high-

## quality hot beverages and sandwiches at competitive prices in prime

locations, just like its rivals Bagels & Beans and Starbucks. Yet there is

one diﬀerence: Many of B&D’s employees have Down syndrome.

That diﬀerence deﬁnes the company’s marketing strategy. B&D avoids high-traﬃc locations, like train stations and business districts, where

many customers just want a quick coﬀee. Instead it focuses on places

where people can sit down quietly and relax. Having people with

disabilities prepare and serve the products may at times make the

service a little slower, but it is one of the reasons some customers like

to visit the chain. Indeed, we know from research that customers value

not just the content of a product and its functionality but also how it is

produced and by whom.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Disability as a Source of Competitive Advantage

Distinctive skills frequently go hand in hand with disabilities. For instance, academics have found strong links between autism and aptitude at tasks requiring attention to detail.

To further explore how people with disabilities help ﬁrms strengthen

their appeal, we set up a series of experiments, enlisting 200 individuals

as participants. Half of them were asked to consider purchasing a

customized mug online from a company that had received high ratings

from its customers. The other half were asked the same thing but were

also told that the company employed many people with disabilities. We

then analyzed people’s willingness to pay for the mug.

The fact that the company employed people with disabilities by itself

didn’t increase people’s inclination to pay more for the mug. So we

repeated the experiment with another group of 200 participants, who

were asked to consider buying an engraved necklace. We found much

the same result: The participants weren’t willing to pay more (or less)

for something that was produced by a company that employed disabled

people. They also didn’t rate the quality of the product any higher.

However, in both cases we also tested for general attitudes toward the

company: Did people feel they liked the company? Did they perceive

what in marketing is called a “communal relationship” with it, in the

sense that they would like to see the company succeed, felt happy if it

performed well, and were willing to actively support it? If the company

employed people with disabilities, the answer was yes: Customers were

signiﬁcantly more likely to engage in a communal relationship with it

than they were with a company in the control group.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Disability as a Source of Competitive Advantage

Interestingly, our results clearly indicated that people’s willingness to

pay was signiﬁcantly higher for a company that they liked and felt a

communal relationship with. So even though customers are not willing

to pay more for a product or a service just because the seller employs

people with disabilities—there is not a simple direct relationship—

they are willing to pay more for a product or service if they feel a

psychological bond with a company. And that bond is much more likely

to form if a ﬁrm is known to have disabled employees. Thus, there

is a strong indirect positive eﬀect on people’s willingness to pay for a

product or service. We also found some indication that customers would

be more likely to make repeat purchases from the company.

# In another follow-up experiment—this

time analyzing 177 new respondents’

inclination to buy and willingness to pay

more for a backpack—we examined why

people feel a stronger relationship with a

company that employs people with

disabilities. Analyzing diﬀerent potential

motives, we found that it’s because they

perceive such a company to be more fair

## (for example, in its pricing) and because

# La Casa de Carlota

they feel that they’re being helpful

themselves by purchasing its product or

service. It made them feel good about

themselves, which can be a powerful and persuasive addition to any

ﬁrm’s value proposition. So the general attitude of the public toward a

company becomes more positive and supportive if it employs people

with disabilities, which down the line signiﬁcantly enhances the

inclination to purchase from it, become a long-term customer, and pay

# more for its oﬀering.

## A related study by David Dwertmann of Rutgers University and several

colleagues also points to positive connections. When they analyzed

## the attitudes of customers in a group of supermarkets in Lithuania

who had been served by workers who were in wheelchairs or had a

hearing impairment, they found that employing people with disabilities

enhanced the reputation of the ﬁrm, making it viewed as more socially

# responsible.

These ﬁndings, however, do present some challenges for companies.

If people value how something is produced and by whom, it implies

that the company needs to show and communicate to customers about

whom it employs. With a coﬀee chain, that’s easy because the servers

can be directly observed by customers. But with, for example, a factory,

it will require a lot more thought.

Take the successful Spanish cooperative La Fageda, which runs a

dairy farm and a gardening business and is well-known for its high-

quality yogurt. It employs several hundred people who have intellectual

## disabilities or suﬀer from mental illness (many of whom might

otherwise be in psychiatric hospitals), paying them standard salaries.

By buying the cooperative’s products and services, customers will

help these people have productive and meaningful lives. However,

supermarket consumers may not know about La Fageda’s workers.

To address that problem, the cooperative opened a visitors’ center,

which, given its location in an area of natural beauty, attracts more

than 40,000 visitors a year. “That is the best marketing we have,”

commented founder Cristóbal Colón. “People go away not just liking

the yogurt but also—after seeing the forest, the cows listening to their

music, and the workers doing their jobs—as apostles.” People develop

## an emotional connection with the La Fageda brand.

Seeing coworkers with disabilities succeed can inspire other employees to realize that they, too, can elevate their performance.

Similarly, La Trappe, which is located on the grounds of a Trappist

monastery, opened a tasting room on its premises that attracts more

than 125,000 visitors a year. When they tour the brewery and taste its

beer, they see the employees with disabilities at work. As La Trappe’s

marketing director explained to us, “They become real fans and tell all

their friends and family about it.”

Employing people with disabilities isn’t a substitute for good products

or ﬁne customer service, but it adds another dimension to a company’s

value proposition, which can help diﬀerentiate it in a crowded market.

It’s important, though, to be genuine about it rather than, for instance,

## recruit only a small number of employees with disabilities for PR

purposes. If customers sense that the practice is not genuine and not

really spread throughout the ﬁrm, it may not only be ineﬀective but

even backﬁre: It could make them feel angry and manipulated and

perceive the company as being exploitative rather than benevolent.

When hiring people with disabilities is implemented sincerely, however,

it can generate another positive knock-on eﬀect: attracting customers

with disabilities and their family members, who form a considerable

economic segment themselves. The managers of Gran Estación noticed

that once they started hiring more people with disabilities, particularly

## in visible functions such as security and information services, the

number of disabled customers began to increase substantially. We

ourselves have observed many families with disabled children in

the mall. According to Andrea Hernandez, its coordinator of human

resources, this is because they feel more at home in Gran Estación,

which also makes them more likely to be return customers.

# Access to Capital and Talent

Hiring people with disabilities can give companies an advantage

with key stakeholders besides customers. Take the market for capital:

Investing that targets ventures focused on environmental, social, and

governance (ESG) issues has increased rapidly in the past several years.

Bloomberg estimates that ESG-related assets topped $41 trillion in 2022

and will reach $50 trillion by 2025. According to CNBC, the assets of

impact-investing index funds quadrupled from 2017 to 2020 and now

compose 20% of the U.S. market. Employing people with disabilities

makes a company more attractive to such investors.

In Europe venture capitalists have started taking ESG factors into

account in their investment decisions, and a growing number of

social impact funds are looking to put considerable sums into socially

responsible start-ups. Employee diversity is an increasingly relevant

consideration in those decisions. The European Venture Philanthropy

Association, for example, reported in its “Investing for Impact Survey”

that 36% of the investment focus of beneﬁciaries related to people with

# disabilities.

People with disabilities also are an untapped source of talent. They

may not always be very skilled at the traditional process of ﬁnding and

applying for jobs or at interviewing, but those skills may not correlate at

all with the requirements of the jobs involved.

We know from research that customers value not just the content of a product and its functionality but also how it is produced and by whom.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Disability as a Source of Competitive Advantage

Prejudice often deters employers from hiring people with disabilities,

but that means it’s easier for more-enlightened companies to snap

up highly skilled people. In the United Kingdom, for example, high

school graduates with disabilities are no more likely to have a job

than people who left school before graduating—suggesting that there

are many qualiﬁed disabled people available for employment. Auticon,

for instance, has hired several with STEM PhDs for data science and

analytics jobs who at the time were working as couriers and delivering

# pizza.

Moreover, hiring people with disabilities makes a company more likely

to be seen as an attractive employer for people without disabilities. We

saw this in an experiment we ran, which involved a simulated potential

## employer, a global ﬁrm with about 3,000 employees in ﬁnancial

services. We provided information on the company to 200 respondents

(who were diﬀerent from those in our previous experiments). With half

of them, we mentioned that the ﬁrm had employees with a disability,

but with the other half we did not.

The results revealed that if a considerable proportion of employees at

the company had a disability, job seekers liked the company much

more, were substantially more interested in working for it, and thought

they would simply be happier there. They even indicated that they

would be willing to forgo a higher salary from another ﬁrm to join

the company. That corroborates prior ﬁndings that having a positive

impact on society is increasingly critical in the labor market. Recent

surveys—by Gallup and Deloitte, for instance—consistently indicate

that, particularly for Millennials, whether a company behaves in a

socially responsible manner is an important criterion in choosing an

# employer.

Like employees and investors, other stakeholders— such as advertisers,

## unions, and alliance partners—are likely to value the employment of

people with disabilities. For instance, it helps the coﬀee chain B&D

# attract franchisees.

Employing people with disabilities is a worthy cause. But portraying it

as such masks the fact that it can deliver real beneﬁts to organizations.

When Andrea Girlanda, the CEO of Auticon, sent his customary note

thanking one of the ﬁrm’s large clients (the head of data analytics at

a multinational pharmaceutical company) for making a diﬀerence in

the lives of disabled people, he received a swift but concise reply: “Stop

thanking me; I am not doing this from the kindness of my heart. Your

consultants are great; we are doing things so much better than before.”

The creative director of La Casa de Carlota holds a similar view. “Lots of

people think that we are being kind by working with people who have

autism or Down syndrome, but I don’t feel I’m being kind; I feel I’m

being clever!” the director says. “I’m tapping into their unique form of

creativity, which hasn’t been used to its full potential in the creative

industries up till now.” There is nothing wrong with wanting to do good

in the world, but there is also nothing wrong with wanting to do well,

and the latter is enough reason to employ people with disabilities.
