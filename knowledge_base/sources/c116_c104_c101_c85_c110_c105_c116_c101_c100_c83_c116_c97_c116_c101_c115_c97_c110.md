Paying Workers or Paying Lawyers: Employee Termination Practices in the United States and Canada*

# LAURA BETH NIELSEN

This article explores one multinational corporation's employee termination practices in the United States and Canada. There are fairly insignificant differences in employees' legal protections in the two countries and the company claims a uniform corporate employee termination process cross-nationally. However, there are major structural and procedural differences in the employee termination process. The differences, including the way attorneys are utilized, the use of quasi-legal personnel to comply with regulatory requirements, and the substance of the severance package are explored. In the United States money is directed toward legal professionals ± ``paying lawyers'' while in Canada expenses associated with employee termination go to severance packages ± ``paying workers.''

# I. INTRODUCTION AND OVERVIEW

In all economically developed democracies, the trend this century has been theory of employment-at-will. The to temper the traditional employment-at-will doctrine holds that, absent a written contract or collective bargaining agreement, an employer may terminate an employee at any time for any legal reason or for no reason, just as an employee may choose to quit (Adair v United States 1908). Employment-at-will eroded as countries began to provide legal protections against arbitrary dismissal and

discriminatory firing, and, in some cases, imposed requirements of due process, notice, and severance pay. There are significant legal differences across nations, however. Most European states and Canada emphasize guarantees of continued employment. The United States, in contrast, gives priority to the employer's interest in efficiency and the fluidity of markets while at the same time providing strong legal protection against termination based on race, gender, age, or disability. Moreover, national legal systems vary in whether employee rights are protected by courts or administrative bodies.

Some large domestic corporations offer stronger guarantees against arbitrary dismissal than are required by law, and some multinational companies pride themselves on implementing similar personnel practices regardless of the law of the host countries. That is the corporate practice of ``PCO,''1 a major multinational pharmaceutical company with operations in more than twenty countries. This case study examines whether and how differences in national legal regimes affect actual corporate personnel practices, using PCO's United States and Canadian operations as an object of inquiry.

legalism'' hypothesis. Adversarial legalism is the idea that the American legal and regulatory style is uniquely legalistic, adversarial, and expensive (Kagan 1991, 1997; Kagan & Axelrad 1997). This case study focuses on one multinational corporation that conducts parallel business operations in the United States and Canada, another economically advanced democracy. By ``holding constant'' the business activity, this study seeks to discern the extent and importance of differences in national legal rules and processes. There exists a large body of cross-national studies of particular legal processes that indicate that U.S. legal and regulatory processes, when compared to other economically advanced democracies, more often involve adversarial legal conflict, strong legal sanctions, and higher levels of legal uncertainty, but none focuses specifically on the United States and Canada in the employment law context (Church, Nakamura & McMahon 1993; Noah 1993). Additionally, there is speculation in the popular press that the rising cost of doing business in the United States has or will force companies to move operations outside the United States to avoid these costs. An empirical examination of these costs is important for this debate.

PCO Canada employs 525 people, and PCO U.S. employs about 9,500 people. In both countries, the work force of PCO consists mainly of white collar workers whose major tasks include sales, marketing, manufacturing, research, and development. PCO has no unionized employees in either country due to the ``informal'' policy about labor unions: jobs performed by people in occupations traditionally dominated by strong labor unions are contracted out in both countries. In both countries, women slightly outnumber their male counterparts and are well represented even in top management positions. There is some difference in the racial composition of

the work force in the two countries although it is not as great as one might expect. In Canada, 12.3 percent of PCO employees are ``visible minorities'' as opposed to about 18 percent racial minorities in PCO U.S.

In the course of the research, we conducted thirty-two interviews with PCO's human resources staff in both the United States and Canada as well as the corporate officials involved with termination, including the affirma- tive action officers, the legal departments, and human resources managers in most of the regional offices.2 In Canada, we were able to read the personnel files of all the employees who left PCO over a two-year period. In the United States, we did not have access to these files, but we were provided summary figures and quantitative estimates that correspond to the results generated by the analysis of the Canadian employment files.

Some scholars have argued that the liberal theory of employment-at-will has been slowly eroded by common law and statutory developments, but the United States retains the employment-at-will presumption for private sector, nonunionized employees working without an employment contract. Canada, in the European tradition that emphasizes continuity of employ- ment, provides greater common law protection to employees in that country, requiring that an employee receive reasonable notice prior to termination unless ``just cause'' for immediate dismissal is shown (Mole 1990; Arthurs, et al. 1993). There are various exceptions to the common law standards in both countries. For example, in the United States, employees are protected by the employee manual which creates an obligation on the part of the employer. In Toussaint v Blue Cross & Blue Shield (1980), the Supreme Court declared that employee manuals and oral statements made by employers can create exceptions to the common law presumption of employment-at-will because they are considered contracts that the employer is obliged to follow.

Additionally, in both countries, statutes protect employees against dis- crimination on the basis of race, gender, age, and disability, although PCO's experience suggests that claims based on these causes of action are much less frequent in Canada. A further example of greater protections afforded Canadian workers includes statutory protection from discrimination on grounds of sexual orientation in a number of provinces including Ontario.3 Finally, the much higher rate of unionization in Canada provides increased protection for workers not shared by their American counterparts.

An employee has three options when forced to separate, or is terminated, from PCO. She can: (1) leave PCO without contesting the termination; (2) contest the termination in some way that does not include filing a lawsuit; or (3) contest the termination by filing a lawsuit. Given the different common law presumptions in the two countries, one might construct two opposing hypotheses. First, considering the greater breadth of protections in Canada, an observer might expect a very low level of termination disputing. Or, considering the somewhat broader legal protections for Canadian employees, one might expect that PCO Canada would experience more legal

disputes and lawsuits when it fires employees. PCO corporate data show that there is much less post-termination disputing, including lawsuits, in Canada. As Table 1 shows, of employees who were terminated in Canada in the 1995 fiscal year, 71 percent raised no dispute with PCO after the termination. In the United States, only 39 percent of those terminated left without disputing the firing. On the other end of the spectrum, there are terminated employees who contest their termination by filing a lawsuit. Of terminated employees, 7 percent of Canadians eventually filed a lawsuit, while 23 percent in the United States filed a lawsuit.4 In the middle of the dispute spectrum, there are those employees who contest their termi- nation in some way without a lawsuit. This ``mid-level'' disputing ranges from simply writing a letter contesting a severance package or contesting the termination itself to hiring an attorney to do the same. In Canada, 22 percent of those who were fired engaged in some level of posttermination disputing that fell short of actually filing a lawsuit. In the United States, on the other hand, 38 percent of those terminated engaged in some sort of posttermination disputing that did not culminate in a lawsuit (personal interviews).

In the years studied, not a single terminated employee won a lawsuit against PCO in either country. Even more striking, PCO has not lost a post-termination lawsuit in either country ± ever. Despite this point of similarity, the cross-national differences in disputing rates are worth noting, not just because they are so great but also because they are inversely related to the strength with which the two countries protect employees' right to continuity of employment.

PCO U.S. and PCO Canada termination procedures varied in notice- able ways, at both the structural level in the organization of the human resources department and at the procedural level in terms of the day-to-day decision making regarding termination. We found that PCO has more deeply entrenched bureaucratic structures within PCO U.S. to process legal claims. These differences between PCO U.S. and PCO Canada are due to a number of factors. First, PCO U.S. employees have access to a greater variety of legal claims. Thus, PCO U.S. officials face greater legal un- certainty than their Canadian counterparts regarding the source of a termination claim. Moreover, the employee in the United States who makes a wrongful termination claim has more potent legal remedies available to her.

Although it is difficult to estimate precisely how much PCO spends on the termination process in each country, it seems clear that U.S. prelitigation and litigation processes are generally more expensive for PCO. Not only does PCO U.S. spend more money on the termination process, but the money spent is channeled largely to legal and quasi-legal professionals while the expenditures made by PCO Canada go toward providing severance packages and services to the terminated Canadian employee. PCO Canada pays workers while PCO U.S. pays lawyers.

## II. PERSONNEL TERMINATION AT PCO: THE ROLE OF CORPORATE

# CULTURE AND ``HUMAN RESOURCES'' POLICY

Notwithstanding differences in law, PCO has sought to create personnel policies and termination procedures that are the same in the United States and Canada. PCO's strategy is to provide guarantees against arbitrary or discriminatory treatment that go beyond those required by the law in either country. PCO's human resources policy exemplifies the decline of employ- ment-at-will as an operative corporate policy in the United States and Canada.

# A. NATIONAL DIFFERENCES IN LAW

Cross-national legal differences relating to employee termination law may be roughly divided into three categories. First, there are differences in substantive law of all sorts ± common law, statutory law, and regulatory requirements. Another category of legal differences relates to the institu- tional and procedural features of the different national legal systems. Third, there are economic differences associated with lawsuits, including attorneys' fees and typical awards for successful wrongful termination cases.

- 1. Substantive Law

The most striking difference in substantive law between the two countries is that unqualified employment-at-will has never been the law in Canada for employees with contracts of indefinite duration as is the case for most of

# 252 LAW & POLICY July 1999

PCO's employees (Arthurs et al. 1993:146). At the most general level, Canada follows the European model of providing a higher threshold of protection from termination for all workers. In Canada, the employment-at- will doctrine does not prevail; the common law presumption in that country is reasonable notice prior to termination, unless the employer has ``just cause'' to terminate an employee. This suggests that Canadian employers might be more vulnerable to unjust dismissal lawsuits than their American counterparts ± at least in theory. Although the common law rule difference between the two countries hardly reflects the entire law, due to the rise of statutory and regulatory rules surrounding termination, this basic difference reflects the variant traditions regarding employment in the two countries.

In Canada, employees terminated without just cause are entitled to receive ``reasonable notice'' which can take the form of either actual notice or monetary compensation in lieu thereof. The reasonable notice standard is a common law protection that is not terribly precise because it requires judicial interpretation and can be overridden for a number of reasons such as a valid contractual term of employment, or if the employee's performance or conduct constitute ``just cause'' for dismissal. Statutory entitlement to ``termination'' or ``severance'' payments, on the other hand, are less vague but the guidelines embodied in statue are not terribly helpful due to the evolving common law doctrine that typically provides well above the proscribed minimum especially for senior level employees (ibid.:147). As a practical matter, there exist publications that provide guidelines for notice based on factors such as type of job, years of service, future employability of the terminated worker (see, e.g., Mole 1990). Despite the complexities of the interrelationship between common law protections and statutory mini- mums, which introduce a certain indeterminacy in the Canadian context, in the American private sector, there is no equivalent general protection for employees.

In contrast, in the United States, the trend has been to allow companies to define workers out of employee status by labeling them ``independent contractors,'' thus circumventing what is legally required in an employment relationship. Thus, U.S. law is less comprehensive and less protective of workers, and more protective of employer autonomy. To be sure, piecemeal statutory, common law, and regulatory protections have arisen which, departing from the common law presumption of employment-at-will, provide increased protection for many employees in the United States under antidiscrimination statutes. For example, in the area of regulatory protections, over 70 percent of the total U.S. work force ± including minorities, women, older, and disabled workers ± is ``protected'' as defined by the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) (Donohue & Siegelman 1991).

Some legal scholars even argue that the employment-at-will standard no longer exists in the United States (Glendon & Lev 1979), since it has been eroded both by common law developments and statutory employee pro-

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 253

tections. Three major common law protections arose during the twentieth century in the United States. First, the employment-at-will presumption is weakened by the public policy exception, which limits the employer's right to discharge an employee for reasons that violate public policy. This excep- tion was established in Petermann v International Brotherhood of Teamsters (1959) which held that an employer cannot terminate an employee for failing to commit perjury at his employer's direction. Second, in Monge v Beebe Rubber Co. (1974), the Supreme Court created an exception for violation of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing. In that case, the court held that an employer may not discharge an employee for failing to go on a date with her employer. The final common law exception to the employ- ment-at-will presumption was established in Toussaint (1980).

Moreover, statutory protections have eroded the employment-at-will presumption in the United States, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Americans with Disabilities Act, and the Pregnancy Discrimination Act. Additionally, government workers protected by civil service legislation are entitled to continued employment absent just cause for dismissal. Collective bargaining agreements provide the same for many unionized employees in the private sector.

Despite many similarities in legal regimes, it seems clear that Canadian employees enjoy somewhat greater legal protections from arbitrary treat- ment than do their American counterparts. The somewhat more favorable common law tradition as well as the greater statutory protections demon- strate this. In addition to the formal laws that protect employees in the two countries, many large corporations, like PCO, include guarantees of due process in their employee manuals, bringing employees certain protections via the contract exception to employment-at-will.

Although PCO has no unionized employees in either country, it is worth noting that there is a much higher rate of union organization and union strength in Canada. PCO Canada officials are no doubt aware of the environment in which they operate that may result in greater employee protection, but it would be difficult to measure how the generalized threat of unionization affects the actual day-to-day practices of PCO officials.

- 2. Legal Institutions and Mobilization of Law

Numerous factors go into the decision of a disgruntled employee about whether or not to pursue any legal claim arising from a dispute regarding a termination. The employee's age, education, and prior encounters with legal disputes are probably factors that influence her decision to invoke or ``mobilize the law'' (Bumiller 1988). Another factor that may explain the relative lack of legal mobilization in Canada is the availability of social services (Thomas 1991). Thomas argues that widely available health insurance and disability compensation in Canada makes litigation optional in products liability cases. The same may be true for employee termination

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 254 LAW & POLICY July 1999

cases ± in Canada the presence of a secure social safety net provides stability for terminated employees, thus making litigation more an option than an economic necessity.

In addition to these factors, there are a number of cross-national legal and institutional differences between the United States and Canada that affect an employee's decision to mobilize the legal system for redress. Institutional arrangements make it easier for U.S. employees to take legal action to vindicate their claims under the law, and encourage them to take legal action even if it is unclear whether or not their rights have been violated.

There are four legal institutions or rules that provide disincentives for Canadian employees to pursue their wrongful termination actions that are not faced by their U.S. counterparts. In other words, these four legal institutions make it more difficult for PCO Canada employees to mobilize the law. First, rules about lawyer compensation arrangements or ``counsel fees'' allow greater flexibility and therefore greater access to legal assistance for U.S. employees. Second, in the United States, government agencies make certain causes of action easier for U.S. employees to pursue, though those agencies suffer certain problems that will be examined as well. Third, the nature of damage awards in the two countries provides greater incentives for U.S. employees to pursue legal action. Finally, the method of recovery for employees in Canada is burdensome.

# (a) Counsel's Fees

Lawyer compensation arrangements affect employees' ability to mobilize the law to redress their termination grievances. In the United States, lawyers can and do take cases on a contingency fee basis, whereby an attorney charges a client nothing at the beginning of a lawsuit but agrees to take a percentage of an award if and only if one is granted. A typical U.S. attorney's contingency fee is about 40 percent, making the attorney's fee, if the suit is successful, large enough for many U.S. attorneys to take chances on weak cases. Although most Canadian provinces allow some form of the contingency fee system, Ontario prohibits these lawyer compensation arrangements (Solicitors Act 1980). Because the majority of PCO Canada employees work and live in Ontario and because PCO Canada's corporate headquarters are located there, Ontario is the province with which PCO Canada is most concerned. Thus, many terminated PCO U.S. employees have a low-cost or no-cost way to pursue legal action that is not available to the majority of PCO Canada employees.

The ``loser pays'' system of awarding trial costs is another institutional difference that makes it less likely that Canadians will pursue legal claims to trial and, if they do get to trial, encourage Canadians to make earlier, more realistic assessments of their likelihood of success. The loser pays system can affect litigants in a number of ways. Cost sanctions (costs awarded at the end of the trial, requiring the loser to pay some of the winner's legal costs) are generally more severe in Canada than in the United States and costs

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 255

awarded to the successful litigant are about 60 percent of her actual legal expenses (Thomas 1991). In the United States, the costs of successfully defending a wrongful termination lawsuit are usually lost to the company involved. Thus, when a PCO Canada employee is terminated and wants to file a lawsuit, in addition to paying her lawyer some money up front, she must at least consider the fact that she may later have to pay all her costs plus PCO's legal costs. This is a big barrier to mobilization for PCO Canada employees that is not faced by similarly situated PCO U.S. employees.

Both the contingency fee system and the ``loser pays'' method of allocating trial costs make it easier for the U.S. employee to pursue a legal claim than her Canadian counterpart.

# (b) Administrative Agencies

In both countries, there exists a regulatory mechanism for dealing with employees' claims of discrimination on the grounds of race, gender, age, and disability. In both countries, the regulatory agencies are slow and somewhat ineffective. The major difference is that there is a routine mechanism that allows U.S. employees to opt out of the regulatory process and file suit in federal court, whereas their Canadian counterparts have no such available remedy. Here again, the process in the United States makes it somewhat easier for employees to pursue a claim against their employer.

Anti-discrimination lawsuits claiming discrimination based on race, sex, age, disability, national origin, and religion are channeled through the EEOC in the United States, which was created with the ``enactment of Title VII of the historic Civil Rights Act of 1964 as a five-member, bi-partisan, inde- pendent executive branch agency charged with enforcing the [then] new employment anti-discrimination law'' (U.S. Congress 1995: 449±70. This statement was made by Gilbert F. Casellas, Chairman, U.S. Equal Employ- ment Opportunity Commission.). Since its creation, the agency has also been directed to enforce other workplace antidiscrimination laws as they have been enacted.

An employee with an antidiscrimination claim, in this case a claim that she was terminated for a discriminatory reason, can file a complaint with the EEOC or the equivalent state agency. If the former, the EEOC then has a statutorily prescribed time of 180 days to investigate the claim. The outcome of the investigation can take one of three forms. First, the agency may investigate the claim and determine it to be without merit; under these circumstances, the agency will dismiss the claim. Second, the agency may investigate and determine that the claim is meritorious. In this case, the employee is either issued a ``right-to-sue'' letter which allows her to file a lawsuit in federal court, or the EEOC itself may sue the employer. Finally, if the agency is unable to investigate and dismiss a complaint within 180 days, the EEOC is required to issue a ``default'' right to sue letter which gives the employee/claimant the right to file a lawsuit in federal court but makes no claim as to the merits of the action.

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 256 LAW & POLICY July 1999

Unfortunately for all parties involved, the EEOC constantly faces a backlog of over 100,000 charges (ibid.). One study of 782,000 discrimination complaints filed with the EEOC and various state equivalents found that the average complaint languishes more than one year before any action is taken (Eisler 1995). Additionally, the average time for a meritless complaint to be dismissed is thirteen months (ibid.). Of complaints filed, about 66 percent are ultimately dismissed as meritless (ibid.). Although terminated employees whose complaints are not being acted on have the option of pulling out of the agency and pursuing the action in court, only employees who can afford the attorneys fees and court costs truly enjoy this option.

PCO officials report that very few cases are resolved through the time- consuming agency process. The wait alone provides some incentive for disgruntled employees to attempt a compromise with PCO. Typically, however, the employee has moved on to another job and can afford the luxury, indeed the no-risk gamble, of simply waiting it out and hoping that her complaint is eventually deemed meritorious.

In principle, availability of agencies makes it easier and cheaper for employees to take legal action in the United States on antidiscrimination claims ± it's free. The costs to the employer are, however great and occur whether the EEOC investigates or not. Simply filing the complaint triggers expensive responsive action on the part of PCO,5 so that even claims later dropped or deemed meritless are expensive for PCO.

Additionally, all of the EEOC investigation and PCO's documents regarding that investigation are ``discoverable,'' meaning that the terminated employee has the right to gain access to these documents as her case progresses. Thus, filing an EEOC claim is a way for an employee who only has suspicions of discrimination regarding her termination to have sig- nificant investigation conducted for her at no cost. PCO Canada employees enjoy no such option. Although the EEOC seems to be largely ineffective in resolving disputes for terminated employees, the way that the agency operates allows the employee valuable information at a very low cost.

When a violation of the Human Rights Code (1990) is lodged in Canada, the commission established by the statute typically provides an investigating officer. As is the case in the United States, an investigation is conducted, a report is filed, and a tribunal may be established if evidence of a violation is shown. The difference is that the employee is locked into this process and cannot take her case outside the commission.6 Thus, despite similar remedies and similar difficulties obtaining a remedy, the PCO U.S. employee has greater ease pursuing a complaint on these grounds because she can use the EEOC to gather evidence, but can usually opt out of the process and pursue the claim in federal court.

# (c) The Lure and Risk of Higher Damages

The prospect of receiving a large award and vindicating herself are the largest incentives for an employee to pursue a wrongful termination lawsuit.

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 257

The calculus about whether or not to enter the complicated, often-costly legal system in either country is based on a prediction about the likelihood of prevailing coupled with the damage award that might be granted. Thus, the higher the potential damage awards, the more likely an employee will pursue legal action ± especially if the direct costs of pursuing the action are, as explained above, not very costly to the employee. In Canada, civil litigants are not constitutionally guaranteed the right to a jury trial (Crupi v Royal Ottawa 1986), but a provincial statute in Ontario gives a party the prima facie right to request a jury (Courts of Justice Act of 1984). No other province provides this protection for parties to civil litigation. Thus, more cases in the United States will be tried before a jury which leads to higher awards, providing yet another incentive for the U.S. employee to litigate.

In addition to fewer jury trials in Canada, there is also more alternative dispute resolution (ADR). While ADR is often attempted in the United States, it is enforced in Canada by court and government initiatives. For example, in Ontario, the provincial government has instituted a policy whereby eight out of ten cases filed are diverted to a mediator (Financial Post Daily 1995b). ADR is more expensive than litigation on an hourly basis because the parties have to pay the costs of facilities and the mediator's time, but the overall savings are great because of the reduced amount of time it takes to reach a conclusion. According to one business periodical, ``the costs of mediation are typically less than 50 percent of litigation costs, with full resolution being achieved in less than a quarter of the time'' (Hendler 1995:7).

In contrast, in the United States, plaintiffs enjoy the option of a jury trial. Although ADR is becoming more common in the United States when both the employee and the employer prefer that system, the government does not compel those with disputes to attempt some alternative form of dispute resolution first as is the case in Canada.

(d) Method of Recovery A further disincentive for the Canadian employee to sue their employer is the method of recovery under the Employment Standards Act. Under this statute, alleged offenses of the Employment Standards Act are referred to the director of employment standards, who appoints referees to adjudicate the cases and provide for remedies. Although there are provisions for administrative review, the decision is binding on the parties and not subject to judicial review (Employment Standards Act 1990:§§ 60-70). Moreover, this system is notoriously lengthy and ineffective.

Unlike the system in the United States in which the employee may proceed directly to court, the Canadian employee faces this regulatory mechanism. Again, the barriers to the judicial system are higher for the Canadian employees. This undoubtedly affects the number of employee related lawsuits in the Canadian judicial system.

- 3. Perceived Legal Risk to the Employer

In both countries, PCO's desire to avoid a lawsuit is shaped by the expenses incurred from a lawsuit. Although some scholars argue that the costs of litigating and paying claims for some sorts of wrongful dismissal lawsuits are not as great as commonly perceived (Edelman, Abraham & Erlanger 1992), even these conservative estimates of litigation costs dwarf the cost of wrongful dismissal suits in Canada. For example, one Canadian study conducted by the Civil Justice Review found that the typical cost to a plaintiff to pursue a civil claim is $38,000 Canadian (Dertouzos, Holland & Ebener 1988). In a study of 120 wrongful dismissal jury trials in California, the average cost to a company defending a dismissal case that goes to trial was over U.S.$80,000 (ibid.). Additionally, the cost of defending such a suit was found to be rising at 15 to 24 percent annually (ibid.). These figures do not even include the costs of the award, if any.

The damages claimed in civil litigation are also much lower in Canada than in the United States. For example, the average claim (in Ontario courts) is C$197,000 Canadian (Financial Post Daily 1995a), while the average wrongful termination award is U.S.$650,000 in the United States (Dertouzos, Holland & Ebener 1988). Although the average U.S. award is inflated due to the statistical dominance of a few, very large awards, these large awards tend to push PCO toward minimizing their risk of incurring the maximum liability. Thus, despite the fact that Dertouzos, Holland, and Ebener, the authors of the U.S. study, conclude that, ``the annual cost of jury trials [in cases with a wrongful dismissal cause of action], including legal fees, amounts to only $2.56 per worker'' (ibid.: ix), it is not the low-end or ``mean'' estimates that concern PCO. It is the threat, however real, of the large jury award (the highest score in the distribution of known previous outcomes) that drives the termination process at PCO.

Although Dertouzos, Holland, and Ebener conclude that the aggregate costs of wrongful termination litigation in the United States are not as high as human resources professionals may think (ibid.: 47), they are definitely higher than they are in Canada. Moreover, PCO U.S. typically does not face causes of action based on common law claims. Over 65 percent of PCO U.S.'s termination litigation stems not from wrongful dismissal causes of action, but, rather, from the more costly antidiscrimination causes of action mediated through the EEOC (personal interviews). PCO is not unusual in this respect; litigation of these costly actions is increasing. In fact, the growth of employment discrimination litigation in the United States has been estimated at 2,166 percent between 1970 and 1989 (Donohue & Siegelman 1991). This growth is dramatic when compared to the average growth in the general federal civil caseload for the same period, about 125 percent (ibid.).

Because the implied contract theory of wrongful discharge is a common law creation ± developed by the courts rather than by legislatures ± the law not only varies from state to state, but the substance of the law can also be

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 259

fairly ambiguous. The ambiguity is multiplied because crucial decisions often are made by a diverse array of juries, whose decisions are not explained and are largely unreviewable. This leaves employers unclear about the best way to protect themselves from liability. Certainly, many employers may guess wrong. One study of 120 California jury verdicts between 1980 and 1986 found that 68 percent of plaintiffs won their wrongful discharge lawsuits; awards averaged $650,000 (although the median award was $177,000) (Dertouzos, Holland & Ebener 1988). The largest award was $8 million (ibid.).

Subsequent research about jury awards for wrongful discharge found, however, that awards vary according to jurisdiction (Edelman, Abraham & Erlanger 1992). More interesting, perhaps was the finding that the construction of the threat of wrongful discharge in professional personnel journals is extremely inflated (ibid.). In a study of nine professional personnel journals, Edelman, Abraham, and Erlanger (1992) found inflated reporting of both the rate at which employees win their wrongful discharge cases and the commensurate jury awards. Consistent with these findings, PCO U.S. officials focus myopically on the large award, the one receiving lots of media attention and attention from professional publications (personal interviews). More close to home, it is the damages claimed in lawsuits filed against PCO itself on which PCO U.S. officials focus. Thus, although some scholars argue that business need only invest $2.56 per employee to prevent wrongful termination suits, any individual company ± PCO included ± must employ a strategy not based on the aggregate data, but on the actual costs that may be incurred. Because all companies do not collectively pool money to pay these awards, PCO tailors its termination policy to prevent any (even a small) chance of losing a lawsuit with a large award.

The majority of the cases that PCO faces, however, originate in EEOC claims (personal interviews). In a study of Title VII race-based lawsuits, Shea & Gardner, a large Washington, D.C., law firm, found that plaintiffs were awarded compensatory and punitive damages in sixty-eight of 576 reported cases between 1980 and 1989 (U.S. Congress 1990). Of those sixty- eight cases, in only three did compensatory and punitive damages combined amount to more than $200,000 (ibid.).

As with the common law claims, PCO U.S. officials focus only on the large antidiscrimination awards and calibrate their prevention strategy on the basis of the large awards. Thus, it makes economic sense in the minds of PCO officials for the company to allocate greater resources to prevent the worst possible outcome ± no matter how remote the chances of that outcome are in fact.

# B. CORPORATE CULTURE

One might seek to attribute the cross-national differences in PCO's termination practices, policies, and outcomes to cross-national differences

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 260 LAW & POLICY July 1999

in corporate culture. After all, the operations in the United States and Canada are separate divisions with different executives, operating in different countries. This might lead one to think that there are also differences in corporate policies, ideologies, and personnel practices. This is not, however, the practice of PCO. PCO has a strong commitment to uniform practices and policies. The 1989 PCO Guidelines of Company Policy declare that, ``[a]dherence to a uniform worldwide standard of conduct to guide our behavior is essential and must be maintained in each country where we do business.'' This commitment extends to personnel practices. Regardless of the substantive law in the countries in which PCO operates, the same PCO policy is supposed to be followed whenever a termination is underway. Every PCO executive we spoke to claimed that there are no official differences in the termination process between the United States and Canada. One PCO U.S. executive explicitly said, ``[i]n theory, there is no difference in the termination process between the two countries'' (personal interview). PCO sponsors annual training in the United States that all human resources representatives from both the United States and Canada are required to attend. Because the corporate philosophy is claimed to derive from principles of equity for employees rather than from legal requirements, PCO asserts that the company does not tailor the termination process to the legal requirements of the particular countries in which it operates.

The advantages to PCO of implementing a uniform cross-national human resources policy are many. Uniform cross-national policies, regardless of differences in law, allow PCO to train U.S. and Canadian human resources personnel in a single training (personal interviews). After the training, PCO can transfer human resources personnel from country to country without retraining those employees about the law and policy in all the different countries of operation. Additionally, PCO officials claim that the practice of implementing generous and consistent cross-national human resources policy makes recruiting and retaining quality employees easier because a fair and consistent human resources policy is something that will attract and retain quality employees (personal interviews).

Except in unusual circumstances, PCO is confident that its standard practices in termination go above and beyond the legal requirements of the United States and Canada. Hence, PCO policies emphasize high quality and consistent implementation of its IDP rather than meeting legal require- ments. PCO executives do believe, however, that following the PCO policy insulates termination decisions from serious legal challenge (personal inter- views). This emphasis on consistency and the very real attempt made by PCO officials to meet the corporate goal of uniformity allows us to rule out cross-national differences in corporate culture as a more likely explanation for the cross-national differences in termination practices.7

If PCO policy provides a level of protection for the employee that far exceeds what the law requires in both the United States and Canada, why do

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 261

we see cross-national differences in outcomes? A more detailed understanding of PCO's termination process is important in order to answer the question.

- 1. PCO's Rapid Termination Procedure

In both the United States and Canada, PCO has a two-tiered termination policy. A ``rapid termination'' occurs when an employee commits one of PCO's ``five deadly sins'' ± absence of three days without notice, dishonesty, insubordination, possession of firearms or violation of the substance abuse policy, and misconduct.8 In those cases, the termination process is not drawn out over many months, but occurs virtually ``on the spot.'' The human resources department is consulted only briefly and provided verification that the incident was sufficient to merit termination and to ensure that PCO has the evidence to prove the violation. Not only does rapid termination eliminate the presence of the problem employee, but it also provides an example to other employees that certain behavior will simply not be tolerated by PCO. In a typical year, PCO Canada and PCO U.S. the same percentage of employees using rapid termination ± about 1 percent. There is little cross-national difference in rapid termination and the law in both countries allows it in these sorts of circumstances.

- 2. PCO's Incremental Discipline Process

More common, however, is termination for waning performance. When an employee's performance declines, PCO policy calls for implementation of the ``incremental discipline process'' or ``IDP.'' This process is designed to provide the problem employee with notice about the inadequacy of her performance, sufficient time and resources to ensure that the expectations placed on her by the company are clear and realizable, and a fair chance for the employee to rehabilitate her performance.

IDP imposes requirements that are justified by PCO officials on other than legal grounds. Yet, the requirements coincide nicely with legal requirements. IDP is not designed only or even primarily to terminate the employee; rather the stated goal of the process is to bring the employee's performance problem to the attention of everyone involved so that the employee or her supervisor can rectify the problem (see PCO Guidelines 1989). PCO officials, both in law and in human resources, insist that the rationale for the documentation is not a legal defense, but fair treatment as an aid to rehabilitation of the employee. Yet, the process does generate a thorough paper trail about the employee's poor performance, which provides both legal justification for any eventual termination and better evidence supporting PCO's decision.

In addition, IDP is designed to prevent the two outcomes that could be most costly to PCO. First, it is designed to prevent termination of an

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 262 LAW & POLICY July 1999

employee who, all things considered, should not be terminated. Thus, IDP is designed to deter or expose a capricious manager with an unjustified desire to terminate an acceptable employee. Terminating an employee for no reason or for a bad reason could expose PCO to legal liability,9 but PCO would also bear the costs of replacing the employee, training the employee's replacement, and retaining the unjustly fired employee's arbitrary or biased supervisor. Second, PCO policy is designed to reduce the risk of retaining an employee who should be terminated. IDP provides the vehicle by which a manager who feels bad about terminating a ``friend'' can employ a procedure that offers an impartial, protected assessment of the employee's performance.10

IDP, nevertheless, is costly in itself. It consists of three phases ± docu- mentation, probation, and termination. Prior to the documenting phase, as an employee's performance begins to wane, the ``line manager'' ± the employee's direct supervisor ± is expected to step up consultations with the problem employee to make clear the expectations that are not being met.

(a) Documentation When the line manager determines it is appropriate, she begins to document these meetings, sending copies to the employee and to the employee's file. This documentation provides the basis for later termination if necessary, but also is intended to help the problem employee rehabilitate her performance. The length of the documentation phase varies according to factors such as the sensitivity of the position, the general attitude of the line manager, and the line manager's perception of how long the employee has been performing inadequately.

# (b) Probation

If the employee's performance continues to wane, the next step is probation. All employees who have been with PCO for one year or longer are entitled to a six-month probation as laid down in the company Guidelines (1989). Prior to placing the problem employee on probation, the line manager must consult the human resources department. The line manager contacts the human resources manager (called the human resources representative in Canada) to discuss the nature of the problem, the amount of discussion and documentation that has already occurred, and other pertinent factors such as how long the employee has been with PCO and the reaction that the line manager expects from the employee. If it is determined that the employee should be placed on probation, a probation letter is drafted by the line manager and the human resources manager. An attorney typically reviews both the contents of the letter and the case history, including documentation about the performance problems. The intensity of this review varies between the two countries, with lawyers in the United States engaging in a more thorough review than their Canadian counterparts. The purpose of this often cursory review is to provide a further check on the process up to the

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 263

point of probation. The attorney makes sure that the problems in question provide the basis for a legally justifiable termination and that there is adequate ``proof'' in the form of documentation to back up PCO's side of the story.

The employee is notified that she is on probation by a letter, typically delivered in person by her line manager and followed by a meeting. At the probation meeting the employee, the line manager, and the human resources manager are present.11 The substance of both the probation meeting and letter are the expectations that are not being met by the employee. At the probation meeting, the problem employee is asked whether or not the expectations for her work are unrealistic. This meeting can be very lengthy or very short. In the United States, most of the human resources executives claim that they know, prior to the probation meeting, what the response of the employee will be to the directed criticism.

Sometimes, the probation period or even the probation meeting is used as an opportunity to help the employee realize that there is simply a ``bad fit'' between PCO and the employee and hint that there is simply no other option for the employee but to leave PCO. One executive told us, ``I ask myself, `Is this a will problem or a skill problem?''' (personal interview). If it is a ``skill problem'' the probation meeting is used as an opportunity to assess what PCO can do to bring the employee's skills up to what is required for the tasks she is expected to perform. Typically, however, a ``skill problem'' will not reach the probation phase. Skill deficiencies are identified and rectified before the problem gets this far. Because PCO executives believe it is the company's responsibility to teach an employee the skills she needs to be successful, when a skill problem reaches this phase of IDP it is everyone's responsibility. Sometimes, the skill problem is simply too large. Then, ``we try to convince the employee that the opportunities at PCO are not going to meet their expectations. We try to help them get on with other life opportunities'' (personal interview).

Most probation meetings are conducted to address ``will problems.'' In these cases, it is up to the employee to recognize that she is not putting all she can into the job and she has to make her own turnaround. According to human resources personnel, there is nothing PCO can really do to fix a will problem, so probation is an extended period in which the employee can assess her options and make this personality change if she can. ``Will problems'' are expected to be rectified quickly because an employee either shapes up when confronted or does not. PCO officials are willing to give more time to a genuine ``skill problem'' if the official believes that it can be rectified.

Throughout the probation, typically a period of six months, the line manager is expected to continue meeting regularly with the problem employee to ensure performance is improving satisfactorily. Although probation is a ``right'' enjoyed by all employees who have been with PCO for more than one year, the probation process is costly for PCO. The costs of

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 264 LAW & POLICY July 1999

probation include (1) productivity losses that stem from retaining a poor employee, (2) lost manager time, as he has to spend increased time supervising problem employees, and (3) consultation with attorneys and other specialists (such as affirmative action officers).12

# (c) Termination

At the end of the six-month probation period, assuming the employee has not left on her own, a decision to retain or terminate the employee is made. This process is the same cross-nationally and seems to be regarded by PCO human resources officials as ``the easy part.'' PCO officials in both the United States and Canada indicate that by the time a problem gets to this stage in the process, it is clear if it is going to be feasible to retain the employee. The actual decision is made by the line manager, the human resources manager, and, in some cases, the attorney and/or the affirmative action officer in consultation with one another.

The ``hard part'' of termination concerns setting the terms, especially the amount of the severance pay. In both countries, the officials say that PCO tries to make the first severance offer a fair one because they claim that fairness prevents both time-consuming negotiations and inconsistent results among similarly situated employees. Another incentive for providing a fair first offer is that PCO does not want to anger an employee at this sensitive time. Offering a severance package regarded as insufficient or unfair could trigger escalating post-termination disputes. In neither country, however, does PCO budge much from the initial offering.

In both the United States and Canada, human resources executives described particular terminations that deviated from the traditional IDP for various reasons. In certain circumstances, PCO would eliminate steps of IDP or speed up certain phases of the model if the employee in question were particularly harmful to PCO. The fact that PCO is willing, under particular circumstances, to deviate from the stated policy demonstrates two things. First, PCO executives are aware that IDP goes above and beyond the legal requirements in both countries. Otherwise, PCO would not be willing to cut corners for fear of opening itself up to legal liability. Second, PCO is consciously legally risk-averse in its standard termination process. Where business risks are obvious and severe, PCO is willing to move closer to legal liability in order to prevent other costs to PCO that would result from retaining the employee.

In Canada, for example, PCO faced a particular marketing challenge. The termination of Steve Smith (a pseudonym) provided great difficulty for PCO because he was brought in at a fairly high level as the product manager of one of PCO's largest selling drugs in Canada. At the time Smith's performance began to wane, the drug was only months away from being made available under a generic label. Obviously, PCO had a large business interest in ensuring brand loyalty and market share just prior to the time when competition would begin. The product manager's role in ensuring

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 265

sales is crucial at all times, but, at this time, the quality of the product manger's work was perceived as especially vital for the company. When Smith missed deadlines, failed to create and implement development plans, and failed to manage the budget properly, his direct supervisor implemented a ``development plan'' to help Smith rehabilitate his performance. Smith was quickly terminated when it became obvious that he had no intention of implementing the development plan. In Smith's case, none of the formal steps of the IDP had been taken. The development plan was not a formal probation, and yet Smith was terminated without fear of legal ramifications. The decision whether to terminate an employee in a crucial position at a crucial time poses a difficult dilemma for PCO. On the one hand, termin- ating the employee leaves a vacancy that is difficult and expensive to fill. On the other hand, retaining the employee may lead to lost profits that cannot be recouped. Of course, this is always the tension that PCO and every company faces surrounding termination. In the case of Smith, however, the costs to PCO were too great and too obvious, so PCO executives were confident in their decision to forgo IDP.

Similarly, in the United States, when executives are confident that the probation will probably not lead to a rehabilitated employee, they will use the probation meeting as an opportunity to help the employee realize that she should probably leave the company. PCO officials recognized the fact that this termination occurred more rapidly due to Smith's important position, but they did not cite this example as terminating an employee ``early,'' and they did not seem concerned about the legal ramifications of handling Smith's termination in this manner. Despite the formal adherence to IDP when the costs to PCO are obvious and great, it is willing to deviate from the model to pursue PCO's ultimate goals. Interestingly, a number of PCO officials who related instance of deviations from the stated policy indicated that the deviation made it no more likely that the termination would lead to legal wrangling.

Given the same cross-national policy and PCO's belief that it has implemented a termination policy that is more than is legally required to protect the employee, how can we account for significant differences in the outcomes we found between the two countries?

## III. LEGAL, ORGANIZATIONAL, AND PROCEDURAL OUTCOMES

Despite PCO's emphasis on uniform corporate policy, there are several significant differences in the termination process in the United States and Canada. Basically, the differences fall into three categories ± dispute patterns, organizational responses, and procedural patterns. First, there are significant dispute pattern differences:

in the United States, PCO's terminated employees challenge their termination decisions more than their Canadian counterparts. Moreover, in the United States

there are many causes of action with which PCO must be concerned, while in Canada there is only one cause of action that poses an actual litigation threat to PCO. Second, there are organizational responses: PCO U.S.'s human resources department has established two offices that do not exist in PCO Canada. Finally, there are procedural differences, including a greater rate of utilization of probation in PCO Canada, and a greater use of attorney services in PCO U.S.

# A. DISPUTE PATTERN DIFFERENCES

Disputes can arise prior to the termination itself and continue after the termination. Disputes may take the form of lawsuits threatened, lawsuits filed, and lawsuits litigated. At each phase of the termination process, PCO Canada and PCO U.S. incur different levels of disputing. According to PCO's detailed records, as a percentage of all employees, there was a higher percentage of ``separations'' (when an employee leaves PCO for any reason ± termination, resignation, or retirement) in Canada than in the United States in the years studied, but the rates of ``forced separations'' (meaning the employee was fired) to all separations was similar in the two countries. As Table 2 shows, in the fiscal year studied, 24.1 percent of total separations in Canada were forced; in United States, 23.4 percent of total separations were forced. In Canada, 35.7 percent of those who were fired were first placed on formal probation. In the United States, on the other hand, only 9.1 percent of those who were fired were first placed on probation.

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 267

# B. ORGANIZATIONAL DIFFERENCES

Although the termination philosophy of PCO does not vary cross-nationally, the organization of the human resources department varies greatly. In PCO U.S., there are in-house attorneys who are utilized in a different way than their Canadian counterparts; and there is an affirmative action office that is active in the termination process. PCO Canada has no such counterpart.

These structural differences represent costs expended by PCO U.S. that are not incurred by PCO Canada. They indicate that there is a need to have more in-house offices and officials to handle legal and quasi-legal questions. These additional offices and officers are required, at least in part due to the higher rates of serious disputing in the United States.

- 1. Lawyers

In Canada, when either the human resources representative or manager believes that legal advice is required, termination issues are brought to an outside attorney. That occurs routinely at the probation phase of the IDP, and sometimes at other stages. For example, a PCO Canada human resources representative was approached by a PCO Canada line manager who claimed to be having trouble with a female employee; that was because, the human resources representative later learned, she was not responsive to the manager's sexual advances. The human resources representative, who had been working with the line manager, had to change gears dramatically and immediately sought legal advice. More typically, however, attorney contact in Canada arises at the probation or termination stage, is brief,13 and is conducted by telephone. In fact, one of the most senior officials in the Canadian human resources office told us that she had never been to their attorney's office.

In the United States, in contrast, attorney contact is more frequent, more substantive, and occurs earlier in the termination process. In the United States, PCO has in-house corporate counsel present every day in the corporate headquarters. This is further evidence that suggests PCO U.S. is more concerned than PCO Canada about legal problems arising from terminations, and, hence, has a greater willingness to expend resources on legal counsel.

- 2. The Affirmative Action Office

Unlike PCO Canada, PCO U.S. has a specialized affirmative action office (AAO). It employs one half-time and two full-time executives who perform the tasks required by the EEOC and the Office of Federal Contract Com- pliance Program (OFCCP). The affirmative action office personnel split their time between termination issues and EEOC regulatory requirements (which include quarterly reports about the demographics of the work force,

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 268 LAW & POLICY July 1999

training on special topics such as sexual harassment, and complying with OFCCP requirements, especially producing and updating PCO's annual affirmative action plan). When termination is being considered, the line manager or the human resources manager contacts the AAO whenever a ``protected'' employee (such as a racial minority, a woman, or an employee over forty years of age) begins down the incremental discipline road. The AAO can also become involved when a terminated or disciplined employee threatens to or actually files a complaint with the EEOC. PCO is adamant in saying that employees who fall

into protected categories receive no different treatment in the termination process than employees who are not members of protected classes. On the other hand, an employee who enjoys increased statutory protection is always routed through the AAO prior to termination while only some of the ``unprotected employees'' are. The director of the AAO says that his office is brought into the termination process to ensure that similar employee malfeasance is treated similarly. A second goal is to ensure that all legal requirements are met. Despite assurances that all employees are treated the same, the affirmative action officer and corporate human resources personnel all expressed concern about the relatively new Americans With Disabilities Act (ADA) which protects employees with disabilities. Because some disabilities may be hidden, there is a concern that an employee may be misidentified as not belonging to a protected class when he does, in fact, merit special protection. The ADA is troubling to PCO U.S. officials both because employees who may merit increased protection are not easily identified and because of the ambiguity associated with the legal requirements actually imposed on PCO. It is interesting, however, that PCO Canada does not feel compelled to create a special effort to deal with this risk.

In addition to providing a consulting-type service during incremental discipline proceedings, the AAO is responsible for PCO U.S.'s interface with the EEOC and the various state government equivalents. If an EEOC complaint is filed by an employee who believes that she has been terminated due to her race, gender, or age, then PCO has thirty days to file a response. (At the time of our interview, the EEOC had been recently giving PCO sixty days to file the response. PCO's AAO did not know why this change in policy had taken place and, grateful for the extra time, had not sought out an explanation from the regulatory agency.)

At this point PCO must be very careful, say the AAO officials, because the complaint signals that the termination might result in a lawsuit and has the chance of going to trial. Also, PCO wants to end the dispute quickly. Any complaint to the EEOC, therefore, is investigated by the AAO. The director of the office claims that responding to each complaint requires about two full work weeks for one person ± about eighty hours. After PCO's response is filed, the EEOC has 180 days to resolve the case or to authorize the employee to sue PCO, or 300 days if a claim has been filed with a state agency. If the EEOC has not been able to investigate the complaint in

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 269

eighteen months, then the employee is automatically granted the right to sue letter.

This use of the AAO in PCO U.S. presumably reflects significant cross- national differences in the methods and likelihood of legal mobilization. Although there are similar legal claims available to PCO U.S. and PCO Canada employees, there is no separate corporate bureaucracy in PCO Canada to field these legal claims. The affirmative action office is costly and the EEOC response function is one of the most costly tasks that the AAO has to perform.

# C. PROCEDURAL DIFFERENCES

PCO's termination process also varies between the two countries. In the United States, PCO's process involves more work, more time, and higher costs. The reason, it appears, is that in the United States there is a more complex and detailed body of legal rules surrounding termination, more legal uncertainty, and a more threatening and more frequently activated litigation system.

PCO Canada seeks waivers from dismissed employees without concern for increasing the risk of future litigation by the employee; this is not the case in PCO U.S. In termination cases, formal consultations with legal or quasi-legal professionals are more frequent in PCO U.S., and they involve more people. In PCO U.S., these conferrals are more open-ended and deliberative than the rather directed consultations that occur in PCO Canada.

- 1. Use of Waivers and Severance Packages

There are cross-national differences in the frequency with which PCO asks a terminated employee to sign a ``waiver'' document, stating that the employee accepts the terms of the severance and will not pursue legal action.14 In PCO U.S., the terminated employee only rarely is asked to sign a ``waiver,'' and the process is more constrained by law. Waivers are intimately connected with severance packages because, in Canada, the severance package is the source of all of PCO Canada's litigation. Thus, when a severance package is agreed upon by both parties, PCO Canada officials seek to have the employee sign the waiver which states that this is agreeable to her.

In PCO U.S., the terms of the severance package are determined according to PCO U.S.'s ``plan.'' The Employee Retirement Income Security Act (ERISA) requires employers to adhere strictly to the terms of their formal employee benefit plans. There is little room for negotiation; PCO does not have the discretion to ``sweeten the deal'' by supplementing one person's benefits. Thus, in PCO U.S. the termination meeting is simply a notification rather than a dialogue. The severance package in the United States, therefore, is more limited. It includes the payment of any pension or

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 270 LAW & POLICY July 1999

investment plan to which the employee has contributed through his tenure. In contrast to the Canadian practice, lump sums equivalent to an employee's salary are not made at the time of termination.

Since liability for PCO U.S. does not center on the severance package, but rather centers on the termination itself, the use of waivers at the time of termination is a bit different. In the United States, the waiver, though rarely used (none of the U.S. regional human resources managers interviewed had used the waiver more then five times, though all of them were thinking about using it more and wanted to use it more), seeks to indemnify PCO from various forms of legal liability. Human resources managers in the United States are reluctant to ask for a waiver because corporate officials believe that, once the idea of legal liability is introduced, the employee is more likely to retain an attorney or pursue legal action.

In contrast, in Canada, requests for waivers are standard practice. At the termination meeting a waiver (which has been approved by PCO's attorney) is presented to the Canadian employee who signs the waiver either on the spot or after consulting with an attorney (often consulting at PCO's encouragement) to make sure the offer is a fair one.

In Canada, when an employee is terminated without just cause, she is entitled to reasonable notice or compensation in lieu thereof. Just cause exists when the employee engages in serious misconduct, insubordination, theft, dishonesty, incompetence, competing with the employer, conflict of interest, absenteeism, or illness. For purposes of the notice requirement, adverse economic conditions, redundancy, and reorganization of the company do not constitute just cause for termination. Some commentators suggest ± and PCO Canada's expectation, reflected in practice, seems to demonstrate ± that employers have a high burden to overcome if they attempt to prove a termination meets the just cause requirement. Thus, PCO Canada routinely offers reasonable notice compensation in lieu of actual notice. The amount provided is not specifically dictated by the law; court decisions refer to a variety of factors including length of service, salary, job status of the former employee, labor market conditions, and the year of the decision (McShane 1983). General studies indicate that such severance awards in court cases average almost nine months of pay (McShane & McPhillips 1987) and somewhat more for larger employers (ibid.). In return, the employee is asked to sign a waiver accepting the conditions of the severance package and accepting this as an adequate substitute for just cause.

Given the legal ambiguity concerning what must be paid in lieu of actual notice, PCO Canada tends to err on the side of safety and fairness, offering the dismissed employee outplacement assistance, severance pay, and a short- term (usually six months) extension of her medical benefits. Unlike the prac- tice in the United States, PCO Canada officials and employees have some room to negotiate. This negotiation is often quite informal. It occurs in many of the termination meetings or occurs semiformally after the termination

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 271

meeting in the form of a letter or phone call from an attorney-friend of the terminated employee. This negotiation rarely reaches a formal level.

Severance packages are much lower and there is rarely time spent negotiating a waiver of legal liability in the United States. PCO Canada invests heavily in pretermination resolution which, in turn, leads to fewer posttermination disputes and thus, lower costs. But, these are the only parts of the termination process that seem to be less expensive in the United States than in Canada. The extremely low level of post-termination disputes and the lack of expensive, pretermination consultations with legal and quasi- legal personnel in PCO Canada are evidence that the more complex and detailed body of legal rules facing PCO U.S. officials result in higher expenditures for PCO U.S. which has no option but to invest heavily in both pretermination and posttermination disposition mechanisms.

- 2. Use of Attorneys

Not only do PCO U.S. officials consult attorneys more often, but they also use them somewhat differently. In the United States, according to human resources officials, the question they typically present to the corporation's attorney is more open-ended, along the lines of, ``What should we do in this situation?'' According to both outside counsel for PCO Canada attorney and PCO Canada human resources officials, the usual question asked of the attorney in Canada is more narrow, along the lines of, ``Is the step we are about to take legally defensible?'' Moreover, the attorney in the United States not only troubleshoots, like the Canadian attorney, but also provides on going training to human resources department personnel. In the United States, the in-house PCO attorney tries to speak with every human resources worker and as many line managers as possible before they start their jobs. She encourages them to err on the side of consulting her too early and too often rather than too late and too infrequently.

In Canada, there are more hard and fast rules about when the attorney should be consulted. Generally, the attorney is consulted later in the process. The attorney reviews the probation letter and analyzes or at least discusses the file to determine if PCO Canada is in a solid position to take the serious step of placing an employee on probation. Attorney utilization is thus a routine ``last check'' to ensure that human resources and line management has not made some egregious error.

In the United States, in contrast, a line manager or human resources representative often consults an attorney not to seek approval for a decision, as is typically the case in Canada, but to participate in formulating a plan. The attorney consultation is not only to help ensure that PCO will have sound legal footing in the event that a termination eventually arises, but also to help apply PCO's policy of attempting to rehabilitate problem employees. The U.S. attorney is more a partner in the decision-making process, without dictating the outcome of the problem.

PCO's Canadian attorney had nothing but praise for PCO Canada's human resources department. He could not think of a time when he told a PCO representative not to take the probation or termination steps they had proposed. In the United States, on the other hand, the attorney claims she often wishes that the human resources representative or the line manager had consulted her earlier in the process.15 The American lawyers sometimes want additional steps to be taken regarding a problem employee, even if doing so will lengthen the documentation phase and extend the tenure of an unwanted employee.

Finally, the PCO U.S. attorney seems to work much harder at ensuring consistency ± ensuring that employees who have committed similar blunders are treated alike. This may partly reflect differences in scale and organ- izational structure. The Canadian human resources department is smaller and all the human resources representatives are in the same location, which allows consultation with one another to ensure consistency. In the United States, both the attorney and the AAO take responsibility for ensuring consistent treatment. Differences in law, however, also influence the U.S. attorney's extra efforts at achieving consistency. Since PCO Canada is only concerned with one cause of action ± reasonable notice ± it is easier for nonlegal actors to perform many of the quasi-legal tasks reserved for the attorney in PCO U.S., where employees may resort to the more complex array of statutory causes of action, in more legal forums, and subject to a higher degree of legal uncertainty.16

- 3. Use of Probation

Probation is one of the most important and potentially costly elements of the IDP. Although PCO officials claim otherwise, the probation process serves as insulation from legal liability. Probation is a demonstration of PCO's attempt to rectify a problem in a procedurally fair manner, thus mitigating future claims by terminated employees of unfair treatment. As Table 2 shows, probation is used much more frequently by PCO Canada (35.7 percent of the time an employee is terminated) than by PCO U.S (9.1 percent of the time an employee is terminated).

The probation practice is drawn out, costly, and usually unsuccessful. One executive estimated that only one or two out of five employees who begin down the road of incremental discipline make it back in good standing with PCO (personal interview). The higher probation rate in Canada is evidence that seems to contradict the theory that PCO U.S. is more risk averse and incurs more costs in the termination process. After all, wouldn't the division of the company that is more risk averse employ this defensive strategy more frequently? Not necessarily. In fact, PCO U.S.'s less frequent use of pro- bation is misleading and actually reflects its greater sensitivity to legal risk. The procedures followed in the United States for probations when they do occur have historically been more complex and expensive. For example, a

common practice until very recently in the United States was to offer a step prior to formal probation known as a ``performance review'' or a ``perfor- mance plan.'' The performance plan was, for all intents and purposes, a probation period, except that a performance plan did not start the six- month probation clock and could be entered into informally, without consulting the attorney or the AAO. Like probation, during a performance plan period, a problem employee would have close supervision by her supervisor and a clear statement about the exact duties that she was expected to perform.

Because the performance plan was required neither by the law nor PCO corporate policy, what accounts for the inclusion of this step in the IDP? PCO U.S. officials attribute the rise of the performance plan as a way to guard against potential legal liability because it gave problem employees additional opportunities to reform and, hence, gave the line manager more evidence that any further discipline was justifiable. Moreover, the perfor- mance plan allowed line managers to attempt the same rehabilitative process attempted by formal probation without all the requirements. The performance plan also reflects the reluctance on the part of PCO U.S. officials to use the formal step of probation.

There have been recent changes regarding the performance plan in the United States PCO U.S. officials are trying to move away from the performance plan because it simply extends the termination process. In fact, all of the PCO U.S. human resources managers interviewed said that one of their main goals was to eliminate this informal practice due to the growing recognition that preprobation procedures and probation itself are signifi- cant costs to PCO (personal interviews). PCO U.S. officials are attempting careful analysis of each of the complex termination procedures to evaluate their legal necessity. Because the IDP and specifically probation are expensive and time-consuming, PCO U.S. executives are currently making efforts to reduce the costs PCO incurs from problem employees including: limiting the time of poor performance that precedes probation; reducing the number of probations by helping employees understand that PCO is not the right place for them; and reducing the need for legal and affirmative action consultations by training the line managers and the human resources managers to handle these situations properly.

The higher use of probation in Canada may be due in part to the common law standard. As stated earlier, one of the exceptions to the reasonable notice standard is terminating someone with just cause which can be established by unsatisfactory performance. It is interesting to note that even those Canadian employees who are terminated after the entire IDP has run its course are offered both their severance package and a lump sum payment referred to as ``notice.'' So despite PCO's attempt to document just cause (relieving the company of the requirement to provide reasonable notice) the company pays those employees anyway. Although the increased use of probation might suggest that PCO Canada is more risk averse, this actually

demonstrates PCO Canada's willingness termination process and PCO U.S.'s aversion to doing so.

to move forward with the

# IV. PERCEPTION OF LEGAL RISK

Despite PCO's attempt at uniform cross-national policy, a detailed inquiry into the termination processes in both countries demonstrates that there are significant cross-national differences in structure, procedure, and dispute patterns. An examination of the law on the books would lead one to expect PCO Canada to be more risk averse, incurring greater costs in the termination process due to the greater employee protections in that country. In fact, the reverse is true. PCO U.S. is more risk averse. This aversion to risk in PCO U.S. is evidenced by the establishment of different structures and procedures in the termination process. These different and more complex structures and procedures are a substantial cost to PCO U.S. not incurred by PCO Canada.

The greater costs and the tendency to be risk averse is a by-product of PCO's attempt to minimize the likelihood of incurring the maximum liability. For PCO U.S., it seems as though it is more efficient (whether or not it is in fact) to expend greater resources early in the termination process to avoid the worst possible outcome. Thus, the empirical work that emphasizes the low mean costs of employment termination lawsuits is irrelevant to PCO officials. PCO Canada employs a similar strategy, but the same result is achieved for less money because Canadian companies enjoy greater legal certainty. PCO Canada officials know that the only cause of action they are likely to face is a reasonable notice claim and they have a good idea of what their maximum exposure will be if the case goes to trial. Moreover, PCO Canada officials know what to do to avoid litigation. One of the ways that the legal certainty manifests itself in PCO Canada is their ability to function with relatively little input from an attorney.

PCO U.S.'s aversion to legal risk is evident in its formal structural attempts to limit legal risk through mechanisms already discussed such as employing more legal and quasi-legal personnel and establishing the in-house bureaucracies to mitigate possible conflicts. Moreover, PCO's aversion to legal risk is evident in the implementation of variations on the standard termination processes.

Although it is difficult to be certain, PCO officials and our own observations indicate that PCO U.S. incurs greater costs in the termination process than PCO Canada does.17 Although PCO Canada incurs costs in severance packages, PCO U.S. incurs greater costs due to the major in- house bureaucracies and more frequent utilization of legal and quasi-legal personnel.

The higher costs and aversion to legal risk evident on the part of PCO U.S. is due to two major factors according to PCO officials ± greater legal

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 275

uncertainty and more punitive legal sanctions in the United States. Greater legal uncertainty coupled with potentially vast legal exposure for PCO leads PCO U.S. officials to employ a strategy in which they minimize exposure to maximum liability. Minimizing their exposure is an adaptation to the U.S. legal environment, which embodies the problems of legal uncertainty and punitive legal sanctions.

The cross-national differences exhibited by PCO in its operations demonstrate a response to different levels of legal uncertainty. Some of the sources of legal uncertainty in the United States have already been alluded to in this chapter, but they merit mentioning here as well. First, in PCO U.S., executives must act defensively to prevent claims that can arise from a multitude of statutory and common law theories, while PCO Canada really faces a legitimate threat from only one cause of action. Second, PCO U.S. officials say that there is the uncertainty inherent in jury awards. Because PCO U.S. cannot accurately guess the amount of potential jury awards and there is no way they can estimate the total costs of an employment dispute, PCO U.S. operates on the assumption that it is best to avoid these situations.

PCO Canada officials operate in much the same way, attempting to avoid potential legal liability. However, because there is a high level of certainty about the type of claim they may face, PCO Canada can accomplish this goal with less expense. While corporate policy in both countries seeks to minimize the legal risk to the maximum legal exposure, the practical implementation of this policy varies according to the demands of the legal system in which PCO is operating. In other words, the policy gives rise to different strategies due to differences in the nature of the legal risks, and it is more expensive to employ these strategies in the United States.

According to the PCO U.S. attorney, there are five causes of action that most often lead to lawsuits: age, gender, race, ERISA, and ADA claims. It is interesting to note that the common law causes of action available to PCO U.S. employees are not utilized. In fact, when specifically asked about PCO U.S.'s response to these sorts of claims, the PCO U.S. attorney stated definitively that her experience has not shown those causes of action to be a problem for PCO and she does not worry about them (personal interview). She had no pending cases in those areas of law.

In PCO Canada, on the other hand, there is really only concern about one cause of action, the ``reasonable notice'' cause of action.18 In the two years of employment records that we examined for the Canadian human resources department of PCO there were only two lawsuits and both were reasonable notice lawsuits. Also, all of PCO Canada's postsepara- tion disputes that did not lead to a lawsuit concerned the reasonable notice issue. If one is only looking at the variety of causes of action that PCO must be prepared to face, it is clear that PCO U.S. officials face greater legal uncertainty. This is not, however, the only source of greater legal un- certainty faced by PCO U.S.

# ADEA (age) 33%

# Title VII (race) 25%

There is some legal ambiguity involved in the Canadian reasonable notice provisions, but it does not compare with the level of ambiguity faced by PCO U.S. reasonable notice requirements are blurred somewhat by the case- by-case, evolving nature of court decisions. Nevertheless, reasonable notice law is well-established in Canada, and its requirements are summarized in books providing Canadian employers detailed advice about how much reasonable notice compensation is required (Mole 1990). In contrast, PCO U.S. faces a multitude of claims under many laws, some quite recent and many whose interpretation remains in flux. For example, PCO U.S. has to contend with the ADA, an ambitious new law often-criticized on the grounds that it places unclear, but potentially very costly requirements on employers. Moreover, the large number of antidiscrimination lawsuits in the United States constantly generate new law and ambiguous requirements as the federal courts continue to redefine employers' expectations. In the face of legal ambiguity, both PCO Canada and PCO U.S. have attempted to tailor their termination policies to limit legal risk. However, PCO U.S. faces the more difficult task because it faces more lawsuits directly, and has to keep abreast of a far larger number of legal precedents. PCO U.S. must employ a strategy that effectively defends against the threat of multiple causes of action. To reduce legal ambiguity, PCO Canada employs the practice of giving severance packages that tend to be more generous than the law requires. Compared to the costs of a lawsuit, PCO Canada saves money this way. PCO U.S. attempts to reduce the uncertainty by establishing large in-house bureaucracies (a costly endeavor), by employing more legal and quasi-legal personnel, and by employing more expensive procedures such as the routine AAO consultation, in order to limit legal risk.

Some sociolegal scholars have suggested that American business's fear of litigation is exaggerated, both in general (Galanter 1983) and in particular

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 277

with respect to the common law claim of wrongful discharge (Dertouzos, Holland, & Ebener 1988; Edelman, Abraham, & Erlanger 1992). For two reasons, however, these arguments would provide no comfort to PCO U.S. officials. First, it is not common law claims that most frequently plague PCO U.S. Anti-discrimination lawsuits are the biggest threat. Second, PCO U.S. officials are not concerned with data in the aggregate. They are con- cerned with costs to PCO. So, while it may be true that the aggregate costs to companies of wrongful termination suits are quite low per employee, if PCO U.S. is the company against which a very large jury award is granted, then PCO U.S. is the one that has to pay the award, suffer the adverse publicity generated by such jury decisions, and/or pay for the appeal. Thus, although the possibility may be statistically small, PCO U.S. officials, following a rational ``mini-max'' strategy, operate as though they must protect PCO from costly lawsuits and the occasional very large jury award. PCO U.S. officials believe that this is the most efficient way to operate because there are so many costs, in addition to the potentially large jury awards, that surround termination lawsuits. PCO U.S. officials do not believe, quite plausibly, that the threat is sufficiently remote to ignore. One cost of a publicized lawsuit, PCO executives repeatedly reported, would be reduced morale among current employees, as people take sides.

# V. CONCLUSION

In Canada, substantive legal protections against arbitrary discharge are broader than in the United States, as evidenced by statutory protections for groups of workers not protected in the United States (sexual orientation), increased protections for labor organizing, and the different common law traditions in the two countries. Nevertheless, the discharge process in PCO Canada entails less legal disputing surrounding termination and less corporate bureaucracy, both formal and informal than in PCO U.S. This is due to the larger variety of legal causes of action available to the American employees, the higher damages available to them, and the greater ease of legal mobilization in the United States. This generates more perceived legal uncertainty and legal risk than does Canadian law, and hence more expenditures on lawyers and regulatory affairs personnel. It also generates a higher incidence of posttermination lawsuits.

Moreover, confronted with a more adversarial legal environment, PCO U.S. employs a more adversarial model of employment relations when considering termination. PCO U.S. is less likely to pursue probation, and less likely to move swiftly to termination. PCO U.S. officials' lower degree of discretion to negotiate terms of the severance package, partly due to ERISA law, stands in sharp contrast to the operations of PCO Canada.

PCO Canada incurs greater costs by investing in probation at a much higher rate than PCO U.S. (which can lead to longer retention of poor

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 278 LAW & POLICY July 1999

employees ultimately dismissed), and by offering severance packages that are more generous than those offered by PCO U.S. The costs incurred by PCO Canada prior to termination, however, seem to lead to a less adversarial posttermination process, lower ex ante legal costs, and lower legal costs arising from post-termination legal claims. When disputes occur with PCO Canada after a termination, they can often be resolved by enhancing the severance package, which does not require extensive aid from legal professionals. In PCO U.S., while payroll expenditures on questionable employees are much lower in the pretermination phase, the threat of postdismissal disputing requires more investment in legal and quasi-legal professionals necessary to defend against these claims.

To best determine which of the models for termination is more efficient, we would have to better understand the costs incurred by PCO Canada in providing the rather generous severance packages and the actual costs in making the more expensive structural and incurred by PCO U.S. procedural alterations to incremental discipline. Given the nature of the organizational and procedural ``extras'' observed at PCO U.S., it seems safe to say that PCO U.S. probably spends more money per terminated employee due to the termination infrastructure we see in PCO U.S. Although the exact costs remain unknown (and are probably unknowable), they are being directed differently. In PCO Canada, higher expenditures are channeled to employees in the form of more generous granting of probation and more generous severance; they are ``paying workers.'' In PCO U.S., the money is channeled to the work of the legal and quasi-legal professionals employed by PCO U.S; they are ``paying lawyers.''

# NOTES

- 1. In order to maintain the anonymity of the corporation that was the case study for this paper, the pseudonym ``PCO'' has been used throughout.

- 2. Interviews were conducted with a number of employees at PCO U.S. and PCO Canada. The interviews with PCO Canada employees took place between October and November 1995, and interviews with PCO U.S. employees in March 1996. The interviews were conducted on condition of anonymity. They are indicated in the text as ``personal interviews.''

- 3. In the United States, protection from race and gender discrimination is found in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and enforcement is delegated to the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) and the federal courts. Of course, each state in which PCO operates has state laws that prohibit employ-

ment discrimination, but a comprehensive list of state law in the area of employment discrimination is beyond the scope of this project. Moreover, the laws at the state and federal level are similar. The purpose is to provide an overview of protections afforded workers in the United States.

In Canada, race and gender discrimination is prohibited at both the federal and provincial levels. For federal employees (not most PCO employees) private sector labor relations are governed by the Canada Labour Code (1990), but race, sex, national origin, and ethnic origin discrimination is prohibited by the Canadian Human Rights Act (1985).

It is beyond the scope of the project to comprehensively summarize provincial protection, but because almost all of PCO's Canadian employees work in Ontario and because the provincial law governs PCO employees, it is worthwhile to examine the Ontario statute that governs private sector labor relations ± the Ontario Employment Standards Act (1990). Like the federal law, protection against discrimination in Ontario is embodied statutorily in a Human Rights Code: The Ontario Human Rights Code (1990). It should be noted, however, that each province in Canada has its own statute and they vary somewhat.

In the United States, protection from age discrimination is prohibited by the Age Discrimination Employment Act (1988). In Ontario, age discrimination is prohibited by the Ontario Human Rights Code (1990).

In the United States, the law governing employment abuses on the basis of disability is the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) (1988) and in Ontario, discrimination based on disability is prohibited by the Ontario Human Rights Code (1990).

Finally, protection from discrimination on the grounds of sexual orientation is

also found in the Ontario Human Rights Code (1990).

- 4. Although it is difficult to find data of this nature specific to certain corporations, some empirical studies about the rate of disputing in the corporate United States indicate that PCO may have a higher level of disputing than other companies do. In fact, many authors of empirical studies about dispute patterns conclude that a large percentage of aggrieved employees do not pursue their claims of employer mistreatment. Moreover, when the source of the claim is discrimination, as is frequently the case in PCO U.S. (see Table 3), scholars suggest that the number of people who will pursue a claim falls even further (see, e.g., Bumiller 1988). There are any number of reasons why the experience of PCO may be different than the ones mentioned here. First, PCO is a very large corporation, which may lead to higher disputing rates due to a lack of community. Second, the employees at PCO are largely upper-middle class, well-educated employees. This popula- tion is more likely to know their legal rights, have access to the legal system, and either have an attorney or know how to go about getting an attorney. Thus, many of the barriers to the legal system that may be present for the subjects of the other studies are not faced by PCO employees. Of course, since this case study focuses only on the experience of PCO, there is no way of knowing exactly why these numbers are higher; these are simply some hypotheses.

- 5. For more on PCO's organizational response, see section III(B). 6. Although the employee formally has the option of attempting to launch a criminal prosecution, this option is rarely employed because the minister must consent to the prosecution.

- 7. Of course, there is a difference between formal and informal differences in corporate culture. While the corporate standard emphasizes cross-national continuity, the corporate philosophy cannot eliminate all cultural differences. 8. Obviously, ``misconduct'' is a broad category designed to give PCO officials some flexibility. Some of the executives with whom we spoke even laughed about the ambiguity of the category (such as PCO Canada's senior human resources

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

# 280 LAW & POLICY July 1999

representative interviewed on 18 and 19 October 1995). However, consistent with PCO's general philosophy to err on the side of caution, misconduct would have to be pretty severe to circumvent the implementation of the IDP. 9. For more on the actual liability, see sections II(A)(2)(c) and II(A)(3). 10. Once the IDP is in process, other managers are involved in reviewing the em- ployee's performance, allowing the termination to be a ``PCO decision'' as opposed to a personal one. The costs of retaining a nonproductive employee could be great and yet are probably the most difficult for PCO to estimate, but some of the costs mentioned by PCO officials include lost opportunities, lost produc- tivity, and the time of the senior management. In the areas of marketing and sales, the estimate is somewhat easier, because PCO can assess performance by sales numbers. In other areas of PCO, however, the exact costs of nonproductive employees are hidden. These costs, hidden or apparent, are ever-present in the minds of the PCO executives and the use of the IDP is designed to reduce them. 11. There is a strong commitment to conducting the probation meeting in person regardless of how far the human resources personnel and the line manager may have to travel in order to be present for the meeting. In fact, the vice-president of human resources in Canada told us that one of her ``worst'' terminations ± meaning that the posttermination disputing was quite protracted ± was one in which she did not attend the probation meeting. She attributes at least some of the problems in that case to her absence from that meeting.

- 12. For more on the role of the affirmative action officer, see section III(B)(2). 13. For more on the substance of the interaction, see section II(C)(2). 14. Of course, there are many reasons why the process of terminating an employee may vary. For example, one case we discussed with a U.S. human resources manager involved a particularly hostile employee who also had quite a lot of expensive PCO property in his possession. In an effort to prevent PCO property from being destroyed, the termination meeting moved from the employee's office to his home where the computer was retrieved on that day. Each termination meeting is different and can be very long or quite short. These sorts of differences do not concern us because they are attributable to the employee's temperament more than to cross-national procedural differences within PCO.

- 15. There is an interesting parallel between this suggestion by the PCO U.S. attorney and the human resources personnel in PCO Canada. Although PCO Canada's attorney had no complaints once a termination reaches his desk, the human resources personnel expressed some dissatisfaction with the speed at which problems were brought to their attention by the line managers ± it was too late. This supports the argument that the human resources personnel in PCO Canada are performing some of the quasi-legal tasks.

- 16. This is not to say that all Canadian employers or even PCO should only be concerned by the reasonable notice cause of action. Obviously, employers in general and PCO Canada in particular could be vulnerable to lawsuits based on any number of causes of action described in the paper. However, I report here the experience of PCO Canada which has never been the subject of a lawsuit on any grounds other than reasonable notice. PCO Canada officials were, of course, aware of the various causes of action, but reported little concern about them due to the high level of integrity in the organization and on their past history. 17. There are any number of costs that we discussed with PCO officials that we had no way of quantifying and including in our analysis. For example, PCO officials said they had no way of estimating, but were sure the following costs are associated with the termination process: the ``gossip factor'' (lost productivity as other employees discuss the merits of a particular termination); replacement costs (the costs associated with finding and training a new employee to fill the terminated employee's position); and opportunity costs (those costs to the

# # Blackwell Publishers Ltd. 1999

## Nielsen TERMINATION IN THE U.S. AND CANADA 281

business associated with having an unproductive employee filling a particular position ± particularly a sales position) to name just a few. These costs escalate the longer a poor performance is tolerated. Of course, there are obvious benefits to terminating an unproductive employee. Presumably, the company would be more profitable if the job were being performed adequately. For a true account- ing of the ``costs'' associated with termination, all of these factors (which are difficult, if not impossible to quantify) would have to be considered in the analysis. Thus, it is difficult to empirically prove which of the termination models ± the one followed in Canada or the one followed in the United States ± is more expensive. However, on the measure we were able to quantify, the U.S. model is more expensive.

- 18. Again, this is not to say that PCO Canada officials are representative of all Canadian employers or even to say that they are wise in their attitude that they need only be concerned with one cause of action. Here I report what PCO Canada officials think and what they do even if it is not the most legally sound method of operating in a legal environment in which employers are vulnerable to so many different causes of action.
