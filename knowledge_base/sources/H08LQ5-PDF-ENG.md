## The Big Idea / Personal Growth and Transformation

Everyone Deserves a Season to Step Back Easing up on your work duties for a limited time can give you the energy you’ll need to flourish later. by Christina Wallace

The generally accepted framework for working at a job is either you do

it or you don’t. The expectation is that, if you’re working, you’re fully

committed. All in. Giving it 110%, as the saying goes. Or else you’re

taking a full leave of absence to manage an illness, for example, or to

take a sabbatical.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Everyone Deserves a Season to Step Back

Often this framework is suﬃcient. But there are plenty of times that

it falls short: when a ﬁrst-time parent returns from leave and is still

adjusting to new family rhythms; when an adult child suddenly must

assume eldercare responsibilities; when an individual faces a legal or

## health situation; or any number of other sources of acute stress. The

catalyst could also be an opportunity rather than a crisis: starring in a

play, for instance, or competing in an athletic tournament. In all these

cases, a brief adjusted work schedule could be invaluable.

My work, inspired by my professor and mentor, the late Clayton

Christensen, focuses on how to answer his question, “How will you

measure your life?” It recognizes that our time and energy are always

being allocated and adjusted across work, creative projects, family time,

community, health, and spiritual commitments — a mix of purposefully

# chosen investments.

In my model, there are options beyond either pushing through a

disruption in your life or, alternatively, taking a full leave of absence

from work. And for good reason: Pushing through increases the

## likelihood of burnout and its long-term consequences on both employee

and organizational health, while taking leave can also prove harmful,

## whether for the organization’s capabilities or for the employee’s

engagement and career. Work is not just something we do; it contributes

to identity, purpose, and community. And in a worst-case scenario,

such a leave could harm future growth opportunities or become

# unintentionally permanent.

Enter the “season of stepping back.”

## What a Season of Stepping Back Can Look Like

A season of stepping back can take many diﬀerent forms. It could look

like shifting from a manager role to an individual contributor, delaying

a promotion, moving to a role with less travel and more-predictable

hours, or trimming back a workload to allow for ﬂexibility or shorter

days. What’s true in all cases is this: It is time-limited; codesigned

by the employee, their team and manager, and HR; has no negative ramiﬁcations for the person stepping back; and oﬀers a seamless

reentry when they are ready to reengage.

Unlike a formal switch to part-time or contract work, this is a temporary accommodation within an existing career trajectory, with no eﬀect on

future reviews, promotion opportunities, or tenure. Over the long term,

such arrangements can beneﬁt both workers and their organizations.

Take the example of Melissa, for instance, who was diagnosed with

breast cancer (some identifying details have been changed). She

contacted the head of human resources at the venture-backed company

where she worked to discuss accommodations. She didn’t want to

follow the typical solution in the United States of going on short-term

disability leave. Melissa was clear that she didn’t want to stop working.

She liked having something to think about other than her treatment; it oﬀered some normalcy during a tumultuous period. So, she and HR

crafted a set of parameters: She needed to start late on Mondays, end early on Fridays, and be oﬀ camera for meetings for a few months. While

she was undergoing chemotherapy infusions, she would be available

over email and on Slack but would decline or reschedule meetings.

The approach worked well. Melissa was able to take care of her health

on her own terms and ramp back up at work when she was ready.

Equally valuable, the company retained an ambitious, high-performing

employee who had deep institutional knowledge and an even stronger

# sense of loyalty.

Consider, too, the case of Chas Carey (full disclosure: Chas is my

husband). When serving as the deputy general counsel of the New York Oﬃce of Housing Recovery Operations in 2017, he was oﬀered a role in an upcoming oﬀ-Broadway production. After talking to his boss and

team about how he might make the opportunity work and still keep his

job, Chas was able to shift his hours to a nontraditional schedule for the

four weeks he was in daytime rehearsals and then, once performances

began, cut back on hours by delegating and deprioritizing while tending

to the most urgent and impactful work. After a four-week run, the

production wrapped, and he returned to his “real life” with gratitude

for the ﬂexibility and a renewed energy for the work. Over the next

three years, Chas continued to excel in his job and was promoted ﬁrst to

general counsel and then to acting director of the agency.

# Are Seasons the Future?

Today, Melissa and Chas’s stories are the exception. But having a season

of stepping back is both possible and beneﬁcial for all parties, aiding in

everything from burnout prevention to learning and development. My

case studies and research also reveal that a wide range of individuals

can beneﬁt from a dynamic allocation of their time across work,

relationships, personal growth, and community. In doing so, life becomes richer — and diﬀerent areas of life can positively reinforce one

another. For example, having a side hustle can boost job performance

and you can gain an inﬂux of innovative ideas from a diverse, second-

# degree network.

Will organizations get on board and recognize similar beneﬁts, such

as boosting retention? Corporate culture will be the deciding factor. If

taking a step back for a limited time is seen as an option only for those

with less ambition, or if it is held up as evidence against high-potential

## status or a demerit come promotion time, then the practice doesn’t

stand a chance. Further, if it fails to address long-held assumptions

about business leaders — for example, that leaders are married men

who have stay-at-home wives to manage the messiness of life without

it impacting quarterly results — then stepping back may be seen as a

# weakness, not a strength.

But if the practice is adopted across the highest levels and

communicated as such — “The head of product is in a season of

stepping back for the next four months, and we are thrilled to oﬀer stretch assignments to his deputies, allowing them to show

their readiness to level up” — it can unlock transparency, ﬂexibility,

## commitment, and retention throughout an organization.

I’m cautiously optimistic. But it will require reframing the larger

conversation around how both individuals and companies view

# successful careers.

Last year, while on tour for my book, The Portfolio Life, an interviewer

asked if an alternative title could have been Lean Out, referencing

## Sheryl Sandberg’s 2013 female empowerment manifesto, Lean In. The

notion that designing and rebalancing our lives to reﬂect the seasons

we are in would be considered giving up on our careers caught me oﬀ guard. I stammered out a ﬂat rejoinder in the moment, but here’s

what I wish I had said: “I am, and remain, incredibly ambitious, but my

ambition is not reserved for my career. I am ambitious for my young

family, for my marriage, my health, my community. I am ambitious for

meeting the demands of my life and thriving because I can rebalance

my portfolio as my priorities change. A season of stepping back is not

leaning out.”

I believe this wholeheartedly, and I trust that organizations that adopt

this mindset will have happier, more loyal workers. Everyone’s life has
