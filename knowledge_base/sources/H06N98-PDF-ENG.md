In 2014, topcoder.com, a platform for crowdsourcing digital talent

on a project basis, asked for technical advice on how to glean useful

data from bison photography. Participant were asked to develop an

algorithm to use structured and unstructured data such as time stamp

or GPS from photos posted online to develop procedures that helped to

## pin-point the migration patterns of bison herds.

Although this looked like a contest set up by conservationists, it was

actually a ploy by the U.S. Intelligence Community (IC) to tap the

wisdom of the crowd to help with a very diﬀerent kind of problem:

tracking Russian military personnel operating in the contested territory

## of Crimea, as well as the everyday movements of hostile military

# vehicles across borders.

If the IC had posed a challenge to coders directly, they would have

attracted unwanted attention. Russian spies might have sabotaged the

contest, for instance, by ﬁling submission after submission with smart-

looking but useless algorithms. Or they might have tried to ﬁle the

winning algorithm, and then used their inside knowledge to adjust their

movements on the ground to avoid being tracked. By framing their

challenge as an exercise in nature conservation, the IC could get the

knowledge it needed undetected.

The IC experience clearly demonstrates that organizations can use

open methods to leverage diverse perspectives from a large number of

## participants from both inside and outside their organizations for very

speciﬁc questions of strategic relevance, while retaining partial or even

total secrecy. But open methods can also be applied at a more general

and strategic level – and we have developed a framework for doing just

that. By using the framework, strategy-makers can beneﬁt from outside

perspectives while maintaining appropriate levels of secrecy.

Identify where you are in your strategy-making

A simple insight sits at the heart of our framework: strategy is developed

in three distinct phases, each of them requiring a diﬀerent solution

to get the balance between openness and secrecy right. Depending

on whether a company wants to open up in order to determine the

direction it wants to take (idea generation phase), work out the exact

details of their strategy (formulation phase), or mobilize staﬀ around

its strategy (execution phase), its strategy-making will involve diﬀerent

numbers and types of people, and requires diﬀerent amounts and type

# of data.

# Idea Generation

In general, companies beneﬁt most from including a large crowd of

## very diverse external participants in the ﬁrst stages of strategy-making.

Partly because this oﬀers new thinking but even more importantly as

it legitimizes a new idea, thereby helping executives to unite around a

particular direction. Happily, participants during idea generation don’t

need very much company-speciﬁc information to get the ideas ﬂowing,

making secrecy easiest to maintain during this phase.

The U.S. Navy for example set up a multiplayer online game to develop

ideas for a new aviation strategy. Six hundred participants — including

industry partners, academics, and others not part of the Navy — posted

and voted on over 5,000 ideas.

The Navy relied on four crucial elements to exert considerable control.

First, they previously experimented with openness in a limited, low-risk

way, e.g., in a game asking how to respond to the Somali piracy issue.

This helped them to understand how open strategy worked and to build

a robust, leak-proof system. Second, they could rely on a culture of

conﬁdentiality — which every organization must build in the age of

social media — to enforce secrecy. Third, they sought legal counsel to

ensure that no issues will emerge on this front. And fourth, they were

aware that in order to generate new ideas it was not necessary to share

what they had already done and what they are planning to do in future.

After the exercise they distributed a report that identiﬁed 127 ideas.

This satisﬁed the curiosity of participants without telling what the Navy

would actually do next.

# Formulation

During the second phase (strategy formulation), openness requires you

to release a substantial amount of information to get meaningful and

valuable outcomes. As a result, most companies will want to involve

primarily their own staﬀ or select a smaller group of people from outside

the organization who sign non-disclosure agreements (NDAs). They are

hand-picked. In our own experience it is most beneﬁcial to match equal

# numbers of employees and outsiders.

The European axle systems and brake technologies company

BWP illustrates how this can be done. The €1.5 billion business knew

that digitalization presents a considerable challenge. Previous attempts

to create digital businesses had produced subpar results. It was less of a

## technology issue than an inability to part with old mental models. When

the company came up with a new technology that would enable lorry

drivers to continuously monitor the forces on a freight-securing belt

(a big market considering annual insurance claims of €1.2 billion for

damaged freight in Germany), it opted for an open strategy approach.

As details of the technology needed to be shared, they used a workshop

model that included a diverse but selected set of internal and external

participants. Over the course of three days several competing business

models were generated and reﬁned across rounds of judging, ending

with a ﬁnal presentation for senior leaders. Initial customer responses

to early trials of the new product — named i.Gurt — have been highly

positive. Armed with a business model signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from the

one driving BWP’s core business, the company is expecting a return on

## its investments in fewer than three years.

# Execution

During the third phase of strategy-making companies have to share

company-speciﬁc knowledge in order to glean the main beneﬁts,

understanding of the strategy and buy-in from those who implement

it. This sharing makes secrecy diﬃcult. Fortunately, the beneﬁts of

openness here far outweigh the dangers. Although competitors might

learn your plans, they are at this stage committed to their own.

Secrecy is also less of an issue as the main participants here should

be employees and business partners rather than outsiders.

Telefónica has used an internal social network tool to mobilize its

workforce around strategic initiatives for several years. Scaling the use

of this tool gradually, allowed them to ﬁnd an appropriate way to share

the right amount of information. Secrecy has actually never been too

much of a concern, as the main goal has always been to make strategy

# actionable.

The top management team ﬁrst used social media to discuss strategy

## with 1,300 senior leaders prior to the bi-annual strategy days in 2013.

This helped to de-mystify the event and give a larger group a voice.

A couple of years later all 125,000 employees were invited to join

and today strategy discussions are ongoing with on average 42,000

interactions every day. Mobilization and the ability to ﬁne-tune has

become part of the company’s fabric. The real competitive advantage

stems not from a few highly guarded ideas but the permanent

## calibration in the operational front-line.

Choose the right tools for engaging with outside participants

As shown in “The Open Strategy Decision Tree” graphic above, we’ve

developed a framework to help managers determine for each of

the three phases of strategy (1) whether participants should come

exclusively from inside the company or should also include externals

and (2) whether they should recruit large groups of randomly selected

or self-selecting people or target small numbers of hand-picked

individuals. In each case, we identify the appropriate open strategy

mechanisms for engaging with external participants, which include:

# Competitions

Online contests typically prove most productive for companies when

the strategic challenges are complex or novel, when established best-

practice approaches don’t exist, and when companies don’t know which

precise combinations of skills or areas of expertise are required to

succeed. As the amount of information you have to divulge in the

ideation phase is limited, it is best to opt for a large crowd. This

increases the chances of spotting anomalies and lends legitimacy

to new ideas, facilitating collective decision making. To keep up

engagement it makes sense to gamify the contest as the Navy did

when participants received votes and comments as a form of micro-

## incentives. The analytical capabilities of many of these platforms will

help you to identify trends as well as anomalies.

# Trend radar

Drawing on the wisdom of the crowd, the Trend Radar process allows

you to derive a shared understanding of emerging developments. It’s

particularly useful if you are looking for new ideas which require you to

share some sensitive insider-knowledge, as the tool has been designed

with the intention to achieve maximum diversity with relatively low

numbers of selected participants. For example, we worked with a large

industrial company, who brought together 94 of its employees with

95 participants from 12 organizations. They developed 159 hypotheses

about the future, asking a larger crowd to vote on them before grouping

them into larger trends. These were not necessarily new, but as a senior

executive explained, that was never the goal anyway. The real value was

to create a shared understanding of the challenges these trends pose,

and agreement on what to do next.

# Business Logic Contest

When making strategic decisions, leaders typically focus on where to

compete (which industries and markets), pushing oﬀ consideration

of competences, resources, and value chains they’ll need to the

implementation phase. The Business Logic Contest helps leaders to

think about the “what” and “how” of strategy together — to explicitly

integrate the customer interface related to value creation with value

capture and its associated process. This ensures that a company

collectively engages in developing a unique proposition that works

coherently for them. As described in the BPW example above, a

workshop type model brings together a relatively small but diverse set

of people preventing leakage of proprietary information.

# Employee Social Network

To mobilize the workforce, large crowds need to be involved. Internal

social networks can be used eﬀectively here as the Telefónica

example demonstrated. A number of simple actions help to create

momentum: Emphasize the social element, establish clear rules to

reduce inappropriate behavior, communicate what exactly will happen

with contributions, and most importantly, have strong moderators.

Leaders also have to take a personal interest. When they reference

## comments, employee participation, acceptance and satisfaction rise

# substantially.

# Jams

Remember that famous Peter Drucker slogan, “Culture eats strategy

for breakfast”? Strategy only has a chance, Drucker pointedly suggests,

if people actively buy-in and champion it. An online event called a

strategy jam helps ensure that they do, providing an opportunity for

large groups of people to engage in moderated strategy discussions.

Barclays’ UK retail arm, for example used the approach in 2012, knowing

that banking would become more digital. Involving the unit’s 30,000

employees in a jam meant that they could all understand what the

shift could mean for them. But even though jams are primarily used to

mobilize, it can have eﬀects on the detailed direction: shortly after the

jam, Barclays launched its ﬁrst mobile app which today is one of the

UK’s most successful ﬁntech products.

. . .

When confronted with the risks of open strategy it is easy for executives

to hold back. As the wisdom of the crowd changes engagement

with customers, innovation, and many other corporate domains, it’s

becoming clear how much companies can gain. With the process we’ve

outlined, executives no longer have to be afraid to open up the C-suite.
