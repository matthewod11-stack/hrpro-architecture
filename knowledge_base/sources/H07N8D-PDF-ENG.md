To remain competitive, businesses must continually challenge the

status quo and ﬁnd ways to reinvent themselves. In a world where

complacency can be comfortable, one unconventional approach can jolt

organizations out of their traditional ways: It’s called the perspective

swap. For example, a CEO might spend a day working as a customer

service representative. Or, an HR representative might spend a week

working in sales.

Perspective swaps involve intentionally shifting your point of view to

gain a new understanding of a situation. Although these switcheroos

can be valuable for all businesses, midsize companies are especially

poised to beneﬁt from them because they’re up against less bureaucracy

and red tape than their larger counterparts, but are still infused with

enough complexity to proﬁt from a change in mindset.

# “Vertical” Perspective Swaps

Perspective swaps can be applied vertically — up and down

## your organizational chart — or laterally across diﬀerent functional

groups. Vertical perspective swaps happen between leaders and their

employees. Leaders often suﬀer from “power poisoning” and ﬁxate

on their own needs and ambitions. Perspective swaps can help

detox leaders from blind spots and distorted views of what’s actually

happening on their teams.

At Vincit, a mid-sized IT services company based in Finland, one

employee is selected per month to be CEO for a day. They’re given

an unlimited budget to make one decision that will improve the

workplace. From instituting new coworker lunches aimed at building

connections among employees to implementing new employee mental

health resources during the pandemic, the program has led to swift and

meaningful changes. For CEO Ville Houttu, the program has helped

surface his own blind spots and gain a clearer picture of how to best

serve his employees.

When perspective swaps happen at the highest echelons of a company,

the stakes can be high (an unlimited budget in the wrong hands

could be catastrophic). Fortunately, there are ways to lower the stakes.

One option is to use simulations. At its annual planning summit, San

Francisco-based cloud infrastructure company HashiCorp runs a virtual

simulation that shakes up the traditional power structure. Leaders are

divided into teams and given the opportunity to act as “CEO” for two

days. Unexpected events, or “wobblers,” are thrown into the mix to test

the team’s ability to respond to change with agility.

# “Lateral” Perspective Swaps

Perspective swaps can also be eﬀective when applied laterally across

## diﬀerent teams, such as sales, marketing, and HR.

Venture capitalist Ben Horowitz applied a perspective swap at one of

his portfolio companies after he noticed that two teams — customer

support and sales engineering — were spewing “blistering complaints”

at one another and struggling to collaborate. Fresh from watching the

ﬁlm “Freaky Friday,” Horowitz instructed the heads of the two teams to

# swap places.

It worked. After just one week, the leaders were able to gain a deeper

understanding of each other’s challenges and resolve the issues that had

caused the spats.

In our latest research at The Work Innovation Lab, we’ve been studying

the evolving role of IT professionals, particularly CIOs and CTOs.

We’ve found that there are three groups whose business priorities

IT professionals are struggling to understand most right now: legal,

ﬁnance, and HR. Yet cross-functional collaboration with these teams is

critical: IT team members need to collaborate with legal team members

to respond to cybersecurity threats, with ﬁnance team members to chop

## budgets and double down on proﬁtability, and with HR team members

to enhance the digital employee experience.

Think about which of your teams stand to gain the most from

perspective swaps. Instructing members of diﬀerent teams to

temporarily swap places can fuel a new level of empathy and

understanding — and, if all goes well, productive organizational

# change.

## Perspective Swaps at the Project or Initiative Level

Perspective swaps can also be valuable when applied to speciﬁc

## projects, initiatives, or change eﬀorts, such as AI-related initiatives.

One key reason that AI initiatives fail to live up to their promise is that

AI developers are often siloed from the end-users of the technology.

By ﬂipping the script and bringing end-users into the development

process, you can increase the likelihood that AI implementations will

meet the needs of your people and deliver tangible value.

At The Work Innovation Lab, we recently designed an experiment where

members of Asana’s marketing team proposed ways to use generative

AI as part of their day-to-day roles. Rather than having the technology

imposed on them by developers, they were put in the driver’s seat to

brainstorm ways they could incorporate the technology into their own

# work.

Ultimately, perspective swaps can foster a culture of innovation and

empowerment that leads to better outcomes for everyone involved.

# Why Do Perspective Swaps Work?

At the heart of perspective swaps is the idea that there is always more

than one way to view a situation. But perspective swaps aren’t just about

ﬁnding new inspiration. They help build “cognitive ﬂexibility” — the

ability to think creatively and adaptively in response to new situations

# and change eﬀorts.

Swaps can also fuel what psychologist Daniel Kahneman calls “System

## 2” thinking. Unlike the fast and intuitive System 1 thinking that

dominates our thought processes, System 2 thinking is slower and

more deliberate. For leaders, this can be especially valuable, as they’re

often plagued by blind spots and conﬁrmation bias — seeking out

information that conﬁrms their existing beliefs.

Perspective swaps can unlock the mental ﬂexibility that you, your

employees, and your organization need to embrace and adapt to

## change. In the words of the esteemed author Dan Brown, “Sometimes

a change of perspective is all it takes to see the light.”
