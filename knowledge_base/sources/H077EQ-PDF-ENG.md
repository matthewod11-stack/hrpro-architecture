Don’t Let Anchoring Bias Weigh Down Your Judgment Too often, we overvalue available — but ultimately irrelevant — information. by Helen Lee Bouygues

It happens just about every time I go to a restaurant with my daughter.

I open the menu and scan the options. Then I glance at the children’s

menu. Oftentimes, the menu is pretty similar, with the same pasta and

tomato sauce. But the items on the children’s menu are usually less

expensive, and I’ll think to myself: Wow, good deal.

If I think again for a moment, though, the deal isn’t really a deal. After

all, I estimated the cost of the pasta based on the adult menu, not the

actual cost of making some bow-tie noodles and serving them with a

# red-tinted sauce.

My faulty reasoning is the product of anchoring, a cognitive bias

that can undermine our critical thinking. According to researchers,

anchoring is when people rely on irrelevant but easily accessible facts to

make judgments. Our minds give too much weight to initial impressions

or numbers that inﬂuence — our subsequent thoughts. In my case, the

prices on the adult menu shaped — or anchored — my judgment about

the value of the items on the children’s menu.

## In the 1970s, psychologists Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman

showed the power of the anchoring eﬀect. In a landmark study,

the researchers found that spinning a wheel of fortune in front of

participants and anchoring them with random numbers inﬂuenced

their answers to simple questions, like “what is the percentage of United

# Nation countries in Africa?”

Studies show that anchoring eﬀects persist no matter how weak the

## connection between the anchor and the actual decision. One study

found that “estimates of an athlete’s performance were inﬂuenced by

the number on his jersey.” In other words, people thought that an

athlete with a higher jersey number was better than an athlete with a

lower number, all else being equal.

Anchoring aﬀects all kinds of decisions, even those made by experts

who should know better. In particular, a recent study shows that

anchoring is far more prevalent in the ﬁnancial world than previously

believed, with substantial anchoring eﬀects inﬂuencing performance in

the stock market. Led by a team at Ghent University, the study showed

that investors valued ﬁrms more highly if the ﬁrms had higher stock

prices. This occurred even after controlling for factors like the number

## of stocks available and other issues of corporate governance.

So, if two companies have the same ﬁnancial proﬁle except Company

X has fewer shares at a higher price than Company Y, then Company

X’s shares will sell better over the long run than Company Y’s. Why?

Because the stock price — the anchor — enhances the company’s

perceived value.

While anchoring can lead to serious and costly mistakes, there are also

ways to use the bias to your advantage. Here are three strategies that can

help make sure that your thinking is clear and well-grounded — but not

anchored.

# Don’t Let Anchors Drag You Down

Anchoring is everywhere in the retailing world. It’s a way to make

customers feel like they’re getting a good deal. One of my favorites is big

box stores that will oﬀer huge “discounts” oﬀ grossly inﬂated “original”

prices that have little to do with the item’s actual value.

So, for instance, I’ll see a low-budget couch “originally” priced at $800

that has been marked down to $200 to make the couch seem like a great

deal. Companies will often perform such “markdowns,” even though

there’s no reason that the couch should have been priced at $800 in the

# ﬁrst place.

There are ways out of anchoring. The ﬁrst step is gaining clarity around

the data. When we are clearer about the evidence, we are less likely to

get hoodwinked. When it comes to a big decision, for instance, I often

write down all the factors involved. Writing down the information helps

me evaluate its reliability and eliminate anchors that aren’t relevant.

Talking through decisions can serve the same purpose. I ﬁnd that when

I seek out the advice of my friends and peers and force myself to be

explicit about my reasoning, it can help expose an anchor.

The key questions to answer are: What information am I using to make

this decision or judgment? Is it accurate and relevant? Am I weighing its

# importance correctly?

If you ﬁnd yourself lacking good evidence, then it’s a sign that you

might be engaging in anchoring. It’s also a sign that you need to do more

research, which brings us to our next takeaway.

# Do Your Research to Escape Bias

I once consulted for Shark, a French company that creates high-end

motorcycle helmets. The ﬁrm was considering whether or not to move

its production line from Portugal to Thailand. At ﬁrst glance, it seemed

like the move would make good business sense. After all, production

costs are generally lower in Thailand.

But my team realized that there was an anchoring problem. The team at

Shark had considered the cost for production of a standardized helmet,

but the company’s product oﬀering was typically customized helmets.

In other words, Shark’s team had relied on the production cost of one

type of helmet rather than the cost of customizing each helmet.

So we brought in a group with stopwatches to ﬁgure out the exact

production cost for diﬀerent categories of helmets. The results showed

that it was actually better to keep over 70% of the production in

# Portugal.

Anchoring to the tune of what happened at Shark is always the result

of lack of information or misinformation. Too often, the human brain

gets ﬁxed on outdated or irrelevant information and fails to see things

# clearly.

This is why for budgets I often recommend zero-based budgeting, which

forces ﬁrms to evaluate costs with a fresh eye. As part of a zero-based

budget process, the ﬁrm has to clear away from previous budgets and

justify all recurring expenses anew. This process forces businesses to

leave their anchors behind and thus ﬁnd new opportunities for savings

and growth. This is particularly relevant with current supply chain

# issues and inﬂation.

It may not always be possible to bring in outside help, but you

can always do more research. If you suspect a number or piece of

information may be an anchor, try to refute or conﬁrm it by researching

other sources. Gather opinions from colleagues who haven’t yet been

exposed to the anchor. Interview experts who can inform you about the

# anchor’s relevance, or lack thereof.

# Use Anchors to Your Advantage

My friend Alex Clavel, the Head of Corporate Strategy at Softbank,

recognizes the usefulness of anchoring in negotiations. He encourages

his team “to use anchoring proactively to convince other parties at

the negotiating table that somehow our ‘anchor’ should be the basis

of discussions.” If it’s successful, this kind of anchoring can “keep the

discussion on your terms as much as possible,” making a favorable

# outcome more likely.

Conversely, it is vital to resist this kind of anchoring when the other side

attempts to deploy it. Alex tells me that he recently worked to eliminate

the anchor of a counterparty whose company’s valuation had dwindled

due to diligence issues. The counterparty still insisted on referring to

the $500 million initial valuation in negotiations. But Alex reminded

them that the number was no longer relevant and could no longer serve

# as a basis for negotiations.

Similarly, I’ll sometimes use anchors to shift a negotiation in my favor.

For example, during a negotiation session, I may begin by talking about

a part of the contract that’s already been settled in my opponents’

favor. With this “win” in the forefront of their minds, my opponents

may be more likely to make concessions once we move on to unsettled

matters. As Cecile Ferrie-Davies, a Managing Director at Pimco, argues,

“anchoring can more often inﬂuence the context of a transaction than

# the speciﬁc analysis.”

In the end, the phenomenon of anchoring shows that while we think

of ourselves as rational and logical beings, extraneous details can have

an outsized inﬂuence on our reasoning. The best solution is a mix of

vigilance and humility and improving critical thinking skills. Otherwise,

you might be a victim of anchoring, dragged down by your bias,

whether you notice it or not.
