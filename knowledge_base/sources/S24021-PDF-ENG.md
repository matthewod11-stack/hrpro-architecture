Perhaps no issue attracts more senior leadership attention than

growth does. And for good reason. Growth—in revenues and proﬁts

—is the yardstick by which we tend to measure the competitive

ﬁtness and health of companies and determine the quality and

compensation of its management. Analysts, investors, and boards

pepper CEOs about growth prospects to get insight into stock prices.

Employees are attracted to faster-growing companies because they

security. Suppliers prefer faster-growing customers because working

with them improves their own growth prospects. Given the choice,

most companies and their stakeholders would choose faster growth over

# slower growth.

While sustained proﬁtable growth is a nearly universal goal, it is

an elusive one for many companies. Empirical research that I and

others have conducted on the long-term patterns of growth in U.S.

corporations suggests that when inﬂation is taken into account, most

companies barely grow. For instance, in an analysis of 10,897 publicly

held U.S. companies from 1976 to 2019, my research associate Catherine

Piner and I found that ﬁrms in the top quartile grew at an inﬂation-

adjusted average of 11.8% per year, but those in the lower three

quartiles experienced little or no growth (0.3%, 0.03%, and -0.5%,

respectively). And the majority of ﬁrms in the top quartile were unable

to sustain superior growth performance for more than a few years.

Although challenging to achieve, sustained proﬁtable growth is not

impossible, however. In our analysis, we found that only about 15% of

the companies in the top growth quartile in 1985 were able to sustain

## their top-quartile performance for at least 30 years.

Over the past two decades, I have tried to understand why some

companies are more eﬀective at sustaining growth and what senior

leaders can do to navigate the organizational challenges it poses.

In addition to quantitative statistical analysis of large samples of

U.S. companies over multiple decades, I have conducted case studies

of more than 20 companies in a variety of industries, including

semiconductors, software, health care, life sciences, restaurants,

## airlines, alcoholic beverages, luxury goods, apparel, hotels, and

automobiles. I’ve also gleaned additional insights from my experience

consulting for (and serving on the boards of) companies ranging in size

## from start-ups to some of the world’s largest corporations.

## HBR / Spotlight / How Fast Should Your Company Really Grow?

I have found that while the usual explanations for slow or minimal

## growth—market forces and technological changes such as disruptive

innovation—play a role, many companies’ growth problems are self-

inﬂicted. Speciﬁcally, ﬁrms approach growth in a highly reactive,

opportunistic manner. When market demand is booming, they go

on hiring binges, throw resources at developing new capacity, and

build out organizational infrastructure without thinking through

## the implications—for example, whether their operating systems and

processes can scale, how rapid growth might aﬀect corporate culture,

whether they can attract the human capital necessary to deliver that

growth, and what would happen if demand slows. In the process of

chasing growth, companies can easily destroy the things that made

them successful in the ﬁrst place, such as their capacity for innovation,

## their agility, their great customer service, or their unique cultures. When

demand slows, pressures to maintain historical growth rates can lead

to quick-ﬁx solutions such as costly acquisitions or drastic cuts in R&D,

other capabilities, and training. The damage caused by these moves

only exacerbates the growth problems.

Sustaining proﬁtable growth requires a delicate balance between the

## pursuit of market opportunities (demand) and the creation of the

capabilities and capacity needed to exploit those opportunities (supply).

To proactively manage that balance, companies need a growth strategy

that explicitly addresses three interrelated decisions: how fast to grow

(the target rate of growth); where to seek new sources of demand (the

direction of growth); and how to amass the ﬁnancial, human, and

organizational resources needed to grow (the method of growth).

Each of those decisions involves trade-oﬀs that must be considered

## in concert with a company’s overall business strategy, its capabilities

and culture, and external market dynamics. (See the sidebar “The

## Perils of an Unintegrated Growth Strategy.”) My rate-direction-method

decisions that are all too often made separately. Using the framework

to illuminate the trade-oﬀs, companies can create a balanced growth

# strategy.

# Rate: What Is the Right Pace of Growth?

The answer to this question seems obvious: as fast as possible.

But taking a strategic perspective means that companies choose a

target growth rate that reﬂects their capacity to eﬀectively exploit

opportunities. Growth is a strategic choice with implications for a

company’s operating processes, ﬁnancing, human resource strategy,

## organizational design, business model, and culture.

In ﬁnance, the concept of a sustainable growth rate is well understood:

It is the fastest a company can grow without having to sell equity or

borrow. But talent, organizational know-how, operational capabilities,

management systems, and even culture are also resources required to

produce goods and services, and they, too, can become bottlenecks

constraining growth. A competent CFO will keep a company from

growing faster than its ﬁnancial resources will allow. Unfortunately,

CEOs and leaders of other functions often do not apply the same

disciplined thinking to nonﬁnancial resources (which constitute the

vast majority of a ﬁrm’s value). For example, rapidly growing companies may downplay gaps between what their staﬃng levels, management

capabilities, and operating processes can deliver and what is required to

meet demand, seeing them as transitory “growing pains.” This approach

can trigger a vicious circle. Shortfalls in critical capabilities can lead to

quality and other operating problems, which in turn become a drain on

already-stretched resources. With no time to design and install systems

adequate to handle the growth, companies often attempt to “catch

## up” through massive hiring and infrastructure spending and other

stopgap measures. Worker burnout and attrition are not uncommon.

These ﬁrms ﬁnd themselves with a patchwork of suboptimal systems,

## an unwieldy infrastructure, an exhausted workforce, and a tarnished

reputation in the market. And the so-called growing pains turn out to be

# not so temporary.

A case in point is Peloton. During the pandemic, it reacted to the surge

## in demand for its exercise bikes and treadmills with a furious eﬀort

to expand manufacturing capacity and distribution. The expansion

pushed the company’s supply chain beyond its capabilities, which led

to quality and customer service problems (including two recalls). The

cooling of pandemic-fueled demand left the company with a bloated

# cost structure.

The right strategy for many ﬁrms may be saying no to faster growth

—even if the opportunities are tempting in the short term. Pal’s

## Sudden Service, a quick-serve restaurant chain with 31 outlets in the

## southeastern United States that Francesca Gino, Bradley Staats, and I

studied, is an example of a company that has taken an exceptionally

disciplined approach to growth. Founded in 1956, Pal’s has eschewed

the rapid expansion of outlets favored by many fast-food chains. Since

1985, when it opened its third outlet, it has added, on average, less

than one new restaurant per year and it has never opened more than

one restaurant in any year. Pal’s boasts one of the highest revenues

## per square foot in the industry: $2,500 versus $650 for the typical

burger chain. In an industry where scale economies are critical, the

chain’s excellent ﬁnancial performance is surprising. A key ingredient

to its success is its operating system, which is designed around lean

manufacturing principles. Every process, from where to place the

ketchup on a burger to how far to open a hot dog bun, has been carefully

studied and speciﬁed. The company’s menu is limited to a few basic

## items such as hamburgers, hot dogs, sandwiches, fries, and milkshakes.

With such a proﬁtable and rigorous operating model, and seemingly

## unlimited demand in the United States for its products, a massive

and lucrative expansion would appear to make sense. Yet the chain’s

leadership recognizes that a unique aspect of its model places a limit on

how fast it can grow: its obsession with quality. Pal’s has an extremely

low rate of order errors: one error per 3,600 orders versus one error per

15 orders for the industry. That level of quality not only allows Pal’s

to save costs on food waste, which is critical in an industry with low

margins, but it also enables the company to have one of the fastest

throughput times in the industry. In a drive-through operation, order

errors cause delays for every customer down the line. Pal’s is able to

serve more customers at peak hours, and that translates directly into

# higher revenue.

But the emphasis on quality also requires signiﬁcant investment in

## resources—in particular, for extensive training and building the right

culture in the workforce. At Pal’s, workers are trained for weeks on each

process and must pass a certiﬁcation test before they can make products

for customers. They must be recertiﬁed periodically to ensure that their

skills are up to par. All Pal’s stores are managed by “owner-operators”

(who are not actually owners but whose compensation is tied 100%

to their individual store’s proﬁts). Pal’s believes that these managers

are critical to nurturing the culture of quality and to training and

developing talent. All manager candidates are put through an extensive

screening process, and selected candidates, regardless of their prior

industry experience, attend the company’s leadership-development

program. It normally takes candidates three years to be allowed to

run their own store. The company’s growth strategy is dictated by the

availability of store managers: When Pal’s has a candidate ready, it will

open a new store.

market potential or target ﬁnancial returns. Instead, it recognizes its

## critical bottleneck resource—in this case, store managers—and paces

growth according to the rate at which it can develop them. This

approach has almost certainly meant slower growth in number of stores

and revenue, but it has been critical to maintaining the company’s

unique operating model and its superior ﬁnancial performance.

In my research, I’ve found that most companies think of growth

## potential in terms of “demand side” factors: external trends, market

share, and other metrics such as total addressable market. These are

important, of course, but they are only half the story. Supply-side

constraints matter just as much: High demand potential does not

translate into proﬁtable growth unless an organization has or can

develop the capabilities needed to meet that demand. So a strategic

perspective on growth means analyzing the company’s sustainable

growth rate (considering all resources, not just money) and then

thinking through the trade-oﬀs inherent in faster or slower growth.

For instance, there may be excellent strategic reasons to grow more

## quickly (for example, a market where ﬁrst-mover advantages or network

eﬀects are present), but that faster growth must be weighed against the

potential harm it creates.

## Direction of Growth: Scale, Scope, or Diversify?

Since demand ultimately fuels growth, selecting which market

opportunities to pursue is a critical component of a company’s overall

growth strategy. Some companies seek growth by scaling in their core

market. Others broaden their scope into adjacent products and services.

Still others diversify into a range of seemingly unrelated industries.

Which strategies are most proﬁtable over the long term has long been a

topic of hot debate, and my research suggests there is no simple answer.

## HBR / Spotlight / How Fast Should Your Company Really Grow?

Let’s return to the analysis of nearly 11,000 companies from 1976 to

- 2019. Among the fastest long-term growers, some companies—such

as Walmart, UPS, Southwest Airlines, and Publix—grew by scaling in

their core markets, replicating their model in new geographic markets,

or adding ancillary services closely aligned with their core service

## operations. Others—such as Danaher, Johnson & Johnson (for which I

have provided consulting services in the past), and Berkshire Hathaway

—took the opposite approach in pursuing diversiﬁcation strategies.

How should companies decide which path to take in their pursuit

of growth? It is tempting to think about such choices as simply a

matter of identifying and exploiting immature, unsaturated markets

with rapid overall growth potential. While market dynamics matter,

there are other factors to consider. For example, from 1980 to 2019

## the average compound annual growth rate of the domestic U.S. travel

## market (in terms of “revenue passenger miles,” or the number of miles

traveled by paying passengers) was a modest 5.3%. Southwest Airlines,

however, enjoyed a brisk average CAGR of 15.3%. It accomplished that

by developing unique operating capabilities (such as fast turnaround of aircraft) that enabled it to eﬃciently provide point-to-point service

on routes that traditional competitors either ignored or served only

## through inconvenient hub-and-spoke models.

I’ve found that even in higher-growth industries, the distribution of

growth rates tends to be highly skewed, with a small set of ﬁrms

accounting for the lion’s share of industry growth. Consider the

## semiconductor industry. From 2015 to 2020, the top 10 semiconductor

companies grew at an average annual compound rate of 9.2%. However,

excluding the two fastest growers during this time (Nvidia, with a

CAGR of 27%, and Taiwan Semiconductor, with a CAGR of 12.3%),

the average dropped to 6.5%. Nvidia’s rapid growth stems from its

capabilities in the design of powerful graphics processing units, or

GPUs. Those capabilities helped Nvidia capture a 61% market share in

the fast-growing market for chips used to power machine-learning and

other artiﬁcial intelligence applications; the next closest rival is Intel,

with a 16% share. The AI chip market oﬀers high growth potential only

to companies with the R&D capabilities to compete there—for others, it

is not a particularly attractive opportunity.

The basic question that companies must address is: In which markets

do our capabilities and other unique resources (such as brand, customer

relationships, reputation, and so on) provide us with a competitive

advantage? A scale-focused strategy will tend to revolve around deep,

market-speciﬁc capabilities. Think about pharmaceutical companies.

The capabilities that enable them to grow are their scientiﬁc prowess in

## drug discovery, understanding of clinical development and regulatory

approval processes, and access to payer networks. While incredibly

## valuable for scale-based growth in pharmaceutical products, none

of those capabilities transfers readily to other industries (including

medical devices and diagnostics, which have diﬀerent regulatory paths

# and market-access dynamics).

Successful scope strategies, in contrast, require the development

of broader, general-purpose capabilities and resources that can be

## leveraged across market segments and lines of business. In some

industries, brand equity is the basis for scope expansion. Consider

the potent role that brand has played in Nike’s explosive growth

over the past several decades as it expanded from being a maker

of running shoes to a powerhouse across the sports apparel and

## equipment industry. In other cases, broad technological assets and

capabilities open doors to new businesses. While conducting research

## on diversiﬁcation patterns across more than 28,000 companies from

1975 to 2004, my colleague Dominika Randle and I analyzed patterns

of patent citations to understand the degree to which a company’s

technological capabilities were broadly applicable across markets. Our

analysis showed that the companies with the most general-purpose

technological assets (those that could be applied across multiple

industries) were the most likely to diversify.

# Method of Growth: How to Grow?

All growth requires access to new resources: ﬁnancial capital, people

and talent, brand, distribution channels, and so on. But there are

various ways companies can choose to obtain them. A classic choice

leaders face is how much to focus on organic growth versus growth by

acquisition. Companies must also make decisions about how to ﬁnance

growth, whether to vertically integrate or outsource to or partner with

other ﬁrms, and whether to franchise or build out company-owned

# operations.

Obtaining any growth-fueling resource—money, people, brand, access

to capabilities, and so on—involves trade-oﬀs. Building up resources

organically can take time (and thus result in slower growth), but those

internally developed resources can often be more precisely aligned

and integrated with a company’s unique value proposition. Partnering

and outsourcing might provide a faster route to growth, especially for

younger companies trying to bring products to market, but it can mean

ceding control of activities critical to the value proposition.

Method decisions are tightly connected to choices about the rate and

direction of growth. Consider the case of Virgin Group, which my

colleague Elena Corsi and I studied. The company’s growth strategy is

to expand into new markets and industries where the Virgin brand can

drive customer acquisition. The company’s leaders consider the Virgin

brand—along with fresh approaches to providing high-quality customer

service—to be the ﬁrm’s critical resource. In many ways, Virgin’s rate of

growth depends on the rate at which the brand can be monetized in new

# markets.

The privately owned Virgin Group has increasingly used licensing of its

brand to drive growth. To raise the capital needed for acquisitions to

enter new markets, Virgin divests existing businesses. In such cases, it

generally strikes a licensing agreement with the acquirer for the right

to use the Virgin brand. As a result of its aggressive use of licensing,

Virgin Group’s most valuable asset, the Virgin brand, is increasingly

under the control of organizations of which it is not a majority owner

and over which it can exercise only limited control. This creates risks

## to the brand, even with vigilant monitoring and strict contractual

clauses. While disputes between Virgin and its licensees are rare, they

have happened. Looking at Virgin’s growth strategy through the rate-

direction-method lens helps us understand the trade-oﬀs the company

has made. The licensing-driven method of growth enables broader

diversiﬁcation and faster growth, but it creates brand equity risks. A

lower-risk approach would be to use less licensing (for instance, let the

Virgin brand be used only in companies in which Virgin Group owns a

## majority share), but this would most likely mean less diversiﬁcation and

# less growth.

# What Makes a Great Growth Strategist

As companies grapple with the central question of how fast to grow,

they’ll need leaders who understand the key decisions to be made

and their inherent trade-oﬀs. Good growth strategists are keenly aware

## of the nonﬁnancial constraints—such as systems, processes, human

capital, and culture—on their company’s sustainable growth rate. They

know that growing faster than capabilities dictate is possible in the

short term but that doing so over the long term can cause lasting

damage to reputation and culture. Good growth strategists do not fall

into the trap of thinking they can grow fast now and ﬁx things later.

They recognize that more-measured growth over a sustained period will

## lead to much better ﬁnancial results than explosive growth for a short

# period of time.

Great growth strategists, however, go beyond avoiding traps and

accepting trade-oﬀs. They proactively look for ways to augment the

resources that constrain short-term growth and focus on the continuous

accumulation of new resources and capabilities that open options

## for future growth, either through scaling in core markets or through

entry into other markets. They see investments in training, processes,

systems, technology, and culture as means to break growth bottlenecks

and raise a company’s sustainable growth rate. They are comfortable

with leading organizational change. Finally, they are obsessed with

human capital. They recognize that among the many resources shaping

## a company’s growth potential, the quality, talent, and mindset of its

people are the most important. Great growth strategists realize that

sustained proﬁtable growth is never going to be easy, but without the

right human capital, it will be impossible.

## The Perils of an Unintegrated Growth Strategy

B.good, a quick-serve restaurant founded in 2004, offers a cautionary

tale about the need to make rate, direction, and method choices in an

integrated manner when crafting a growth strategy. As a case study by

## Francesca Gino, Paul Green Jr., and Bradley Staats reveals, B.good has

an innovative value proposition: Unlike most companies in the industry,

B.good makes its burgers and other fast-food offerings using fresh, local

ingredients. In addition, it cultivates a “family” culture for employees and

customers: The founders got to know many employees and often reached

## out to them on special occasions or in difficult circumstances. Frontline

employees were encouraged to greet customers by name and recommend

## members of their own families for jobs at the company.

B.good’s value proposition and its focus on culture created challenges

operationally and organizationally. The focus on “fresh and local”

and the unique cultural model made franchising—which requires more

## standardization and less corporate control over human resource decisions—

# and geographic expansion more difficult.

For the first eight years of B.good’s existence, it pursued a growth strategy

compatible with its constraints: It opened only eight restaurants, all in

the immediate Boston area and all completely company-owned. It had a

cohesive growth strategy aligned with its core value proposition.

But then the company changed its growth strategy. It began to add outlets

very quickly, a rate decision. By 2019, it operated 69 stores across the

## Northeast, South, Midwest, and Canada—a direction decision. And to

finance growth, it began to sell franchises, a method choice; by 2019, 20%

of its outlets were franchised.

In the aftermath of this change in strategy, the company struggled. Every

time it expanded into a new geography, it needed to develop a new supplier

base to fulfill its fresh and local promise. And every franchise selection

required a time-consuming process to make sure the franchisee shared

the founders’ philosophy. The company’s leaders should have realized that

they faced a strategic choice: Either align its growth strategy with its core

value proposition—which would have meant slower growth, less-aggressive

## geographic expansion, and less franchising—or change its value proposition

and culture to enable faster growth, broader geographic expansion, and

more franchising. They tried to have it both ways, and it didn’t work. As

of 2023, the company was down to just 13 outlets, 11 of which were in

## metropolitan Boston and one each in Maine and New Hampshire.
