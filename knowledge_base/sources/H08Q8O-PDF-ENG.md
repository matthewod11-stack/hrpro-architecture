When Amazon announced in September 2024 that it was requiring

people to come into the oﬃce ﬁve days a week rather than three, the

reaction was swift and negative: A poll of 2,585 Amazon professionals

found that 91% were dissatisﬁed with the new policy and 73% said they

were considering looking for a new job because of it.

# HBR / Digital Article / The Workplace Psychological Contract Is Broken. Here’s How to…

Amazon’s CEO, Andy Jassy, is not alone in struggling against strong

pushback when trying to bring workers back into the oﬃce post-

pandemic. Dell Technologies resorted to threatening people who

continued working from home, stating that they wouldn’t be eligible

for promotion. At JPMorgan Chase, CEO Jamie Dimon has sharply

criticized employees who resisted coming into the oﬃce ﬁve days a

week. And Starbucks set up an “accountability process” to ensure that

its three-day-a-week policy was adhered to, including by their new CEO,

who commutes to Seattle from Southern California.

The battle between companies pushing for a return to oﬃce (RTO)

and employees who increasingly claim a right to work from home if

they choose can easily be dismissed as overreaction on both sides: out-

of-touch senior executives who don’t understand that the world has

changed versus pampered, entitled, and unmotivated employees. But

the fury the debates produce suggests that there is a deeper problem.

In this article, we suggest that the outrage over workplace policies

## reﬂects a larger breakdown in the unspoken psychological contract

employees thought they had with their organization—and speciﬁcally

a growing divergence between employers and employees in their

understanding of what is fair. To close this gap, we believe that

employers need to move away from establishing formal workplace

policies based on what’s called the ethics of justice—a rational and

one-size-ﬁts-all way of thinking about fairness—to a more ﬂexible,

personalized approach based on the ethics of care. We’ll explain what

ethics of care means, demonstrating how some companies that we

work with in our research and executive programs have successfully operationalized a caring approach, and oﬀer guidance on how to create

# a culture of care in your company.

# What Does It Mean to Be Fair?

## First described by Harvard Business School’s Chris Argyris, a

psychological contract describes the implicit understanding that

employees have about what they owe the company and what the

company owes them. Psychological contracts are, as Carnegie Mellon’s

Denise Rousseau has observed, based on trust, “which develops from a

belief that contributions will be reciprocated and that a relationship

exists where actions of one party are bound to those of another.”

Importantly, she notes: “A damaged relationship is not easily restored.”

Post-Covid RTO policies provide a powerful example of broken

psychological contracts. Employees who felt they had demonstrated

that they could work productively from home and who had rearranged

their lives in ways that they did not believe would be temporary felt

betrayed by their companies when the terms were changed, regardless

of the rationale. Let’s go back to Amazon. To explain the changes, Jassy

wrote to employees: “We’ve observed that it’s easier for our teammates

to learn, model, practice, and strengthen our culture [when people are

in the oﬃce together]; collaborating, brainstorming, and inventing are simpler and more eﬀective.”

We agree with those arguments, having written about them in

HBR in 2021. But if the real underlying issues are trust and the

relationship between employers and employees, then arguments about strengthening culture and making brainstorming more eﬀective are

beside the point and won’t persuade their intended audience that the

policy is correct and fair. Instead, perhaps at play here is a disagreement

about what each side in the psychological contract owes to the other

regarding the terms and conditions of employment.

Today, many employers understand “fairness” as an abstract principle,

applying the ethics of justice lens, which assumes that it is possible

to ﬁnd universal and objective principles that can be applied in all

situations. In the context of working from home, this would lead

employers to think that their task is to deﬁne a rule that can be applied

to all employees (a fair policy), stipulating, say, the right number of

days of remote work (a fair outcome), and the right way to implement

that policy (a fair process). But in the minds of employees, “fairness”

is increasingly deﬁned in more personal and relational terms: What consideration am I owed for the eﬀort I give? Do you seem to care

about what is right for me and what makes me most productive and

# innovative?

This shift in what employees understand as fair goes back to well before

## the Covid pandemic, at least in Europe and North America. By the

end of the 20th century, companies had forced new expectations on

## their employees: no more job for life, no more company deﬁned-beneﬁt

pensions. By the 2010s, employees never expected that if they worked

hard and made work-life sacriﬁces, they would necessarily have a secure

job and beneﬁts. There remained the purely transactional contract: I

follow your rules, you pay me for my time.

But how could this contract entice employees to do more than the

minimum—to care enough about their job and company to put in extra eﬀort, thought, and creativity; to be proactive; to engage in extra-role

behaviors? Today, if companies want an employee to care, they need

to show that the work is worth caring about—hence the intensifying

## focus in management literature on company purpose and meaning.

Companies must also show that they care about the individual doing the work. The trouble is that diﬀerent employees and diﬀerent companies think about caring in very diﬀerent ways. One size doesn’t ﬁt all, and

ﬁnding which sizes ﬁt which people is tricky. The fact that psychological

contracts are tacit further complicates this issue—they are not just

unspoken but unconscious and not clearly articulated in people’s minds

until the moment they are broken.

This makes return-to-oﬃce friction a useful focal point. We see four elements in this issue: 1) diﬀerences in individual preferences about the percentage of work people do in the oﬃce; 2) diﬀerences in preferences

about the percentage of work their colleagues do in the oﬃce (few

people are enthusiastic about commuting into a mostly empty oﬃce building to have virtual meetings all day); 3) diﬀerences of belief about

whether people being in the oﬃce is actually good for the company; and 4) diﬀerent assumptions about the right of the employer to set

aside individual preferences for the good of the company. The pandemic further highlighted these diﬀerences as it showed many people that

working from home could even make them more productive—so why

should they be forced to go back to the oﬃce?

Studies show that the diﬀerences don’t line up neatly by demographics:

Stereotyping young people or women as remote workers, for example,

and older men as preferring an oﬃce hides huge amounts of variation. The diﬀerences are so big that no single policy will please everyone.

Further, the psychological contract is predicated on an increasingly

shaky assumption that people can agree about what is in the general

good. The issue, in other words, is with the whole idea that ﬁnding a

best-ﬁt policy is the answer. In our research, we have seen companies

both succeed and fail with ﬁve-days-in-the-oﬃce policies, two-days-in-

the-oﬃce policies, and fully remote work. Success doesn’t depend on

# the policy.

So how should organizations construct a workable psychological

contract now? The answer is rooted in what is known as the ethics

of care. This concept allows leaders to understand the tensions and

## mismatches between the expectations of them and the people they

## lead—in relation to RTO but also more broadly to expectations about

engagement and work. It provides some directions for organizations to

design the conditions for fairer, more caring relations. Let’s go into it in

# a bit more detail.

# The Care Lens

Research on the ethics of care started with the work of Carol Gilligan,

## a developmental psychologist and professor at New York University. In

her 1982 book, In a Different Voice, Gilligan challenged research by her

Harvard mentor, Lawrence Kohlberg, that suggested that girls were less

morally developed than boys. She showed that the girls in his study did

demonstrate the ability to tackle moral questions, but when doing so,

they did not rely on the ethics of justice that boys usually used. Instead,

when making ethical decisions girls leveraged a deep understanding of

# relations and personalized needs.

Gilligan illustrated this using Kohlberg’s ﬁndings and his famous Heinz

dilemma. Heinz’s wife is dying, he is her primary caregiver, and there is only one drug that will save her life. Heinz can’t aﬀord it, no one will

loan him the money, and the drug’s inventor refuses to lower the price.

Should Heinz steal the drug?

The boy reasons that the right to life is a more important principle than

the right to property and so all reasonable people should agree that

Heinz is justiﬁed in stealing the drug. The girl disagrees: If Heinz goes to

prison for the theft, he cannot take care of his wife, and she will just be

in another predicament. In essence, notes Gilligan, the boy’s argument

is based on a perceived universal truth, while the girl’s is more nuanced,

based on the consequences of actions and the way his wife relies on him

# for care.

# HBR / Digital Article / The Workplace Psychological Contract Is Broken. Here’s How to…

Inspired by Gilligan’s theory of ethics as always situated and relational, and broadening the focus beyond gender diﬀerences, the ethics of

care was developed further in the 1980s by philosophers such as Nel

Noddings and in the 1990s by political scientists such as Joan Tronto,

who deﬁned “care” as a practice that includes “everything we do to

maintain, contain, and repair our ‘world’ so that we can live in it as well

as possible.” By the early 2000s, ethics of care was a small and growing

theory in management, and organizational scholars started using it in

their research. Today, it is entering the mainstream media as well as

# business literature.

So, how does it work for a business?

# Adopting a Care Lens in Organizations

While there is no single deﬁnition of “ethics of care,” there are some

key themes that are relevant for organizations, particularly on the tricky

issue of who can work from where.

First, as reﬂected in the Heinz dilemma, the concept is rooted

in the assumption that humans are fundamentally relational and

interdependent. Second, context matters. Unlike the ethics of justice

## and its abstract and universal principles, the ethics of care values

unique and individualized attention and response. It requires being

attentive to and understanding each other’s speciﬁc experience,

including each person’s relative power and relationships. Third,

emotions play a positive role in creating empathic relationships, which

are essential for caring actions.

## In their book, Business Ethics and Care in Organizations, organizational

## researchers Marianna Fotaki, Gazi Islam, and Anne Antoni build on

## the work on the ethics of care in psychology, philosophy, and political

science, developing a theoretical framework for evaluating actions and

interactions between managers and employees from a care lens. They

contrast three questions that one can ask about a given organizational

policy: What is right? What works? What matters?

## Leaning into these questions, Carlos Mendes Gonçalves, CEO of Casa

Mendes Gonçalves (CMG), one of the largest producers of vinegar and sauces in the Iberian Peninsula, has taken a very diﬀerent approach

from leaders who have adopted a blanket approach to RTO. In multiple

interviews with him, we have observed that his approach to hybrid

working and communicating with employees is consistent with what

you would expect from a leader guided by an ethics of care.

First, asking what is right, Gonçalves wondered how he could on the one

hand ask the 350 factory workers to be on-site ﬁve days a week while oﬀering a hybrid model for the 100 employees in the oﬃce. So when

the new HR director joined in September 2024, Gonçalves told her that

she needed to implement a four-day week in the factory to compensate

for the fact that factory workers cannot beneﬁt from hybrid work. This

way, Gonçalves reasons, both groups get a boost to their well-being,

# something that matters to him.

Turning to what works, CMG has implemented a process to make sure the employees could make the shift to a four-day week eﬀectively. After

research on other companies that had made this move (discovering

none in their industry), they started with a six-month pilot with 10–15

people, which they are currently rolling out across the organization.

Then, asking what matters, CMG has planned a study to listen to

their employees, pre-pilot and afterward, to understand not only their

professional needs but also their emotional and social needs. This has

meant training managers to conduct in-person discussions because, as

CMG’s HR director stresses, it is key that the managers themselves are

involved both to hear what matters to their people and to signal that

they are listening, that they care, and that they are working to address

# some of the most important concerns.

To accurately measure outcomes from these initiatives, CMG has put in

## place a data collection plan with experimental and control groups. The

data will include measures of productivity, energy costs, well-being, and

psychosocial risks in the pre-intervention period, intervention periods,

# and then post-intervention.

In most cases, the best person to answer the what matters question

is the line manager, who is familiar with the work context and knows

## the employees better than the executives or human resource managers

designing policies do. One member of a Dell global team, who has been

working remotely for more than 10 years from Europe with a boss in

Texas, told us that, when the company announced that employees had

less than a month to choose between working at least three days in the

oﬃce or else becoming ineligible for promotion or changing divisions,

several reasons were given in terms of what is right and what works—

abstract arguments about the right of employers to set the conditions

of how and where work gets done and the importance of presence

in the oﬃce for learning, creativity, and culture-building. None of the

arguments addressed what matters.

When the announcement was made, the Dell team member told us,

there was a lot of agitation on their work group chats: “Everybody

posted and the messages showed a mix of despair, frustration,

unhappiness, and a feeling of unfairness. People didn’t trust the

company.” The policy was strict: Time in the oﬃce would be tracked

by badging; if you were sick one week, you had to work in the oﬃce

extra days to make up for it. People suddenly faced long commutes and

had to ﬁnd childcare solutions.

But this person’s boss found a way to create ﬂexibility within the

policies by caring about what matters. Acknowledging that it made no

sense for the members of the global team to be in the oﬃce when they work with people in diﬀerent time zones (in early mornings as well

as late afternoons), the supervisor was able to create an exception for

them. “My boss is great,” our contact told us. “She talked to me about diﬀerent options and told me she would support our team.” And the

team, we learned, was more engaged than many other groups the team

member observed across the company.

The CMG experiment and the Dell example both demonstrate that

crafting psychological contracts based on an ethics of care requires

## a careful understanding of context on the part of employees and

the managers they report to. And while it is easy enough to create eﬀective arrangements on a small scale, there are clearly challenges to

be met in shaping and adapting to individual psychological contracts

across large organizations with diverse working environments. Since

work arrangements and employee needs vary enormously, a large

organization has to form a multitude of very local psychological

contracts. This means that many managers will have to engage more

closely with their employees than they are used to. Finally, everyone in the organization then has to accept that diﬀerent arrangements apply to diﬀerent people.

Given these issues, how can large companies make the ethics of care a

# companywide phenomenon?

## Creating a Culture That Supports Care-Based Psychological Contracts

## Ezio Manzini, a designer famous for his work on social innovation

and sustainability, suggests a way to do this. In a recent book, Livable

Proximity: Ideas for the City that Cares, Manzini argues that care is

## fundamental for sustainable, resilient, and healthy cities and societies.

The challenge, he concedes, is that it cannot be designed. But the

good news, says Manzini, is that “we can create the conditions for

care to happen.” Leveraging his work and the ethics of care literature,

we propose three guiding principles for creating a new psychological

contract of care, along with some concrete suggestions for how to put

the principles in action—regardless of whether you’re looking at how

to manage in-person, remote, or hybrid work or dealing with any other

# organizational decisions.

# Relational proximity.

In our 2021 HBR article, we wrote about neuroscientiﬁc research

suggesting that the brain chemistry of people in what psychiatrist

Edward Hallowell calls a human moment—a face-to-face-encounter

(often, but not necessarily, in person) that allows for empathy,

emotional connection, and nonverbal cues to complement what is

## actually said—is distinct from that in purely transactional encounters.

Human moments support care. They may result from a short meetup at

a colleague’s desk or a video call just to chat, but optimism that merely

## bringing managers and employees back to the oﬃce—sometimes

against their will—will automatically mean that people feel more cared

for and care more about their work is misplaced. From a care lens, the

important aspect of proximity is relational, stressing the need, when

interacting and making decisions, to take into account contextual and

## individual variations—and not just logic and reason but also emotions.

However, with hybrid or remote work, one might wonder what

happens to relational proximity and how it might be achieved. When

communication takes place only remotely, the connection is weakened

and nonverbal signals are less easy to pick up on, even when people

are sitting nearby or can see each other on a screen. While relational

proximity might be more diﬃcult to achieve, it still matters, and even

if work is done remotely, it is important to create opportunities for

# in-person meetings.

This is why many tech companies that boast about being 100% online

still have an oﬃce or other space for scheduled meetups, in order to

foster deep relationships through in-person contact. Take Automattic,

## the remote-ﬁrst company behind WordPress and Tumblr, which

employs around 2,000 people. It organizes in-person team gatherings

of multiple kinds, sizes, and length throughout the year. And before the

pandemic, the entire company would meet for a week for an in-person

social and brainstorming gathering. Research on online communities

## like the Open Source community or The WELL (Whole Earth ‘Lectronic

Link) conﬁrms these companies’ instincts, demonstrating that in-

person meetings are important for the development of community

# leaders and relationships.

Companies can also do more to foster relational proximity in the

virtual space. Managers working with a hybrid or remote team need

to do intentionally through technology what comes for free face-to-

## face: Connect with people for short times with no agenda except to

be in touch with them, see how they are doing, signal that you care

about them. We have heard about startups creating Discord rooms for their remote employees in order to replicate the coﬀee machines and

watercoolers where they would chat with their colleagues. But you

could also simply use WhatsApp, Slack, or Team channels to catch up

## informally and share thoughts, personal stories, and emotions. The key

is to have conversations that go beyond the task at hand and get to what

people are feeling.

At the same time, relational proximity shouldn’t be forced or rigid.

You should respect your people’s time: Don’t, for example, schedule

meetings only with regard to your time zone (such as 2:00 p.m. CET

meetings on Fridays when you have team members six hours ahead in

Singapore). Further, be careful to show that you trust people working

remotely—don’t use technology to track them in ways you wouldn’t

if they were in the oﬃce. Invite them to take breaks, and make

sure that meetings are not scheduled back-to-back; leave enough time

between them that, if you were meeting in person, they could go to the

bathroom, catch up on email, or change conference rooms. In short,

show your remote workers at least the same respect for their time and

availability as you would if they were in the oﬃce. Embracing relational

proximity in any work context is about showing care to employees as

individual people rather than cogs in the wheel. Doing that will allow

managers to rebuild trust and strengthen the psychological contract.

# Transparent principles.

A lack of trust and growing resistance to control are why the

psychological contract has been broken. Many of the people we talked

to mentioned that there was more ﬂexibility in terms of working from

home pre-Covid, simply because there were no policies and it was

## an arrangement with their line manager and their team members.

Post-pandemic, however, many organizations decided to adopt policies,

rigidifying practices that used to be contextual and trust-based, with

little room for line managers to interpret them.

But once you replace trust with rules, people’s attitudes to their work

can change. We met one middle manager in a food and beverage

company who told us that when her company formally allowed her

to work two days from home, which she had been doing with the

agreement of her bosses, she started coming into the oﬃce more often.

As she explained, “When I’m at the oﬃce, I don’t need to leave a sign

on my desk to say I’m going to the bathroom.” The formalization of the

arrangement had paradoxically made her feel less comfortable working

# from home than before.

# HBR / Digital Article / The Workplace Psychological Contract Is Broken. Here’s How to…

Taking a care lens invites organizations to develop a policy as a guiding

principle and be transparent about it (while also being ready to adapt).

For instance, the HR director of one of the European oﬃces of an

international consultancy told us that while they have a hybrid option

for all, young graduates have to be fully on-site for their ﬁrst six months.

She explained that these new hires do not complain, because they

are told about it from the start—something missing in cases such as

Amazon and Dell, where employees’ expectations had been set during

Covid and the explanations for bringing them back to the oﬃce were

only given afterward—and the new hires at the consultancy know it is

only for a six-month period. “It’s essential to be clear about not only the

policies but also the rationale explaining them,” the HR director said.

“It’s important to justify your decisions. You can’t just impose things with no explanation.” To be most eﬀective, these explanations need to

address what matters as well as what is right and what works.

# Attentive adaptability.

A care lens requires managers to be attentive to individual contexts and

personal situations. As the CMG case illustrates, attentiveness means

being curious about people—asking questions and testing assumptions.

This can be a challenge. If, as a Gen X manager, you work for On, the

fast-growing Swiss shoe company where 50% of employees are in their

twenties, you have to cross a generational divide in understanding your

Gen Z employees. If, as a neurotypical manager, you work for ASML, the

Dutch company that makes the photolithographic machines central to

semiconductor manufacturing, you have to show care for some of the

roughly 15%–20% of its employees who are neurodivergent and react to the world very diﬀerently.

In a culture of care, attentive managers quickly ﬁnd that they have to

## adapt policies. In one of the North American oﬃces of an international

law ﬁrm, the president realized that while the senior partners were

ready to go back to the oﬃce full-time, their personal assistants were

not. Many assistants had longer commutes and more-complicated

childcare situations than the senior partners. Aware of the importance

of the assistants’ work and acknowledging the necessity for his ﬁrm to

retain them, the CEO decided to adapt the policy to their needs and

allow them to work from home several days a week. In consequence, he

told the senior partners that they would have to adapt and get used to

not having their personal assistants on-site all the time.

Our view is not that policies should never be set or that existing ones

be abolished but that they should be treated as values rather than rules.

Novo Nordisk doesn’t have an enforced rule about hybrid work but

rather it has a formal opinion, which is that people should work in the

oﬃce a little more than at home. So on average you should be working

in the oﬃce more than 2.5 days a week. But one manager we spoke

to explained, “We believe in ﬂexibility,” meaning that employees have

a variety of hybrid work arrangements and exceptions can be granted for diﬀerent reasons. Attentive adaptability suggests that to rebuild

the psychological contract, managers need to move away from a rigid

standard and instead think of a template with guidelines that can be

discussed with employees.

## It Takes Time to Develop a Culture of Care

Creating a culture of care can be challenging for organizations because it’s based in eﬀectiveness, not eﬃciency. This notion is anathema to

most executives and often leads companies to outsource or delegate

care work by sending their managers to customized executive retreats, coaching programs, or special curated events. These eﬀorts are usually

self-defeating, however—on a day-to-day basis, employees can easily

see what the company really cares about.

The ethics of care can bridge this disconnect. If the old psychological

contract called for managers to be rulemakers and fair judges, the ethics

of care requires them to be more like anthropologists, psychologists,

or social workers. When organizations focus on what is right, what

works, and what matters when setting policy—and consider relational

## proximity, transparent principles, and attentive adaptability when

putting it into practice—they can reset the psychological contract

they have with their employees. That’s hard to hurry, but worth the

# investment.
