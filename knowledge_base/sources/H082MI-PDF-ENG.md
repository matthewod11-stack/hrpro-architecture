Remote work, as many of us know, can be isolating. That isolation often

leads to feelings of loneliness, which can cause employees stress and

signiﬁcantly impact their job performance. Absenteeism attributed to

stress and loneliness costs U.S. employers an estimated $154 billion

annually, according to a 2022 article published in the Journal of

isolation have had such a widespread impact on society over the last

ﬁve years that public health oﬃcials have declared the situation an

epidemic. Central to this crisis is a lack of community.

## The Stanford Social Innovation Review deﬁnes community by

recognizing what it is and isn’t:

Community is not a place, a building, or an organization; nor is it

an exchange of information over the internet. Community is both

a feeling and a set of relationships among people. People form and

maintain communities to meet common needs.

As an advisor and coach, I’ve seen how the sense of community can

beneﬁt an organization. I once worked with a global remote company

with approximately 3,000 employees, many of whom enjoyed the

ﬂexibility of remote work. Still, the data and observations showed

a common need: to foster a greater sense of safety, respect, and

care through community. It’s clear that community is an antidote to

# loneliness.

Inspired by my work with this company, and others, this article

## will share some of the evidence-based strategies and approaches that

leaders, managers, and employees under the umbrella of Talent, People,

or Culture can explore to build community in a remote environment.

Remote workers experience three types of virtual distance: physical,

operational, and aﬃnity. Leaders and managers may have less inﬂuence

on the ﬁrst two types. Physical distance refers to employees who work in diﬀerent time zones and geographies. Operational distance

refers to the tools, policies, or procedures that may inhibit successful collaboration, such as poor virtual connections, ineﬀective workﬂows,

or miscommunication. The third type of distance, aﬃnity distance,

refers to the quality of connection among coworkers. This makes it well

within a leader’s sphere of inﬂuence. That is why this article focuses

on building community by enhancing the quality of connection among

# remote coworkers.

Research conﬁrms high-quality connections can be made in small ways,

including respectful engagement, support, trust, and playfulness. The

four practical strategies I discuss below, which I’ve used in my work,

# support this research.

- 1. Reflect on where your team stands right now

As a starting point, I recommend reﬂecting on your team’s potential to

thrive in remote environments and build connections. Consider your

## team and their connections in the framework of risks, respect, and

# relationships with remote work.

# Risks

I’ve heard employees say that forming human connections can be risky:

there’s a risk of exclusion, or being ignored or judged, all of which feel

heightened in remote work. Reﬂect and consider where your team may

stand in terms of barriers to making connections. If anyone on your

team has stated they feel like there’s a risk to making connections,

your ﬁrst step as their leader is to determine whether the risk is real

or perceived. Real risk is based on something that has happened, while

perceived risk is internal and possibly based on an employee’s negative

thought patterns. Regardless of why the risk is there, empathetically

address it so your employees feel safe and so they can trust that work

can be a place of community.

# Respect

Time is one of our most precious commodities — it should be respected.

Wasting it drains energy and dampens motivation, giving employees

less time to do enjoyable and meaningful work. According to a 2023

PwC report, CEOs perceive major ineﬃciencies across routine activities

like decision making, meetings, and emails — viewing roughly 40% of

the time spent on these tasks as ineﬃcient.

As well as time, displaying respect for the individuals on your team will

help foster a stronger sense of community. Employees often cite feelings

of disrespect when managers take credit for their ideas, form a habit

of talking over them in meetings, or micromanage them in a way that

undermines proven capabilities.

As you reﬂect on any roadblocks in your journey to building

community, think about whether you may have broken respect around

your employees’ time or emotions. If you uncover any instances, make it

a goal to express a meaningful apology and, if necessary, show how you

are rethinking your behavior and practices to facilitate change.

# Relationships with remote work

Lastly, reﬂect on each of your employees’ relationship with remote

work. Speciﬁcally, ask yourself:

- 1. What may make remote work challenging for them? They may

identify as having an extroverted personality or a small social circle,

so work has typically provided an opportunity for them to connect

# with people directly.

- 2. How long have they worked remotely? They may have learned

examples of what does and doesn’t work well for them as a remote

worker. By sharing these examples, the team can build a greater sense

of shared support.

- 3. Have they worked at more than three remote companies? Being able to compare what it’s like to work at diﬀerent remote companies may oﬀer good/better/best insights for strategic planning and assist you in your community-building eﬀorts.

- 2. Make recognition meaningful

It was over a decade ago, but I still vividly remember a manager who did

a great job celebrating personal and professional wins. He would rally

the team on occasion and we’d walk over to a quaint confectionery.

In remote environments, where there’s physical distance and employees

may be spread across the country or globe, there aren’t as many

opportunities to engage in in-person celebrations like dinner or

afternoon treats. Employee recognition programs — including thank-

## you notes, milestone celebrations, and employee-appreciation events —

can help provide opportunities for remote teams to celebrate and for

leaders to help embed recognition into the company culture.

At its core, recognition is a signal of value and gratitude for one’s

work. Recognition makes employees feel good and part of something

meaningful. The business impact of recognition is signiﬁcant, too.

According to data from the employee recognition platform Achievers:

- Three-quarters (73%) of workers say recognition would inspire them to

be more productive.

- Two-thirds (64%) of workers say recognition would reduce their desire

# to job hunt.

- More than half (54%) of workers say recognition would reduce the

impact of having a salary below their expectations.

Sometimes, remote teams don’t feel that recognition is as “public”

as it would be if they were in an in-person environment. Virtual

## quarterly town hall meetings, monthly virtual team meetings, or annual

in-person company retreats are all potential opportunities to make

recognition more public. But, the best way to build community with

recognition is to ask your employees how they would like to be

recognized. You can also lessen aﬃnity distance and make recognition

more meaningful by acknowledging the following details:

- 1. What did they do? This highlights and reinforces valuable behaviors

# and skills.

- 2. What did you experience? This adds an element of storytelling and

makes your recognition more memorable and personalized.

- 3. What was the impact on the company and team? This can help

show the employee how their eﬀorts and accomplishments align with

# the company’s goals.

- 3. Provide support for career advancement

According to the Foundation for Social Connection, managers’

interactions with direct reports are among the most powerful

inﬂuencers of employee well-being. And when you enhance the well-

being needs of your employees, you enhance the sense of community

overall. Yet, data by INTOO and Workplace Intelligence shows a

low percentage of employees have formal (34%) or informal (30%)

## conversations with their manager about their career either once a year

or never. But more than half (53%) of employees — and 62% of Gen Z —

would like to talk about their career with their manager more often.

The same study shows 79% of employees want organizational

mentorship or coaching opportunities. Yet, research by Deloitte

shows that Gen Z and Millennial employees express diﬃculty ﬁnding

mentorship/sponsorship opportunities when working remotely. Take

job shadowing, for example. This experimental learning method takes a diﬀerent form in a remote environment because there’s no on-site

observation. As a leader of a remote team, you can help satisfy your

employees’ curiosity by taking a few minutes in a one-on-one meeting

to show them a project or task you’re working on that would be of

interest to them. As an added bonus, when you share your work with

others, you invite diverse perspectives and questions that can help

reﬁne and challenge your ideas and rationales.

A monthly virtual “lunch and learn” is another great way to create

exposure for other roles and deepen your remote team’s appreciation for

## and connection with employees across the company. Cross-functional

projects, where employees take on tasks outside of their area of

expertise, is another popular method of career development that can

be done remotely. Take caution, though, to be sure these projects aren’t

added on top of already heavy workloads.

## Other forms of career support and community building for remote

teams include coordinating skill-based learning sessions presented

by external experts, publicizing industry conferences, announcing

workplace events associated with signiﬁcant days like World Mental

Health Day, or hosting an internal podcast where people discuss what

# inspires them in their work and life.

Ensure career and mentorship opportunities are varied, so that your

team members can pursue those that best align with their needs and

# styles.

- 4. Model communicating as a whole person

According to the 2023 U.S. Surgeon General’s “Advisory on the Healing Eﬀects of Social Connection and Community,” workplaces can foster a

sense of inclusion and belonging among their employees by creating

cultures and practices that encourage people “to connect with one

another as whole people, not just as skill sets.” Here are three ways

you as a leader can model communicating as a whole person with your

# remote team:

Re-frame your response to the question “How are you?”

In virtual meetings, instead of responding to the “How are you?”

## question with a typical, ﬂat response like “Good, and you?” use the

opportunity to highlight your work and life. You could say something

like: “I’m well, thanks. Just ﬁnished wrapping up [a project or task],” or

“I’m excited to be working on [a project or task you’re proud of], and

this evening I’m dabbling in my love for [what you’re doing for fun, as a

hobby, or for self-care and why you enjoy it]. How’s life for you?”

Work and life can easily intertwine — this style of communication

allows you to address both. It’s important for your employees to realize

you’re well-rounded and have a life outside work, too.

## Infuse opportunities for friendship into meetings

Gallup’s research found a sign of friendship at work is the amount

of time that employees talk about unrelated work topics. Friendships

are built when we dedicate time for connection, and that can start

## in meetings with an agenda or in meetings where the entire format

is an open-ended question-and-answer. Tools like Airspeed can help

strengthen the operational and aﬃnity distance, providing an array of

## fun icebreakers that auto-populate in Slack or a mobile app.

# Talk about mental health

Mental health is a growing concern across demographics, generations,

and work models. As a leader, you have the power to create an

environment where people feel safe talking about mental health at

work. Here’s a practical example of a message a leader might send to

# their team:

Hi team,

You may have already gotten a sense of this, but creating a safe

and strong community where it is OK to be vulnerable is essential to

me, just like it is for you. I’ve been struggling with [opportunity for

transparency]. Did you know we have [beneﬁt that you can use for

support]? Here’s [link] where I found it.

The power here is in the follow-up. At the next opportunity, discuss your

message and continue the conversation around mental well-being.

. . .

Building a community in a remote environment requires innovation

and intention, but getting started only takes one act. When followed

through, the process and outcomes are transformative and rewarding

from the standpoint of preventing burnout and impacting the bottom

line, elevating the employer brand, and knowing that you made a diﬀerence in someone’s life. There is far too much at stake for

individuals and corporations to hope in building communities by
