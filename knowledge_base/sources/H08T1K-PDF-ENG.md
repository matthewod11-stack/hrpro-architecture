Proﬁts are lagging, budgets are stretched, and the layoﬀ rumor mill

is cranking into high gear. Your team is looking to you for clarity and

reassurance. What can—and should—you tell your team about the true

state of the business without sending them into panic mode? How can

you highlight the good stuﬀ without creating a false sense of security?

And when do you risk glossing over the real issues that need everyone’s

# attention?

# What the Experts Say

As a senior leader, people look to you for clarity and reassurance. But

when the situation is uncertain, oﬀering that kind of steady conﬁdence

can feel like sugar coating, or worse, lying. Your team has questions.

And while they may not like the answers, they want and deserve

honesty, according to Courtney Lynch, founding partner of leadership

consulting ﬁrm Lead Star and coauthor of Spark, Bet on You, and

Leading from the Front. “Sometimes there’s a tendency to fall back on

phrases like, ‘We’re all in this together,’ or ‘Don’t worry, we’ll ﬁgure it

out.’ But what people need is clarity,” she says. “They’re not looking for

leaders to shine it up or play cheerleader.”

There is a place for positivity, however. Acknowledging uncertainty is

important, but don’t let your team get caught up in overanalyzing it,

says Darcy Eikenberg, executive coach and author of Red Cape Rescue.

Rather, “your goal is to get your team unstuck in the swirl of what-ifs

and help people focus on what they can control right now.” You don’t

need to be a Pollyanna “to magnify the positives and what’s working,”

she adds. Here’s how to strike the right balance.

# Find your footing

Before you say a word to your team, you need to process your own doubts and worries about the diﬃculties facing your organization,

Eikenberg says. “You might have a little of that ‘everything is falling

apart’ feeling; and maybe some of that’s true. But when a leader—the

voice of the company for a group of employees—is stalled there, people

pick up on it.” To ground your thinking, Lynch suggests turning to peers

outside your team and from diﬀerent industries to stress test strategies

and work through scenarios. “They will push your thinking, add value,

and help you make sense of the chaos in a way that’s more thoughtful,”

she says. Working through the gray areas out loud with your team risks

leaving them with unnecessary worry, she adds.

See the good

As you tackle the hard issues, Eikenberg recommends reﬂecting on

where things are on track. Take a cue from improv and use the “yes,

and” framework as a guide. “Yes, things are chaotic—and we’re doing

good work,” she says. “You’ve got to hold what feels like two opposing

views.” When you recognize what’s working even amid the messiness, it

helps your team see it, too, she adds. (More on this later.) One word of

caution: as you zero in on the positives, be careful not to explain away

the negatives by blaming external factors like market conditions or a

down economy. “These realities can be part of the narrative, but don’t

let them become excuses,” says Lynch. “Instead, take responsibility and

focus on what can be improved.”

# Lean into curiosity…

Your team likely has many things weighing on them: What’s the

forecast? Will there be more layoffs? How bad is it, really? It might be

tempting to redirect the conversation, but Eikenberg advises “getting

curious” instead. “The best thing leaders can do is create space for

people to reﬂect, to muse, and wonder,” she says. Ask them questions

about their experience: What are you concerned about? How is it

showing up day to day? And what does this mean for the core project

we’re working on? Beware: A lack of questions from your team doesn’t

necessarily signal all is well. If they’re not talking, Eikenberg suggests

checking in with a few “thermometers” on the ground—project leads,

coordinators, or others who aren’t in formal leadership roles but are

trusted and in the loop—to get a read.

# …And respond with care

Inviting questions is one thing; how you respond sets the tone. Lynch

advises “talking to your team about the ambiguity of the situation, but

not in a way that breeds more uncertainty”—or hollow reassurance.

When you don’t have answers, point to the factors that could shape

the outcome. For example, if an employee asks: Could our team be

restructured? Or Will there be a hiring freeze? You might say: “We’re

tracking these key economic indicators. If our biggest supplier goes oﬄine, that would be a concern.” Even when you have answers,

sometimes discretion is best, says Lynch. “Not because you’re keeping

secrets or being paternalistic, but because sharing is unnecessary.”

When in doubt, “Ask yourself: how likely is this information to aﬀect

this team’s day-to-day reality?” If it will have a signiﬁcant impact, more

clarity is better. But if it’s a minor detail or relates to another group, be

selective with what you disclose.

# Stick to the facts

Steer clear of speculation by focusing on what you know: facts, ﬁgures,

and the progress you see without layering on fear or false hope. Your

message should be a “mix of sober and informative,” says Lynch.

## Acknowledge challenges and uncertainties, and project conﬁdence by

reminding your team members what they’re capable of. “Talk about the

## team’s reserve capacity, additional resources, or the options available,”

says Lynch. “And then add clarity by saying how we’ll navigate the

challenges we face.”

If your team is anxious about job losses, Eikenberg recommends saying

something like: “Our goal is to understand the situation and interpret it

based on the facts. Yes, we had layoﬀs last year—that’s one data point.

Let’s avoid adding more meaning to it than necessary. Instead, let’s ask:

Are we doing the right work for the business today?” Most importantly,

don’t try to put a positive spin on the situation. “You can’t promise job

security, no one can,” she says. But you can help your team see how their work ties into real business objectives, like revenue, eﬃciency, or cost

savings. This way, instead of spiraling, they gain a sense of purpose and

control, says Lynch. “Show your team where their energy, productivity,

and creativity are best spent.”

# Highlight progress

The steady drumbeat of bad news might be inescapable, but it’s not exactly motivating. That’s why you need to “aﬃrm what’s going well,

what can be repeated, and what strong performance looks like,” says

Lynch. Point out where your team is growing by benchmarking against

internal data on quality or speed. “The key is to do so in the context

of big picture challenges, so you don’t come across as tone deaf.” For

example: “We’re ﬁlling orders faster than ever before, even though

overall volume is down. That reﬂects growth in how we work and

deliver.” Eikenberg recommends inviting up-and-coming leaders to

share case studies and success stories that show how the team’s eﬀorts

tie to bigger goals. “As a leader, you need to make the invisible visible,”

she says.

# Model resilience

“Uncertainty isn’t the moment for you to go quiet,” says Eikenberg.

Indeed, silence from leaders can be unsettling as people start to ﬁll

## the gaps with their own often worst-case what-ifs. Eikenberg suggests

steeling yourself by asking not “What should I do?” but “Who do I want

to be?” Being clear on how you want to show up for your team can

help center you in times of stress, she says. It’s about your presence

and approach as much as your words: staying calm, being patient, and

building trust by talking candidly about challenges while still pointing

to what’s possible. Remember: “This is just one drop in the bucket of

your long leadership life,” she says. “The more conﬁdence and clarity

you have about who you want to be, the more muscle you build to

handle it the next time. And there is going to be a next time,” she says.
