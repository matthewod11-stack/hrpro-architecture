## Taylor, a seasoned manager at a midsize tech company, recently

completed a training on how to have diﬃcult conversations. Taylor

found the training valuable. She learned a new model, practiced a

diﬃcult conversation she needed to have with a peer, and got feedback

But Taylor never had the conversation. It felt risky, and she worried how

the person would respond. While Taylor knew this conversation was

important, her own manager rarely communicated so directly, nor did

most of the leaders at her company who were regularly recognized and

promoted.

“Taylor” is a composite of many motivated leaders I’ve worked with

throughout the years who are encouraged and developed to lead in ways

that they don’t see modeled or rewarded at their company.

I’ve previously written about the power in using behavioral science to increase the eﬀectiveness of employee development programs. When,

after completing a training, individuals deﬁne exactly when they will

take action and plan for the inevitable obstacles they will encounter,

they are more likely to achieve their goals and make meaningful

# behavior changes.

However, this focus on individual development doesn’t account for another key variable in any behavior change eﬀort: the context or

environment in which an individual is working. Across nearly all

domains, a person’s context plays a large role in shaping their behavior.

The design of our environment impacts our choices and consequent

# habits.

We are also strongly inﬂuenced by the norms and expectations of other

people within our environment. When we see others around us being

altruistic or exercising, we’re more likely to behave in the same way. BJ

Fogg, founder and director of the Stanford Behavior Design Lab, goes as

far as to say, “There’s just one way to radically change your behavior:

radically change your environment.”

Within an organizational context, senior leaders play a large role in

creating the environment. Edgar Schein, who is considered the “father”

of organizational culture, noted that what leaders pay attention to,

role model, teach, and reinforce will have a signiﬁcant inﬂuence on

organizational culture. A leader who spends all of their time with the

leaders above them while neglecting their own team is sending a signal

about what they believe is important. When a leader refuses to admit

a mistake or weakness, they’re implicitly telling their team it’s not safe

for them to do so either. In Taylor’s case, her manager avoided diﬃcult,

direct conversations and set the tone that conversations like that are not

important enough to prioritize and are okay to avoid.

And yet, all too often, leadership development programs don’t

## adequately account for the culture, norms, and system within which the

leader is working. Leaders may be asked to think long term in a culture

that ﬁxates on immediate results, or they may be taught to collaborate

across organizational boundaries when they’re rewarded for work

within their own group. When leaders and leadership development

practitioners fail to acknowledge the critical role of 1) a company’s

culture and organizational context and 2) the most senior leaders’ role

in shaping that context, they oversimplify and likely undermine their leadership development eﬀorts.

At Intuit, we’ve spent the last ﬁve years working to build a culture that

reinforces, rather than inhibits, positive leader growth. We’ve had our

share of learnings along the way, including the need to modernize our

learning technology, which required signiﬁcant buy-in and investment

from our HR and tech teams. We’ve also been reminded of how diﬃcult

it is for our leaders to consistently prioritize their development in the

midst of limited time and many competing priorities. While we still

have a long way to go, we’ve seen positive feedback, engagement, and

behavior change that suggests we’re on the right track. Hopefully our

experiences can provide inspiration to anyone else on a similar journey.

Below are four actions we’ve taken to ensure our culture supports and

# reinforces leadership development.

# Define leadership.

To start, senior leaders need to clearly articulate what great leadership

looks like at your company and create a shared language around your

leadership expectations. To do this, consider questions like:

- What do our best leaders do really well?

- What will our leaders need to be great at in the future?

- What is unique or special about culture that we expect leaders to

# model and reinforce?

At Intuit, it was important to us that our shared language around

leadership was relevant and applicable to people leaders at all levels

— not just our executives. We also wanted to make sure it was “easy

to remember and recite,” so we avoided making it overly prescriptive

or complex. Ultimately, we focused our deﬁnition on three core

capabilities: 1) Lead with a clear vision; 2) Build a high-performance

culture; and 3) Drive winning results.

The next step is to build out a leadership framework. We call ours

the Leadership Playbook, and it includes three supporting behaviors

for each core capability. Many of the behaviors we included, such as

“Develop people to accelerate performance,” are best practices and

## likely similar to desired behaviors in many other companies and

industries. Others, such as “Stay focused on the customer problem,”

reﬂect our unique company priorities and values.

We’ve consistently received feedback from leaders that codifying these

behaviors has been helpful in clarifying the expectations of them and

providing a framework to address real leadership challenges.

# Model leadership.

If you’re a senior leader, the most impactful thing you can do to ensure

your company’s culture aligns with your leadership expectations is

to personally model your company’s leadership behaviors. As Schein

suggests, your actions will have a disproportionately large inﬂuence on

shaping the culture.

To encourage this at Intuit, we start at the top, with our most senior leaders kicking oﬀ many of our leadership development eﬀorts. When

we initially rolled out the Leadership Playbook at our annual leadership conference, our CEO Sasan Goodarzi and his staﬀ, along with our former

CEO and then-executive chairman Brad Smith, shared their experiences

practicing the playbook behaviors and the ways in which the behaviors showed up diﬀerently based on their unique leadership styles. Our most

senior leaders set the tone for the rest of the organization, and their

actions — much more than their words — indicate what they believe is

# important.

We also try to help leaders build self-awareness about whether

they’re modeling our leadership behaviors. As part of several of our

executive development programs, leaders receive feedback from their

teams and/or manager on the extent to which they’re practicing our

Leadership Playbook. Leaders then create development goals based

on this input to ensure they’re consistently reinforcing and practicing

# these behaviors.

# Teach leadership.

## In the book High Output Management, former Intel CEO Andy Grove

discusses the concept of “managerial leverage” — the actions leaders

can take to increase the output of their organization. He identiﬁes

training as “one of the highest-leverage actions a manager can perform.”

As part of our eﬀorts to build a leadership development culture, we’re

training our leaders to seize upon teachable leadership moments. These

can be formal opportunities — for example, we design nearly all of our

training programs to be at least partly leader-teacher led. We try to

structure these opportunities so that the leader is teaching about a topic

they have passion for and sharing lessons from their own experiences

# and observations.

Teaching can also happen during informal moments that emerge in a

leader’s everyday conversations, 1:1s, and team meetings. We encourage

our leaders to develop a leadership philosophy — what professor and

leadership expert Noel Tichy calls a “teachable point of view.” We

suggest they ask themselves the following questions to develop their

# own teachable point of view:

- What experiences or observations have inﬂuenced my perspective on

# leadership?

- What important lessons have I learned from my experiences?

- How can I codify or simplify my lessons into principles or tangible

# advice?

In our last ﬁscal year, 100% of our EVPs and 88% of our SVPs facilitated

a learning experience. Perhaps not surprisingly, participant attendance,

engagement, and commitment to leadership development programs has

been relatively strong. In our ﬁrst year after launching the Leadership

Playbook, 95% of VPs voluntarily attended our ﬁrst executive program,

# the VP Leadership Lab.

Recognize and reinforce leadership.

In order for your leadership behaviors to stick, they must be

systematically reinforced through your talent and performance systems

and processes. When your performance systems aren’t aligned with the

behaviors you’re promoting, leaders are much less likely to consistently

practice these behaviors. Consider all of the formal and informal ways

you hire, reward, and recognize your leaders. Each of these processes

provides an opportunity to reinforce your organization’s deﬁnition of

# great leadership.

We embedded our Leadership Playbook into our hiring, onboarding,

and performance management processes. We mapped behavioral

interviewing questions to our playbook for use when hiring leaders.

For example, to get at our leadership behavior of “Deﬁne success and

galvanize the team around it,” we included the interview question:

Describe a time that you had to inﬂuence others to move in a direction

they were initially resistant to go in. What did you do?

Every employee is introduced to the playbook during employee

orientation and all new executives take part in a year-long deep dive as

part of our executive onboarding. The Leadership Playbook is the rubric

we use for performance and promotion decisions, and is foundational to

## our company leadership awards and annual leadership conference.

Many organizations have leaders just like “Taylor” — curious,

motivated, and eager to do the right thing for their company and team

but working against organizational headwinds. Taking steps to create

an environment and culture that supports and ampliﬁes, rather than
