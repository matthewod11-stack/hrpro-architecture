Generative AI is changing how we work. Tools like ChatGPT and Copilot

help people write everything from emails to blog posts to plans for

internal analyses 40% faster than they used to, according to a 2023

MIT study. The new technologies are transforming technical jobs in

## particular. A study by MIT Sloan, Microsoft Research, and GitHub

determined that gen AI coding tools can cut programming time by 56%,

# for instance.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Is Your Team Spending the Time Saved by Gen AI?

How should workers use such time windfalls? Experts have been

debating that ever since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, in November

- 2022. Boston Consulting Group, for example, found that many people

devote their extra hours to problem-solving, interacting with others,

or learning new things. Christopher Pissarides, a Nobel Prize–winning

economist, has diﬀerent ideas: He believes that we should leverage this

new free time to improve our well-being and even to move to a four-day

# workweek.

The popular view is that people will use AI-generated time savings

to enhance their personal lives, develop innovations, or increase

## productivity. However, two surveys of 302 AI users and 57 managers

from around the world, conducted by the University of Lausanne,

Switzerland, in early 2024, challenge that thinking. The surveys asked

questions like, Do you save time using gen AI? Do you feel you have

more time for other things? Do you reallocate time for personal or work-

related tasks? How frequently do you waste the time you saved?

The researchers found that gen AI saved the managers about two hours

and 50 minutes a week, on average. Eighty-two percent of them said

that the technology helped them do their jobs faster. But many in that

group failed to fully capitalize on their freed-up time: Thirty-six percent

of them admitted to wasting more than half of it. Similarly, 83% of

people in the gen AI user group who saved time admitted to wasting

at least a quarter of it. When asked how they did use their extra time

productively, more than half of the managers said they just did more of

the same work they’d always done. Few managers said they used it to

connect with others, enjoy their families, learn new skills, or improve

# their physical and emotional health.

“Reallocating time savings requires people to track when they’re saving

time,” says Isabelle Engeler, an associate professor in the marketing

department at the University of Lausanne who is the lead author of the

study. Only once they have a good idea of how much they’ve gained

can they decide how to beneﬁt from it, she argues. “Unfortunately,” she

notes, “many people don’t immediately notice it.” That was true for 37%

of the managers in the study who said that AI had saved them time.

To optimize AI-related time savings, Engeler suggests, managers should

take these four steps:

Be strategic. Focus on gathering information on how much time gets

shaved oﬀ the tasks for which the most signiﬁcant beneﬁts are expected.

But don’t start doing that with too large a group of people; begin with a

# small pilot.

“If your goal is simply to get an estimate of AI-related time savings,

you don’t need many people in your pilot,” says Engeler. “But if your

objective is to monitor the impact of saved time on your team or the

organization as a whole, you need a larger sample.”

Ask people to log their time. Once you’ve decided what and whom to

track, get the chosen employees to record the minutes they save each

day. There are several ways to do this. Employees can self-report by

reﬂecting on their daily activities and estimating how much time AI

saved them, perhaps noting it in diary entries. Or they can simply jot

down the minutes it takes to perform a task without gen AI and then

how long it takes to do it with AI.

Productivity-tracking software like Harvest and ActivTrak, which allow

managers to observe and log how long tasks take, can provide numbers

for the time savings that are more precise and objective than those

generated by self-reporting. Regardless of the method, any form of

tracking should give you a good sense of how much time you have freed

# up.

Asking employees to track time requires that they have the bandwidth

to engage in this process in the ﬁrst place. If they are already

overwhelmed with tasks, they are more likely to move straight to the

next item on their list and tracking time gains may feel like just another

# burden.

Develop a blueprint for reallocating time. Once you have a handle

on how many hours your team will save with gen AI, design a plan

to use them in a meaningful way—for instance, in activities that

promote employee well-being, productivity, and personal growth. Ask

your people how they’ve traditionally spent time savings and where

investing more time would beneﬁt them most. But keep in mind that

as the manager, you are responsible for setting the direction—whether

by urging employees to recharge or prompting them to tackle new

# challenges.

“What employees do with the extra time ultimately depends on how

managers encourage them to use it,” Engeler says. “Employees could

plan to use it for stretching, getting a coﬀee, interacting with colleagues,

or working on a strategic project. Whatever it is, it’s important to

allocate this time purposefully in advance. Without guidance and

preplanned activities, the saved time might easily slip away unused.”

Monitor how the time is redirected. Regular monitoring and feedback

are crucial to help employees make the most of their newfound time.

Managers should stay engaged, observing what their reports do with

time windfalls and promoting eﬀective uses.

“Generative AI tools can boost productivity, and they can help

employees improve work-life balance. But time reallocation requires

a deliberate, intentional, and ongoing approach,” says Engeler. “By

helping employees notice and reallocate their saved time, companies can ensure that AI-driven eﬃciency leads to meaningful changes in the

workplace and beyond.”

## “I Want Them to Use the Time Windfall to Streamline Tasks”

Travis Muhlestein is the chief data and analytics officer at GoDaddy, a

U.S.-based web-hosting company. He manages 440 engineers, business

## analysts, and product-management, machine-learning, and user-experience

professionals. Gen AI has helped them complete in seconds processes that

used to take weeks. He spoke with HBR about how his people are using the

time savings. Edited excerpts of that conversation follow.

Where has your team saved time using

# gen AI?

One notable example is in threat modeling

## for security practices. Traditionally, the

process involves multiple stages of

# detailed analysis. With gen AI we

can automate the submission and

analysis of data-flow diagrams, identify

## vulnerabilities, and suggest mitigations in

seconds. This gives us additional time

# to measure and remeasure accuracy and

security. However, every role and task has

benefited from gen AI.

How have you asked your team to invest the extra time?

To better understand and serve our customers. By automating data

analysis, we can quickly gain insights into their preferences and behaviors.

For example, AI helps us analyze customer interactions and feedback,

allowing us to tailor our products and services to their needs better. This

has improved customer satisfaction and loyalty. We never would have been

able to do it as well without gen AI.

What has gen AI helped you learn?

Customers, especially small-business owners, are particular about the

## design of their websites, logos, and other branding materials. The extra

time gen AI gave us allowed us to uncover patterns in their preferences,

and we may not have been able to delve so deeply into the data without

it. Gen AI also helps us quickly test and iterate on new ideas. We use

it to run numerous experiments simultaneously to identify which new

processes work better than traditional methods. That has led to significant

## innovations and improvements in our products and customer service.

How did you communicate the AI directive to your employees?

A common fear is that AI might take their jobs. Some people don’t even

want to use it. So I emphasize the importance of their career aspirations.

I say I want to help them use the time windfall to further streamline tasks

that hinder their progress. I ask people to imagine how they’d like to do

their jobs three, five, and 10 years from now. What would they automate and

why? Then we try to automate it.

What kind of tasks are your people applying gen AI to?

One of our business analysts proposed a project to improve our support

channels. He developed a system that uses AI to analyze call routing and

ensure that customers are directed to the right support engineer quickly.

It not only improved our efficiency but also demonstrated AI’s potential to

help employees drive innovation. The success of this project has inspired

other employees to explore AI-driven solutions for their work.

How do you recommend that managers track and oversee the time

# savings?

Managers must give employees the space to experiment and fail. I suggest

A/B testing productivity before and after implementing AI. Using control

and variation groups, managers should also run rigorous tests and validate

how employees have budgeted the time windfall. That will help managers

develop guidelines and techniques for how employees use the extra time.

Finally, managers should constantly collect data to track it all.
