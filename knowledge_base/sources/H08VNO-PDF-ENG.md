To Change Company Culture, Focus on Systems—Not Communication Leaders spend too much time on tone and narrative. Instead, they need to model the new culture they’re trying to create. by Benjamin Laker, Chidiebere Ogbonnaya, Yasin Rofcanin, Tomasz Gorny, and Marcello Mariani

Culture is one of the most talked-about priorities in leadership, yet one

of the least consistently understood. Executives routinely declare it is a

strategic imperative. They launch values campaigns, unveil wellbeing

programs, revise mission statements, and deliver impassioned talks

about trust and purpose. But for all this activity, something isn’t

working: in many organizations, we’ve seen that the louder leaders talk

## about culture, the more performative it feels—especially when actions

# don’t align with the message.

Culture shapes everything from decision-making norms to employee

engagement, brand perception to risk tolerance. When it’s mismanaged,

organizations don’t just lose trust; they lose traction.

That paradox became the starting point for our research. To understand

how culture plays out in real time, we conducted a cross-national

## study as part of the “Elgar Encyclopedia of Leadership.” Our aim

was to explore how senior leaders deﬁne, express, and operationalize

culture—and how those eﬀorts are interpreted by the people in the

organization. Over 18 months, we engaged 164 senior leaders across

North America, Europe, and Asia, from organizations in private,

public, and non-proﬁt sectors. Leaders were selected based on their

active involvement in shaping cultural initiatives or overseeing major

cultural change. Through in-depth interviews, team conversations,

## workplace observation, and with access to employee engagement data

and biannual survey tracking for indicators such as trust in leadership,

psychological safety, communication transparency, we examined how

culture is forged not in vision statements, but in meetings, moments,

# and everyday decisions.

A consistent pattern emerged: many leaders treat culture as a

communication strategy. They believe it lives in messaging—in the

## articulation of purpose, the rollout of values, the tone of internal

campaigns. But culture doesn’t shift because a new narrative is

introduced. It shifts when systems change. When leaders take personal

risks. When norms are not just declared but demonstrated.

Our inquiry focused on four key questions:

- How do senior leaders deﬁne and measure cultural impact?

- What disconnects emerge between leadership intent and team

# experience?

- What behaviors signal authenticity—and which quietly erode it?

- And what does it actually take to build a culture that lasts?

What we found was striking: culture doesn’t fail because it’s forgotten. It

fails because it’s misunderstood. It’s treated as branding, not behavior.

As output, not infrastructure. And when that happens—even the most

well-meaning eﬀorts can erode the very trust they’re meant to build.

Here’s what we learned.

# Culture Isn’t a Campaign

In many organizations, work on culture begins with visible gestures.

Leadership teams roll out refreshed values, commission posters, launch

Slack emoji packs, or schedule empathy workshops. While the intent

is often genuine, when these symbolic eﬀorts aren’t accompanied by

a shift in leadership behavior, employees don’t feel inspiredt—they

# disengage.

Our research found that across companies that had launched formal

culture initiatives since 2022, 72% showed no meaningful improvement

## in employee trust, engagement, or retention one year later. Despite the

visibility and investment, employees perceived these eﬀorts as surface-

level — more performance than practice.

The reverse was also true. In companies where senior leaders changed

how they led—how they ran meetings, gave feedback, made decisions,

and responded to challenge—trust scores rose by an average of 26%,

even in the absence of a branded campaign. As one executive told us,

“We didn’t write our values—we reverse-engineered them from how

we wanted to behave.” Another senior leader put it simply: “We didn’t

announce a culture shift. We just started acting like it mattered.”

The problem isn’t the intention—it’s the framing. Culture is still too

often treated like a project: something to roll out, brand, or assign to HR.

Meanwhile, underlying power dynamics, communication habits, and

decision-making norms go untouched, and the deeper operating system

# stays intact.

Employees notice. In fact, 59% told us that senior leadership

actions contradict stated values at least weekly. These aren’t abstract

misalignments—they’re visible breaches that undermine credibility and

sap momentum. No amount of cultural branding can oﬀset that kind of

# signal loss.

# Pro Tip

Before culture can be articulated, it needs to be embodied. Spend

that time reviewing how your senior team actually operates. Where

are decisions opaque? Where does hierarchy dominate? Where does

psychological safety collapse? Start ﬁxing those.

## Values Don’t Count Until They Cost You Something

Executives often champion values like empathy, inclusion, and

integrity. They appear in slide decks, onboarding sessions, and CEO

town halls. But employees rarely judge values by how often they’re

named. They judge them by what leaders are willing to give up

upholding them.

At one global bank, equity was described as a core cultural pillar. The

language was strong and visible. But executive compensation remained

nearly 100% tied to revenue performance. When internal advocates

pushed for incentive alignment, leaders cited market pressure and

deferred action. Over the following year, internal trust scores dropped

## 12%, with the steepest declines among underrepresented employee

groups. The signal was clear: performance still outweighed principle.

By contrast, a telecom company in Latin America tied 13% of senior

leaders’ bonuses to leadership quality, team development, and feedback

culture. This wasn’t just symbolic. It reshaped priorities and rebalanced

how success was deﬁned. Within 12 months, employee retention

improved by 18%, and internal promotion rates rose — particularly in

teams led by managers who engaged directly with the new expectations.

The strongest cultural signals are those that involve visible, personal

risk. That might mean changing how incentives work. It might mean

enforcing values even when it means losing a top performer. It might

mean sharing decision-making power that used to sit solely at the top.

Without that cost, values remain performative — they read as theatre,

# not truth.

# Pro Tip

Employees aren’t waiting for leaders to be perfect. They’re waiting for

them to be consistent—especially when it’s inconvenient. Choose one

declared value. Then ask: where would living this value cost us — power,

money, speed, control? Then, take one visible action in that direction

and be consistent.

# Silence Isn’t Alignment

Leaders often assume they’re hearing the truth. They aren’t.

## In environments with high-status executive cultures, silence can

masquerade as alignment. But beneath the surface, employees are often

## withholding—their concerns, skepticism, dissent.

Our research found that in these environments, 69% of employees

## regularly withhold feedback or concerns from senior leadership. The

top reasons? Futility and fear. Many said they’d spoken up before and nothing changed. Others feared being labeled diﬃcult, disloyal, or high-

# risk.

One European tech ﬁrm tried to address this by launching anonymous

Q&A forums and encouraging open challenge. On paper, the move

looked progressive. But 83% of employees from marginalized groups

reported never submitting a question. When asked why, they cited

a lack of psychological safety and concern that anonymity wouldn’t

protect them from informal backlash. The format had changed—but the

power dynamics hadn’t.

After rethinking its approach, the company introduced a reverse Q&A

format. Employee councils selected and read aloud the most critical,

## uncomfortable questions during executive town halls—on camera, with

no pre-screening. Within three quarters, internal trust scores rose 32%.

Employees said they didn’t just feel heard—they saw that being heard

made a diﬀerence.

The takeaway is simple but often overlooked: people speak when it’s

safe, when it matters, and when speaking leads to change. Culture isn’t

built by soliciting feedback—it’s built by how leaders respond when that

feedback is hard to hear.

Too often, silence is misread as consensus. But in high-power-distance

cultures, silence is more likely to signal disengagement, fear, or learned

helplessness. Real alignment starts with acknowledging that people

won’t raise the hard stuﬀ unless you actively make room for it—and

protect them when they do.

# Pro Tip

At your next town hall, ask a frontline employee to open with one

## uncomfortable observation about culture—chosen in advance by their

peers. Don’t explain. Don’t defend. Just listen, acknowledge, and take

one visible step forward. The point isn’t the question—it’s what you

prove by how you answer.

# The Perk Illusion

When culture feels strained, many executives reach for perks. Mental

## health apps, free lunches, recharge days, wellness stipends—these

oﬀerings are positioned as proof points of a supportive culture. But

when perks are introduced in place of real operational change, they

don’t just miss the mark. They backﬁre.

In our study, one European tech ﬁrm rolled out a full suite of beneﬁts:

## unlimited vacation, ﬂexible Fridays, daily gratitude prompts, and access

to mindfulness tools. On paper, it was generous. But within three

months, internal feedback scores fell sharply. Employees reported

feeling more burned out, not less. The reason? Nothing about the

actual workﬂow had changed. Role clarity remained murky. Deadlines

were still erratic. Slack pings continued after hours. The message was

“unplug” — but the expectation was “stay responsive.”

A similar pattern played out in a Southeast Asian media company,

where management introduced digital detox days and wellness

stipends. Despite the new initiatives, employees reported rising anxiety

## —largely because tight production schedules and last-minute editorial

changes continued to drive daily pressures.

The perks became a pressure point. Employees felt guilty for taking

time oﬀ, unsure of whether they were truly allowed to. One team

member put it bluntly: “It felt like we were being handed self-care

instructions while the house was still on ﬁre.”

This wasn’t an isolated case. Across the organizations we studied,

57% of employees said they felt worse after culture-enhancing

perks were introduced. The most common reason? It reinforced a

sense that leadership was either unaware of deeper problems — or

unwilling to confront them. Instead of addressing low psychological

safety, inconsistent management, or chronic overload, companies were

oﬀering a smoothie bar.

By contrast, organizations that removed surface-level perks and

reinvested in structural improvements—such as manager coaching,

conﬂict resolution, and clearer work boundaries—saw real gains.

Burnout scores dropped by 22%, and perceptions of fairness and

leadership care increased signiﬁcantly.

The lesson: culture doesn’t improve by giving people more. It improves

when you remove the things that waste their time, drain their energy, or

blur their priorities. Perks are not culture. Operating norms are.

# Pro Tip

Kill one popular perk this quarter. Use that budget to solve a known

workﬂow or management pain point—something employees have been

ﬂagging but leaders have been avoiding. Then tell people exactly why

you’re doing it. Signal that culture isn’t just about caring—it’s about

ﬁxing what’s broken.

## Middle Managers Can’t Carry What Executives Won’t Model

In most organizations, culture ﬂows downhill—at least in theory. Senior

leaders announce a set of values or launch a new initiative, then step

back. Middle managers are expected to translate intent into action,

often without the training, authority, or consistency needed to succeed.

In our research, this pattern showed up across sectors. At one global

services ﬁrm, 69% of middle managers said they felt solely responsible

for delivering on cultural commitments. Yet only 14% believed senior

leaders were modeling those same behaviors themselves. That gap —

between responsibility and example—was the single strongest predictor

## of manager burnout across the organization.

The issue isn’t a lack of belief in culture. It’s a lack of modeled alignment

from the top. When executives treat culture as something to delegate

instead of something to live, they create confusion, cynicism, and load-

bearing strain at the middle.

By contrast, one Southeast Asian conglomerate took a diﬀerent

approach. Instead of pushing culture downward, it started at the

top—by redesigning senior leadership meetings to reinforce cultural

alignment. Executives began co-creating agendas with junior staﬀ,

practicing open dissent in front of peers, and recording sessions for

wider team visibility. Within a year, manager alignment scores rose 37%,

and executive credibility improved across every business unit.

The lesson is clear: if culture isn’t consistently modeled at the highest

levels, it won’t take root anywhere else. Middle managers cannot

enforce what senior leaders won’t embody. Culture isn’t a message to

be passed down. It’s a behavior to be practiced up close.

# Pro Tip

Once a month, invite a mid-level manager to silently observe a senior

leadership meeting. Afterward, ask a simple question: What felt aligned

with our stated culture — and what didn’t? Then listen. You’ll learn

## more in that one conversation than in a dozen surveys.

If there’s one ﬁnding that cuts across our research, it’s this: culture

doesn’t fail because people don’t care. It fails because power doesn’t

shift. Leaders talk about trust but make decisions in back rooms. They

champion inclusion but reward conformity. They promote empathy

but penalize dissent. These aren’t communications problems. They’re

# credibility problems.

Across every sector and region we studied, culture only changed when

leaders changed ﬁrst. Not in tone, but in structure. Not in principle, but

in power. The most eﬀective teams weren’t following a campaign—they

were following a pattern. In those environments, culture was shaped by

# three levers:

- Power: Who makes decisions, and who gets heard

- Risk: What leaders are willing to lose to live their values

- Modeling: What behaviors get demonstrated—not just demanded

# If those don’t shift, nothing else will.

So before you announce your next culture initiative, stop. Step back.

Ask: What are we asking people to believe that we haven’t yet proven

through our own behavior? Lead that ﬁrst. Then name it. If you want

your values to land, start by leading in a way that makes them real. Let

action come before announcements—and proof come before praise.
