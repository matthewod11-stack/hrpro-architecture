Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, (LMRDA) as amended

(29 USC §401 et seq.;(http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/401.html) 29 CFR Parts 401 to

## 453(https://www.dol.gov/dol/cfr/Title_29/Chapter_IV.htm))

Who is Covered

# The Labor-Management Reporting and Disclosure Act of 1959, as amended (LMRDA), is administered by the

# Oﬃce of Labor-Management Standards (OLMS). The LMRDA covers unions, oﬃcers and employees of

unions, union members, employers, labor relations consultants, surety companies, trusts in which a union is interested, and other "persons" as deﬁned in the LMRDA who may be covered by particular provisions of the

# Act.

The LMRDA also covers unions representing U.S. Postal Service employees by virtue of the Postal

Reorganization Act of 1970 and unions representing Federal employees through Section 7120 of the Civil

Service Reform Act, and its implementing regulations. The LMRDA does not cover unions composed solely of state and local government employees.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The LMRDA consists of seven titles

Title I, the "Bill of Rights," sets forth certain basic rights that Congress believed Federal law should guarantee to union members. These rights are set forth under the "Employee Rights" section below.

Members may enforce these rights through private suit in Federal district court. (Note: Federal-sector union

members can bring a complaint to OLMS.) The Secretary of Labor also has enforcement responsibilities

with regard to an employee's right to receive and inspect a collective bargaining agreement.

Title II requires unions to ﬁle an information report (Form LM-1), copies of their constitution and bylaws,

and annual ﬁnancial reports (Form LM-2, LM-3, or LM-4) with OLMS. The reports and documents ﬁled with

OLMS are public information, and any person may examine them or obtain copies at OLMS oﬃces.

Oﬃcers and employees of unions must ﬁle a Form LM-30 with OLMS if they have any loans or beneﬁts from, or certain ﬁnancial interests in, employers whose employees their union represents and businesses

that deal with their union. Employers who enter into such an agreement or engage in certain speciﬁed

activities or ﬁnancial dealings with their employees, union, union oﬃcers, or labor relations consultants

must ﬁle a Form LM-10.

Labor relations consultants, who enter into an agreement with an employer to persuade employees about their union activities, or to supply certain information to the employer, must ﬁle a Form LM-20,

# Agreement and Activities Report, and a Form LM-21, Receipts and Disbursements Report.

Finally, surety companies that issue bonds required by the LMRDA or the Employee Retirement Income

Security Act of 1974 (ERISA) must ﬁle a Form S-1 to report data such as premiums received, total claims paid, and amounts recovered. The Secretary of Labor has authority to enforce the reporting

# requirements of the Act.

Title III concerns the imposition of trusteeships over subordinate unions. A parent union may impose a trusteeship only for a purpose speciﬁed in the LMRDA, and it must establish and administer the trusteeship

in accordance with its own constitution and bylaws. A parent union that places a subordinate union in

trusteeship must ﬁle initial, semiannual, and terminal trusteeship reports (Forms LM-15, LM-15A, and LM-

# 16).

Under the LMRDA, the parent union may not engage in certain speciﬁed acts involving the funds and delegate votes from a union under trusteeship. The Secretary of Labor has the authority to investigate and

enforce alleged violations of Title III, and a union member or subordinate union may also enforce the

provisions of this title, except for the reporting requirements, through private suit in Federal district court.

Properly imposed trusteeships are presumed to be valid for a period of 18 months and are presumed to be

# invalid after that period.

Title IV establishes standards for elections of union oﬃcers. Among other things, local unions must elect

their oﬃcers by secret ballot; national and international unions and intermediate bodies must elect their

oﬃcers either by secret ballot of the members or by delegates chosen by secret ballot. Title IV requires

elections to be held by national and international unions at least every ﬁve years; intermediate bodies at least every four years; and local unions at least every three years.

Unions and employers may not use their funds to promote the candidacy of any candidate, although union

funds may be used to conduct an election. A union member in good standing has the right to nominate

candidates, be a candidate subject to reasonable qualiﬁcations uniformly imposed, hold oﬃce, and support and vote for the candidates of the member's choice. Unions must mail a notice of election to every member

at the member's last-known home address at least 15 days before the election.

A union member has the right under Title IV to ﬁle a complaint with OLMS regarding the conduct of a union

oﬃcer election within one calendar month after meeting certain conditions. Before ﬁling an election complaint with OLMS, a member must have either exhausted internal election remedies within the union, or

pursued them for three months without obtaining a ﬁnal decision from the union. The Secretary of Labor

has authority to ﬁle suit in a Federal district court to set aside an invalid union election and to request a new

## election under the supervision of the Secretary.

Title V provides a number of safeguards for unions. Union oﬃcers have a duty to manage the funds and

property of the union solely for the beneﬁt of the union in accordance with its constitution and bylaws. A

union may not have outstanding loans to any one oﬃcer or employee that exceed $2,000. Union oﬃcials

who handle union funds or property must be bonded to provide protection against losses.

A union oﬃcer or employee who embezzles or otherwise misappropriates union funds or other assets

commits a Federal crime punishable by a ﬁne and/or imprisonment. Persons convicted of certain crimes,

including a violation of Title II or III of the LMRDA may not hold union oﬃce or employment for up to 13

## years after conviction or the end of imprisonment

Title VI includes the authority to investigate (see "Penalties/Sanctions" below); a prohibition on a union

ﬁning, suspending, expelling, or otherwise disciplining members for exercising their rights under the

LMRDA; and a prohibition on the use or threat of force or violence to interfere with a union member in the

# exercise of LMRDA rights.

# Title VII amends the Labor Management Relations Act (LMRA), otherwise known as the Taft-Hartley Act,

# concerning strikes, boycotts, and picketing. The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB)

(http://www.nlrb.gov/), an independent Federal agency, administers the LMRA.

# Employee Rights

Title I of the LMRDA guarantees certain rights to all union members. These include the right to nominate

candidates, to vote in elections or referendums, to attend membership meetings, and to participate in the deliberations and vote upon the business of such meetings, subject to reasonable rules and regulations in the

# organization's constitution and bylaws.

They also include the right to meet and assemble freely with other members, to express any views,

arguments, or opinions, and to express views at meetings about candidates in an election of the labor

organization or about any business properly before the meeting, subject to the organization's established and reasonable rules pertaining to the conduct of meetings. Additional rights outlined in Title I address dues,

initiation fees and assessments, protection of the right to sue, and safeguards against improper disciplinary

# action.

# Recordkeeping

Every labor organization subject to the LMRDA, the Civil Service Reform Act (CSRA), or the Foreign Service

Act (FSA) must ﬁle a ﬁnancial report (Form LM-2, LM-3, or LM-4) each year with OLMS, and the underlying

records must be maintained. The recordkeeping requirements for each ﬁnancial report, as well as other

required reports, are explained below. For each of these reports, the underlying records must be kept for at

least ﬁve years after the date the report is ﬁled. Any record necessary to verify, explain, or clarify the report must be retained, including, but not limited to, vouchers, worksheets, receipts, and applicable resolutions, and

any electronic documents, including recordkeeping software, used to complete, read, and ﬁle the report.

# Form LM-1, Labor Organization Information Report. The oﬃcers required to ﬁle Form LM-1 are responsible

# for maintaining records which must provide in suﬃcient detail the information and data necessary to verify the

accuracy and completeness of the report. There are penalties for willfully making any false entry in or concealing, withholding, or destroying any books, records, or statements required to be kept.

Forms LM-2, LM-3, and LM-4, Labor Organization Annual Reports. The oﬃcers required to ﬁle Form LM-2,

LM-3 or LM-4 are responsible for maintaining records which will provide in suﬃcient detail the information and

data necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the report.

Form LM-30, Labor Organization Oﬃcer and Employee Reports. The individual required to ﬁle Form LM- 30 is responsible for maintaining records which must provide in suﬃcient detail the information and data

necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the report.

Form LM-10, Employer Report. The individuals required to ﬁle Form LM-10 are responsible for maintaining

records which will provide in suﬃcient detail the information and data necessary to verify the accuracy and

# completeness of the report.

# Forms LM-20 and 21 (Recordkeeping Requirements for Labor-Relations Consultants). The individual(s)

required to ﬁle Forms LM-20 and LM-21 are responsible for maintaining records which will provide in suﬃcient

detail the information and data necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the report.

Form S-1. The individuals required to ﬁle Form S-1 are responsible for maintaining records which must

provide in suﬃcient detail the information and data necessary to verify the accuracy and completeness of the report. The records must be maintained for at least ﬁve years after the date the report is ﬁled. Any record

necessary to verify, explain, or clarify the report including, but not limited to, vouchers, worksheets, receipts,

and applicable resolutions, must also be maintained.

Every labor organization subject to the LMRDA, CSRA, or FSA must ﬁle a ﬁnancial report, Form LM-2, LM-3,

or LM-4, each year with OLMS. Other types of reports are required in speciﬁc situations; descriptions of these

reports are detailed below.

Pursuant to the LMRDA, the U.S. Department of Labor is required to make all submitted reports available for

public inspection. These reports are available on the OLMS website.

Form LM-1 (Labor Organization Information Report). The LMRDA and the CSRA regulations require that

every covered union adopt a constitution and bylaws and ﬁle two copies with OLMS, along with a Labor

Organization Information Report, Form LM-1. The initial Form LM-1 must report certain information

concerning the structure, practices, and procedures of the labor organization. Labor organizations must ﬁle

the Form LM-1 within 90 days after the date they become subject to the LMRDA, CSRA, or FSA.

# Labor organizations are required to ﬁle an amended Form LM-1 to update the information on ﬁle with OLMS if

# there are any changes in the practices and procedures listed in Item 18, Column (2) of its most recent Form

LM-1. These are changes in practices and procedures which are not contained in the labor organization's constitution and bylaws. The amended Form LM-1 must be ﬁled with the organization's annual ﬁnancial report

for the reporting period in which the change occurred.

Form LM-2 (Financial report). Every labor organization with total annual receipts of $250,000 or more must

ﬁle the Form LM-2. The form includes the organization's assets, liabilities, receipts, salaries, loans, and other

disbursements to oﬃcers and employees of more than $10,000. When determining if the $250,000 threshold has been met, include all ﬁnancial receipts of the labor organization during its ﬁscal year, including receipts of

any special funds, such as "subsidiary organization," deﬁned as an entity that is wholly owned, wholly

controlled, and wholly ﬁnanced by the labor organization. Form LM-2 must be ﬁled electronically.

Certain labor organizations are required to ﬁle Form 990(http://www.irs.gov/instructions/i990ez/index.html), Return

of Organization Exempt from Income Tax, with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS). The IRS has accepted a copy of the labor organization's Form LM-2 in the past to provide some of the information required by Form

- 990. Filing the Form LM-2 with the IRS does not satisfy the labor organization's reporting requirement with the

# U.S. Department of Labor.

The Form LM-2 must be ﬁled within 90 days after the end of the organization's ﬁscal year (12-month reporting

# period).

If the organization went out of existence during its ﬁscal year, a terminal ﬁnancial report must be ﬁled within 30

days after the date it ceased to exist. A terminal ﬁnancial report must be ﬁled if the labor organization has

gone out of business by disbanding, merging into another organization, or being merged and consolidated

with one or more labor organizations to form a new labor organization. The last president and treasurer, or the

oﬃcials responsible for winding up the aﬀairs of the labor organization, must ﬁle a terminal ﬁnancial report for the period from the beginning of the ﬁscal year to the date of termination. A terminal ﬁnancial report is not

required if the labor organization changed its aﬃliation but continues to function as a separate reporting labor

organization. In addition to initial and semiannual trusteeship reports, the organization imposing the

trusteeship is required to ﬁle an annual ﬁnancial report on Form LM-2 on behalf of the trusteed organization.

The Form LM-2 is due within 90 days after the end of the trusteed organization's ﬁscal year and must report the ﬁnancial activities of the entire ﬁscal year. If the trusteeship was imposed during the subordinate labor

organization's ﬁscal year, the ﬁrst report must cover the period prior to the imposition of the trusteeship as

well as the ﬁnancial transactions occurring during the trusteeship. A terminal trusteeship ﬁnancial report on

Form LM-2 is also required within 90 days after the date that the trusteeship is terminated.

Any Form LM-2 ﬁled on behalf of a trusteed organization must include the signatures of the trustees, in addition to the signatures of the president and treasurer or corresponding principal oﬃcers of the organization

which established the trusteeship.

Form LM-3 (Financial report). Labor organizations with total annual receipts of less than $250,000 may ﬁle

the simpliﬁed annual report Form LM-3, if not in trusteeship. Labor organizations with greater annual total receipts and those in trusteeship must ﬁle the more detailed Form LM-2.

# The Form LM-3 must be ﬁled within 90 days after the end of the organization's ﬁscal year (12-month reporting

# period).

If the organization goes out of existence during its ﬁscal year and the organization's total annual receipts were less than $250,000 for the part of the last ﬁscal year during which the organization existed, a Form LM-3 must

be ﬁled within 30 days after the date it ceased to exist. If total annual receipts were more than these limits, the

organization must use Form LM-2 to ﬁle its terminal ﬁnancial report. A terminal ﬁnancial report must be ﬁled if

the labor organization has gone out of business by disbanding, merging into another organization, or being

merged and consolidated with one or more labor organizations to form a new labor organization. The last president and treasurer, or the oﬃcials responsible for winding up the aﬀairs of the labor organization, must

ﬁle a terminal ﬁnancial report for the period from the beginning of the ﬁscal year to the date of termination. A

terminal ﬁnancial report is not required if the labor organization changed its aﬃliation but continues to function

## as a separate reporting labor organization.

Form LM-4 (Financial report). If it is not in trusteeship, labor organizations with total annual receipts of less than $10,000 may ﬁle the abbreviated 2-page annual report Form LM-4. The term "total annual receipts"

means all ﬁnancial receipts of the labor organization during its ﬁscal year, regardless of the source, including

## receipts of any subsidiaries and any special funds.

The Form LM-4 must be ﬁled within 90 days after the end of the labor organization's ﬁscal year (12-month

reporting period).

If the organization goes out of existence during its ﬁscal year, a terminal ﬁnancial report must be ﬁled within 30

days after the date it ceased to exist. A terminal ﬁnancial report must be ﬁled if the labor organization has

gone out of business by disbanding, merging into another organization, or being merged and consolidated

with one or more labor organizations to form a new labor organization. The last president and treasurer, or the

oﬃcials responsible for winding up the aﬀairs of the labor organization, must ﬁle a terminal ﬁnancial report for the period from the beginning of the ﬁscal year to the date of termination. A terminal ﬁnancial report is not

required if the labor organization changed its aﬃliation but continues to function as a separate reporting labor

# organization.

A terminal ﬁnancial report may be ﬁled on Form LM-4 if the labor organization ﬁled its previous annual report

on Form LM-4 and the labor organization's total annual receipts were less than $10,000 for the part of the last ﬁscal year during which the labor organization existed.

Form LM-30 (Union oﬃcers and employees). The LMRDA requires public disclosure of certain ﬁnancial

transactions and ﬁnancial interests of labor organization oﬃcers and employees and their spouses and minor

children. Every labor organization oﬃcer or employee (other than an employee performing clerical or custodial

services exclusively) who has engaged in any such transaction or has any such interest during the ﬁscal year must ﬁle a detailed report with the Secretary of Labor.

The reporting requirements only relate to the disclosure of speciﬁed ﬁnancial transactions and interests. The

reporting requirements do not address whether such economic interests are lawful or unlawful. The fact that a

particular ﬁnancial transaction or interest is or is not required to be reported is not indicative of whether it is or

# is not subject to any legal prohibition; this must be tested by provisions of law other than those prescribing the

# reports.

The types of ﬁnancial transactions and interests which must be reported can be found in the Form LM-30 and include:

Legal and equitable interests in, transactions with, and economic beneﬁts from an employer whose

employees his/her union represents or seeks to represent

Legal and equitable interests in, transactions with, and economic beneﬁts from certain businesses which

deal with the business of the employer whose employees the union represents or seeks to represent, or which deals with the union or a trust in which the labor organization is interested

Certain income and other economic beneﬁts received from certain other employers or labor relations

# consultants

The completed Form LM-30 can be submitted electronically at no cost via the OLMS Electronic Forms System

(EFS). Alternatively, the completed, signed form and any additional pages must be mailed to the following address:

# U.S. Department of Labor

# Oﬃce of Labor-Management Standards

# 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-1519

Washington, DC 20210

Form LM-10 (Employer). The LMRDA requires public disclosure of speciﬁc ﬁnancial transactions or

arrangements made between an employer and one or more of the following: a labor organization, union

oﬃcial, employee, or labor relations consultant. Every employer who has engaged in any such transaction or

arrangement during the ﬁscal year must ﬁle a detailed report with the Secretary of Labor within 90 days after

the end of the employer's ﬁscal year. An employer required to ﬁle must complete only one Form LM-10 each ﬁscal year that covers all instances of reportable activity even if activity occurs at multiple locations.

These reporting requirements only relate to the disclosure of speciﬁed payments. The reporting requirements

do not address whether speciﬁc payments, transactions, or arrangements are lawful or unlawful. The fact that

a particular payment, transaction, or arrangement is or is not required to be reported does not indicate

whether it is or is not subject to any legal prohibition.

The types of ﬁnancial transactions, arrangements, or expenditures which must be reported are set forth in

Form LM-10. The report must include the following: (1) the date of each arrangement and the date and

amount of each transaction; (2) the name, address, and position of the person with whom the agreement or

transaction was made; and (3) a full explanation of the circumstances of all payments made, including the

terms of any agreement or understanding pursuant to which they were made.

The completed Form LM-10 and any additional pages must be mailed to the following address:

# U.S. Department of Labor

# Oﬃce of Labor-Management Standards

## 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-1519 Washington, DC 20210

Form LM-20 (Labor Relations Consultant Agreement and Activities Report). Every person, including a

labor relations consultant, who enters into an arrangement with an employer under which he or she

undertakes activities where an object thereof is, directly or indirectly, to persuade employees about exercising

their rights to organize and bargain collectively, or to obtain information about the activities of employees or a union in connection with a labor dispute involving the employer (except information solely for administrative,

arbitral, or court proceedings) must ﬁle an Agreement and Activities Report, Form LM-20.

These reporting requirements only relate to the disclosure of speciﬁc agreements, arrangements, and/or

activities. The reporting requirements do not address whether such agreements, arrangements, or activities

are lawful or unlawful. The fact that a particular agreement, arrangement or activity is or is not required to be reported does not indicate whether it is or is not subject to any legal prohibition.

# Any person who, as a direct or indirect party(/elaws/ﬁrststep/glossary.htm?glossary_word=party) to any agreement

or arrangement with an employer, undertakes, pursuant to the agreement or arrangement, any activity of this

type must ﬁle a Form LM-20. A "person" is deﬁned to include, among others, labor relations consultants and

other individuals and organizations. A person "undertakes" activities not only when he/she performs the

activity but also when he/she agrees to perform the activity or to have them performed.

The information required to be reported on Form LM-20 includes: (1) the party or parties to the agreement or

arrangement; (2) the object and terms and conditions of the agreement or arrangement; and (3) the activities

performed or to be performed pursuant to the agreement or arrangement.

Each person who has entered into any agreement or arrangement to undertake activities described in the form

must ﬁle the report within 30 days after entering into such agreement or arrangement. Any changes to the

information reported in Form LM-20 (excluding matters related to Item 11.c.) must be ﬁled in a report clearly

marked "Amended Report" within 30 days of the change.

The completed Form LM-20 and any required attachments and additional pages must be mailed to the

following address:

# U.S. Department of Labor

# Oﬃce of Labor-Management Standards

# 200 Constitution Avenue, NW, Room N-1519

Washington, DC 20210

Form LM-21 (Labor Relations Consultant - Receipts and Disbursements Report). Any person required to ﬁle Form LM-20 must also ﬁle Form LM-21, Receipts and Disbursements Report for each ﬁscal year during

which payments were made or received as a result of any agreement or arrangement described in Form LM-

20.

# Form LM-15 (Trusteeship). The LMRDA, CSRA and FSA require public disclosure of certain matters

# pertaining to a trusteeship which a labor organization imposes on a subordinate body. Every labor

organization which has established a receivership, trusteeship, or other method of supervision or control, suspending the autonomy otherwise available to a subordinate labor organization under its constitution or

bylaws, must ﬁle trusteeship reports with OLMS.

A Trusteeship Report, Form LM-15, is required whenever supervision or control has been employed which has

the eﬀect of suspending any right which a subordinate labor organization otherwise has to carry on its own

aﬀairs. Suspension of autonomy will ordinarily include any method of supervision or control which (1) interferes with or restricts the functions of the oﬃcers of the subordinate labor organization; (2) prevents the

members of the subordinate labor organization or, in the case of an intermediate body, their elected delegates

from electing oﬃcers; (3) prevents the members or delegates of the subordinate labor organization from

participating in the business of the organization which may be transacted at regular or special meetings; or (4)

otherwise interferes with the autonomy of the subordinate labor organization; all as provided in the constitution and bylaws or other pertinent documents, and the practices and procedures developed

thereunder, of both the organization which has established the trusteeship and the subordinate labor

# organization.

An initial Form LM-15 must be ﬁled when a parent body imposes a trusteeship on a subordinate body. Form

LM‑15 reports must also be ﬁled semiannually for the duration of the trusteeship.

# Form LM-15A(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/regs/compliance/GPEA_Forms/blanklmforms#FLM15a)

(Report on Selection of Delegates and Oﬃcers). Form LM-15A must be ﬁled with the initial or semiannual

trusteeship report, Form LM-15, or the terminal trusteeship report, Form LM-16. A Report on Selection of

Delegates and Oﬃcers, Form LM-15A, must be ﬁled with an initial, semiannual, or terminal trusteeship report

if, during the period covered by the report, (1) any convention or other policy-determining body met to which the trusteed labor organization sent delegates or would have sent delegates if not in trusteeship; or (2) the

labor organization which imposed the trusteeship over the subordinate organization held an election of

oﬃcers. Form LM-15A, if required, must be ﬁled with the initial or semiannual trusteeship report, Form LM-15,

## or the terminal trusteeship report, Form LM-16.

# Form LM-16(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/regs/compliance/GPEA_Forms/blanklmforms#FLM16)

(Terminal Trusteeship Report). A Terminal Trusteeship Report, Form LM-16, must be ﬁled (along with a Labor

Organization Annual Report, Form LM-2) within 90 days after the date that the trusteeship is terminated. The

terminal trusteeship report must be ﬁled whether the trusteeship is terminated because the subordinate labor

organization is restored to the autonomy otherwise available to it under its constitution and bylaws and the

constitution and bylaws of the labor organization which has imposed the trusteeship or because the subordinate labor organization loses its reporting identity through dissolution, merger, consolidation, or

# otherwise.

# Form S-1(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/regs/compliance/GPEA_Forms/blanklmforms#FLMS1) (Surety

Company Annual Report). The LMRDA requires public disclosure of ﬁnancial information from any surety company which issues a bond required by the LMRDA or the Employee Retirement Income Security Act of

# 1974 (ERISA). Form S-1 must be ﬁled by any surety company having a bond in force which insures the

# following: 1) a welfare or pension plan covered by ERISA; or 2) any labor organization or trust in which a labor

organization is interested. Filers must retain the records necessary to verify the reports for at least ﬁve years.

Each surety company is required to ﬁle the Form S-1, Surety Company Annual

# Report(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/olms/regs/compliance/GPEA_Forms/blanklmforms#FLMS1) (and any required

attachments and additional pages) within 150 days after the end of its ﬁscal year, to the national oﬃce of

OLMS. The LMRDA requires Department of Labor make all submitted forms available for public inspection.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Section 601(a) of the LMRDA authorizes the Secretary of Labor to investigate "in order to determine whether

any person has violated or is about to violate" any provisions of the Act (except the Bill of Rights of Union

Members and amendments made by the LMRDA to other laws), and to "enter such places and inspect such

records and accounts and question such persons" as may be necessary to determine whether a violation has occurred. The Secretary may issue subpoenas to compel testimony or to obtain records and other materials

needed to complete an investigation.

The Secretary may ﬁle civil actions in Federal district court to restrain or correct violations and to bring about

compliance with the LMRDA. The embezzlement of union funds is subject to a ﬁne of up to $250,000 and/or

imprisonment up to ﬁve years. Criminal penalties also apply to other Title V provisions as well as to certain reporting violations under Titles II and III.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws
