Picture yourself ﬁlling out a job application online. You arrive at a

question asking you to provide some demographic information, like

your gender or race. Although several response options are provided,

you notice that your own identity group is not included in the list.

At this point in the process, how would you feel about this potential

employer? Would you expect to feel a sense of belonging if hired?

We explored situations like these, which we term instances of “identity

omission,” in a recent paper. We ﬁnd that the seemingly mundane

choices companies make when designing demographics forms —

such as those used in job applications or employee engagement

surveys — can have relatively major implications. For members of

minority groups, ﬁnding their identity omitted in an organization’s

demographics forms can make them question whether their identity is

valued and respected by that organization.

However, decision makers in organizations may not recognize the

implications of the response options and formats they use in

demographics forms. In this article, we summarize recent research on

## identity omission in demographics forms and oﬀer two low-cost, low-

risk suggestions for how organizations can boost the inclusivity of the

demographics forms they use.

# Identity Omission in Demographics Forms

We conducted a series of experiments to understand how experiencing

identity omission in demographics forms impacts members of minority

groups. Many of our experiments were inspired by real-world instances

of identity omission. Before conducting our studies, we gathered

information on the demographics questions typically asked and

response options provided in job application forms used by several of

the largest employers in the U.S. We noted that 80% of the employers

whose forms we surveyed only included “male” and “female” as

response options in their question soliciting applicant gender. This

means that anyone who identiﬁes their gender in non-binary terms

would experience identity omission when applying to one of these

# companies.

In a related experiment, we asked 200 U.S. residents who identify

as non-binary to ﬁll out a mock job application. One group saw

demographics questions that omitted the non-binary gender identity,

and the other group saw a set of questions that included “non-binary”

as a third response option, along with “male” and “female.” We found

that the former group, who were assigned to experience gender identity

omission, both anticipated that they would feel less sense of belonging

if hired by this company and felt less sure that this company respected

people who identify as non-binary.

Other research has explored consequences of identity omission in

demographics forms for a separate minority group: those who identify

their race or ethnicity as Middle Eastern/North African (MENA). Survey evidence collected by The New York Times this year indicates that

people who self-identify as MENA often experience identity omission

in demographics forms across varied contexts. Respondents reported

that common demographics forms seldom include a response option

that matches the MENA category when soliciting information about an individual’s race. As a result, those surveyed by the Times who identify

as MENA indicated that they are often forced to select a racial option

that they do not feel matches their identity. For instance, most chose

“white” as their best option when forced to select between “white,”

## “Black or African American,” “American Indian or Alaka Native,”

## “Asian,” and “Native Hawaiian or Other Paciﬁc Islander” on the U.S.

# Census form.

To understand how MENA people react to experiencing identity

omission of this nature, Nader Hakim and Nyla Branscombe ran

## an experiment with U.S. undergraduate and graduate students who

were part of an Arab/Arab American student organization. Students

completed a survey that ﬁrst asked for demographic information and

then asked how they felt Americans perceive Arab Americans. In the

demographic portion, students were randomly assigned to one of two

conditions. In one condition, students saw a question requesting racial

identity but omitting the MENA category as an option. In another

condition, the MENA category was included as an option. Hakim

and Branscombe found that, particularly for those students who self-

identify as MENA and also strongly identify as American, ﬁlling out a

demographic form that omitted the MENA racial identity led them to

feel less sure that broader American society respects Arab American

# people.

There are even subtler instances of identity omission, such as situations

in which demographics forms allow a person to partially, but not

completely, self-identify. Addressing this issue, research by Sarah

Townsend and colleagues found that multi-racial people — those

who identify their race as mixed between two or more categories —

often feel their ability to fully self-identify is denied in the context

of demographics forms. Speciﬁcally, participants cited situations in

which demographics forms ask them to identify their membership in

a racial group but allow them to only select one racial identity, rather

than multiple identities. In a follow-up experiment with multi-racial

undergraduate students, Townsend and colleagues assigned one group

to complete a set of demographics questions that allowed them only

to select one racial identity and another group to complete a set of

questions that allowed them to select multiple racial identities. The

researchers found that multi-racial students assigned to the “check one”

condition reported lower self-esteem than those assigned to the “check

all that apply” condition. They also found that those students who were

only able to select one racial identity performed worse on a subsequent,

# achievement-related word search task.

Given these ﬁndings on the prevalence and impact of social identity

omissions, how can organizations do better?

## Rethinking Organizational Demographics Forms

Based on the research that we and others have conducted, here

are two concrete steps that decision makers can take to make their

# demographics forms more inclusive.

- 1. Err on the side of inclusivity.

Research on identity omission suggests that, when organizations are

designing demographics forms, they should err on the side of inclusivity

when selecting response options. Including response options for groups

in the numerical minority in a given setting — such as gender

minorities — may pay big dividends in terms of signaling to members of

those groups that they are valued. To achieve this goal, diﬀerent steps

might be taken for external demographics forms, like job applications,

## and for internal forms, like employee engagement surveys.

## In terms of job applications, for smaller organizations or those

recruiting locally, this could mean taking steps to ensure that the

identity options they provide are broad enough to match the identity

groups represented in their local recruitment base. For instance, an

organization that typically recruits from an area with a large population

## of immigrants and second-generation families from Latin America

might consider using a broader set of options for questions soliciting

## ethnicity (for example, “Guatemalan” or “Salvadoran”) rather than

## catch-all ethnic labels like “Latino/Hispanic.” Indeed, research suggests

that people whose ethnicity would typically be classiﬁed under the pan-

ethnic labels “Latino” or “Hispanic” report more positive feelings when

their unique country of origin is recognized as an ethnic identity.

For larger organizations, or for those that wish to use standard

demographics across all application forms, options for applicant racial,

ethnic, and gender identity could be intentionally broadened to at least

## include groups in the numerical minority in these categories, such as

# non-binary and MENA.

Some decision makers may wonder whether including more expansive

identity options, like a non-binary gender option, may send negative

signals to members of majority groups in that demographic category,

like men or women. Our research suggests this may not be a

large concern. In a follow-up study, we explored whether men and

women respondents reported lower feelings of likely belonging in a

company when mock job applications included (and did not include)

a non-binary gender option. We found that inserting the non-binary

gender option did not impact men’s and women’s anticipated sense

of belonging at the company, suggesting that there may be limited

downsides to using more inclusive identiﬁcation options.

Finally, with respect to demographics used in internal surveys,

organizations interested in avoiding identity omission might consider

surveying a subset of their employees and asking them to indicate their

identities using open-ended, written responses. Organizations could use

data like this to get a better understanding of the diﬀerent identities

their employees may wish to see included as response options in

internal forms. Data like this could also serve as a useful check against

information stored in internal HR systems.

- 2. Broaden the response formats used.

When designing demographics forms, organizations may also beneﬁt

from considering whether a standard, multiple-choice format — where multiple options are provided and only one can be selected

— is required. Several alternative response formats may be viable.

First, when soliciting racial or ethnic identity information in internal

surveys and external applications, organizations may consider allowing

respondents to select as many options as they wish to identify

themselves — using a “select all that apply” rather than a “check one”

format. In this way, respondents who view themselves as holding two

or more racial or ethnic identities will feel liberty to indicate their full

# identity.

Second, decision makers might consider whether certain demographics

questions require a discrete set of response options in the ﬁrst place:

Identity omission is avoided if respondents are simply asked to

manually ﬁll in their identities, such as their gender or race. Of course,

organizations need to be able to turn response options in demographics

## forms into frequency data for internal benchmarking, and so they may

balk at the potential eﬀort involved in deriving discrete categories from

## open-ended responses. However, with the advent of large language

models like ChatGPT, organizations can potentially use human-assisted

AI processes to read through open-ended responses to demographics

questions and categorize those responses and their relative frequencies.

. . .

The steps we’ve outlined in this article would cost organizations little

to nothing to implement. Recent research on identity omission in

demographics forms suggests that taking steps like these could help

organizations reach commonly held goals, such as fostering a sense

of belonging among employees and a positive experience among job

## applicants. With a little bit of thoughtful attention, organizations can

boost the chances that the demographics forms they use include

a broader set of identities that better represent the diverse set of

individuals ﬁlling them out.
