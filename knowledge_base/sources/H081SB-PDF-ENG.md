To attract top talent, employers often pay new hires more than they

pay existing employees in equivalent roles. This isn’t new. But today,

regulatory changes and technological advances have dramatically

increased pay transparency in many sectors, making employees more

aware of these pay disparities. Moreover, data from the U.S. Chamber of

Commerce indicates that the workforce is expected to shrink in 2024,

while a global survey of more than 30,000 employees found that salaries

are expected to increase by an average of 4% in 2024, suggesting that

these pay gaps will likely continue to expand.

But how does this inﬂux of higher-paid workers impact

existing employees, especially top-performing ones? And what can

organizations do to balance the need to recruit new talent with

mitigating the risks of creating increasingly visible pay disparities on

# their teams?

To explore these questions, we used a sample from our customer

## database, the Visier Community Data, of more than 4 million live

employee records from nearly 100 companies across the U.S., Canada,

and Europe during the period of 2018 to 2023. We looked at the tenures

and salaries of higher- and lower-performing employees, leveraging

statistical methods to identify patterns and trends in the data. We were

particularly interested in how likely employees were to resign after the

addition of a higher-paid coworker, as well as the extent to which getting

a pay raise might reduce their chances of resigning.

# Our Findings

Through our ﬁrst round of analyses, we determined that employees

whose pay was increased soon after the addition of a higher-paid

coworker tended to stay in their jobs a lot longer, whereas those who

had to wait for a raise were more likely to quit.

When pay was adjusted within a month of the new addition, existing

employees remained with their companies for an average of another two

and a half years. In contrast, when pay adjustments took six months,

employees stayed on board for an average of just one and a half years,

and when pay increases took an entire year, employees quit an average

of just 13 months after the new hire joined. In other words, employees

resigned more than two times sooner if their employers took a year to

adjust their pay.

## In a second round of analyses on the Visier Community Data, we

found that high performers were disproportionately represented among

resigning employees. While normally, about one in four resigning

employees are high performers, in the aftermath of the addition of

## a higher-paid new hire, that number increases to more than one in

three. In other words, hiring new employees at higher salaries than

existing employees doesn’t just lead to generally higher turnover rates

for current employees — it increases attrition speciﬁcally among the

employees who add the most value to their organizations.

There are a few reasons for this eﬀect. On the one hand, when high

performers feel that their eﬀorts are under-rewarded, it reduces their

motivation, making them less excited about their jobs and more likely

to start looking elsewhere. This is often compounded by downstream

eﬀects, as other employees’ motivation also suﬀers when they see their

team members become demotivated.

There’s also a phenomenon psychologists call the “sucker eﬀect.”

Similar to FOMO, or fear of missing out, the sucker eﬀect refers to

employees’ fear of being a “sucker,” or of doing more than their fair

share and missing out on better opportunities. Interestingly, even

employees who aren’t actively looking for a new job may become more

aware of shifting market prices when a new hire joins at a higher salary,

sparking concerns that they may be being taken advantage of.

Our ﬁndings suggest that even in organizations with limited pay

transparency (i.e., in which existing employees may not know how

much a new hire is making), just the knowledge that new team members

are being hired at all can foster fears among existing workers that they

may not be being paid fairly. A new employee joining the team serves as

a reminder that switching jobs is always an option, pushing people to do

## a reality check around their own job satisfaction.

And ﬁnally, existing employees are likely to resign in response to

sustained pay disparities because these situations signiﬁcantly erode

## their trust in their teams and broader organizations. When people

perceive their organizations as treating them unfairly and paying them

inequitably, their morale and commitment falter, making them that

much more likely to start looking for the door.

# How to Make Compensation More Equitable

The good news is, our research highlights several strategies that can

help managers and leaders address these issues, ensuring that both new

hires and existing employees — especially top performers — are treated

fairly and set up for success.

# Raise awareness.

First and foremost, it’s critical for employers to raise awareness about

the impact of pay inequity across their organizations. That means

dedicating time and resources to training not just for HR teams, but

## also for managers, executives, and any other relevant stakeholders.

It’s also important to note that this isn’t just about reminding people

of the existence of disparities in general. It’s also about identifying

and talking about the particular sensitivities of diﬀerent employees

within a speciﬁc organization or department. For example, analyzing

your company’s retention rates and pay histories for diﬀerent employee

groups can help you identify (and compellingly communicate) where

inequities are causing the most harm. Health care company Providence

conducted such an analysis and determined that with targeted pay

increases, they could actually save $6 million in turnover costs,

illustrating the importance of raising awareness about the impact of pay

## disparities on both individual workers and on an entire organization’s

# bottom line.

# Audit pay equity regularly.

Of course, identifying pay disparities is not a one-and-done activity.

To the contrary, employers should take accountability on an ongoing

basis by conducting regular pay-equity analyses. These audits should

focus on identifying which disparities are fully explainable and which

# represent inequities.

Importantly, the goal isn’t for every employee to make exactly the same

salary, or even for every title to be compensated the same way. The art

of ensuring an equitable pay structure is nuanced and complex, and

it requires leaders to take a range of factors into account, from the

diﬀerent beneﬁts and perks that employees may have negotiated for to

cost of living adjustments to variance in the contributions that diﬀerent

people in similar roles may oﬀer.

This is hard work, and there are no easy answers. However, a critical

ﬁrst step is to ensure that whenever there are any disparities, that there

is at least some way to explain them. After all, the real problems emerge

when pay inequities seem arbitrary, or worse still, turn out to be the

## result of bias rather than relevant factors.

# Address pay inequities ASAP.

Next, once an inequity has been identiﬁed, it’s critical to address

it as soon as possible. While some organizations may be tempted

to leave pay adjustments to annual reviews or lengthy performance

management processes, our research demonstrates that that simply

isn’t good enough. As we mentioned previously, in our study, a delay

of just six months in addressing pay disparities between new and

existing employees led workers to resign 1.8 times sooner than they

otherwise would — and they resigned more than twice as quickly if pay

adjustments took an entire year.

To get ahead of this, rather than waiting for an unhappy top performer

to complain to their manager (or even worse, to just turn in their two

weeks’ notice), organizations should proactively oﬀer compensation

adjustments as soon as they notice a disparity. This doesn’t mean that

new hires can’t be oﬀered competitive rates. But it does mean that if

you want to keep your existing employees, you need to adjust their

# remuneration accordingly.

# Invest in agility.

Finally, for many organizations, this kind of rapid response to pay

inequities necessitates some investment into new tools and processes.

Plenty of well-meaning managers and leaders may fully intend to

correct disparities within their teams, but without the tools to move

quickly and eﬀectively, those good intentions are unlikely to make

# much of a diﬀerence.

That means taking a fresh look at everything from your formal

## performance management systems to your informal norms and

company culture surrounding pay conversations. Does your HR

department depend on outdated, clunky software or slow-moving,

bureaucratic processes? If so, it’s going to struggle to keep up with

the rapidly evolving needs of its workforce. Similarly, are managers

accustomed to engaging in open and transparent conversations with

their reports about compensation and related concerns, or are these

topics so taboo that employees would rather just resign than attempt to

get the raise they feel they deserve?

Adopting more agile processes and mindsets can come with some

growing pains, but these transitions are critical for any employer to stay

competitive. After all, our research shows that to avoid attrition, and

in particular to avoid losing top performers, pay adjustments have to

happen fast.

. . .

The world of pay and compensation is incredibly complex. There are

countless factors to balance, and no guarantees of success — even

with the best of intentions. Moreover, while our research focused on

a general analysis of workforce behavior, prior work suggests that

inequities are likely further exacerbated by gender and racial biases. For

example, data from the Pew Research Center has shown that American

women still make just 82 cents for every dollar earned by men, and that

gap is even greater for Black and Hispanic women.

In addition, every organization faces its own unique challenges. While

our analyses highlight big-picture trends, they represent correlations,

not necessarily causal eﬀects, and they may not hold for all employers.

It’s up to individual organizations to analyze their own data to test

whether they see similar patterns and to identify any eﬀects that may be

## speciﬁc to their environment and workforce.

That being said, our data suggests that unless employers adjust existing

employees’ wages soon after making a higher-paid new hire, employees

tend to resign — and that top performers tend to resign even faster

than others. As such, employers should be aware of the psychological

eﬀects that hiring higher-paid external talent can have on their teams,

they should conduct regular pay equity analyses to ensure that any

disparities are fully explainable, and they should develop the agility

necessary to adjust wages as soon as inequities are identiﬁed.
