When the landscape keeps shifting, decisions that rely on old

assumptions can quickly become outdated. What worked last time may

no longer ﬁt.

In this moment, asking the right questions is one of the most powerful

actions a leader can take. That’s because good questions don’t just help

you ﬁnd answers—they open up your thinking and help you see your

# choices from new perspectives.

Traditional questions aim to reduce ambiguity: What’s the return on

investment? What’s our timeline? How will we determine our key

milestones? But when volatility is the norm, these questions can

unintentionally narrow the ﬁeld of vision too soon, leading teams to

lock in too early, overlook systemic shifts, or delay critical action.

While it’s natural to zoom in on what’s familiar when you’re under

pressure, that instinct can create an illusion of control, blinding you to

emerging risks, obscuring valuable opportunities, or keeping you locked

in yesterday’s logic while the world moves on.

In uncertain conditions, leaders need questions that expand

perspective, generate new insight, and spark creativity. The right

questions don’t just help you avoid missteps—they open new paths.

These are four questions that I use to help my clients work with and

through ambiguity. The answers won’t predict the future—they’re to

help you think more clearly right now, cutting through noise, surfacing

blind spots, and creating momentum when you feel stuck.

- 1. What decision today will still make sense a year from now?

It’s easy to make decisions that solve immediate problems but create

downstream consequences. Asking this question forces leaders to

pause and consider the durability of their choices, injecting long-term

thinking into short-term chaos.

Answering this question doesn’t require perfect foresight, but it does

require clarity: What direction are we truly committed to? What values

do we want this decision to reﬂect? What kind of risk are we willing

to carry forward? The question acts as a ﬁlter—helping teams move

beyond panic or pressure to make decisions that align with where they

want to go rather than simply reinforcing where they are. It prioritizes

## resilience over quick wins and strategy over noise.

Alana, a senior leader at a global consumer brand, was under pressure

to cut costs after a disappointing quarter. Her ﬁnance team presented

a straightforward solution: Eliminate the company’s sustainability

initiatives. The move would produce fast savings with minimal

operational disruption—just what the quarterly report seemed to call

for. But something about the recommendation gave her pause.

After asking herself “What decision today will still make sense

a year from now?”, Alana zoomed out to consider the long-term

consequences of this move. Sustainability had become a key part

of the brand’s identity—especially with its fastest-growing customer

base: younger consumers who cared deeply about environmental and

social responsibility. Slashing those programs might help this quarter’s

margins, but it would send the wrong signal to the market and risk

damaging hard-earned trust.

Instead of cutting the entire program, Alana identiﬁed which

sustainability eﬀorts were most visible and most valued—for example,

the company’s ethical sourcing partnerships. This enabled her to

preserve what mattered most, while pausing or restructuring eﬀorts

that had less direct consumer impact. She communicated the decision

transparently to employees, reinforcing the company’s long-term

commitment while acknowledging short-term constraints.

The question helped Alana resist a reactive decision and instead choose

one that balanced immediate needs with long-term positioning.

- 2. If a year from now this decision was used as an example of our leadership, what would it teach?

In uncertain times, when data is incomplete and outcomes feel

unpredictable, this question helps leaders shift from reactive problem-

solving to intentional meaning-making.

This is more than a reﬂection question—it’s a reframing device. It asks:

What kind of story are we writing with this decision? What would others

learn—not just about what we did, but about how we showed up?

Unlike a question that focuses on whether a decision will stand the test

of time, this question is about what your decisions say about you—your

priorities, courage, and clarity. It’s strategic because it prompts leaders

to widen the lens and consider how their choices reﬂect the culture

they’re building and the example they’re setting.

Take Raj, a vice president at a fast-growing tech ﬁrm, who was leading a

high-stakes product launch. One team member raised ethical concerns

about how user data might not remain anonymous. While the legal team

had signed oﬀ, a gray area remained. Delaying the launch would mean

missing a major investor milestone. The team was split.

Asking “If a year from now this decision was used as an example of our

leadership, what would it teach?” shifted the conversation. It wasn’t just

about timelines or risk anymore—it was about character. What lesson

did they want to model? What did they want their team—and their users

—to remember? Raj decided to delay the launch by two weeks to build in

stronger data protections and publicly explain the change.

The result: The company missed the milestone, but gained internal

trust, external respect, and investor conﬁdence. And a year later, that

decision was held up as a deﬁning example of leadership with integrity.

- 3. What if this isn’t the storm—what if it’s the climate?

This question ﬂips the way leaders typically frame disruption. Rather

than treating volatility as a temporary storm to wait out, it asks you to

consider: What if this is the new normal?

That shift is more than semantic—it’s strategic. It challenges the

instinct to delay, defer, or design for an imagined return to stability,

and it invites you to stop optimizing for recovery and start preparing

for persistence and building for endurance. It encourages investments

in systems, culture, and capabilities that can ﬂex under pressure—not

snap. By confronting uncertainty head-on, leaders move from reactive

to resilient, making choices that don’t just survive the current moment,

but thrive across whatever comes next.

Darryl, COO of a consumer goods company, had been struggling with

a key packaging vendor. Deliveries were late. Quality was slipping. But

switching vendors felt risky—the current one had been with them for

years, knew their specs, and oﬀered decent pricing. So, Darryl kept

pushing for ﬁxes, hoping the issues were temporary.

Then during a meeting with his team to discuss the supply chain, his

procurement lead asked him: “What if this isn’t the storm—what if it’s

# the climate?”

The question ﬂipped the conversation. Instead of treating the vendor’s

issues as short-term turbulence, Darryl began to see a deeper pattern:

Although the relationship had worked for several years, it hadn’t worked

for the past year—a period in which Darryl’s company had expanded

into international markets. Maybe Darryl wasn’t seeing glitches; maybe

the team was seeing a vendor that could no longer serve their expanding

needs. The risk wasn’t in making a change—it was in staying loyal to a

relationship that no longer served the business.

Darryl launched a dual-track plan: Begin onboarding a second vendor

while giving the current one a ﬁnal 90-day improvement window with

clear benchmarks. If the issues continued, Darryl was ready to make the

# switch.

## The result: fewer delays, better quality control, and a stronger position

with retailers. The procurement lead’s question kept Darryl’s company

from waiting for things to “go back to the way they were.” The question

didn’t oﬀer a prediction, it forced a new frame. And that reframing led

# to action.

- 4. What’s the cost of waiting?

In a crisis, the instinct to pause—to wait for more data, for more

certainty, for the fog to clear—can feel responsible and prudent. Leaders

are taught to avoid rushing, to reduce risk, and to base decisions on

# evidence.

## But in volatile environments, the pursuit of perfect clarity often

conceals a hidden cost: the cost of inaction. That’s what makes this

question so strategic. It forces leaders to confront not just the risk of

moving too soon, but the equally dangerous risk of moving too late.

This question shifts the decision lens from fear-based delay to

opportunity-focused action. It encourages leaders to examine what

may be lost by hesitating: market position, momentum, team morale,

innovation windows, or the chance to lead rather than follow. It’s not

ignoring caution—it’s about weighing it against what’s at stake if the

moment passes. In crisis, timing often matters more than precision, and

waiting for a more complete picture can mean missing the window for

# your best move.

Monica, a chief strategy oﬃcer at a small ﬁnancial services company, faced a tough decision about adding a senior marketing oﬃcer in the

## middle of economic uncertainty and volatility in the stock market.

Her instinct was to wait—for six more months of data, maybe a more

stable market, and investors who would be interested in new ﬁnancial

# products.

But in a leadership meeting, she asked out loud: “What’s the cost of

waiting?”

As the team talked it through, they uncovered real risks: failing to get

their name and product in front of potential investors, not reaching

the customers who would beneﬁt from their product, losing out to

competitors, and damaging internal momentum after months of work.

Just as importantly, they realized that waiting for a more stable market

would likely mean tossing out the stack of high-quality resumes on

# Monica’s desk.

By ﬂipping the bias away from fear of acting and toward awareness of

inaction, they made a decision that balanced courage and caution. They

moved ahead with the hire and re-imagined the compensation structure

to heavily reward bringing in new assets. The question didn’t eliminate

uncertainty, but it helped the team move forward anyway, with eyes

# wide open.

## Moving from Hesitation to Meaningful Action

In today’s perma-crisis world, waiting for stability is like waiting for a

train that’s never coming. When everything around you feels unsteady,

using these four questions as strategic tools can enable you to have

better analysis, reframe risk, and strengthen your decision-making

# muscles.

You don’t need perfect foresight to lead well in times of uncertainty,

but having the right questions to ask can shape how you respond. They

reveal faulty assumptions, spotlight hidden opportunities, and help you

focus on what’s within your control. Strategic decision-making isn’t

about having all the answers; it’s about asking the questions that move

## you toward wiser, more resilient outcomes.
