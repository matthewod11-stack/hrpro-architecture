## Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA), as amended (PDF)

(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf)

(29 USC §201 et seq.(http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/201.html); 29 CFR Parts 570 to

## 580(https://www.dol.gov/dol/cfr/Title_29/Chapter_V.htm))

# Who is Covered

The child labor provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) are administered by the Wage and Hour

Division (WHD). These provisions are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and to

prohibit their employment in jobs and under conditions detrimental to their health and well-being. The FLSA

establishes a minimum age for covered employment in agriculture unless a speciﬁc exemption is applicable.

Employees of farms are subject to FLSA's child labor provisions if they are individually engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce. An employee will be deemed to have been

engaged in the production of goods if such employee was employed in producing, manufacturing, mining,

handling, transporting, or in any other way working on such goods, or in any closely related process or

occupation directly essential to its production. The child labor provisions applicable to nonagricultural

employment are discussed elsewhere in this Guide.

In addition, all employees of a farm are covered under the FLSA on an enterprise basis if the annual gross

volume of sales made or business done by the enterprise that owns the farm is not less than $500,000 and the

enterprise employs workers engaged in commerce, or the production of goods for commerce, or who handle

goods that have moved in commerce. Such covered employees include workers employed directly by the

farmer, or by a covered contractor hired by the farmer, who: cultivate the soil or grow or harvest crops; raise livestock, bees, fur-bearing animals, or poultry; perform work which is incidental to the farming operations of

that farm (such as threshing grain grown on that farm), or work oﬀ the farm as employees of the farmer

performing work which is incidental to the farming operations of that farm (such as delivering produce to

# market by truck).

The child labor provisions of the Act set standards for youth employed in agriculture. These same standards

set forth several hazardous occupations orders for jobs that the Secretary has declared to be too dangerous

# for those under the age of 16.

The permissible jobs, by age, in farm work are as follows:

Minors of any age may work at any time in any job on a farm owned or operated by their parents or

## person(s) standing in place of the parent(s).

Minors age 16 and above may work in any farm job at any time.

Minors age 14 and 15 may work outside of school hours in jobs not declared hazardous by the Secretary of

Labor. Minors 12 and 13 years of age may work outside of school hours in non-hazardous jobs on farms that also

employ their parents(s) or with written parental consent.

Minors under 12 years of age may work outside of school hours in non-hazardous jobs with parental

consent, but only on small farms where none of the employees are subject to the minimum wage requirements of the FLSA.

# Detailed information on the occupations determined to be hazardous by the Secretary is available from a local

# Wage and Hour Division oﬃce and in subpart E-1 of Regulations, 29 CFR Part 570. By regulation, employers

must keep records of the dates of birth of employees under age 19, their daily starting and quitting times, their daily and weekly hours of work, and their occupations.

The FLSA also gives an employee the right to ﬁle a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division and testify or

in other ways cooperate with an investigation or legal proceeding without being ﬁned or discriminated against in any other matter.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Every employer of employees subject to the FLSA's minimum wage provisions must post, and keep posted, a

notice(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm) explaining the Act in a conspicuous place in all

of their establishments. Although there is no size requirement for the poster, employees must be able to

readily read it. The FLSA poster is also available in

Spanish(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsaspan.htm), Chinese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwagecn.pdf),

Russian(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/FLSAPosterRuss.pdf), Thai,

(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageThai.pdf) Hmong,

## (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageHmong.pdf)

Vietnamese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageViet.pdf), and Korean(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageKorean.pdf). There is no requirement to post the

poster in languages other than English(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm).

# Recordkeeping

Every employer covered by the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) must keep certain records for each covered(/elaws/whd/ﬂsa/overtime/glossary.htm?wd=covered), nonexempt (/elaws/whd/ﬂsa/overtime/glossary.htm?

# wd=non_exempt)worker.

There is no required form for the records. However, the records must include accurate information about the

employee and data about the hours worked and the wages earned. The following is a listing of the basic

payroll records that an employer must maintain:

Employee's full name, as used for Social Security purposes, and on the same record, the employee's

identifying symbol or number if such is used in place of name on any time, work, or payroll records

# Address, including zip code

# Birth date, if younger than 19

## Sex and occupation Time and day of week when employee's workweek begins

Hours worked each day and total hours worked each workweek

Basis on which employee's wages are paid (e.g., "$9 per hour", "$440 a week", "piecework")

# Regular hourly pay rate

# Total daily or weekly straight-time earnings Total overtime earnings for the workweek

## All additions to or deductions from the employee's wages

Total wages paid each pay period

Date of payment and the pay period covered by the payment

For a full listing of the basic records that an employer must maintain, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements Under the FLSA(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs21.pdf).

Employers are required to preserve for at least three years payroll records, collective bargaining agreements,

and sales and purchase records. Records on which wage computations are based should be retained for two

years. These include time cards and piecework tickets, wage rate tables, work and time schedules, and

## records of additions to or deductions from wages.

# Reporting

The FLSA does not contain any speciﬁc reporting requirements; however, the above referenced records must

be open for inspection by the Wage and Hour Division's representatives, who may ask the employer to make

extensions, computations, or transcriptions. The records may be kept at the place of employment or in a central records oﬃce.

The child labor "hot goods" provision of the Act prohibits the shipment or delivery of goods in interstate

commerce that were produced in or about an establishment where a child labor violation occurred in the past 30 days. It is also a violation of the Act to ﬁre or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for

ﬁling a complaint or for participating in a legal proceeding under the Act.

Employers are subject to a civil money penalty per worker for each violation of the child labor provisions. In

addition, employers are subject to a civil money penalty for each violation occurring after May 20, 2008, that

causes the death or serious injury of any minor employee—such penalties may be doubled, when the violations are determined to be willful or repeated. When a civil money penalty is assessed, employers have

the right to ﬁle an exception to the determination within 15 days of receipt of the notice of such penalty. When

an exception is ﬁled, it is referred to an Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and determination as to

# whether the penalty is appropriate. Either party may appeal the decision of the Administrative Law Judge to

# the Department of Labor's Administrative Review Board. If an exception is not ﬁled within the 15 days, the

penalty becomes ﬁnal.

The Act also provides for a criminal ﬁne of up to $10,000 upon conviction for a willful violation. For a second

conviction for a willful violation, the Act provides for a ﬁne of not more than $10,000 and imprisonment for up

to six months, or both. The Secretary may also bring suit to obtain injunctions to restrain persons from

violating the Act.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

Many states have child labor laws. Nothing in the FLSA excuses noncompliance with a state law that

establishes a higher standard than that provided in the FLSA. See 29 U.S.C. 218(a).

The Department of Labor provides employers, workers, and others with clear and easy-to-access information

and assistance on how to comply with the FLSA. Among the many resources available are:
