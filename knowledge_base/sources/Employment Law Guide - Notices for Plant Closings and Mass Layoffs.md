# Who is Covered

The Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notiﬁcation (WARN) generally covers employers with 100 or more employees, not counting those who

have worked less than six months in the last 12 months and those who work less than 20 hours per week, or those employers with 100 or

more employees, including part-time workers, who in the aggregate work at least 4,000 hours per week, exclusive of overtime. Regular Federal, state, and local government entities that provide public services are not covered. Employees entitled to notice under WARN include

## managers and supervisors as well as hourly and salaried workers.

WARN protects workers, their families, and communities by requiring employers to provide notiﬁcation 60 calendar days in advance of plant closings and mass layoﬀs. Advance notice gives workers and their families some transition time to adjust to the prospective loss of

employment, to seek and obtain other jobs and, if necessary, to enter skill training or retraining that will allow these workers to compete

successfully in the job market. WARN also provides for notice to state dislocated worker units so that they can promptly oﬀer dislocated

worker assistance.

# A covered plant closing occurs when the permanent or temporary closure of a single site of employment or of one or more facilities or

# operating units within a single site of employment results in an employment loss as deﬁned by WARN regulations. A covered mass layoﬀ

# occurs when 50 to 499 employees are aﬀected during any 30-day period at a single employment site (or for certain multiple related layoﬀs, during a 90-day period), if these employees represent at least 33 percent of the employer's workforce where the layoﬀ will occur, and the layoﬀ

results in an employment loss for more than six months. If the layoﬀ aﬀects 500 or more workers, the 33 percent rule does not apply.

WARN does not apply to closure of temporary facilities, or the completion of an activity when the workers were hired only for the duration of

that activity. WARN also provides for less than 60 days notice when the layoﬀs resulted from closure of a faltering company, unforeseeable

## business circumstances, or natural disaster.

Workers or their representatives, and units of local government may bring individual or class action suits. U.S. district courts enforce WARN

requirements. The court may allow reasonable attorney's fees as part of any ﬁnal judgment.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

There are no workplace poster requirements under the WARN Act.

Employers do have notice requirements under the WARN Act.

If an employer orders a plant closing or mass layoﬀ, it is required to provide notiﬁcation to the employees or their representatives, the state

dislocated worker units, (so that they can promptly oﬀer dislocated worker assistance), and the chief elected oﬃcials of local governments.

Notices to employees or their representatives. WARN requires employers to notify either the individual employees aﬀected by a plant

closing or mass layoﬀ or their representatives at least 60 calendar days prior to any planned plant closing or mass layoﬀ. If employees are

terminated on diﬀerent dates, the date of the ﬁrst individual termination within the statutory 30-day or 90-day period triggers the 60-day notice requirement.

Notices to representatives. These notices must contain the following:

The name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or mass layoﬀ will occur, and the name and telephone number of a

company oﬃcial to contact for further information

A statement about whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire plant is to be closed, a statement to that eﬀect

The expected date of the ﬁrst separation and the anticipated schedule for making separations

The job titles of positions to be aﬀected and the names of the workers currently holding aﬀected jobs

Notices to individual employees. If the aﬀected employees do not have a representative, the notice is to be written in language

understandable to the employees and is to contain:

A statement about whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire plant is to be closed, a statement

# to that eﬀect

The expected date when the plant closing or mass layoﬀ will begin, and the expected date when the individual employee will be separated

An indication whether or not bumping rights exist The name and telephone number of a company oﬃcial to contact for further information

The notice may include additional information useful to the employees such as information on available dislocated worker assistance, and, if

the planned action is expected to be temporary, the estimated duration.

Notices to State Dislocated Worker Units and the chief elected oﬃcials of local governments. WARN requires employers to separately

provide notices to the state dislocated worker unit and to the chief elected oﬃcial of the unit of local government in which the aﬀected plant is located. The notice should contain:

# The name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or mass layoﬀ will occur, and the name and telephone number of a

## company oﬃcial to contact for further information

# A statement as to whether the planned action is expected to be permanent or temporary and, if the entire plant is to be closed, a statement to that eﬀect

The expected date of the ﬁrst separation, and the anticipated schedule for making separations

The job titles of positions to be aﬀected, and the number of aﬀected employees in each job classiﬁcation

An indication as to whether or not bumping rights exist

The name of each union representing aﬀected employees, and the name and address of the chief elected oﬃcer of each union

The notice may include additional information useful to the employees such as a statement of whether the planned action is expected to be

temporary and, if so, its expected duration. As an alternative, an employer may give notice to the state dislocated worker unit and to the unit

of local government by providing them with a written notice stating:

The name and address of the employment site where the plant closing or mass layoﬀ will occur

The name and telephone number of a company oﬃcial to contact for further information The expected date of the ﬁrst separation

# The number of aﬀected employees

If the employer chooses the alternative notice, the information required for the longer form of notice must be maintained on-site where it is

readily accessible to the state dislocated worker unit and to the unit of local government.

There are no recordkeeping requirements.

There are no reporting requirements.

WARN is enforced through the U.S. District Courts. Workers, their representatives, and units of local government may bring individual or class

action suits against employers believed to be in violation of the Act. The Department of Labor has no authority or legal standing in any

enforcement action and cannot provide speciﬁc binding or authoritative opinions or guidance about individual situations. The Department of Labor provides assistance in understanding the law and regulations to individuals, ﬁrms, and communities.

An employer who violates the WARN provisions is liable to each employee for an amount equal to back pay and beneﬁts for the period of the

violation, up to 60 days. This may be reduced by the period of any notice that was given, and any voluntary payments that the employer made

# to the employee.

An employer who fails to provide the required notice to the unit of local government is subject to a civil penalty not to exceed $500 for each day of violation. The employer may avoid this penalty by satisfying the liability to each employee within three weeks after the closing or layoﬀ.

WARN does not preempt any other Federal, state, or local law, or any employer/employee agreement that requires other notiﬁcation or beneﬁt. Rather, the rights provided by WARN supplement those provided by other Federal, state, or local laws.

General information about WARN, worker's guide (PDF), and employer's guide (PDF) are available from the Employment and Training

Administration's website. Speciﬁc requirements of WARN may be found in the Act itself and the regulations at 20 CFR Part 639.
