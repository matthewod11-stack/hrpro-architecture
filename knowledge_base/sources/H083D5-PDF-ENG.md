We know that effectively onboarding new employees has huge

## value. A good onboarding process — with clear information on job

requirements, organizational norms, and performance expectations —

not only enhances employee productivity but helps increase loyalty and

engagement, and decreases turnover.

## HBR / Digital Article / Onboarding New Employees — Without Overwhelming Them

And yet organizations consistently fall short. According to a 2022

survey from payroll company Paychex, only about half of new hires are

satisﬁed with their onboarding experience. This failure can preclude

## the formation of an emotional bond between new hires and the

company, impacting engagement and inﬂuencing employee retention.

New employee turnover rates can be as high as 20% in the ﬁrst 45 days,

and approximately one-third of employees leave their new jobs within

# the ﬁrst 90 days of employment.

One common mistake is oﬀering a perfunctory experience that consists

of a day of orientation and a packet explaining beneﬁts. What is less

recognized — but equally destructive and prevalent — is that some

companies “over-onboard” their employees. In my work as a learning

design consultant, I hear stories of managers who, on their new hires’

ﬁrst days, read through every single page of the employee manual with

them and expect them to get up to speed with Slack, email, Box, and

all the other platforms all at once. Or managers who take employees

on a “quick tour” of a manufacturing plant and then point out all the

# diﬀerent features in rapid succession.

While these leaders may be well-meaning and eager to help their new

employees get acclimated to their role, bombarding new hires with a

deluge of information can also backﬁre. Our brains can only process a

ﬁnite amount of new information at one time, and even less when we

are novices. As a result, new employees are susceptible to the impact of

excessive (extraneous) cognitive load during onboarding. This can lead

to diminished performance or even the new hire deciding the new job is

not a great ﬁt, and leaving.

In my research, both in academia and corporations, I’ve identiﬁed three

strategies leaders can implement to help reduce employee overwhelm and ensure new employees are onboarded eﬀectively and eﬃciently.

# Dose information in a logical sequence.

While it may be tempting to give new employees a rapid “ﬁre hose” of

onboarding material, in reality, eﬀective learning is a gradual, eﬀortful

process that requires more than a singular session or even a week

or two. And it turns out (somewhat counterintuitively) the longer the

onboarding process, the faster employees gain proﬁciency, because

they’re able to build on prior knowledge they’ve already assimilated.

Begin the onboarding process with the essential basics, clarify their

relevance, and then build on this foundation in a logical sequence over

time. By doing so, your company will retain more new hires and create a

culture where continuous learning is a clear organizational priority.

For example, one fast-food company adopted this strategy when they

shifted their approach to a continuous learning model. To begin, new

hires go through a focused training program, followed by quizzes on

key topics several times a month. If they fall short on the quizzes, they

go through a retraining process. As a result, the fast-food company’s

turnover rate is less than 29% for frontline workers, signiﬁcantly less

# than the industry average of about 86%.

Be clear about expectations.

A clear understanding of your role is one of the most consistent

predictors of engagement and job satisfaction. If you don’t know what

you’re meant to be doing, you can’t know whether you’re on the right

path — and that uncertainty can take a mental toll.

Without adequate guidance, new hires are left to navigate a confusing

maze of uncertainties, which uses up mental capacity in nonproductive or ineﬃcient ways. Common shortfalls include a lack of clarity about

job responsibilities, task prioritization, reporting structures, deadlines or timeframes, and performance metrics. These ineﬃciencies in

## communication can, for the new hire, generate anxiety, stress, and

reduce conﬁdence, especially if people are afraid of asking for help or

making mistakes.

To ensure role clarity and to set new hires up to make meaningful

contributions, consider the following strategies:

- Provide employees a document that describes realistic expectations

and responsibilities for their role (and make sure it aligns with the job

description). For example, to encourage collaboration and productive

teamwork, include details not just of the new employee’s role, but

how their role ﬁts in with other team members’ roles, and the overall

goals of the organization. Indicate any responsibilities or projects for

which the new hire will take the lead. List task priorities as well as

a rough breakdown of how much time will be allocated to diﬀerent

# responsibilities.

- Set realistic and manageable goals (both short and longer-term). Short-

term goals should be things you are sure the new hire can execute

— for example, scheduling lunch once a month with someone from a

diﬀerent team or creating a schedule to help with time management.

As time goes on, the level of responsibility can increase, and longer-

term goals can be established. These expectations could include tasks

such as taking a public speaking course to enhance communication

skills, taking the lead on a project to get leadership experience, or

achieving a certain number of sales within the ﬁrst year on the job.

- Communicate a vision for what your organization is working to

accomplish and help employees see how they contribute to the

company’s success. For example, if an employee is hired for their

Eliminate “insider terminology” to avoid creating “outsider” anxiety.

## A third, and critical, component of a good onboarding experience

involves making sure new hires feel welcome and a sense of belonging.

There is a real danger that new employees won’t be able to learn about

their job and your organization if they are distracted by worrying about

ﬁtting in, ﬁnding like-minded people to connect with, or questioning

## their place in the grand scheme of things.

One of the surest ways to torpedo a new hire’s sense of belonging is

the use of insider-jargon or acronyms without explanation. Assuming

universal understanding of business terms like “LOE” (level of eﬀort),

or “RCA” (root cause analysis), organization-speciﬁc names like TPS

report (which can mean many diﬀerent things), or the staﬀ’s routine

attendance at the “AERA conference” (these are real examples) is

misguided. New hires are not necessarily in the know about these terms,

and their lack of knowledge slows down understanding and can create

## feelings of exclusion, apprehension, and inadequacy.

This “insider” information also extends to people within the

organization. Consider the experience of a new colleague, Edmund, who

struggled with uncertainty when co-workers referred to other people

at the company by their ﬁrst names. Each time it happened, Edmund

would worry if he should know this seemingly important “Sarah” or

“Juan” (without explicit introductions), and what did it say about him if

he had to ask?

To make sure everyone is in the loop, err on the side of over-explaining

## terms, acronyms, and relationships to new employees. Include full

names and titles when you introduce people within the organization.

Provide new hires with a comprehensive glossary of industry or

## organization- speciﬁc terms, along with a detailed company directory.

This resource can help support new employees in their transition and

ensure a more inclusive and informed onboarding process.

. . .

A great onboarding experience not only increases employee learning

and preparedness to excel in their new role, it also leads to greater

engagement, loyalty, and retention. But while the value of eﬀective

onboarding is indisputable, the reality is that many organizations (even

those studiously trying to avoid under-training their employees) fall

short, going too far in the opposite direction and ﬂooding new hires

with too much information. By implementing strategies that mitigate

cognitive overload, organizations can ensure employees have space,

time, and mental resources available to learn and thrive in their new

# job.
