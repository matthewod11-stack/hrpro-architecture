Despite signs of economic recovery, including lower inﬂation rates and

sustained low unemployment, the start of 2024 has already seen a surge

in layoﬀs, surpassing 10,000 within the tech industry alone at the time

of writing. Macy’s, Wayfair, Ford, and Citigroup are among the other

companies who have already announced layoﬀs this year. This leaves

many workers in a state of uncertainty, waiting to ﬁnd out if they’re next

to be cut.

## HBR / Digital Article / 5 Reasons People Get Laid Off

It’s normal to feel powerless in this position. There’s not much you

can do if your entire business unit is being cut because company goals

have changed and your work is no longer relevant, or if the company

over-hired and revenue has unexpectedly dropped. However, there are

proactive measures you can take that will help you manage your stress.

Here are ﬁve common reasons people are laid oﬀ — and strategies to

help you assert some control over your professional destiny.

- 1. Lack of skills advancement

Employees are 100% responsible for continually upskilling and

reskilling. While companies may oﬀer resources to learn new skills,

they tend to teach to the entire employee population, so most talent

development programs focus on management skills such as giving

feedback, leadership skills such as inﬂuencing without authority, and

soft skills such as emotional intelligence. But employees need to

continue to advance their hard skills, such as becoming technically

## proﬁcient in AI applications or new programming languages. Those who

don’t continue to evolve their skills to keep up with rapidly changing

business needs may be targeted for layoﬀs.

## Recent advancements in generative AI and large language models

(LLMs) such as ChatGPT provide a timely example. While this

technology has been predicted to replace human workers at a large

scale, for now it may be replacing tech workers who don’t have AI skills.

As companies update their core products with this new technology,

they’ll be looking for talent who have LLM expertise. Even if you’re

## an expert in natural language processing, machine learning, or natural

language understanding technologies, if you haven’t gained expertise in

LLMs, which can generate contextually accurate text, answer queries,

summarize text, and preform language translation, then your skills are

already outdated.

Showing a dedication to reskilling yourself in a new space and

demonstrating those skills during the transition to a new way of doing

business could save your job. Therefore, employees should take a

proactive approach to gaining skills and knowledge based on where the

market and company are heading to ensure their skills remain relevant.

- 2. You’re an “overseer,” not a “doer”

When companies decide to implement budget cuts, the ﬁnance

department typically allocates a speciﬁc percentage reduction to each

department. The most straightforward method to meet the assigned cut

percentage is to eliminate the positions of individuals with the highest

salaries, particularly if they’re not actively involved in accomplishing

the work. Managers who lack hands-on involvement may be seen as

less valuable to the organization, as there is a perception that they’re

not directly contributing to task and project execution. This perception

could increase the likelihood of them being considered expendable

# during cost-cutting measures.

Managers who are invaluable to an organization ﬁnd a balance between

strategic leadership and hands-on involvement without micromanaging

their teams. They’re perceived as more adaptable and capable of

responding quickly to changes, making them more resilient in volatile

business situations. Managers who have deep understanding of team

dynamics, challenges, and goals and who can demonstrate their ability

to speak to the details will make seem like they’re the glue holding the

team together, which makes it harder to see their role as dispensable.

- 3. Lack of visibility

Being the quiet worker bee won’t protect you from being laid oﬀ. In fact,

being invisible could be your downfall. When determining which roles

to cut, if senior leadership doesn’t know who you are, what you do, or

the impact you make, your job could be an easy choice for elimination.

In times of organizational changes or restructuring, being visible can

help mitigate the risk of being overlooked or underestimated.

Your visibility can act as a form of job security by ensuring decision

makers are aware of your capabilities and impact. Having visibility at

all levels in an organization can help you create a strong network of

colleagues and senior leaders who can vouch for your contributions and

accomplishments. It could also show leaders you can succeed if plugged

into any position. If decision makers have a clear understanding of your

skills, achievements, and contributions, they’re more likely to view your

position as essential to the success of the company, or they may see you

as the person to combine teams under when other roles are eliminated.

- 4. Lack of performance

When companies need to cut their budgets, they’ll likely try to eliminate

those who are considered non-performers. Where more than one person

is doing a particular job, layoﬀs provide managers a ripe opportunity to

cut low performers without having to do the hard work of giving them

more feedback or putting them on a performance improvement plan.

Employees must realize their manager’s perception means everything.

So even if you think you’re doing a great job, if your manager doesn’t

agree, you could be deemed a poor performer and be on the chopping

block. Therefore, employees need to proactively request feedback from

## their managers more often than just during the performance-review

period. Once you receive feedback, continually work on improving, and

check back in with your manager to see whether they agree that your

performance has improved.

- 5. Offshoring and automation

The automation or oﬀshore relocation of speciﬁc jobs is determined

based on strategic, economic, and operational costs as well as

technological advancements. Companies may opt for oﬀshoring to

countries with lower labor costs where the talent pool is rich with

expertise. They may also implement automation technologies that prove more eﬃcient and accurate than human labor to cut expenses

associated with salaries, beneﬁts, and operational overhead. The World

Economic Forum’s 2023 Future of Jobs Report delves into which jobs

will likely shift toward automation, minimizing the need for human

# interaction.

To safeguard against a potential layoﬀ, it’s critical to stay informed

about market trends and assess whether your chosen career is prone

to oﬀshoring or automation in the future. In some cases, U.S.-based

companies may have a U.S. manager overseeing oﬀshored talent or

automated processes. That may pose further challenges for early-career

professionals who want to grow into management positions and are

seeking experience through jobs that have been oﬀshored or automated

to get there. If you discover your job is one that’s likely to be automated

in the future or you see trends moving toward oﬀshoring your type of

position, ﬁnd ways to gain new skills that will help you transition to

another ﬁeld with less risk and will be just as (if not more) fulﬁlling. For

example, you could take on a stretch project in another department at

your company or form a side hustle consultancy.

. . .

Building a reputation for being a valuable team member through your

work and relationships is key to minimizing your risk of being laid oﬀ.

Ensure your leadership and cross-functional stakeholders know your

contributions and the impact you bring to the organization as well as

where you’ve upskilled to stay relevant, which will help position you as

an indispensable asset. This proactive approach helps ensure that your

value is recognized long before any decisions about layoﬀs are made.
