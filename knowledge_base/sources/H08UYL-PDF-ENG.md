In many organizations, transparency is held up as a leadership virtue.

Open communication fosters trust, signals authenticity, and helps

employees feel informed and included.

But as leaders step into executive roles, the context changes. Casual

remarks often carry the weight of a mandate. What once felt like honest

candor can become counterproductive. A passing comment may be

interpreted as a directive. An offhand thought can trigger unnecessary

confusion or anxiety. Instead, you have to master executive presence,

where how you speak matters as much as what you say.

That’s why strategic editing is a critical senior leadership skill. It’s

knowing what to say (and what to leave out), how to say it, and when

silence is more powerful. First-time CEOs and other new C-level leaders

often ﬁnd that the communication habits that served them earlier

in their careers don’t scale well at the top. To communicate more eﬀectively, leaders need to develop the skill of saying less with greater

# impact.

# Five Types of Overcommunicating Leaders

In high-stakes environments, people look to senior leaders for clarity,

conﬁdence, and stability. When communication is unﬁltered or unclear,

it creates confusion or fear, even if the intent is transparency.

Through our work coaching C-suite clients, we’ve identiﬁed

ﬁve common overcommunication styles. Importantly, these aren’t

personality ﬂaws; they’re signs of a missing skill: the ability to

## communicate with executive-level precision.

- 1. The Straight Shooter

This leader shares unﬁltered thoughts in the name of honesty. They

value candor and believe in “telling it like it is.”

But without thoughtful framing, blunt statements can damage morale

and shut down growth. Especially at the executive level, how comments

about the business or people are delivered is just as important as what’s

being said.

A CEO one of us (Jordan) worked with had a tendency to share direct, unbuﬀered thoughts about segments of the business at all-hands

meetings. While on one hand the team appreciated his candid style,

on the other, certain people felt taken for granted and disrespected.

Through coaching he learned to pause before saying what was on

his mind and consider how he wanted his audience to feel. He

maintained his direct approach but got better at framing comments

# more constructively.

- 2. The Idea Generator

## This leader shares too many early ideas without strategic framing.

They thrive on creativity and innovation, but teams can become

overwhelmed or confused when new ideas are shared without context or

when priorities are already in motion.

One founder frequently pitched new innovation projects during team

## meetings. While imaginative, the constant inﬂux of new initiatives

## diluted focus on the company’s core advertising business. Through

executive coaching with one of us (Tutti), he introduced a structured

“5% innovation time” and began clearly distinguishing between

exploratory concepts and strategic priorities. This shift preserved his

creative energy while enabling the team to stay focused on execution.

- 3. The Anxious Communicator

This leader overshares uncertainty in the name of transparency.

They want to be honest and real but often broadcast indecision or

internal anxiety too early. During organizational change, this can

leave teams feeling unmoored rather than informed, contributing to

change exhaustion when repeated ambiguous updates erode employee

# conﬁdence and clarity.

One CEO Jordan coached wanted to be transparent as he navigated shifting return-to-oﬃce plans. With his executive team, he often shared

his evolving thoughts—and worries—in real time, sometimes leaning

toward full-time return, other times suggesting permanent remote

work. The frequent reversals were meant to keep people in the loop but

instead left his team confused and anxious, which made it harder for them to communicate eﬀectively with their own teams. By pausing to

ﬁnalize his thinking before communicating and aligning his tone with

a sense of direction, he helped his team and the organization relax and

# regain clarity.

- 4. The TMI Leader

This leader blurs personal and professional boundaries. Especially in

organizational cultures that emphasize authenticity or “bringing your

whole self to work,” some leaders overcorrect. While empathy is a

critical leadership skill, blurring boundaries by oversharing personal

stress, doubt, or emotion can erode credibility and create discomfort.

Consider a founder Tutti worked with, who regularly opened team oﬀsites by sharing personal struggles, hoping to foster connection.

Instead, team members began questioning her steadiness and

judgment. She needed to better balance her authenticity with the

intention behind why she was sharing, and pick what and when to share

# and not to share.

- 5. The Detailed Over-Explainer

This leader overloads meetings with unnecessary complexity. They equate thoroughness with clarity, oﬀering too much context or diving

into technical details. In executive or board settings, this can lose

the audience, triggering side conversations about minor points and

becoming a distraction that derails meeting focus.

One functional leader we worked with lost credibility in cross-

functional meetings by diving into minutiae, explaining every nuance

before arriving at a recommendation. We suggested he shift his style to lead with a clear synthesis of the issue and oﬀer detail only when

asked. He practiced providing his headline recommendation ﬁrst,

followed by the top three or four concise reasons why. As a result, his

colleagues were more engaged and clear about his point of view, and

the conversation stayed on track. And, of course, he still had the details

in his back pocket if questions came up. Colleagues reported that his

communication style became sharper and more impactful.

## How to Hone the Skill of Strategic Editing

Strategic editing is the skill of adjusting your communication to match

your role. It’s not about withholding information; it’s about choosing

what’s most essential to say, how to say it, and when it’d be more eﬀective to say nothing at all. Here’s how:

- 1. Recognize that everything you say (or don’t say) carries weight.

Executive communication is always ampliﬁed. A passing comment can

redirect strategy. A sigh in a meeting can spark anxiety. That’s why

being intentional about what you communicate and how you deliver it

is critical for creating the impact you intend.

Practice being explicit about what you’re communicating and what you

do and don’t know:

- “I’m just thinking out loud right now…”

- “I have feedback from the board that I want to share and discuss. We’re

not going to make a decision today; I want to explore the issue with

you ﬁrst.”

- “I’ve had some ideas on ways to adjust our strategy that I’d like

to discuss with you. To be clear, I’m not saying this is a new

direction. Today I just want us to consider where we are, the shifting

environment, and what might make sense going forward.”

- “We had a tough quarter, and we may need to shift our go-to-market

strategy. I don’t know if that’s true yet, but I want to discuss it.”

- 2. Clarify your audience and outcome.

What do you want your audience to think, feel, and do after hearing

you? Make it a practice to ask yourself three simple questions before

communicating widely:

- Who is my audience?

- What do they care about right now?

- What do I want them to be thinking/feeling/doing as result of my

# communication?

This may sound obvious, but in our experience, far too many senior

leaders forget to take this critical step and ultimately impact people in a

way they didn’t intend. Strategic editing starts with clarity of intent.

Jordan worked with a tech CEO who was perceived as insensitive.

His team was under a lot of pressure and driving hard in a

competitive market. The team felt that he always wanted more without

acknowledging their hard work, struggles, and accomplishments along

the way. This led to venting between team members outside of team

# meetings.

After receiving feedback, the CEO started to make a point of asking

himself how his team was feeling before he stepped into a meeting

to share his perspective with them. He got better at acknowledging

the team’s concerns, needs, and successes—not just challenging them. As a result, the team felt like he understood the diﬃculties they were

facing, cared about their well-being, and genuinely wanted to help them

to be successful. This created a more motivating environment for all

concerned.

- 3. Prepare or pause.

## A lot of executive communication happens in real-time exchanges when

you don’t have time to prepare. Good strategic editing also means

developing strong impulse control and recognizing, in the moment,

when an idea surfaces that’s half-formed or emotionally charged. In this

situation, it’s critical to pause. Write the idea or thought down. Give

yourself a few minutes to consider if sharing it will distract from the

core topic and cause unhelpful ripples, or whether it would be better

to discuss it later when you’ve had time to think through the best

# approach.

We saw one ﬁrst-time CEO at a large, facilitated gathering of senior leaders take the whole meeting oﬀ track. The CEO wasn’t happy with the

focus of the conversation and in the middle of the meeting insisted on

a complete change of direction. The result? Awkward confusion, a lot of

## startled side conversations, and a poor meeting result.

We’ve also seen C-level leaders in startups, where the environment

is more casual, have had a hard time keeping signiﬁcant structural

changes such as reductions in force or reorgs to themselves, resulting

## in a lot of internal angst and distraction.

Sometimes the most strategic move is to say nothing. This can be

challenging for extraverted leaders used to thinking out loud, or highly

driven leaders who like to move fast. But timing matters. What you share now versus next week or next month can signiﬁcantly aﬀect how

a message is received. Embrace the pause. The rule of thumb is that if

you’re at all unsure of whether or not you should say something in real

time, don’t.

- 4. Frame your message strategically.

How you say something shapes how others interpret it. Behavioral

economics research by Amos Tversky and Daniel Kahneman shows that people respond very diﬀerently to the same information depending on

how it’s framed. For example, presenting a medical treatment as having

a 90% survival rate feels very diﬀerent from describing it as having a

10% mortality rate, even though the data is the same.

For leaders, framing is especially important when communicating

ambiguous, messy, or evolving information. It helps create structure

and signals conﬁdence. One startup CEO Tutti worked with received

## a request from a major customer for more direct access to the

core product. While this move could have created doubt among her

employees, the CEO framed it instead as an experiment to test a new

service model in the spirit of customer learning. This message preserved

conﬁdence in the company’s direction while creating space to explore.

- 5. Pressure-test your communication.

Especially now with so much change, uncertainty, and ambiguity,

senior leaders need safe spaces to process their thoughts conﬁdentially.

Whether with a coach, mentor, or trusted advisor, ﬁnd someone who

can help you think through your evolving ideas and messages before

you share them more broadly. You’ll especially want to pressure-test and

reﬁne your message before a high-stakes setting such as an all-hands

## meeting, a contentious performance review, or a major client pitch.

Ask a trusted advisor:

- How does this message land with you?

- What do you take away from it?

- What needs to be changed, clariﬁed, or simpliﬁed?

- How can I make it more inspiring and impactful?

Pressure-testing helps you distill your message, reduce noise, and walk

## into the room with clarity and conﬁdence.

At the executive level, your words carry more weight and come with

greater responsibility. Strategic editing is about being more deliberate, not less transparent. The most eﬀective leaders don’t just share what

they know or think; they share what their teams need to hear in order to

# act with clarity, conﬁdence, and focus.
