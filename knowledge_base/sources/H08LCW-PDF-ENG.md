The fastest way for recruiters to determine if you have the necessary

skills and experience for a job is by asking, “Can you walk me through

your resume?” It sounds like an easy question, but don’t be fooled

— your answer will determine whether the recruiter considers you

a serious candidate. Recruiters aren’t looking for a laundry list of

accomplishments or responsibilities. Instead, they want a focused

narrative that highlights why you’re the perfect ﬁt for the new role.

Here’s the catch — you need to deliver your answer in less than two

minutes no matter how many jobs you’ve had and how many years

you’ve worked, or you could risk losing the recruiter’s attention.

Here are three steps to ensure that your response to this crucial question

leaves a lasting impression.

- 1. Highlight your experience through the lens of the new job

Determine which accomplishments, skills, and capabilities from each

of your past jobs are directly relevant to the job description’s key

## requirements. Don’t repeat the same responsibilities from one job

to the next; the goal is to show career progression which aligns

with the role you are pursuing. For example, the job description for

a Paid Media Director role includes language such as, “Own client

relationships, creating media planning strategy from cross-platform

data. Must have familiarity with social media, email, and DSP platforms.

Successful candidate will have excellent writing, reporting, and project

# management skills.”

If a candidate with seven years’ experience as a media planner in two

diﬀerent jobs wants to align their experience to the job description, they

would start from their ﬁrst job after school and progress toward their

# current position:

I started my career as an associate media planner at [agency name]

where I mastered project management skills while supporting ten

directors. I researched and analyzed target audiences, reported on

ad campaigns across platforms, and wrote data-driven strategic

plans which were presented directly to the clients. Within two years, I

was promoted to own and manage client accounts and built strong

## relationships with Client Name 1 and Client Name 2. Through

strong strategy development, I was able to drive a 20% increase in

## brand awareness for [client #1] within six months with a strategic

media planning campaign on social and digital, and a 22% increase

## in brand awareness for [client #2] within three months through

programmatic ad campaigns on a DSP, where I targeted speciﬁc

audience segments to optimize ad placements for maximum reach

# and engagement.

This statement covers ﬁve years of work, and it includes everything this

candidate needs to say to explain her foundational skills from her ﬁrst

two jobs. Mentioning her promotion proves she learns quickly and could

demonstrate an impact from her skills, which directly relates to the new

# job.

- 2. Build clear transitions between jobs

When explaining job moves, it’s essential to provide context that

## demonstrates intentionality and alignment with your career growth.

Highlight the reasons for each move — were you seeking to develop

speciﬁc skills that are now crucial for the role you’re applying for? Did

a former manager or colleague recruit you because they valued your

expertise? Mentioning this highlights your professional reputation. If

you changed industries or shifted careers, explain how the transition

was a strategic step that prepared you for the responsibilities of the

position you’re pursuing. In continuing the previous example:

After ﬁve years at [agency name], a former manager recruited me

to join [new company name] as an International Senior Media

Planner. This move allowed me to build on my expertise planning

and executing multi-channel campaigns for global brands.

# Or

After ﬁve years at [agency name], I wanted to grow my skills and

understanding of international media campaigns, so I accepted

a position at [new company name] where I worked on global

campaigns. Here I was able to grow my experience in diverse

## audience research, cross-cultural media strategy, and global media

buying and negotiation, which resulted in a 30% increase in website

## traffic and a 25% improvement in lead generation for one of my

# clients within the ﬁrst quarter.

If you moved jobs every one to two years, your explanation for changing

jobs must make sense and be delivered with conﬁdence. If you were

terminated in a mass layoﬀ, you can mention that the company changed

strategy or cut programs, and your job was impacted. If you were ﬁred

for performance, view your termination through your own positive

perspective and use that as your transition statement. For example,

At [former company], I was working 60-hour weeks so there was

no time to focus on a job search to gain international experience

working with global brands. I departed to spend time ﬁnding that

next opportunity and within ﬁve months, a former colleague referred

# me to a role at [new company].

Then continue with one sentence on what you accomplished at the

new company that is relevant to the prospective job. Again, this

demonstrates that colleagues valued your work, even if your former

company let you go.

The key is to be proactive and ﬁll in breaks in employment before you

are asked about them. Yes, it’s okay to say you took time oﬀ to raise

children, but talk about how you kept your skills updated during that

time, such as, “While I took a break to raise my children, I attended

numerous conferences to keep my skills fresh, such as the ANA Masters

## of Marketing, Content Marketing World, and Digital Summit. I also

completed my IAB Digital Media Buying and Planning certiﬁcation to

ensure that my skills remained fresh.”

It’s also ﬁne to say you took time oﬀ to travel the world. Most people

would be jealous! An example would be, “After ﬁve years at [agency

name], I took time oﬀ to travel the world. There is no better teacher

of diﬀerent cultures and communication styles than fully immersing

yourself. That experience was invaluable in landing my next role as an

international media planner at [new company name] because I didn’t

just study cultural diﬀerences — I lived them. Experiencing ﬁrsthand

how people across regions consume media, engage with brands, and

respond to advertising gave me a unique perspective that allowed me to

craft campaigns that truly resonated with global audiences.

What you don’t want to focus on is the negative, such as being burned

out, needing to take time oﬀ for your mental health, or hating your

manager. When you don’t have a deep relationship with an interviewer,

such statements could make them question whether you can be

successful in the job under less than perfect conditions — and no job

is perfect.

- 3. Showcase your unique value

Identify what sets you apart from other candidates and weave it into

your narrative of past roles. Highlight speciﬁc skills, experiences, or

perspectives that bring unique value to the role you’re pursuing. For

example, if you have a background in ﬁnance, emphasize how it equips

you with a data-driven approach to aspects of the new role. Or, if you’re

transitioning from a creative ﬁeld like journalism to marketing, focus

on the transferable skills that will drive results in the new role. For

# example:

As an award-winning journalist, I developed exceptional storytelling

and audience engagement skills, which have been instrumental in

bringing a unique value to my current marketing position. In my

Marketing Manager role at [company name], I crafted compelling

campaigns across TV, web, and social media that increased brand

engagement by 40%. My ability to understand diverse audiences and

communicate effectively enables me to create content that resonates

and drives measurable outcomes — skills I’m eager to bring to your

# company.

Be bold in drawing clear connections between your unique skills

and the role you’re interviewing for, showcasing how your experience

enables you to deliver exceptional value beyond what other candidates

can oﬀer. Connecting your experience to the job you are pursuing

and showing progressive skills acquisition throughout your career in

a succinct story will leave the interviewer satisﬁed that you are capable

of succeeding in the new role. Highlighting your unique skill is the icing

on the cake that not only sets you apart from the competition but also

makes you a more memorable and compelling choice for the job.
