As a leader, you’ve noticed something feels oﬀ with your team. After

years of remote work, your company has shifted to a hybrid or fully in-oﬃce model—but the return hasn’t been seamless. Meetings feel

clunky, casual collaboration is inconsistent, and relationships that once

felt natural now require more eﬀort. Hoping to rebuild connection and

alignment, you decide to plan a leadership team oﬀsite.

With more organizations mandating in-oﬃce time, this is a pivotal

moment to strengthen teamwork and redeﬁne how your team works

together. Oﬀsites can be a powerful catalyst for this—but only when

designed with clear intent. Many leaders assume that starting with

the end in mind is enough to ensure a successful oﬀsite, but in our

experience, that’s just the beginning.

## As executive coaches with extensive experience designing and

facilitating oﬀsites for corporate clients, we have seen that the most

impactful oﬀsites go beyond setting objectives—they address the deeper

questions that drive real change. While clarifying your goals is an

obvious ﬁrst step, this article oﬀers ﬁve additional—often overlooked

—outcome-oriented questions that will help you design an oﬀsite that

delivers lasting results.

- 1. How do you want your team to feel?

Considering how you want your team to feel has meaningful

implications on the design and delivery of the day. Take a utilities

company leader who planned an oﬀsite for her newly established

leadership team. When one of us (Marissa) asked how she wanted the

team to feel, she said “cozy, comfortable, and connected.” This intention

led to a shift in venue—from a sterile hotel conference room to an

inviting rental home. The informal setting fostered deeper connections,

achieving the desired emotional outcomes.

An animal health leadership team was planning an oﬀsite with the

focus of strengthening collaboration. When asked about how she wants

the team to feel, the CEO reﬂected and said, “valued, celebrated, and

supported.” Recognizing the team’s resilience through a challenging

year, we reshaped the agenda to begin with a collaborative strengths

exercise. Everyone had the opportunity to acknowledge each of

their peers’ strengths. The exercise immediately boosted morale and

reinforced the emotional impact she aimed to achieve. Not only that,

the feeling lasted, fueling intensiﬁed collaboration in a more systematic

way. Being really intentional about the emotions you want to create is

very valuable in crafting the right type of experience.

- 2. What is getting in the way of your team’s success?

A large retailer’s leadership team was consistently struggling to make decisions eﬃciently. This ﬂaw was preventing the team from operating

to their fullest potential and contributing to unnecessary delays on key

initiatives. Diagnosing the issue, the leader disclosed that the team

lacked clarity on how decision-making works and who to include in

# which decisions.

At the oﬀsite, speciﬁc decision-making tools to support decision-

making were discussed and speciﬁcally applied directly to three real-

time situations. By providing the right tool and using it directly on

actual situations, the team immediately clariﬁed their decision-making

process going forward.

- 3. What shift in behavior will set your team on a new trajectory?

Consider in what ways you hope things will be diﬀerent when

examining the “before” and “after” of the oﬀsite. A great oﬀsite is a

memorable milestone in the team’s story, after which, it is on a new

trajectory. That diﬀerent trajectory can only be created with diﬀerent

# behaviors after the session.

For example, an education non-proﬁt leadership team wanted to

transform their meetings from passive status updates into dynamic

discussions that harnessed everyone’s best thinking. The team had

historically avoided conﬂict, resulting in surface-level conversations

and missed opportunities for robust problem-solving. At the oﬀsite,

they discussed the need for more productive debate and co-created

a set of operating norms for navigating conﬂict, such as encouraging

diverse perspectives and practicing active listening. To reinforce these

behaviors, they scheduled time in each leadership meeting to tackle

complex issues and actively practiced their norms during the session.

This shift led to more engaged and impactful meetings post-oﬀsite.

- 4. What do you want your team to stop doing?

Oﬀsites always generate new actions to the team’s to-do list. Less

commonly do leaders think about what can be subtracted. In order

to create capacity to operate eﬀectively and implement new ideas,

exceptional leaders know they need to create room for it.

One of Frans’s clients is the CEO of a ﬁnancial services organization.

After a recent restructuring, she knew the current resource allocation

## wasn’t in line with the strategic focus of the business. The question

of how her team allocates internal resources was paramount. In a speciﬁcally focused oﬄoading session at the beginning of the

oﬀsite, the team identiﬁed ways-of-working and friction that could be

eliminated to free up capacity. Dozens of ideas were generated. The

team selected three items as a team and each selected one item as an individual to immediately oﬄoad. The feeling of release was palpable,

and the exercise turned out to be a ﬁre starter for the whole organization —inspiring more oﬄoading, creating capacity for highest value work.

- 5. How are you going to make it stick?

An oﬀsite oﬀers people a pause in their regular routines to connect

and reﬂect before they often default back into the daily busyness

trap. But lasting adjustments and changes are possible and have the

greatest signiﬁcance. Making it stick has to be considered as part of the

# planning, not as an afterthought.

Allocate time at the end of the oﬀsite to align with the team on a

handful of commitments. Set expectations that all participants will be

held accountable, and track the team’s progress vs. commitments on a

quarterly basis. Intervene when progress isn’t demonstrated and reward

continuing eﬀorts when they are.

Another approach to ensuring follow through is to establish champions

who will hold the team accountable for certain commitments. For

example, a media company’s leadership team developed new operating norms at their oﬀsite to improve decision-making eﬃciency. To ensure

the norms stuck, they assigned a “norms champion” for each team

meeting—a rotating role responsible for monitoring adherence and

gently calling out deviations. They also scheduled a 30-day follow-up

session to reﬂect on what was working, adjust the norms, and reinforce

their commitment. These steps helped embed the changes into their

# daily routines.

Oﬀsites aren’t just a day away from the oﬃce—they’re an opportunity to

reset your team’s trajectory. By focusing on these ﬁve questions, you’ll

transform a routine gathering into a catalyst for meaningful change.

Start with the end in mind, ask the right questions, and design and

deliver an oﬀsite that creates connection, clarity, and momentum so

your team walks away primed to thrive.
