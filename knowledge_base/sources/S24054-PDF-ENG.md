When our society talks about success, we tend to focus on individual

success. We obsess about who is the “greatest of all time,” who is most

responsible for a win, or what players or coaches a team might add next

season to become even better.

What can get lost in this way of thinking is that leaders don’t accomplish

anything by themselves. In fact, nothing of signiﬁcance in life is

achieved alone. To do great things, we rely on teammates. And to win,

team leaders must ﬁnd ways to draw the best physical, mental, and

emotional performance from the players working with them.

Since retiring from football, Tom has been reﬂecting on what he brought

to the teams he played on. Naturally, most people focus on his role as

a quarterback. But we believe that another set of behaviors—how he

helped the people around him perform better—was a vital part of why

those teams won so much.

As part of Tom’s exploration of this topic, he reached out to Nitin, who

has been studying and teaching leadership for nearly four decades.

He’s also a football fan—a Patriots season ticket holder—who has

followed Tom’s career closely. Together, we began to sort through Tom’s

experiences to identify the leadership principles that people can use to

maximize performance from their teammates.

In this article, we’ve distilled this work into a set of seven behaviors.

We’ve written the rest of the piece in Tom’s voice because these ideas

are based on his experiences, but what follows is a collaborative eﬀort.

Although Tom’s experiences took place mostly in sports, we believe that

many of the techniques he used can be applied in any organization.

# A Team-Focused Philosophy

Leadership comes down to two things: Do you care about your

teammates and their role on the team? And do you care about winning,

which is what you’re ultimately trying to do together? Leadership

requires trust, and trust usually comes from deeply caring about one

another and the belief that winning is about the team. You must feel

# passionate about both.

## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

I’ve always tried to be an ideal teammate. Much of my approach

came from being born into an amazing family and having a strong

upbringing, and this orientation deepened when I was in high school

and college. Playing football at the University of Michigan, we had a

team-centric philosophy that became central to who I am today. There’s

an old saying in sports: Do you want to be a star, or do you want to

be a champion? At Michigan, I was focused on our team goals—on

winning games and championships for our school, and on being a great

teammate rather than achieving individual goals. That attitude stayed

# with me throughout my NFL career.

If you spent time in professional sports locker rooms, you might be

surprised that players don’t always behave that way. Some players take

all the credit when things go right, but when things go wrong, they

make excuses and place the blame on everyone else, including referees,

teammates, and coaches. They focus too much on individual statistics

or records or awards. They are self-serving, and their teammates

recognize it. When I see players like that, who seem to care more about

themselves than the team, I can also see how that makes the people

around them less motivated to give their best eﬀort. In a way, I was

lucky those behaviors are so pervasive, because if they weren’t, many of the teams I played against would have been more diﬃcult to beat.

So what exactly do great team leaders do? I believe there are seven key

# things.

Brady in a huddle with his offense during the 2015 AFC championship game Damon Winter/The New York Times/Redux

Put the team ﬁrst, always, even when facing personal adversity. That

was one of the ﬁrst lessons I learned about leadership. In college, I “red-

shirted” as a freshman, and I didn’t get to play much during my second

year. In my third year, I thought I had a good shot at being the starting

quarterback, but I was beaten out (fair and square) by a great leader and

quarterback named Brian Griese, who went on to play many successful

years in the NFL. My job was to support and push Brian in practice to

help him get better. Though I was disappointed, I wasn’t pissed oﬀ that

he beat me, and I never tried to bring him down. That year, we went

undefeated and won the national championship, and although I wasn’t

on the ﬁeld much, I was very happy with the role that I played.

In my fourth year, I started every game, and we ﬁnished with an

electrifying victory in the Citrus Bowl against a great Arkansas team. In

my ﬁfth year, the team named me captain, and I thought I’d earned the

right to again be the starting quarterback. But Michigan had recruited

a top prospect named Drew Hensen. The coaches were adamant that

he would play, and I began to doubt whether they wanted me to be

the starter. Our coach decided that an alternating rotation, which rarely

happens in football, was the way our team would go forward. We split

time at quarterback for most of the year, even though at times I thought

I outplayed Drew. But I refused to sulk or complain—which I had done

my share of when I was younger—because I wanted to be focused on the

# team’s success.

In our third game of the year, against Syracuse, Drew threw a long

touchdown pass to end the second quarter. At halftime the coaches

chose Drew to play the entire second half while I watched from the

sideline. It felt like a gut punch. We won the game, and Michigan has an

awesome tradition: In the locker room after a win, the captains stand on

chairs and lead the team in singing the ﬁght song. I was crushed that

I hadn’t played in the second half, but I stood up on that chair and I

screamed those lyrics out as loud as I could. I’m sure people knew I was

disappointed, but I wanted to show everyone that I supported Drew and

the team. I felt like that really endeared me to my teammates. A few

games later, the coach chose me to become the permanent quarterback.

We won the rest of our games, including a dramatic overtime win in my

# last college game, in the Orange Bowl.

The way I handled myself during the ﬁrst few games of that season,

when things didn’t go the way I wanted them to, was very important in

my development as a leader. I continued to work hard, I put the team

ﬁrst, and I always supported my teammates, even as I tried to prove that

I was the right person to play quarterback. This fundamental change in

attitude set the tone for the rest of my athletic career.

Show appreciation for unsung colleagues. At Michigan, we had a great

fullback named Chris Floyd. On running plays, his primary job was to

block the linebackers and create holes for the running back with the

ball. It’s hard work. It’s very physical and taxing on your body, not to

mention that there’s not a lot of glory in it. In football, the camera

follows the ball carrier, and blockers tend to go unrecognized. But Brian

Griese made a point to tell people: “There’s nobody I’d rather have in the

backﬁeld with me than Chris Floyd.” The recognition meant everything

to Chris. After hearing that, he walked around like he was 10 feet tall.

That made a huge impression on me. I began making a habit of giving

## credit to players in those underappreciated roles—not just because they

deserved it but also to point out to others that no player should go

# unnoticed.

This is an important part of team leadership. In football, the best

examples of underrecognized players are the oﬀensive linemen. When

I was with the Patriots, I would go into their meeting room all the time

and tell them there was no way we could be successful without them.

(And we couldn’t.) I would show them appreciation and aﬀection in

diﬀerent ways, sometimes taking them out to dinner, sometimes giving

small gifts, always ﬁnding opportunities to show them recognition.

When I joined Tampa Bay, in 2020, the team was running a lot of screen

passes, but we weren’t getting much yardage because the oﬀensive line

was missing too many blocks too often. I told the oﬀensive linemen

that every time we ran a screen play that gained more than 15 yards,

I’d pay each of them $1,000. On Mondays, we’d watch game ﬁlm, and

they’d line up with smiles on their faces and their hands out when we

accomplished our goal. These were athletes making a lot of money, so

$1,000 wasn’t that much to them. But the fact that I was paying them

out of my own pocket meant something and motivated them to do

# better.

## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

Good team leaders go further and ﬁnd ways of recognizing those who

don’t play on the ﬁeld yet support us in less visible ways. Football teams

have big support staﬀs—trainers, the people who prepare our meals and

clean the locker room and wash our uniforms, among others. I found

that a simple high ﬁve or word of appreciation means so much. To be a

great team, everyone needs to feel valued—and it’s up to the leaders of

the team to make sure that happens.

Set the standard and create a culture of 100% effort. During my early

seasons with the Patriots, I was part of a group of players called the

“Edgers.” We were constantly competing to get the edge on one another:

who could get to the weight room earlier, watch more game ﬁlm, do

more extra practice—even something as silly as who could drink the

most water. People assume that the coaches made sure we were putting

in the work, but in this culture, we were holding ourselves to a higher

level of accountability. I remember practices where the coach would tell

us we needed to run 20 wind sprints, each under seven seconds, with a

30-second break after each one. I’d stand up and say, “No, guys, we’re

doing 24 sprints, six seconds each, with 15-second breaks in between.”

(Remember, I was the slowest guy on the team.) Some of the players

would start arguing and yelling. I’d tell them: “I don’t give a f— what the

coach says.” We needed to work harder because it mattered to us, not

just give enough eﬀort to satisfy the coach.

In the NFL, every player thinks he’s giving 100% eﬀort. Judging from

what I saw, a lot of them are playing at only 70% or 80% of their true

ability. They may not realize it, but they’ve been conditioned to do that.

Putting in less than 100% eﬀort is particularly common for players on

teams that don’t win very often. Imagine being a star running back on a

bad team. Your team loses most of its games, and soon you ﬁnd yourself

giving less than your full eﬀort. But because you’re the best player,

you’re rewarded with a huge contract. In theory the money should

motivate you to work harder, but often players see it as aﬃrmation

that they’re already working hard enough—if they weren’t, why would

the owner pay them $10 million a year? And because it’s a team sport,

an individual player can give 100% and the team still may be terrible,

which creates disincentives to keep trying so hard. The only hope of

breaking this cycle is for the people on the team to push one another to

do better.

I wish I had a foolproof method for going into any situation where a

player is giving 70% and ﬁnding a way to squeeze out that remaining

30%. I’m not sure I ever was able to do that. But by modeling team-

focused behavior and creating higher expectations and accountability,

I could reliably get another 5% or 10% out of players—and that often

made a big diﬀerence.

Sometimes the pacesetting wasn’t about working harder physically. It

was about communicating expectations more candidly. Because my

teammates knew that I was invested in them, I was able to oﬀer criticism

without making them feel attacked. “Hey, do you want me to lie to you

and tell you what you want to hear?” I’d say. “Or do you want me to tell

you the truth? You were not prepared today, so you weren’t at your best.

We need you to be better.” As a society, we’ve moved away from having

those frank conversations. As I’ve gotten older, I’ve come to recognize

that when people give me tough love and tell me the truth, it’s often the

best sign that they really care about me.

Recognize teammates’ individual psychology and the best ways to

motivate them. Every NFL player is unique. Some are motivated

by money and contracts. Some are motivated by recognition, like

making the All-Pro team. Some are motivated by what the media is

writing about them. Some are motivated by winning championships,

while others are just trying to avoid losing their job. Great leaders

recognize these things instinctively and are able to ﬁnd each person’s

motivational levers. It’s almost like love languages—the idea that

## diﬀerent people express and receive love diﬀerently in relationships—

and it’s an essential skill that leaders must learn.

Let me give you some examples. During the middle part of my career

at the Patriots, I played with two wide receivers, Julian Edelman

and Randy Moss. If you wanted Julian, who had incredible mental

toughness, to play his best, the way to do it was to tick him oﬀ. I would

say something like “Jules, wow, you look really sluggish today.” He’d

glare at me and be so angry, but I knew he’d channel that energy to

prove me wrong and go out and play great. Randy, who’s a Hall of Fame

receiver, responded better to validation: “Man, Randy, you look amazing

out there.” Even in practice, if I went too long without throwing the ball

to him, I’d go over and say how much I valued him and remind him that

I was always looking for him on every play. I wanted to make sure he

never slowed down.

Whether you’re a coach or a team captain, you learn that you spend

90% of your time working with the 10% of players who are the

most challenging. I had one particular teammate who was a naturally

gifted oﬀensive player. But he had faced many adversities during his

childhood and young adult life. I spent a lot of time with him, and

I felt that he had unhealed traumas that led to insecurities. It was diﬃcult for him to trust anyone or control his emotions. He didn’t

recognize that his behaviors were self-destructive and distracting to

his teammates. I wish he’d found some professional support that could

have shown him a way to take advantage of the opportunities he had in his career. It’s very diﬃcult to see people struggle like that, but you

have to keep trying to ﬁgure out what might work to motivate them

and try to help them achieve their potential. The time spent managing

challenging teammates is worth it because you’re not just bringing

up their performance, you’re also keeping them from bringing down

everyone else’s. People don’t always appreciate this work, but it’s what

leaders must do.

I sometimes talk about inputs and outputs, and although that is mostly

about putting in the preparation and practice (inputs) to get a win

(output), it also refers to team composition. If you add the wrong players

to the mix—people who are undisciplined or self-centered—that’s a

negative input, and it will lead to negative outputs. By working with

those players to help them manage their emotions, leaders help to

improve both the inputs and the outputs.

Understand and complement the style of the formal leader. I spent

most of my career playing for Bill Belichick. He’s the greatest coach in

the history of the NFL, and many fans are familiar with his coaching

style. He’s very intense and matter-of-fact. He grew up as the son

of a coach at the Naval Academy, and that’s where he learned his

coaching style. He is a product of that rigorous military environment.

The focus was on discipline and accountability, not on empathy or

compassion. No matter how we played, Coach Belichick’s coaching

style was to motivate the team by looking for weaknesses and areas

to improve. There’s an argument that players need that. Pro athletes

have a lot of people in our lives—families, girlfriends, wives, agents,

fans—telling us how great we are. Coach Belichick always wanted to

keep us from buying into those narratives and becoming complacent.

We all felt fortunate to play for him, and there were many beneﬁts

to his approach, but his motivational style—often based on fear—was sometimes diﬃcult. So as a team leader, I tried to complement that

approach by being a bit more upbeat.

In his leadership style, Coach Belichick never got too close to his

players. He wasn’t one to mingle and form personal relationships with players or coaches, because it’s diﬃcult to do that when you know

you’ll have to trade, cut, or ﬁre most of them at some point down the

road. So I often took the opposite approach: I tried to get to know

my teammates deeply and show that I cared about them personally.

I asked about their families and the things going on in their lives

oﬀ the ﬁeld. I made it clear that if we connected as teammates,

they’d be my teammates for life, and I’ve tried to live up to that. My

relationships are the most important thing in my life. I like to think my

style complemented Coach Belichick’s. I was lucky to play for a coach

who was so smart, hardworking, and focused on discipline—a coach

who relentlessly held people accountable for doing their job. He was

fortunate to have someone like me who could recognize where the team

was at emotionally, rally the troops, and pull people together.

## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

Our other team leaders used diﬀerent leadership styles. Willie

McGinest, a great linebacker during my early years with the Patriots,

was six-foot-ﬁve and 270 pounds. He used his physical presence and

voice as a leadership tool. When Willie said something, people stood

up straight and said: “Yes, Willie, we’ll do whatever you ask us to do.”

Matthew Slater, who I played with in the 2010s, became a leader by

example because of how hard he played on our special teams unit. The

dedication and work he put into his job endeared him to his teammates.

Assistant coaches played important leadership roles, too. Dante

Scarnecchia, who coached our oﬀensive line, combined the tough

discipline that Belichick exuded with a deep personal caring for people.

He got every ounce of eﬀort out of his players, every day. At the

Patriots we talked about leaders as “culture drivers,” and in any given

season there were probably a dozen players who held that role, each

complementing the others with his own style.

Recognize and counteract the external forces that can cause selﬁsh

behavior. Leaders need to realize that powerful external forces push

people to focus on themselves instead of the team. In professional

sports, agents can be one example. In a perfect world, I’d have three

great receivers who didn’t care which one I threw the ball to, as long as

we won the game. In reality, if receiver A has a great day, receivers B

and C may be happy we won, but then they may hear rumblings about

## their performance from their agents, their family and friends, or the

media. If the pattern continues, their individual stats will go down, and

their agents will start warning them that not getting the ball is going

to aﬀect the value of their next contract. They start to worry that they

may lose the aﬀection and admiration of their fan base. As a leader, I

needed to understand that even if everyone agreed that our goal was to

win championships as a team, players would face pressure from people

in their lives to behave in more self-serving ways.

The same is probably true for corporate employees—they have a spouse

or parents asking when they’re going to get promoted, or if they got

the raise they deserved. We all have vulnerabilities that can make us

act in more self-centered ways, and everybody is surrounded by people

who can either amplify those instincts or help manage them. Team

leaders must recognize outside pressures and continually reinforce the

# team-ﬁrst message.

Create opportunities to connect as people outside the ofﬁce. This fall

I’m starting work as a broadcaster. In May, our broadcast team went to

the Bahamas together. We played games on the beach, shared meals,

and got to know one another. We were creating a shared experience

outside the environment that we’re used to, and we saw new parts

of everyone’s personalities. The camaraderie we built and the better

understanding we gained of one another as individuals will help us

# perform better as a group this fall.

Some people criticize corporate oﬀsites or team-building events as

wasteful junkets. That is enormously short-sighted. Leadership is about

improving the quality of teammates’ relationships and building trust,

and that comes from shared experiences. Those experiences should not be limited to the oﬃce—in fact, they often deepen more easily away

from work. When I played football, my teammates and I regularly spent

time together in the oﬀseason. We texted. We FaceTimed. We’d hang

out at my place in Montana, or we’d have fun at the Kentucky Derby.

Sometimes we just went bowling. We loved being together. People focus

on the physical attributes and skills that we as athletes brought to

competition, but so much of our success was built on our emotions

and how they helped us perform better. The more we were interested in

and concerned about one another as teammates, and didn’t want to let

one another down, the more motivated we were to do our absolute best,

# every day.

# What Helps—and What Gets in the Way

The leadership behaviors I’ve just described can help any individual

improve a team’s performance. But there are also some pretty strong

forces that can work for or against you and inﬂuence how much better a

team can get.

The emotions and behaviors that deﬁne individuals are formed early.

My experience working with hundreds of teammates has taught me

that the core behaviors that make any of us a good teammate—

unselﬁshness, discipline, humility—are wired into us when we’re very

young. If your childhood experiences taught you that people aren’t

trustworthy or don’t follow through on promises, it can be tough

to convince you otherwise when you become a pro athlete in your

twenties. That’s a real challenge. As a society, we should begin more

systematically teaching behaviors around teamwork when kids are in

kindergarten—and even then, there’s no guarantee that those lessons

will make a diﬀerence, especially for children who have unstable family

lives. As members of organizations, whether sports teams or companies,

we need to start focusing on teaching team-centric behaviors to young

people coming up in the ranks. I’m now a part owner of a British soccer

team and a women’s professional basketball team, and I’m trying to

become a part owner of the NFL’s Las Vegas Raiders. In these roles, I’m

doing all I can to transfer some of the leadership lessons I learned in

my athletic career to the next generation of players. But again, that can be diﬃcult, because by the time athletes reach the professional ranks,

many of their values and their ability to adapt and manage emotions

are fully formed. That’s why scouts and general managers talk so much

# about “character” during the draft.

Leaders work within a system. When football fans look back on the

Patriots’ success from 2001 to 2019, they spend a lot of energy trying

to divide up the credit. Who was responsible for it? Was it the coach?

The owner? The quarterback? The truth is that we won championships

because of all three of us—along with dozens of other contributing

factors. As a team, we talked about “people, processes, and protocols.”

For example, a foundational culture of toughness and discipline had

emerged just as I was arriving, built by players such as Tedy Bruschi,

## Matt Light, Kevin Faulk, Logan Mankins, and Rodney Harrison (to name

just a few). We also developed a way of using the calendar to create a

cadence and a rhythm. We learned to relax and recharge just enough

in March and April without getting out of shape. By May, we were

completely focused on identifying our deﬁciencies from the prior year

and improving. Maybe most of all, we mastered the ability (goaded on

by Coach Belichick) to convince ourselves that a Wednesday practice in

July was actually the fourth quarter of a playoﬀ game in January. That

got us used to the feeling of performing under pressure so that we were

able to handle ourselves when the pressure was no longer pretend. By

the time the season started in September, we were just so far ahead of

# other teams.

Everyone at the Patriots was shaped by that system of intense

preparation. We tried to anticipate everything we might encounter in

a game and then practiced until we perfected how we would respond.

We developed the mental ﬂexibility to be fully present in the moment

and to problem solve and react instinctively as a game unfolded. Finally,

we focused after each game on the lessons to be learned from it so that

we could keep things in perspective and never get too up or too down on

ourselves. We blocked out the noise that constantly surrounded us and

focused on getting better to win the next game.

Toyota is known for having developed a system for “winning” in the car

industry in the 1970s. Experts have studied its system ever since and

have concluded that there is no magic ingredient; it’s made up of dozens

of interlocking principles that have evolved over many years. The lack

of a simple formula is why competitors haven’t been able to replicate

what Toyota does. I see similarities in what observers called “the Patriot

Way,” which was also a complex system that evolved over time. Having

been part of such a system, I have a strong sense of humility about my

—or any individual player’s—ability to inﬂuence team performance. As

the Patriots’ quarterback and captain, I could have perfectly carried out

every one of the seven behaviors I just described, but without the other

elements of our system, we might have had far less success.

It can be hard for individual team leaders to inﬂuence change across

large organizations. A pro football team has 53 players, 20 or so coaches,

and 20 or so key support staﬀ, so call it about 100 people. One or two

peer leaders can have an inﬂuence on a group that size. Compare that

with Delta Air Lines, where I’m now a strategic adviser. It has 100,000

employees. Delta is a great company, and many of its employees feel

a sense of ownership and pride. But creating a culture where people

care about one another in a company that big is challenging. Assessing individual performance can be more diﬃcult too.

A leader’s style and inﬂuence will take time to evolve. It can take years

for a leader’s style to become natural and eﬀective. During my ﬁrst

season in the NFL, I was a third-string quarterback. No one outside the

Patriots thought of me as a team leader. But inside the locker room, I

was showing leadership in small ways. For example, I regularly pulled

younger guys aside after practice to run extra plays. “The starters are

playing more than we are, so we need to do more to keep up and to

get better,” I’d tell them. Within my small group—the oﬀensive players

who weren’t starters—I was taking charge. I also focused on showing

conﬁdence so that more-experienced teammates would trust me when

I began playing in games. By the time I was in my 40s, I was leading in

a much diﬀerent style. Some younger players who’d grown up watching

me on TV felt intimidated by me, so I worked on being approachable

and showing humility. And by that point, I didn’t have to try to appear

conﬁdent because I had developed real conﬁdence.

## HBR / Spotlight / Tom Brady on the Art of Leading Teammates

This kind of evolution also happens away from sports. At age 19, Mark

Zuckerberg led Facebook diﬀerently than he does now, at age 40. But

even when his entire team could ﬁt in his dorm room, he was still acting

like a leader, and that’s important. Even the youngest people in an

organization are capable of leadership. If they work intentionally toward

that goal, they’ll get better at it over time. Especially as I grew older, I

worked to improve as a leader as much as I did at throwing a football.

. . .

Despite the challenges, I remain optimistic about the potential for more

people to become better teammates and team leaders. There is a huge

## upside here, not only for sports teams but for any other organization.

If the corporate world creates more skilled team leaders, companies

will produce better results and employees will have more fun doing it.

Bad bosses, toxic coworkers, and “quiet quitting” will become far less

common. As much as I loved winning Super Bowls, I recognize that

the impact of helping organizations achieve success through teamwork

could be far-reaching. That’s why I’m so excited about embracing this

## challenge in the next stage of my career.

Let’s go.
