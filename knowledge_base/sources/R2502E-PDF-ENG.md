The numbers tell the story: Women achieved educational parity with

men more than 40 years ago and today are outperforming men in

formal educational settings. In 2021, for instance, women earned 59%

of all bachelor’s degrees, 63% of all master’s degrees, and 57% of all

# doctorate degrees in the United States.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Women Can Win in the Workplace

That’s the good news for women. But as soon as they cross the

## graduation threshold, something strange happens: They immediately

lose their advantage. In the United States women represent only 48%

of employees entering the corporate workforce—and when the ﬁrst

promotions to manager come around, only 81 women are promoted for

every 100 men. This means that over the course of ﬁve years one million

women will fall behind right at the start of their careers, held back by

a broken rung at the bottom of the corporate ladder. Not only that, but

women continue to lose ground throughout their careers: At the senior

manager/director level, their representation falls to 37%; at the VP level,

to 34%, and at the senior VP and C-suite level, to 29%. The numbers are

even more extreme for women of color, who collectively make up only

7% of C-suite executives today. We see a similar drop-oﬀ for women at

# senior levels of leadership globally.

All of this raises some familiar questions: How is it possible, four

decades after achieving parity in education, that women are still so far

from achieving it in the workplace? If they’re beginning their careers

## just as qualiﬁed as or even more qualiﬁed than men, shouldn’t that

## translate into better representation all the way up the professional

ladder? Why do these stubborn gender gaps exist in the workplace,

# especially at senior levels?

One of the big reasons is that education and entry-level skills get

you only halfway to your full earning potential. The rest is based on

knowledge, skills, and wisdom gained on the job. We call this experience

# capital.

To understand how men and women build experience capital

diﬀerently, we analyzed about 86,000 professional proﬁles in the

United States, using longitudinal data to trace actual career trajectories.

Interestingly, our analysis shows that women move from role to role and

learn new skills just as frequently as men do. However, men are more

likely to move to growing occupations from shrinking ones. Their moves

are also more likely to increase their pay than moves made by women,

who often see a decrease in pay.

Experience capital can be gained through employer-provided learning

and development programs, through job changes that challenge you

to add new skills to your repertoire, and by observing how colleagues

and bosses handle complex tasks or tricky situations. But building

experience capital isn’t the only challenge; the other half of the equation

is having it recognized in the form of new opportunities, promotions,

# and compensation increases.

Our research has shown that women aren’t earning the same amount

of experience capital as men. There are multiple systemic issues at

work here that need to be addressed if we want to solve this problem,

including biases in hiring and promotion, but in the meantime there’s

plenty that women can do to help themselves. That’s what this article

is about: the actions that women can take. By distilling what we’ve

learned in more than a decade of research and through interviews

with successful female leaders, we’ve developed a set of strategies and

practices for developing experience capital that can help women set

themselves up for success—in a way that will beneﬁt not just them but

also the people and companies they work with.

## Find the Right Company, Not Just the Right Job

The organizations you join at the start of your career can have a

profound impact on your success. In our research we’ve found that early

exposure to an eﬀective organization that supports employees’ growth

—ideally within the ﬁrst ﬁve working years—accounts for 50% of the

## variation in experience capital among workers, on average.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Women Can Win in the Workplace

To identify companies that will help you boost your experience capital,

# look for these traits.

A strong learning culture. Seek out companies in which all employees,

new and long-tenured, are oﬀered education and training—and are

actively encouraged to take advantage of them by leaders who prioritize

their growth. Such organizations also often promote peer learning

and set the expectation that employees will take responsibility for

developing one another.

Successful competitive strategy. Identify organizations that have a

clear strategy for winning in their industry and execute it systematically

—whether it is driving innovation, involving employees in continuous

improvement, being very attuned to the market and its changes, or

building a broad set of leaders and general managers.

High and cross-functional mobility. A company that actively helps

employees move into new roles internally increases their experience

capital. In such ﬁrms workers develop greater agility and feel that their

organization invests in and values them, which increases engagement

# and retention.

Diversity. People are more likely to learn new things and be innovative

and creative when they have colleagues who diﬀer from them.

Organizations with leadership teams that reﬂect diverse cultures

and genders are more likely to make better decisions and be open

to continuous improvement, which can increase their employees’

experience capital. (Note that we’ve found only that these beneﬁts are

correlated with diversity; it’s not possible to put a company through a

double-blind test to prove causation.)

The question, of course, is how to identify companies that actually

possess these traits. The most obvious places to start are company

websites and the information that companies’ HR departments make

available. It’s always a good idea to talk to people who work in the

organizations and to compare what they tell you with what you ﬁnd

## out through external sources, such as media outlets or websites like

Glassdoor and Indeed. You can ask questions like these: What are the

core values of the company, and how do leaders walk the talk each day?

How many hours a year (or what percentage of time) are employees

encouraged to invest in their personal learning? How does that learning

actually happen, and what company support and resources are there

to ensure that it happens? What is the promotion structure? How

high is employee turnover? What percentage of employees make

cross-functional moves within the organization? What kinds of formal

sponsorship and mentorship programs exist?

When interviewing for a job, never forget that it’s a two-way process:

The people at a company may be interviewing you, but you’re also

interviewing them. Outside the interview process, seek every possible

opportunity to speak to current and former employees. Find out about

## the culture. Learn everything you can about the CEO, the executive

team, and your future boss: What are their values and leadership styles,

and how do they interact with others? Consider the board of directors,

too. How diverse is it in terms of background and expertise? Board

members, after all, are the people who shape the organization from the

# very top.

# Make Big, Bold Moves

The moves you make throughout your career—across organizations,

occupations, and industries—play an enormous role in the growth of

your experience capital. But not all moves are created equal. Our data

shows that two types of moves have the greatest impact. The ﬁrst is a big

move, which involves starting over in a new occupation or industry. Big

moves can make sense when you ﬁnd yourself in the wrong occupation

or industry: It just isn’t a ﬁt, or perhaps the ﬁeld is being disrupted

signiﬁcantly by generative AI. In the latter case it may be a good time to

jump to one that is growing and needs more people.

Workers who start out in line roles have lifetime earnings that are 20% higher, on average, than those who start out in support roles.

The second type is a bold move, in which you take a role that requires

a signiﬁcant number of new skills. To determine whether a move is

bold, we use a measure we call “skill distance”—the percentage of new

skills needed in the new job. The median skill distance for all job moves

is roughly 25%, meaning that a quarter of the required skills were not

used in the person’s previous role. When a job move has a skill distance

higher than 25%, we consider it to be bold.

One way to increase your experience capital is to make bold moves

throughout your career. Your pay tends to go up the most when you take

a new job that requires novel skills, which is when your learning curve

is the steepest. When you make multiple bold moves during your career,

you compound your experience capital.

Whether you’re looking to make a big move early in your career or a bold

move later on, it can take some work to ﬁnd the right opportunity. Here

are a few steps you can follow:

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Women Can Win in the Workplace

Stretch yourself. Make sure you’re reaching for roles with a high skill

distance. If you go after jobs that require only the skills you already

possess, you won’t maximize your experience capital.

Build your narrative. Before starting your search, know what story you

plan to tell. Even if you feel that your previous role or roles didn’t

work out or were a bad ﬁt, ﬁgure out how to describe them as learning

opportunities that provided you with valuable skills. This is key: To

persuade companies and hiring managers to make a bet on you, you

need to talk about what you’ve liked and learned in your previous roles,

not what made you unhappy or frustrated.

Activate your network. Because big moves often require crossing over

into new industries or functions, and because bold moves often involve

getting people to take a chance on you even though you may not yet

have all the necessary skills for a job, networking is key. You’ll need

a network that’s broad and diverse enough to facilitate cross-industry

moves—and includes sponsors who can encourage leaders who don’t

know you to give you a shot. Start by strengthening your personal

## connections. Systematically free up time on your calendar for coﬀee

chats, lunches, and so on, and use this time to talk to people in areas

you’re interested in. Ask them about their roles, about other people they

think you should talk to, and—if you feel comfortable with it—whether

they can connect you directly to those people. Continue doing this until

you understand exactly what kind of opportunity you’re looking for and

what truly interests you. Once you know where you want to go, ﬁgure

out how best to get there. Be straightforward and clear as you continue

to reach out to people: “I’m really interested in this area. How can I best

prepare myself and build the right skills?” As you make progress and

start to apply for positions, update the people in your network who’ve

been helpful. This is especially important in the case of sponsors or

mentors, who are likely to be in the room when hiring and promotion

decisions are made.

Signal the right skills. Often job seekers have the skills that are required

for a role but fail to highlight them on their résumés, in their LinkedIn

proﬁles, or in other ways. This gap is widest when it comes to soft skills

such as teamwork, conﬂict resolution, and communication. Together,

soft skills make up 25% of the top 20 skills listed in job postings, but

most people focus predominantly on signaling their technical skills.

Don’t make that mistake.

Close with conﬁdence. At the end of an interview, make it clear why

you’re the person for the job. To pull oﬀ big and bold moves, you have

to believe in yourself, the skills you’ve developed, and your potential to

apply them in a new role. If you’re willing to bet on yourself, prospective

employers will be more willing to bet on you too.

# Enter the Power Alley

When it comes to building experience capital, two types of positions

are accelerators: leadership roles and those with proﬁt and loss (P&L)

responsibilities. Because both give you a signiﬁcant amount of clout, we

think of them as being in what we call the power alley. The more time

you spend there, and the wider the variety of roles you hold there, the

more experience capital you’ll accumulate.

Leadership roles. The beneﬁts of working in a leadership role are clear:

You have a seat at the table in decision-making and are able to inﬂuence

outcomes. You and your work become far more visible. You have an

opportunity to build a network of senior colleagues, which can help

open doors for you. And you can open doors for others. All of this

requires excellent communication skills that are transferable across

# organizations and industries.

But becoming a leader is not just about applying for a job or a

promotion. It’s also about being seen as a leader, both by others and

by yourself. This can be a struggle for women. Often biases are a factor:

Women are nearly twice as likely as men to be mistaken for someone

more junior and are far more likely to have colleagues question their

judgment or imply that they aren’t qualiﬁed for their jobs. They’re

more likely to have others take credit for their ideas—37% of female

leaders say that this has happened to them, compared with 27% of male

leaders. Female leaders are also more likely to report that personal

characteristics, such as their gender or being a parent, have played

a role in their being passed over for a raise or a promotion. Those

experiences disrupt the learning required to become a leader, which

in turn can prevent women from seeing themselves as leaders, creating

a vicious cycle of external biases driving internal biases. However, we

know that women do make eﬀective leaders. Employees with female

managers are more likely than those with male managers to say their

boss checks in on their well-being, helps them balance their workload,

and promotes inclusive behavior on their team—traits that are all

# increasingly important to employees.

A manager at any level is in a leadership

position, but there are other types of

leadership roles—for example, sitting on a

functional council or board, running a

high-proﬁle project, or heading up an employee resource group or a local oﬃce at

## your organization. Any of those positions

will help you become more visible to senior

executives, build a stronger network, and

gain the authority to make decisions that

aﬀect the overall organization, thus

increasing your experience capital.

P&L roles. Holding a line role is a good way to acquire a deep

understanding of the business, have an impact, and move up the career

ladder. By “line role,” we mean any position that directly generates

# revenue for an organization.

People who work in line roles will accrue critical experience capital that

will help them when they’re being considered for promotions or lateral

rotations. But most women don’t recognize how much the decision to

seek a line role can aﬀect their success. First of all, workers who start out

in line roles have lifetime earnings that are 20% higher, on average, than

those starting out in support roles, and across sectors, workers in line

roles earn salaries that are 14% to 31% higher than their peers in support

# roles.

Just over a third of men’s entry-level jobs are in line roles, and just

under a third of women’s are. The gap gets bigger at more-senior levels,

with more and more men ﬁlling the P&L ownership roles, and women

ﬁlling more of the staﬀ roles. In fact, four times as many men as women

hold executive line roles. Given that P&L management experience is

often desired for positions in the C-suite, this puts many women at a

major disadvantage. While support roles can be powerful, particularly

if you’re in a leadership role in a function, your experience capital will

grow from having P&L responsibilities.

As you imagine your career trajectory, think about how you can position

yourself in the power alley, with either leadership or P&L roles or with

both. Start by asking yourself whether the positions you’ve held so far,

including your current job, have been line, support, or leadership roles.

Once you identify the type of role that you want, make a plan to reach

for it. This can mean directly asking your boss or others what to do to be

qualiﬁed for it. You may even want to consider making a lateral move to

# better position yourself.

# Go Where the Jobs Are

Even with the rise of AI, economists and demographers are hopeful that

we will have more jobs in the future than we do today in the United

## States (consistent with historical patterns and previous technological

waves). And the good news is that, on average, those jobs will pay more.

The catch is that they will also require diﬀerent skills.

Whether you’re just starting out in your career or are more established,

it’s important to understand the shifts that are underway now and those

that are coming. When you’re choosing an occupation, it pays to be

strategic and pick an area that’s growing. If you’re currently in one that’s

shrinking, you’ll need to think about reskilling and upskilling.

Here are some of the key aspects of the changing work landscape to

# consider:

Growing occupations. In the United States the industry that will

experience the greatest job growth is healthcare, where employment

is expected to increase 30% by 2030. The second-largest increases will

be in jobs in science, technology, engineering, and math, collectively

referred to as STEM, for which demand will increase 23%. The

transportation-services sector is expected to see job growth of 9%

# overall.

Shrinking occupations. Automation and generative AI will lead

to declining opportunities primarily in four categories of jobs— customer service and sales, food service, oﬃce support (administrative

assistants), and production (manufacturing). People working in them

will account for roughly 85% of the 12 million occupational shifts, or

job changes, that will need to be made in the United States by 2030.

Because women hold more of the jobs in all those occupations except

production, they are 50% more likely than men to be aﬀected by job loss

# from automation and gen AI.

New occupational categories. By 2030 technology and other trends will

also help create entirely new kinds of jobs. This is a long-standing

pattern: In the United States about 9% of all jobs have been in

occupations that are less than 10 years old. Recent examples include

jobs related to artiﬁcial intelligence, machine learning, social media,

## renewable energy, and environmental sustainability.

Cross-industry opportunities. Workers often don’t realize they can do

a very similar job in a very diﬀerent industry. As industries grow and

shrink, it’s important to keep that possibility in mind and get creative

about seeking opportunities. In some cases it may even be worth trading

a higher salary for a role in a growth sector. Just as you do when

jumping to a new occupation, when you move to a new industry you

take relevant skills with you—and increase your experience capital.

# Everyone Can Be a Technologist

Once technology was seen as a back-oﬃce support function, but today

tech skills are valuable in jobs of all types across all industries. An

increasing number of jobs don’t require direct computer engineering

skills but do require familiarity with technology. However, many women

may perceive that those jobs are out of reach, perhaps because they

## didn’t study computer science or engineering in college.

But remember: What you learn in school is only half the story. You

can still learn at work, and there are several ways you can embrace

technology to set yourself apart.

Be an AI power user. Generative AI is accelerating the automation of

tasks across hundreds of job categories and has the potential to increase

productivity in the global economy by up to $4.4 trillion. By 2030, 30%

of the activities of every job in the United States, on average, could

be done by automation and generative AI. In some jobs up to 70% of

activities can be augmented by gen AI. That’s not to say these jobs will

disappear, but how workers in them spend time and add value will be

substantially diﬀerent, and being able to harness gen AI in them will be

# essential.

One of the unique advantages of gen AI is that anyone can be a power

user—the technology is complex to create but easy to apply. The basic

prerequisite is simply the ability to ask good questions and have a

# dialogue with the tools.

Pilot new technology use cases. There are many actions women can

take to gain gen AI experience capital that do not require a technical

background. Seeking out opportunities and demonstrating that you

are a committed early adopter can give you visibility and leadership

opportunities in your organization. Parts of the process you might

experiment with include technology design, user experience design,

# analytics, and research.

Prioritize technology skill development. All of this may sound

overwhelming if you haven’t spent a lot of time with technology, but

there are practical steps you can take. A simple benchmark is to set

aside 10% of your workweek to invest in yourself and the skills you’ll

need to advance your technology experience capital. It’s also important

to ensure that you have people with technology skills on your team.

Not only does that improve its eﬀectiveness, but you can learn from

those colleagues. Finally, technology, particularly gen AI, is best when

experienced ﬁrsthand. So have some fun with it. The more time you

spend playing around with it, the more prepared you’ll be to apply it to

# your work.

. . .

As you think about how to develop your experience capital, ask yourself

# the following questions:

- What is my ambition, and how can I embrace it?

- Am I strategically building a portfolio of experiences that will help me

meet my goals?

- What investments am I making in myself that will increase my chances

# of success?

- Do I have the right short- and long-term habits in place to ensure my

# career longevity?

- Am I asking for help?

- Am I giving back to my communities and lifting up others around me?

How you answer those questions will help you navigate the workplace.

For the past decade women have consistently expressed a desire for

promotions and leadership positions that is equal to or greater than

men’s. Equal representation remains elusive, of course, particularly at

more-senior levels, but it’s now clear what you need to do if you want to

get ahead: Earn more experience capital.
