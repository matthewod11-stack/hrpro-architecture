Every business is deﬁned by its customers — but it’s not always

obvious who an organization’s customers really are. When it comes

to VC ﬁrms, investors have historically and unsurprisingly viewed

their limited partners (LPs) — the source of VCs’ funding — as their

# customers.

## HBR / Digital Article / Why VCs Should Use Net Promoter Scores with Founders

But in recent years, investors have begun to rethink this traditional

mindset. In the early 2000s, some VCs began suggesting that the

entrepreneurs in whom they invested were their true customers. Today,

this narrative has grown increasingly widespread, with more and more

VCs claiming that they view their founders (not their LPs) as the

# customer.

However, despite the rising popularity of “founder-friendly” venture

capital, many investors continue to struggle to implement a founder-as-

customer approach in their daily operations. They may even ask for

input using a traditional customer satisfaction survey, but these surveys

are generally not very eﬀective at sourcing real, constructive feedback.

What does it take for VCs to move beyond platitudes to actually serve

the entrepreneurs they fund as eﬀectively as traditional companies

serve their customers?

As the president of a corporate VC ﬁrm, I’ve learned that we’ve

best served our entrepreneurs as customers when we use a proven,

## customer-oriented methodology: NPS, or Net Promoter Score.

First publicized in a 2003 Harvard Business Review article by Bain &

Company’s Fred Reichheld, NPS involves asking customers a single

question: On a scale from 1 to 10, how likely are you to recommend

this company to a friend? Customers who give ratings of 9 or 10 are

classiﬁed as “promoters,” those with ratings of 7 or 8 are “passives,”

and those with ratings of 1 to 6 are “detractors.” Then, to determine

a company’s Net Promoter Score, you just subtract the percentage of

detractors from the percentage of promoters, resulting in a measure that

ranges between -100% and 100%. Companies can then use this metric to

evaluate overall brand sentiment and identify opportunities to improve

# customer loyalty.

This metric has been shown to correlate with growth across a wide range

of industries and is a proven methodology for soliciting and acting on

## customer feedback in traditional business environments. While other

approaches to measuring customer satisfaction involve lengthy surveys

and vague, sometimes less-than-relevant questions, NPS is particularly

powerful because it is easy to implement and oﬀers targeted insight into

a key driver of business success: how likely customers are to proactively

either recommend or say something negative about a brand. As a result,

while the methodology is not without its critics, today, more than two-

thirds of Fortune 1,000 companies use some form of NPS.

In fact, many VCs explicitly encourage their founders to use NPS with

their own customers — and so it’s only natural that VCs looking to

serve their founders as customers will beneﬁt from this tried-and-true

# approach as well.

# Why NPS Works for Venture Capital

Despite the wealth of research demonstrating the eﬀectiveness of NPS

in traditional business environments, VCs have been slow to adapt the

methodology for their own organizations. Answering the call to treat

their entrepreneurs as customers, some VCs have implemented other

forms of satisfaction surveys — but these ad hoc eﬀorts don’t have

the research-backed beneﬁts of NPS. Traditional satisfaction surveys

simply ask how happy someone is with your product or service, while

NPS goes a level deeper to ask whether they would put their reputation

on the line by recommending you to a colleague or friend. As a result,

when implemented correctly, the NPS approach can help you unearth

feedback that a simple satisfaction survey would be unlikely to ever

# uncover.

To ﬁll this gap at TDK Ventures, my team and I began implementing

NPS with the founders we invested in. Over the past ﬁve years,

## HBR / Digital Article / Why VCs Should Use Net Promoter Scores with Founders

we’ve worked with nearly 40 startups, and we’ve found that NPS is

an unparalleled tool to guide and empower us to better serve our

entrepreneurs. From discovering that we could add additional value

for our founders by oﬀering marketing support to realizing that we

should be doing more to communicate check size expectations up front,

this approach has helped us identify ways to improve our founders’

## experiences and ultimately drive growth both for the companies in

which we invest and for ourselves. In addition, we’ve learned that NPS

can be eﬀective even with a relatively small portfolio: In our ﬁrst year,

we had a portfolio of just 12 startups, but NPS still helped us uncover

vital insights to better serve our entrepreneurs, such as their need for

# counsel on non-dilutive ﬁnancing.

Our approach to implementing NPS is particularly eﬀective because it

includes not just the likelihood to recommend question, but also two

qualitative follow-up questions: What are we doing well? and How can

we improve? While founders might otherwise hesitate to share negative

feedback with their investors, starting by soliciting positive feedback

makes people much more open to sharing real, constructive feedback

as well — which is critical to ensuring that we learn where we need to

# improve.

# How to Implement NPS as a VC

So, what does this look like in practice? Below, I outline a four-step

approach to bring the NPS methodology to life in a VC fund:

- 1. Solicit feedback.

Start by asking the questions. Importantly, to demonstrate how much

you value your customers’ input, this communication should come

from the head of the organization. It should also be personalized to

demonstrate a white-glove approach, and it should be low-friction:

## Invite founders and their team members to share their responses by

replying directly to your email, rather than asking them to use some

## unwieldy survey system or impersonal form.

In addition, to avoid relying solely on input from the person we know

best and work with the most at a given startup, we make a point of

soliciting feedback from at least three people at each of our portfolio

companies. Thanks to this approach, our ﬁrst survey achieved an 81%

## response rate (with 29 responses from the 12 portfolio companies in

which we had invested at that point), and our 2024 survey achieved an

80% response rate (receiving 90 responses from 31 startups).

It’s also important to avoid mentioning the idea of NPS, promoters,

or detractors. Instead, simply ask the questions without providing too

much background or context that might bias the responses you receive.

You should also be sure to thank respondents promptly, and while

you can ask clarifying questions when needed, never challenge their

responses or react defensively. If they mention a serious issue, make it

clear that you will look into it and get back to them as soon as possible.

To illustrate this, below is the email template I send to our portfolio

companies every year. Of course, you can adapt this template to ﬁt your

voice, but be sure to stick to the basic elements to capture the beneﬁts of

NPS:

Subject: [First Name], your feedback on TDK Ventures is important

Hi [First Name],

We at TDK Ventures strive every day to serve and bring genuine value to all our portfolio companies with the simple goal to help make them even more successful.

With this goal in mind, we look at every opportunity to bring “TDK Goodness” to [Portfolio Company Name], and I would love to hear your feedback on how we have been doing so far and where we can do better. I promise you that your answers matter and will drive how we will focus our improvements plan moving forward. For example, we built an internal 10-person Platform Team dedicated to your success thanks to the feedback we received from the previous survey a year ago.

Below are the three simple questions that I’d love to read your answers to and learn from. Feel free to answer inline.

- 1) From 1 (“never”) to 10 (“absolutely”), how likely would you be to recommend TDK Ventures to another entrepreneur?

- 2) What was the best value that TDK Ventures brought to you?

- 3) Where can TDK Ventures do better?

# Thank you so much for your time!

# Nicolas Sauvage

# President, TDK Ventures

If I don’t receive a response, I’ll send a maximum of two follow-up

messages over the course of three weeks. After all, our founders’ time is

precious, so I understand that not everyone will be able to reply.

- 2. Analyze the responses.

Once you’ve collected all the responses, it’s time to identify trends and

common themes. While the numerical scores can help you determine

whether you’ve been moving in the right direction, the real value of

NPS is in people’s answers to questions two and three. After reviewing

all the data, unearth and organize the actionable feedback that your

entrepreneurs have shared.

For example, over the years I’ve received feedback that some

entrepreneurs could use more support with certain functional areas

like non-dilutive ﬁnancing or marketing. Another common theme in

early NPS surveys was surprise or disappointment with the size of the

investment we were able to make, while other respondents suggested we

should get a more explicit green light before sharing their information

with co-investors. Importantly, while we can’t make changes based on

every piece of feedback we receive (e.g., our maximum check size is

limited by fund size constraints), we are often able to extract at least

some actionable takeaways (e.g., the need to communicate check size

expectations more clearly). These are the kinds of valuable insights

that a traditional satisfaction survey would be unlikely to surface as

they require respondents to feel comfortable giving real constructive

# feedback.

In addition, while these survey questions don’t ask for input on speciﬁc

team members, founders will sometimes oﬀer feedback on individual

people unprompted. These proactive comments can be especially

meaningful, whether they’re a positive spotlight highlighting someone

who’s gone above and beyond or constructive criticism emphasizing an

# opportunity for improvement.

Responses like these demonstrate just how frank and direct

entrepreneurs can be (even in non-anonymous surveys) — if you create

a safe space in which they can share their feedback freely and without fear of reprisal. While unexpected feedback can be diﬃcult to receive,

it’s also incredibly valuable, and I am always grateful when founders are

willing to share these critical insights. I’ve also found that reviewing this

feedback together with my team — reﬂecting on our shared areas for

improvement and collaboratively exploring creative solutions — can be

a powerful trust-building exercise, bringing the internal team closer and

making the entire organization more eﬀective.

- 3. Prioritize and implement improvement areas.

Of course, you can’t do everything at once. To turn your entrepreneurs’

actionable insights into real change, it’s vital to prioritize the highest-

impact actions you can take — for both the entrepreneurs you’ve

already invested in and for those you will want to invest in going

forward. It’s also important to act fast: The startup world moves quickly,

so if you wait too long to implement, it may be too late to make a

# diﬀerence.

Since launching TDK Ventures, my team and I have made numerous

changes to our operations in direct response to feedback from

our annual NPS surveys. For example, in response to feedback

that our entrepreneurs could use more support with ﬁnances, HR/

recruiting, and ﬁnding customers/building ecosystems, we recruited

non-investment principals in each of these areas. Similarly, in response

to feedback that some of our early-stage portfolio companies didn’t

have enough (or any) experience in marketing, we created a marketing

principal role to give portfolio companies a blueprint and coach them.

We’ve also made a handful of process changes. For instance, in response

to feedback that entrepreneurs were disappointed by our relatively

small check sizes given the depth of our due diligence review, we reﬁned

our communications to ensure that clearer expectations were set up

front and that our due diligence was more right-sized to the stage of

## the startup. In addition, while we strictly adhere to all conﬁdentiality

agreements, we received one suggestion to secure explicit signoﬀ before

sharing a startup’s information with other investors. In response, we

improved our process to ensure thorough conﬁrmations with each

founder before sharing materials.

- 4. Communicate the changes back.

Finally, don’t forget to close the loop by communicating changes back

to the people who gave you the gift of relevant feedback. This doesn’t

mean spamming people incessantly; if you aren’t making speciﬁc

changes based on their feedback, there’s no need to send unnecessary

updates. But for the founders who shared quality, actionable input, this

can be a great opportunity to express gratitude and further cement your

# relationship.

Here again, it’s important to personalize communications. Rather than

sending a blanket email, thank your founders individually for their

speciﬁc input, and demonstrate exactly how you’re acting on it.

In my responses, I always make sure to start by expressing my genuine

appreciation for their helpful input. I then describe the speciﬁc, tactical

changes that we’re making to address the issue they identiﬁed. And

time and time again, I’ve seen just how impactful this approach can

be: In one case, I received the following reply just ﬁve minutes after

sending such a message: “Wonderful to hear Nicolas!! You just reinforced

# the reason for my ‘10’ [rating] below.”

. . .

Of course, every ﬁrm is diﬀerent. While TDK Ventures has had success

with this approach, it may not work for all VC ﬁrms. Smaller or younger

VC ﬁrms with fewer companies in their portfolios may be less likely to

glean as many useful insights, simply because they won’t have access

to as much feedback as larger ﬁrms. Moreover, while I have found NPS

to be incredibly valuable in my own experience, more data — that is,

more VCs trying out this methodology — would further validate its

eﬀectiveness. As with any initiative, experimentation and iteration are

# critical.

But in general, if you expect your entrepreneurs to listen to their

customers, it’s only fair that you listen to yours, too.

The four-step approach I’ve outlined is an easy way to both capitalize

on the untapped ideas your entrepreneurs can oﬀer and to ensure

you’re able to provide them with as positive an experience as possible,

ultimately increasing the chances that they’ll recommend you to their

networks. This is a true “equal-win” for VCs and entrepreneurs: It makes

the VC better at serving its entrepreneurs (which beneﬁts startups),

and it inspires those entrepreneurs to become champions of the VC,

ultimately helping VCs connect with even more great entrepreneurs and

## access ever stronger investment opportunities.
