Moving from frontline management to becoming a leader of leaders

is a huge professional milestone. The role often comes with broader

scope, bigger expectations, and inﬂuence to shape strategy, culture,

and the organization’s performance at the highest levels. Reaching this

point can feel thrilling, even validating. After years of proving yourself,

you’ve earned a seat at the table. Your input carries more weight. You’re

probably excited about setting direction and solving more important

# problems.

But here’s where things get tricky. While a senior role comes with nice

rewards, the transition itself can be disorienting. Leading leaders isn’t

“more of the same” just with bigger teams and budgets. In reality, you

have to fundamentally shift how you think about your role, how you

spend your time, and how you measure success.

Claudia, an operations executive, discovered this the hard way. She

had built her reputation on solving any problem, from late shipments

and client complaints to staﬃng shortages. When she was promoted

to oversee four regional managers, Claudia saw it as an extension of her previous role. She jumped in to oﬀer guidance, sat in on team

meetings, and weighed in on almost every decision, not realizing she

was crowding out her managers in the process. They seemed frustrated,

not grateful—and Claudia’s boss questioned why she was still in the weeds. She found herself working longer hours but feeling less eﬀective

# than ever before.

This was a wake-up call for Claudia. What had made her successful

at the frontline level—behaviors like being hands-on and swooping in

with solutions—was now holding her back. She was competent and

capable, but she hadn’t updated her professional identity to match her

new operating altitude.

Maybe you also ﬁnd yourself in the middle of transitioning to leading

leaders and trying to ﬁnd your footing. If so, then like Claudia, you

might be realizing that it requires rewiring beliefs you have about what makes you valuable and eﬀective. Here are the three key shifts you need

to make.

- 1. Going from expert to coach

Your job is no longer to be the smartest in the room, but to grow your

managers into independent decision-makers. That means resisting the

urge to jump in with ﬁxes and instead creating space for your team to

build their own judgment. This can feel like a loss or even a dereliction

of your duties, particularly if you’ve prided yourself on being helpful

and knowledgeable. But if you’re the one doing all the strategizing, your

managers don’t get the chance to hone that skill themselves.

The next time your team brings you a challenge, push for their analysis before oﬀering your own thoughts. Ask questions like these to push your

managers to think critically and take ownership, instead of defaulting to

# you:

- What’s the real challenge here?

- What options have you considered?

- What’s your recommendation?

- If I weren’t here, what would you do?

Get comfortable sitting with discomfort while your people wrestle with

ambiguity. Get comfortable with pauses and silence. When a manager

raises an issue, take a breath and say: “That’s complicated. Tell me what

you’re seeing,” or “I understand why you’re concerned. What do you

think is the best course of action?”

- 2. Moving from execution to driving impact through others

As a frontline manager, you were probably deeply involved in assigning

work, tracking progress, and keeping things on course. You might have

gained a sense of comfort from knowing exactly what was happening on

# the ground.

But now, you have to loosen that grip. When you’re driving multiple

teams’ performance, your role shifts to cultivating conditions where

good work can happen without your direct involvement.

This shift can be emotionally challenging. Your satisfaction once came from checking tasks oﬀ a list and ending each day with concrete

proof of what you accomplished. At the senior level, your productivity

becomes intangible—strategic conversations, coaching sessions, and

relationship-building that creates value you can’t easily measure.

When you catch yourself thinking, “I talked all day and have nothing to show for it,” think beyond the ﬁrst-order eﬀects of your actions.

Did you guide an important decision? Align priorities so work moves

forward faster? These wins may not come with a dopamine hit in the moment, but the second- and third-order eﬀects compound over

time. The feedback you gave a manager today might mean stronger

performance next quarter. The way you challenge someone could give

them the conﬁdence to take a bolder approach that secures a major

# account three months from now.

- 3. Evolving from oversight to scalable systems

Since you’re overseeing more people and projects, the volume of

information coming at you may double or triple. Without proper

mechanisms in place, you may drown in details or miss critical issues

entirely. So identify three to ﬁve priorities or risks you must stay closest

to, such as revenue targets or client retention. Then establish clear

guardrails for when your managers should escalate issues versus handle

# them independently, for example:

- Run any new expense over $5,000 by me. • New hires above the director level band need my signoﬀ.

- Any situation that could generate negative publicity should be brought

# directly to me.

Asynchronous systems also give you visibility without creating more

overhead. You might ask for biweekly or monthly written updates

highlighting key metrics, wins, challenges, and upcoming priorities

from each manager. Or you can have each team create a dashboard that

tracks critical data points so you can check status at a glance rather than

# schedule multiple meetings.

Becoming a leader of leaders is a change of both scope and attitude. Your decisions may now aﬀect dozens (or hundreds) of employees. Your

results depend on how well other experienced professionals do their

jobs, not on what you can personally make happen. Stepping into these

shifts doesn’t happen overnight and it can feel nerve-wracking for a

while. But once you make peace with—and embrace—this new version

of leadership, you’ll unlock new levels of impact and satisfaction you

never imagined.
