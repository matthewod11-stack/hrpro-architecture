## For more than three decades, the Americans with Disabilities Act

(ADA) has served a critical role in advancing accessible and equitable

communications for deaf and hard of hearing individuals. The

ADA has expanded the required use of sign language interpreters,

mandated closed captioning on television, and has compelled access

to telecommunications systems. While the ADA was passed long before

today’s advanced technologies, its prescient call 34 years ago for

equitable communications remains as relevant a guiding force as ever, a

beacon illuminating a path toward accessibility in our AI-driven world.

The past few years have been transformational for deaf and hard

of hearing people’s access to communications technologies. Systems

built with and powered by AI now deliver real-time translation using

automated speech recognition technology to seamlessly convert speech

to text. There are additional emerging innovations that have the

potential to automate speech to sign language translation facilitated

by AI-powered digital avatars. However, these advances come with real

## challenges, particularly in customer service interactions.

As companies race to automate their customer service operations, many

are inadvertently creating new barriers for deaf and hard of hearing

people. Since the 1990s, deaf and hard of hearing people have primarily

relied on telecommunication relay services (TRS) to interact with voice

callers. TRS is staﬀed by agents working from call centers who facilitate

## communication between a deaf caller and a non-deaf voice user, either

# through text or sign language.

TRS was transformational for deaf and hard of hearing people when

it was introduced decades ago. But it is most eﬀective when a deaf

person using the service is able to directly connect with the voice

caller they are attempting to reach. It is highly problematic when used

to interface with customer service operations. Picture the challenges

of using one call center to communicate with another, and how this

creates a suboptimal experience for the deaf and hard of hearing

individual. You can imagine how complex the call becomes, especially

## on private matters such as banking or healthcare, as the conversation

is relayed back and forth while interfacing with interactive customer

service systems. TRS is not designed to eﬀectively navigate the complex,

partially or fully automated systems that many companies use to

streamline their customer services.

What’s more, complex voice recognition systems and the proliferation

of AI-enabled bots can often be confusing and fail to accommodate the

unique needs of deaf and hard of hearing customers who primarily

and natively communicate in sign language. While chatbots can be

programmed to communicate in a multitude of languages, there is no

mechanism at present for them to support customers that depend on

sign language to communicate. Thus, they undermine the equivalency

that Title IV of the ADA not only envisioned but mandated: that the

communications experience for deaf people should be the same as the

experience enjoyed by people who are not deaf.

The global call center market, ranging from business process

outsourcers to ﬁnancial institutions to airlines, is estimated to reach

more than $740 billion by 2030. Providers are rapidly accelerating

toward total automation through the implementation of AI-supported customer service applications. While this desire for eﬃciency is

understandable given the enormous costs involved with customer

service, it is crucial that innovations do not leave anyone behind,

especially considering the signiﬁcant spending power of deaf and

# disabled communities.

Drawing from decades of experience working with and on behalf of deaf

and hard of hearing communities in the delivery of communication

services, here are a few ways leaders can lean on the vision and spirit

of the ADA to create more inclusive and accessible customer service

# programs in this era of AI:

- 1. Design customer experiences to be inclusive from the beginning.

Consider the requirements of deaf and hard of hearing individuals at

every stage of service delivery. For example, if a company is looking

to add a chatbot, they should ensure that its chatbots can seamlessly

transfer to a live representative who can communicate via sign language

or provide additional text-based support. Where possible, involve deaf

end users in ideation and testing your systems to identify potential

# barriers.

- 2. Repurpose a portion of the efficiencies gained from automation to support more complex customer service needs.

For instance, using the resources you’ve saved through AI automation,

create a dedicated queue for customers with disabilities to receive

assistance from specially trained live representatives and implement

the ability to deliver services directly in sign language whenever

# possible.

- 3. Use an abundant and expansive mindset in the engineering of customer experiences.

Companies should consider oﬀering multiple channels of

communication — voice, text, and sign language via video — and allow

customers to toggle between these modes with ease. The more points of

access you can create, the better.

- 4. Demonstrate socially responsible practices.

Highlight your company’s accessibility initiatives and features — not

## just in your customer service practices, but across your organization

— in your marketing and customer communications. This not only

telegraphs to customers with disabilities that they are valued, but also

that your company is genuinely committed to the inclusivity of all its

# customers.

- 5. Involve individuals with lived experience as a person with a disability in the development of any AI-powered application.

Hire deaf and disabled people to directly contribute to your company’s

projects. Additionally, consider partnering with deaf and disability-led

organizations, creating a disability advisory board, or working with

qualiﬁed deaf and disability consultants to provide ongoing feedback

## on the accessibility of your customer service programs and systems.

Consider an example that puts these principles into practice. Fifteen

years ago, Communication Service for the Deaf (CSD), where I am the

CEO, began to advocate for the use of direct video calling (DVC). DVC

creates tremendous value for entities that adopt the service in that it

## reduces total call time by as much as 42% and substantially increases

customer satisfaction. The economies of scale it requires means that

DVC is not a panacea or a replacement for TRS, but it is a vastly superior

method of access for engaging deaf and hard of hearing individuals with

## your company’s customer service operations.

Since then, major organizations including the 988 Suicide & Crisis

## Lifeline, Comcast’s Xﬁnity Internet, Google, and Cox Communications

are all using DVC today as an adjunct to their call centers. Comcast

Xﬁnity has even taken this a step further. It has enabled a deaf

subscriber to call directly in to an ASL-ﬂuent customer service

representative working on behalf of Comcast, thereby eliminating the

need to hop between two diﬀerent call centers and to involve any third-

party agent or interpreter to resolve a customer service issue.

Access for deaf people has come far in recent decades and because

of the ADA and all the important legislation that has followed. As we

look ahead in the twenty-ﬁrst century, two things are certain. The AI

revolution will only accelerate, and with aging populations, more of us

will live with a disability. The potential of AI should be to broaden, not

narrow, the opportunities for companies to engage and interact with

their customers. We must leverage and seek to integrate innovation in

ways that consider human nuances — particularly in assuring equitable

# communications access for everyone.

Organizations must remember that when implementing new technologies, like Gen AI, for eﬃciency, they don’t forget the working

technologies still available that can aid and assist customers with

speciﬁc needs. DVC and other such tools can work in tandem with

automated systems and meet the unique communication needs of deaf

and disabled people. Now, more than ever, and decades following its

establishment, the ADA remains an important, powerful guide to ensure

## an accessible and equitable AI world for all of us.
