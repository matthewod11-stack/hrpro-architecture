Despite the U.S. population’s growing diversity, managerial roles are

still predominantly held by white men. While the largest ﬁrms have

been pledging to recruit and train Black workers for over 40 years,

there has been little increase in Black representation in managerial roles

during this timeframe. In a 2021 analysis, Black employees held only 7%

of managerial roles despite comprising 14% of all employees. Women

have diﬃculty attaining leadership roles despite evidence that “women are more likely than men to lead in a style that is eﬀective.”

## This mismatch between corporate commitment to diversity and

tangible outcomes raises critical questions about the eﬃcacy of

management practices for achieving diverse representation. Our research, published in Business Horizons, examines the degree to

which speciﬁc management practices are associated with increased

(or decreased) diverse managerial representation and how often

organizations implement each practice.

## How Do Management Practices Impact Organizational Diversity?

Our research draws on data from Dobbin and Kalev across 806 organizations collected between 1971 and 2015, examining the eﬀect

## of management practices on diverse representation in managerial

roles. We extend beyond their work by examining how frequently

each management practice is utilized in organizations. Contrasting interventions’ eﬀectiveness and prevalence of use in organizations

provides crucial insights into why organizations are not making greater

# progress toward diverse representation.

The table below summarizes 16 management practices alongside their eﬀectiveness and prevalence in organizations. Eﬀectiveness is the

## average percent change in managerial representation across seven

## demographic groups: White women, Black women, Black men, Latinx

## women, Latinx men, Asian women, and Asian men. Positive numbers

reﬂect increases in managerial diversity, and negative numbers reﬂect

decreases in managerial diversity. We broadly coded the prevalence of

## each management practice as infrequent (-1), moderate (0), or frequent

(1).

We found the relationship between how often management practices are implemented in organizations and their eﬀectiveness in attaining

diverse representation is negative and strong at -.48. This negative

correlation indicates that organizations are commonly implementing practices that are ineﬀective at — and in some cases even harmful to —

increasing diverse representation while less commonly implementing

practices that positively impact diverse representation. Leaders need to

understand which management practices work so that they can build a

# more diverse managerial team.

# Management Practices and Their Effectiveness for Increasing Managerial Diversity Versus Prevalence

This table summarizes 16 management practices along with their effectiveness

and prevalence in organizations. Effectiveness is the average percent change in

## managerial representation across seven demographic groups: white women, Black

## women, Black men, Latinx women, Latinx men, Asian women, and Asian men.

Positive numbers reflect increases in managerial diversity, and negative numbers

reflect decreases in managerial diversity. The authors broadly coded the prevalence

## of each management practice as infrequent (-1), moderate (0), or frequent (1).

## Effective Practices for Enhancing Management Diversity

Hiring Chief Diversity Oﬃcers and maintaining diversity task forces are the most eﬀective management practices. Both practices have the

advantage of creating formal accountability for promoting diversity.

Having jobs explicitly focused on DEI ensures that DEI remains

a strategic priority and empowers employees to make meaningful

changes. Despite their impact, paid diversity roles are only utilized

by 10-20% of large employers and are decreasing in prevalence as

organizational support for diversity programs has become politically

polarized.

Formal mentoring, family-accommodating practices, targeted

recruitment, empowering training, and setting diversity goals were each eﬀective in advancing diverse representation but were also not widely

implemented.

Mentoring fosters career success by providing coaching on work-related

goals, facilitating developmental assignments, and having someone

# advocate on mentees’ behalf.

## Family-friendly practices (childcare, ﬂextime, and parental leave) can

accommodate the disproportionate work-life challenges experienced by

women and people of color. In heterosexual married couples, women

spend substantially more time on caregiving than their husbands, even

among couples with egalitarian earnings. Relative to white parents,

Black parents are more likely to quit a job, turn down a job, or change

jobs due to childcare challenges. Ensuring that employees are not

stigmatized for utilizing family-friendly practices is imperative for these

programs to increase diverse representation.

Targeted recruitment, empowering training (training that teaches

managers and employees to foster DEI rather than scolding them to

avoid harassment and discrimination), and setting diversity goals each

involve employees as change agents, encouraging them to cultivate a

diverse and inclusive workforce. By treating employees as well-meaning

citizens rather than oﬀenders, employees are more likely to monitor their behavior and direct eﬀorts toward increasing workforce diversity.

Notably, organizations implement family-friendly practices with moderate frequency, while other eﬀective practices, such as targeted

recruitment, empowering training, and setting diversity goals, are

implemented infrequently.

## Practices with Mixed Effects on Management Diversity

## Cross-training, employee resource groups, self-managed teams, and

skills training yielded mixed results in promoting managerial diversity.

These practices either increase managerial representation for some

underrepresented groups while decreasing representation for others or have minimal eﬀects on managerial diversity. Eﬀects are often mixed

across demographic groups because underrepresented groups vary in

participation in these interventions. For instance, white women are

more likely to have a college degree than Black Americans and Latinos,

which is often a prerequisite for managerial training.

While employee resource groups can create spaces for underrepresented

employees to connect, they place the burden of enacting DEI strategies on women and people of color. Other practices with mixed eﬀects

often have limited access for lower-level employees because employers

dictate which employees are eligible to participate. For example, cross-

training allows employees to broaden their skills by training in other

roles. This can be especially beneﬁcial for women and people of color, who often hold jobs that oﬀer little room for advancement and lack

access to inﬂuential social networks. Yet, many lower-level employees

are not permitted to participate in cross-training, limiting their ability

to advance their careers. Similarly, employer-provided skills training

has been declining in recent decades. This decline is problematic

predominantly white school districts, resulting in white employees

entering the workforce with greater access to skilling opportunities than

employees of color. As such, organizational training is needed to rectify

# inequitable educational outcomes.

Across the four interventions with mixed eﬀects, only skills training is

frequently utilized in organizations. Cross-training, employee resource

groups, and self-managed teams are implemented with moderate

# frequency.

## Counterproductive Practices That Hinder Diverse Representation

Four of the most pervasive management practices — performance

evaluations, diversity and harassment training, grievance procedures,

and job tests for managers (standardized reading and writing tests or

assessments of work-related skills) — are each counterproductive for

attaining diverse managerial representation. While these practices may

reduce legal trouble, they fail to increase managerial diversity.

These methods often exacerbate existing biases and fail to address

systemic barriers, perpetuating organizational inequities. For example,

diversity and harassment training programs frequently focus on blame,

legal consequences, and unconscious bias. Employees are often told

they are biased, and managers are informed that they will be held

accountable if employees are accused of discrimination. This is

counterproductive because employees tend to react with resistance

and anger to these messages, inadvertently increasing discriminatory

behavior. Employees may leave these courses either feeling like they

have been accused of being bad people or deciding how questionable

their behavior can become before crossing legal thresholds.

Grievance procedures are ineﬀective because employees are often

discouraged from ﬁling grievances or are subjected to retaliation.

Indeed, nearly half of all grievance complaints focus on retaliation.

These practices make women and people of color feel like they are

expected to ignore discrimination to act like team players. Grievances

should be taken seriously and proactively addressed to advance

# workplace equality.

Notably, organizations frequently implement practices that are

counterproductive for advancing management diversity, including

## performance evaluations, diversity and harassment training, and

## grievance procedures. The only counterproductive practice that

organizations utilize infrequently is managerial job tests.

. . .

Progress toward diverse managerial representation has been slow and

plagued by persistent challenges. While legislative measures such as the

1964 and 1991 U.S. Civil Rights Acts instigated marked advancements,

the absence of comparable legislation in the last 30 years suggests that

we are relying on employers to drive progress toward equality.

Organizational diversity interventions have proliferated since the 1960s,

providing the pretense for more just and equitable workplaces. The

Black Lives Matter and Me Too movements, for instance, have provided

an opportunity for similar advancements. However, the current

landscape has seen a backlash against DEI, spurred by political agendas,

misconstrued interpretations of DEI objectives, and the erosion of

# aﬃrmative action.

When there are resource constraints, DEI initiatives are often

one of the ﬁrst things to be cut in organizations. Organizations

also predominantly rely solely on practices that undermine or

fail to advance diverse representation. If we are going to see

meaningful progress toward diverse representation, organizations need

to use their limited resources on the most eﬀective strategies, like

employing Chief Diversity Oﬃcers, creating diversity task forces,

and implementing formal mentoring programs. Companies should

also expand family-friendly practices such as childcare, ﬂextime, and

parental leave. Importantly, diversity training should be revamped.

Rather than focusing on legal repercussions and blaming employees

for discrimination, training programs should empower employees to

# advance diversity and inclusion.

Our ﬁndings underscore the urgency for organizations to reassess

their management practices, prioritizing those that foster diverse

representation and dismantling systemic barriers. By heeding evidence-

based insights, organizations can envision a future with diverse

and inclusive workplaces while using science to guide the cultural

# transition.
