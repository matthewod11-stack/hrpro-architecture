# What the Experts Say

Employee discontent is on the rise: more workers today are thinking

about quitting their jobs than during the Great Resignation in 2022,

according to a June PwC report. And since the current job market is

not as favorable as it was then, particularly for knowledge workers,

many people feel “frustrated and trapped,” according to Anthony

## Klotz, associate professor of organizational behavior at UCL School

of Management. This breeds resentment which can lead people to

“act like jerks,” says Klotz, noting that they’re more likely to, for

instance, “commit small acts of incivility or rudeness,” like excluding

colleagues from group emails or interrupting others during meetings.

It’s up to you, the manager, to take action, says Ron Carucci, co-

founder and managing partner at Navalent, a consulting ﬁrm, and

the author of the book, To Be Honest: Lead with the Power of Truth,

Justice and Purpose. “Even if you’re the target of resentment, it’s your

job to defuse it,” Carucci says. He advises approaching the situation

## with “curiosity, openness, and empathy to de-escalate emotions” and

“engage constructively.” Here are some eﬀective ways to do that.

Don’t assume it will resolve on its own

Teams are going to have the occasional oﬀ day: a tense, unproductive

meeting, say, or times when colleagues are overly critical of each

other. Their grievances might not even be work-related. “There could

be something happening in their personal lives, or they’re worried

about the wonky political climate or inﬂation,” says Carucci. “People

are living on edge.” If team dynamics otherwise show a “reasonable

level of engagement, contribution, and enjoyment,” it could be just

part of the normal ebb and ﬂow of human interaction. But if rudeness

and resentment become a pattern, you must address it with speed

and seriousness. “Don’t assume time will take care of it,” Klotz says.

Left unchecked, resentment erodes morale and becomes contagious,

creating what are called “spirals of incivility,” he adds. “That kind of

environment drains whatever positive momentum you have.”

# Stay close to your team

Recognizing when group dynamics are “slipping a little too far into

interpersonal strife and animosity” requires a deep understanding of

your team members’ priorities and personalities. “You need to know

your team well enough to spot when debate shifts from task conﬂict

to relationship conﬂict and when intervention is necessary,” says Klotz.

Sometimes resentment looks like lashing out; other times it manifests

as silence or withdrawal. “Look for changes in people’s eﬀort or energy

level,” he adds. Carucci advises opening lines of communication. “Tell

your team: ‘If you’re feeling frustrated, tired, or concerned, I want to

hear about it — even if I’m the source of that frustration.’” (More on this

# below.)

If you see something, say something

When you spot signals of resentment within your team, whatever form

it takes, what should you do? Klotz recommends following advice

often seen on the subway: “If you see something, say something.”

These conversations are best handled one-on-one and they require a

deft touch tailored to the person you’re talking with and what you’ve

noticed. The goal, says Carucci, is to “build a team that’s conﬂict

# resilient.” For instance:

- If your colleague is the reticent type: Klotz recommends starting

the discussion with an open-ended question, like “How’s it going?”

or “Anything on your mind?” Then you might share an observation:

“You’ve seemed a little quiet lately,” or “I noticed there was conﬂict

in the team meeting earlier, and you didn’t say much.” Show genuine

interest in their well-being and open the door for them to express their

thoughts and feelings. “It’s an act of support,” he says.

- If your colleague leans more toward outspoken and irritable:

Probe the source of their frustration and resentment, Klotz says. Do

they want more development? A bigger role in decision making? Do

they feel neglected? Then, he says, think about what you can do to

help and how you might adapt your leadership style to better suit their

needs. Be compassionate, but not indulgent, says Carruci. Explain how

colleagues perceive their behavior. “We don’t all have to be best friends

but we have expectations for treating one another with respect, even

# during our worst moments.”

- If your colleague is a recreational complainer: When the griping

is constant with no particular cause other than everyday work

frustrations, be gentle but ﬁrm, says Carucci. He suggests saying

something like, “You have high expectations and freely express them

when they’re not met, but I worry the team will tune out if it happens

too often. They might miss real concerns.” Then suggest they be more

selective when voicing complaints. Otherwise, their negativity risks

spreading resentment to others. “A bad apple spoils the barrel,” says

# Klotz.

# Embrace tough feedback

Sometimes the target of resentment is you, says Carucci. As a manager,

you’re the object for everyone’s unresolved issues with authority.

“You’re their seventh-grade gym teacher, their ﬁrst mean boss, and

their awful uncle.” It’s not fun and it might not be fair — but you need

to be open to the possibility that they could have a valid point. The

absolute worst responses are defensiveness, dismissiveness, or passive

aggression, Carucci says. Avoid feigned empathy and condescension,

too. “No pursing your lips and saying, ‘Oh, poor you.’” Instead, approach

the conversation with compassion and curiosity. “Ask for feedback to

understand how your team members are metabolizing and experiencing

# your leadership.”

# Advocate for your team

On the other hand, your team might harbor resentment toward the

organization — leadership decisions that seem nonsensical or reward

systems that are misaligned. When systemic issues fester as resentment,

it can undermine your team’s motivation and productivity, notes

Carucci. That’s why it’s vital to communicate your team’s concerns

to your bosses, stressing the impact on morale and advocating for

necessary changes. Demonstrating to your team that you support them

and have their back fosters trust. At the very least, he says, you can act

as a buﬀer, shielding them from the dysfunctions of the organization.

“Create a quarantine from the systemic issues and policies that are

plaguing your team,” he says. “Be their ﬁrst line of defense.”

# Shake things up

Resentment often tends to surface as quibbling and criticism during

meetings or routine communication, notes Carucci. “People can come

across as annoyed, impatient, and distracted.” To counteract this, Klotz

recommends introducing changes to your daily or weekly meetings.

Replace the typical conference table setting with a walking meeting, or

experiment with rotating meeting leaders instead of always being the

Zoom moderator yourself. “Disrupt the communication patterns and get

a reset,” he says. Shaking up your team’s routines creates an opportunity

# for a fresh start.

# Focus on common goals

As humans, we’re hardwired to focus on threats and negative events

more than positive ones. “Psychologists call this positive-negative

asymmetry, and it explains why even small negative events wield such

power,” according to Klotz. To mitigate this, he suggests amplifying

positive events. “Take the time to celebrate wins, acknowledge

accomplishments, and focus your team on a common goal,” he says.

This way, instead of looking inward and ﬁghting, the team’s attention

shifts outward toward the future. “It helps cleanse the negative vibes.”

Clearly communicate your purpose and mission. The objective is to

cultivate optimism and drive, he adds. “Say: ‘Here’s what we’re doing,

why we’re doing it, and where we’re going.’”

# Principles to Remember

# Do

- Talk to team members one-on-one about signs of resentment you’ve

noticed; if necessary, discuss how their negative behavior is perceived

# by others.

- Experiment with new routines and communication to counteract

potential resentment and improve team dynamics.

- Be an advocate for your team by both expressing their concerns to

leadership and shielding them from organizational dysfunction.

# Don’t

- Hesitate to step in when team dynamics shift from arguing about work

to personal conﬂicts; keep communication open and let your team

know you’ve got their back.

- Respond with defensiveness when you’re the target of resentment;

instead, be curious and seek feedback to understand how your team

# perceives your leadership.

- Allow negative events to dominate; instead, celebrate wins,

acknowledge accomplishments, and focus your team on a common

# goal.
