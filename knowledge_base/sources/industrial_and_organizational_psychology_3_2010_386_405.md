Abstract The major premise of this article is that increased exposure to—and increased application of—theories, methods, and ﬁndings from the judgment and decision-making (JDM) ﬁeld will aid industrial–organizational psychology and organizational behavior (IOOB) researchers and practitioners in studying workplace decisions. To this end, we ﬁrst provide evidence of the lack of cross-fertilization between JDM and IOOB and then provide an overview of the JDM research literature. Next, with the aid of a panel of prominent IOOB scholars who share JDM interests, we discuss the philosophical and methodological traditions in IOOB and JDM, the areas in which IOOB has already been enriched by JDM as well as the areas in which it might be further enriched in the future, ways of increasing cross-fertilization from JDM to IOOB, and ways in which IOOB can in turn contribute to JDM. Through this focal article, we hope to spark conversation and ultimately engender more cross-fertilization between JDM and IOOB.

# I–Opsychologyandworkplacedecisions

Shutting down the assembly-line after hearing a suspicious sound, selecting one out of several job applicants, prioritizing one work task over another, and smoking marijuana in one’s ofﬁce cubicle are all examples of decisions made by employees. Similarly, estimating how long a particular take to complete, task will forecasting the next year, appraising the sales for fairness of received outcomes, and rating the job performance of subordinates are all examples ofjudgments madebyemployees. We therefore argue that a consider- able proportion of the topics of interest to the ﬁeld of industrial–organizational (I–O) psychology and the related ﬁeld of orga- nizational behavior and human resources fall (collectively abbreviated as within the purview of the ﬁeld of judgment and decision making (JDM). Of course, some IOOB topics are likely to fall out- JDM. For example, side the purview of consider work behavior. Behavior that is completely ‘‘routinized’’ (Weiss & Ilgen, 1985) or that is enacted under the dictates of prohibitively ‘‘strong’’ situations (Meyer, Dalal, & Bonaccio, 2009) may fall out- side the JDM sphere. Even so, this leaves an awfully large portion of the construct space of work behavior potentially within the domain of JDM.

IOOB)

It is not the case that IOOB is uninter- ested in the types of decisions (or judg- ments) mentioned in the ﬁrst paragraph. On the contrary, IOOB has avidly studied, and continues to avidly study, most of them. The issue, as we see it, is that IOOB does not typically study these workplace decisions asdecisions.

Inrecent years,books suchasPredictably Irrational (Ariely, 2008), Blink (Gladwell, 2005), Nudge (Thaler & Sunstein, 2008), and others have focused on the appli- cation of JDM ideas to various domains life—and have gone on to become of bestsellers. JDM approaches have pene- trated areas as diverse as medical decision making, ﬁnancial forecasting, jury decision making, consumer behavior, accounting and auditing, economics, and even other areas of psychology (e.g., social psychology

and neuropsychology) because each of these ﬁelds often involves the study of judgments and decisions. Yet, despite the fact that numerous topics within IOOB also involve judgments or decisions, JDM approaches have not (barring a few promi- nent exceptions) penetrated IOOB.

This lack of cross-fertilization between JDM and IOOB is suggested by several lines of evidence:

- JDM topics are not well represented in the IOOB journals (other than Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes). Fewer than 5 of the 100 most published authors in the Journal of Applied Psychology (JAP) and PersonnelPsychology (PPsych) in the 1990s (see Ones & Viswesvaran, 2000) appear to have meaningful JDM interests. Similarly, Cascio and Aguinis (2008) concluded that, during the 2003–2007 period, only 5.25% of the 457 articles published in JAP and 0.00% of the 111 articles published in PPsychfocused on JDM topics (loosely deﬁned). In line with these ﬁndings, fewer than 10 of the over 200 current JAP editorial board members appear to have meaningful JDM interests. • JDM is not well represented at the SIOP conference. In 2007–2010, the JDM category of the SIOP conference than 11 program contained fewer entries per year (though a handful of other entries in other categories could also arguably be classiﬁed as JDM). In a related vein, not one of the 24 presidents listed on the Web site of the Society for Judgment and Decision Making is currently a member of SIOP.1

- JDMtopicsarenotwellrepresentedin undergraduate-levelIOOBtextbooks. Not one of the well-known I–O text books has a chapter speciﬁcally on though some OB text books JDM,

do. Text books that do not have a JDM chapter occasionally cover some JDM content in the chapter on teams (and, rarely, the chapter on personnel selection).

- JDMtopicsarenotwellrepresentedin the output of IOOB-oriented consult- ing ﬁrms. Only 1 of 45 white papers and technical reports displayed on the Websitesof three well-known consult- ing ﬁrms pertained directly to JDM.

In our view, the lack of cross-fertilization between JDM and IOOB is unfortunate. We believe that increased exposure to—and application of—theories, methods, and ﬁndings from the JDM ﬁeld will aid IOOB researchers and practitioners in studying workplace decisions as decisions. This is the major premise of our article.2

To be sure, there have been others before us who have attempted to encourage IOOB to embrace JDM methods and research (and vice versa). Consider, for example,

I have been of the philosophical position that [IOOB and JDM] (if I could get either to read the papers of the other) ... have much to say to each other. (Naylor, 1984, p. 2)

Decision theory offers a unique ana- lytical framework for studying person- nel/human resource management (HRM) decisions. (Boudreau, 1984, p. 198)

As the very nature of human resource management is a series of choices (including recruiting, hiring, evaluating, promoting, transferring, demoting, and terminating), the foibles and shortcom- ings of human decision makers are of

However, our target readership for this article is the IOOB community (though we hope that the JDM community also ﬁnds the article interesting and useful). With our target readership in mind, we have primarily focused on how IOOB can beneﬁt from more infusion of JDM approaches as well as why so little JDM-to-IOOB transfer has occurred so far.

In this article, in an attempt to persuade the reader of the beneﬁts of additional cross- fertilization, we follow a slightly uncon- ventional approach. First, we summarize IOOB-relevant research from the ﬁeld of JDM (including its implications for improv- ing managerial decision making). This sets the stage for a discussion among mem- bers of that select group of researchers who have one foot in the IOOB world and the other in the JDM world. The discussion focuses on (a) the differences between JDM and IOOB in terms of philosophical per- spectives and research methods (including the obstacles to and opportunities associ- ated with cross-fertilization); (b) examples of ways in which IOOB researchers have successfully applied theories, methods, and ﬁndings from JDM; (c) examples of ways in which IOOB researchers could fruitfully apply theories, methods, and ﬁndings from JDM in the future; and (d) concrete recom- mendations for increasing cross-fertilization from JDM to IOOB (and vice versa). We end with a series of questions to spark further conversation on these issues in the IOOB community.

## A Canter Through IOOB-Relevant Research on JDM

Our overview is focused on our (i.e., the ﬁrst and second authors’) views regarding topics that will be most useful or at least

# I–Opsychologyandworkplacedecisions

thought provoking to IOOB researchers and practitioners. We therefore delib- erately do not provide an exhaustive overview of the JDM literature (for examples of more comprehensive reviews, albeit with diverse emphases, see Bazerman & Moore, 2008; Highhouse, 2001; Stevenson, Busemeyer, & Naylor, 1990). We do, how- ever, touch brieﬂy upon some topics that fall outside the realm of the traditional JDM literature (e.g., naturalistic and strate- gic decision making) because we believe relevance to them to be of particular IOOB. We have structured this overview on the basis of several themes—namely, judgments versus decisions, a focus on internal versus external validity, levels of analysis, applied implications, and philo- sophical approaches—collected from mul- tiple extant sources (e.g., Doherty, 2003; Maule & Svenson, 1993; Pliske & Klein, 2003; Solomon & Shields, 1995). The main message of this section is that decision- making researchers have studied a wide variety of topics relevant to IOOB; however, they have typically done so using different perspectives and methods than those used in mainstream IOOB.

# JudgmentsVersusDecisions

The term judgment typically involves a rating or evaluation of the value or attractiveness of a person, an object, an event, a course of action, or some other phenomenon (Bonner, 1999; Maule & Svenson, 1993). A judgment may be a prediction regarding the future or an assessment of the present (Bonner, 1999). For example, a manager may make a judgment about a subordinate’s overall level of job performance on the basis that subordinate’s task performance, of organizational citizenship behavior, and counterproductive work behavior over the previous year.

A common theoretical approach to studying judgment the lens model is (Brunswik, 1955). Many IOOB researchers and practitioners are likely to already be familiar with the lens model, but, brieﬂy,

the model may be summarized as follows: ‘‘A person’s ability to predict the world is completely determined by how well the world can be predicted from the available data ..., how consistently the person uses the available data ..., and how well the personunderstands theworld ...’’(Doherty, 2003, p. 653). In other words, for a prespec- iﬁed set of cues, the researcher can deter- mine, typically via multiple regression, not only the actual cue–criterion relationships in the environment but also the mental rep- resentation of cue–criterion relationships on the part of a human judge.

In contrast, the term decision refers to the choice between various alternatives, which may be people, objects, events, courses of action, and so forth (Maule & Svenson, 1993). For example, a manager may choose to promote one employee from a workgroup. The terms decision and choiceare often used interchangeably, though, as we will discuss in a later stage in the article, decision making is actually a broader process that the choice stage just encompasses not but also prechoice stages (e.g., generating the alternatives among which one will subsequently choose) and postchoice stages (e.g., commitment to the choice). Moreover, although this view is increasingly falling out of favor, many JDM researchers have historically viewed judgments pertaining to each alternative individually as a necessary precursor to a subsequent choice between these alternatives (Bonner, 1999). For example, the aforementioned manager may choose to promote the highest-performing (in his or her judgment) employee from the workgroup.

# further

Most choices inthe real world are subject to uncertainty, in the sense that the outcome is not fully determined by the choice alone. In our example, the manager cannot be certain that the employee he or she chooses for promotion will be successful at the new level. Therefore, according to the subjective expected utility approach, a decision maker should estimate and then multiply the probability and utility of success for each alternative and should subsequently choose

# 389

# 390

the alternative with the highest expected value of success (Maule & Svenson, 1993). However, Tversky and Kahneman (1974, 1981) have demonstrated that people’s choices cannot be modeled perfectly by subjective expected utility theory. Speciﬁ- cally, apparent shortcomings in cognition (e.g., insensitivity to base rates) lead people to rely on several heuristics (e.g., avail- ability), which lead to systematic errors. Although Tversky and Kahneman’s research on heuristics and biases is among the JDM research best known to IOOB researchers and practitioners, perhaps less well known is the fact that this program of research has not gone unchallenged by JDM researchers. In particular, Gigerenzer (1996) argues that heuristics are adaptive in an evolutionary sense and that the putative biases owe less to deﬁcient human cognition and more to deﬁcient research design on the part of researchers who argue for the existence of these biases. The bottom line from this debate remains that, although heuristics are efﬁcient they require little time or effort) and although they are often accu- rate, they can sometimes result in spectac- ularly ineffective decisions (Doherty, 2003; Gigerenzer, 1996; Kahneman & Tversky, 1996).

(i.e.,

# AFocusonInternalVersus ExternalValidity

Traditional JDM research is focused on internal validity (Pliske & Klein, 2003). It is therefore frequently (though by no means always) conducted in the laboratory. For example, vis-`a-vis the heuristics and biases program of research, Doherty (2003) notes, ‘‘There is a belief that if people cannot do simple, one-shot tasks in the laboratory, it is highly unlikely that they can do complex tasks outside’’ (p. 662).

In a later section, we discuss mainstream JDM’s emphasis on laboratory research in more detail. However, here we introduce a discipline that has arisen in roughly the last 2 decades: naturalistic decision making (NDM). NDM focuses on the study of expert decision makers in context-rich

settings that are frequently characterized by high stakes, complexity, uncertainty, severe time pressure, and multiple goals that may nonetheless be ill-deﬁned, feedback loops, teams or crews of interacting individuals, and so forth (Pliske & Klein, 2003; Salas, Rosen, & DiazGranados, in press).

The theoretical model most closely associated with NDM (Lipshitz, Klein, Orasanu, & Salas, 2001; Pliske & Klein, 2003; the recognition-primed decision model (Klein, 1998). This model, originally developed through the study of ﬁreﬁghter comman- ders, yielded several counter intuitive (from a traditional least) insights. For example, ﬁreﬁghter comman- rarely compared and then chose ders between multiple alternatives; instead, allegedly on the basis of their expertise and situation awareness, they very quickly (i.e., in a matter of moments) generated a single alternative and evaluated its worka- bility. A second alternative was generated only if the ﬁrst alternative was found to be unworkable.

is

# JDM perspective, at

Common methodological approaches used in NDM are high-ﬁdelity simulations (e.g., ﬂight simulators for the study of commercial pilots) as well as cognitive task analysis, which extends traditional job analytic techniques (e.g., the critical incidents technique) by examining the cognitive processes underlying the tasks performed (Lipshitz et al., 2001; Pliske & Klein, 2003).

the new organization theory and strategic decision making—also emphasize external valid- ity and the role of the environment in decision making (Connolly & Koput, 1997; Schwenck, 1995). We describe these approaches in the subsequent section.

Other approaches—namely,

this is often a feature

Although the study of small groups has largely shifted from other disciplines to IOOB (Levine & Moreland, 1990), research in IOOB does not provide the same centrality to group judgmentanddecision- making as does research conducted within a JDM tradition (for an exception, see Hollenbeck et al., 1995). In IOOB, decision making has, for the most part, been treated as just one of several processes (along with motivation, affect, etc.) contributing to group effectiveness. In the case of JDM, decision making has remained central at each level of analysis. Thus, although there is a very large IOOB literature on groups or teams (e.g., Ilgen, Hollenbeck, Johnson, & Jundt, 2005), our focus here is to very brieﬂy summarize ﬁndings from the JDM literature on group processes and outcomes that are likely to be of interest to an IOOB audience. Much research has attempted to under- stand, often via mathematical models, how the prediscussion distribution of group- member preferences and knowledge is translated into group discussion and, ulti- mately, the group-level choice or judgment (e.g., Davis, 1996; Gigone & Hastie, 1993; Stasser, 1999). Sunstein (2003) sums up the bottom line from these programs of research very neatly, as follows: ‘‘Like-minded peo- ple, talking only with one another, usually end up believing a more extreme version of what they thought before they started to talk.... Blunders and even catastrophes are possible results.’’ Sunstein further argues that group processes such as these were partly responsible for the loss of the space shuttle Columbia. As we will discuss at a later stage in the article, these literatures are relevant to the study of teams and assess- ment centers in IOOB.

This potential for groups to make poor choices and judgments has led to several techniques designed to inﬂuence group pro- cess and, thereby, to improve group perfor- mance. Perhaps the technique best known to IOOB researchers as well as managers is group brainstorming. What may not be widely known, however, is that research

has consistently found group brainstorming to be an abject failure (e.g., Diehl & Stroebe, 1987). Among the more promising alterna- tives is the Delphi technique (for a review, see Rowe & Wright, 1999). This technique involves rounds: group-member judgments are obtained anonymously at each round and feedback regarding the dis- tribution of judgments (sometimes accom- panied by rationales provided by members with extreme judgments) is presented to members at the end of each round. After several rounds, the group’s ﬁnal judgment is taken as the median or mean of the mem- bers’ judgments on the last round.

Neither individuals nor teams. Numerous decisions take place within a decision- making unit that is characterized neither by a person acting alone nor by a work team in which all members group or Indeed, with regard have equal status. it could be argued that a to the latter, truly ‘‘one member, one vote’’ type of team is actually not particularly common in the workplace (or elsewhere). Instead, power differentials within teams appear ubiquitous. For the ultimate responsibility for making a decision often lies with a single person (e.g., a leader) who nonetheless incorporates recommendations andinformation fromotherindividuals (e.g., subordinates or subject matter experts) into his or her ﬁnal decision. Such a decision- making unit is called a judge-advisor system or a hierarchical decision-making team (for reviews, see Bonaccio & Dalal, 2006; Humphrey, Hollenbeck, Meyer, & Ilgen, 2002). A consistent ﬁnding is that decision makers do not utilize advice sufﬁciently (from a normative perspective); thus, much recent research has been devoted to understanding factors that enhance advice utilization (e.g., Bonaccio & Dalal, in press; Dalal & Bonaccio, in press).

instance,

The organization. Working from a more ‘‘macro’’ perspective, some organization theorists have focused on what they refer to as ‘‘organizational decision making’’ the (e.g., Shapira, 1997). For example,

# 391

# 392

provocative ‘‘garbage can’’ model of organizational choice (Cohen, March, & Olsen, 1972) addresses the seeming ran- domness and disorder of decisions in orga- nizations by focusing on the externally dictated and highly time-bound arrival, and hence coupling, of problems, choices, solu- tions, and decision makers. More generally, a loose clustering of theories, collectively called the new organization theory, empha- sizes the role of (other organizations, scarce resources, time, etc.) ‘‘as both a constraint on and a venue for organizational decisions’’ (Connolly & Koput, 1997, p. 290).

# the environment

Another perspective, strategic decision making (e.g., Schwenck, 1995), is also ostensibly focused on the organization. However, in reality, this perspective crosses levels of analysis. For example, several it the the choices made by top- organization, management teams (which are sometimes described more along the lines of judge- advisor systems than traditional, nonhier- archical teams), and biases that operate at both the individual and team levels of anal- ysis (e.g., overconﬁdence).

AppliedImplications:Improving ManagerialDecisions

Major decisions by top managers appear to have at least a 50% failure rate (Nutt, 2002). Moreover, aswe have alluded topreviously, core IOOB topics such as employee selec- tion, performance appraisal, motivation, job attitudes, and leadership may themselves be conceptualized through the ‘‘lens’’ of decisions or judgments. The issue of how to improve managerial decision making should therefore be of considerable interest to IOOB practitioners. Importantly, extant JDM research suggests several ineffective and effective prescriptions for improving (or ‘‘debiasing’’) judgments and decisions.

Merely gaining experience at making decisions within a particular domain is not sufﬁcient: highly experienced deci- sion makers are often highly biased in their decisions, in part because feedback

# R.S.Dalaletal.

regarding decision quality is often unavail- able, delayed, or ignored; thus, the inap- propriate strategies used by experienced decision makers frequently need to be ‘‘unfrozen’’ (by demonstrating their poten- tial for error) before improvement can occur (Bazerman & Moore, 2008). Strategies that involve warning the decision maker about bias and identifying the direction of the bias are also ineffective (Fischhoff, 1982). Even extensive training involving personalized feedback appears to be at best moderately effective (Fischhoff, 1982).

Instead, judgments and choices can be improved via one or more of the following evidence-based strategies:

- 1. Making a concerted effort to consider the beneﬁts of adopting courses of action other than the favored one (Bazerman & Moore, 2008; Larrick, 2004).

- 2. Reasoning analogically by identifying similarities and differences across decisions rather than treating each decision as unique (Bazerman & Moore, 2008).

- 3. Taking the average (e.g., median) of the judgments of several (e.g., up to six) expert advisors who are privy to different information and whose judg- ments are consequently uncorrelated (Bonaccio & Dalal, 2006).

- 4. Using simple statistical (e.g., multiple regression) models to ‘‘capture’’ the judgment ‘‘policies’’ of experts and then using these statistical ‘‘models of experts’’ instead of the experts them- selves (because research consistently showsthat,giventhesamesetofinfor- mation, the ‘‘model of the expert’’ outperforms the expert himself or herself; Bazerman & Moore, 2008; Goldberg, 1970; Larrick, 2004). We believe that

ﬁlled by practitioners from other ﬁelds, such as decision analysis.

# PhilosophicalApproaches

Research on decision making has primar- ily used three approaches (Brown, 1989; Maule & Svenson, 1993; von Winterfeldt, 1989):

- 1. the normative approach, which de- ﬁnes ‘‘ideal’’ or ‘‘rational’’ judgments or choices as those that adhere to formal models (such as the expected utility model or even its subjec- tive variant) and axioms (such as transitivity),

- 2. the descriptive approach (such as Kahneman and Tversky’s prospect theory and catalog of heuristics and biases), which outlines the systematic departures of real-world from normative decision makers standards—demonstrating, in other words, that decision makers are ‘‘not only irrational but predictably irra- tional’’ (Ariely, 2008, p. 6, emphasis added), and

- 3. the prescriptive approach (‘‘the nor- mative tempered by the descriptive’’; von Winterfeldt, 1989, p. 499), which attempts to improve decision making via, technology-based decision support systems that reduce the representational and computa- tional complexities inherent in nor- mative models. for example,

In other words, the normative approach has served as the foundation for both the descriptive and the prescriptive approaches in decision-making research. In the next the normative section, we maintain that approach has, for the most part, served the ﬁeld of JDM well—and we urge the ﬁeld of IOOB to develop more normative theories.

## Expert Opinions on the Relevance of JDM to I–O Psychology

We turn now to a discussion of the philo- sophical and methodological traditions in

IOOB and JDM (including the obstacles to, and opportunities associated with, cross- fertilization), the areas in which IOOB has already been enriched by JDM as well as the areas in which it might be further enriched in the future, ways of increas- ing cross-fertilization from JDM to IOOB, and ways in which IOOB can in turn con- tribute to JDM. Included in this discussion are Scott Highhouse, Daniel R. Ilgen, Susan Mohammed, and Jerel E. Slaughter. These researchers are leading IOOB scholars whose research program is characterized by strong ties to JDM topics. They therefore have one foot in the IOOB world and the other in the JDM world. In addition, their speciﬁc areas of research interest collec- tively encompass both the ‘‘industrial’’ and ‘‘organizational’’ sides of I–O psychology. Several of them also teach courses in JDM- related topics, and several of them have authored reviews (e.g., Highhouse, 2001; Ilgen, Major, Hollenbeck & Sego, 1995; Mohammed & Schwall, 2009) and encyclo- pedia entries (e.g., Schwall & Mohammed, 2007; Slaughter & Reb, 2007) on JDM- related topics. Finally, the aforementioned scholars have served as editors, associate editors and/or editorial board members of OrganizationalBehavior andHumanDecisionProcesses (OBHDP), which is not only frequently considered a top-tier journal for IOOB researchers but also arguably the premier journal for JDM researchers. This discussion originated as, but has been greatly modiﬁed from, a panel discussion held at the 2009 SIOP conference.

Question 1: What are the differences inphilosophicalperspectivesacrossthe IOOB and JDM ﬁelds? What are the opportunities and obstacles created by thesedifferencesinperspectives?

Daniel Ilgen: Consider the difference between normative science and induc- tive science. The judgment and decision- making literature follows a normative approach. The literature is dominated by certain models (e.g., the Bayesian model, Slovic & Lichtenstein, 1971; the lens model,

# 393

# 394

Brunswik, 1955; subjective expected utility models, Savage, 1954). The propositions of each model are carefully developed before- hand in terms of how the main variables relate to one another, and the research then focuses on how those models ﬁt various kinds of situations. The cognitive model of decision making is the focus, and the research on it follows a well-accepted research paradigm. Instead, research from an IOOB perspective often begins with an outcome of interest and samples broadly from different psychological models in an effort to explain the behavior of the out- come. Each approach has its strengths and weaknesses. The outcome-centered approach leads to addressing a broader set of problems and greater openness to multi- ple theoretic approaches. At the same time it is less likely to build a cumulative science from a program of research that progresses step-by-step over time. In the case of the JDM theory-centric approach, the science is more systematic but there is a tendency to limit investigations to only a narrow set of problems that can easily be ﬁt into the theoretical framework.

At one time, I was closely associated with OBHDP. It was, at times, frustrating because of the differences in approaches to research between the two disciplines. For example, on the basis of the number of articles published in the journal, it appeared the journal were more JDM- than as if IOOB-focused even though the numbers of submissions were similar. JDM reviewers shared a very similar paradigm along with a common evaluation perspective and were much more likely to agree among themselves. IOOB reviewers often had very different perspectives on the same problem and thus disagreed far more often among themselves. This disagreement lengthened the review process and often led to fewer acceptances than was the case among the JDM reviewers. This in turn had a strong inﬂuence on the proportion of manuscripts in the journal from each discipline.

In contrast,

In sum, the differences in paradigms are large and each ﬁeld can learn a lot from the

other. The rigor of a strong paradigm pro- vides a framework around which to build systematic research programs grounded in cumulative knowledge. At the same time, thestrong paradigmnarrows theperspective on a problem in ways that may miss expla- nations that fall outside the paradigmatic framework. JDM provides the paradigm and rigor, and the IOOB approach provides that breadth that is likely to avoid some of the problems of a narrow focus. The two approaches complement each other.

Susan Mohammed: Dan referred to the tight paradigm that characterizes decision- making research. With its applied focus, IOOB research tends to gravitate toward the context of the decision: decision making under stress, decision making under time pressure, decision making under uncer- tainty and ambiguity, and the emotional aspects of decision making. When one expands the research question by adding contextual effects, one gets away from the JDM paradigm that is a tight internally valid experiment. To illustrate, the naturalistic decision-making movement (Pliske & Klein, 2003) has broad research questions that talk about decision-making more descrip- tively, incorporating different variables and different ways of testing relationships. The NDM movement is closer to IOOB (than traditional JDM) from a philosophical stand- point, but the methods to test these bigger questions are still being developed.

Clearly, the tight, internally valid exper- imental design characterizing JDM stud- ies contributes to systematic, program- matic research, which tends to produce a well-accepted paradigm that can quickly launch and maintain productive areas of research. However, too much homogene- ity in methodology can limit the pursuit of ideas that do not ﬁt the dominant experi- mental design, leading to an empirical rut the more macro, over time. contextual orientation of IOOB naturally expands to a variety of samples, tasks, and research approaches. Nevertheless, diver- sity in methodologies and designs can make it difﬁcult to compare and contrast among empirical ﬁndings. The failure to establish

In contrast,

a coherent picture of results can inhibit programmatic research.

Question 2: Whatarethedifferencesin researchmethods across the IOOB and JDM ﬁelds? What are the opportunities and obstacles created by these differ- encesinmethods?

Scott Highhouse: The very different methods may be part of the barrier to cross-fertilization. There is an experimen- tal bias in the JDM area. The ﬁeld is built on doing simple, elegant,little experimentsthat are aimed at interesting questions, whereas in IOOB—and I am making caricatures here—it is more like taking elegant, sophis- ticated statistics and sometimes applying them to uninteresting questions. In addi- tion to this difference in orientation, there tends to be a bias in IOOB against research done in labs or employing paper simula- tions with students, which are all staples of JDM research. My answer to this bias is that Daniel Kahneman won the Nobel Prize using very sterile, simple, paper problems and showing how much application those problems have to our everyday lives and to economic thinking (I should note that economists were traditionally even more critical of laboratory research with student subjects). If we could see beyond the meth- ods and see beyond the sample to look at the question and what kinds of applied issues it is addressing, we would be better off in IOOB (see in this regard Highhouse & Gillespie, 2009). Itisthetheoriesthatgen- eralize,nottheeffects.

that we publish in differ- ent journals also contributes to the lack of cross-fertilization. The exception is OBHDP. However, having been involved with OBHDP (like Dan), I can attest that the two ﬁelds are together in the journal but they are not together in terms of the research (see also Naylor, 1984). It is two different groups of people who submit articles, and there is a different set of reviewers for each area. As a result, IOOB and JDM are just living together in those pages.

# The fact

Jerel Slaughter: I think that the use of different methods is an issue. It is harder to get papers containing lab studies in to JAP and PPsych, or the Academy of Manage- mentJournal (AMJ) and AdministrativeSci- enceQuarterly (ASQ), which are arguably the ﬂagship I-O and management journals, respectively. Lab studies do get published, of course, but I suspect that the rejection rates are higher for lab studies, although I do not have data to support this assertion. This comes mostly from my experience as a reviewer. I am pretty sure that my per- sonal rejection rate (as both an author and a reviewer) is higher for laboratory studies than for ﬁeld studies.

The problem for JDM is that, with a few notable exceptions (e.g., Hayward & Hambrick, 1997), it is prohibitively difﬁcult to sample enough real-world decisions to make passive observation a realistic option as a research method for studying decision making. Commentaries by Scott and Dan (Highhouse, 2009; Ilgen, 1986) are particularly instructive here: In JDM, as in some other areas of research, laboratory work is absolutely necessary for many reasons. It allows for conclusions of cause- and-effect, it is efﬁcient and inexpensive, it allows researchers to study phenomena that cannot be studied in the ﬁeld, and perhaps most importantly, it allows us to ask the ‘‘Can it happen?’’ question (Mook, 1983).

So it is fairly clear what the obstacles are: As several of us have discussed, there does seem to be a bias against the simple laboratory studies that are common to JDM, and this makes it more the difﬁcult journals that are most visible to IOOB researchers. But I suppose that there are also opportunities that are created by this bias. For example, it probably pushes those researchers doing work in the lab or with ‘‘paper people’’ types of studies to be more creative in their work, to increase mundane realism, and to employ new experimental manipulations. For example, we would deﬁnitely know a lot less about the effects of accountability on decision making (see, if people e.g., Lerner & Tetlock, 1999)

had not complained that participants in JDM research are not accountable for their decisions (Tetlock, 1985).

Question 3: What are some examples of how you or other IOOB researchers haveusedtheoriesormethodsfromJDM toadvanceresearchorpractice?

Jerel Slaughter: Let me begin with meth- odology. Speciﬁcally, the policy captur- ing methodology (e.g., Karren & Barringer, 2002) that comes from JDM has made important contributions to IOOB. As a reviewer and an action editor, I ﬁnd that I see a fair number of policy capturing sub- missions, and some of those do eventually getaccepted. Manypolicy capturing articles have been published in JAP and some have been very inﬂuential. As of early March 2010, the Rotundo and Sackett (2002) paper on judgments of job performance has been cited close to 100 times, and the Judge and Bretz (1992) paper on the effects of work values on job choice decisions has been cited over 150 times.

The JDM topic that has become the most to the IOOB community is escalation of commitment, or the irra- tional continued commitment to a chosen course of action. Articles on escalation have been published in both JAP (e.g., Simonson & Staw, 1992) and AMJ (e.g., Ross & Staw, 1993), in addition to OBHDP In addition, of course (e.g., Ku, 2008). there have been applications of decision errors and biases to decisions that are made at work. Certainly Scott has done a lot of that work (e.g., Brooks, Highhouse, Russell, & Mohr, 2003; Highhouse, 1996; Highhouse & Johnson, 1996), and I have done some as well (e.g., Slaughter, Bag- ger, & Li, 2006; Slaughter & Greguras, 2008; Slaughter, Sinar, &Highhouse, 1999). For example, Scott and I have both done work on the decoy effect, a phenomenon in which manipulating the characteristics of an inferior third option that is never chosen causes preferences between two superior options to reverse. Obviously, we think that this phenomenon has alot of applicability to IOOB, especially in employee selection. An

article was written in the WashingtonPost about potential decoy effects in the 2008 presidential election (Vedantum, 2007).

I am not sure IOOB has taken note of these ﬁndings as much as would be suggested by the number of publications on these topics. Nor am I sure why this is the case; perhaps it is because of the fact that many of the studies are based in the laboratory or because they involve experimenter-constructed scenarios or vignettes so they may be dismissed as contrived situations. On many submissions in which the decision was a rejection (and some in which the submission was eventually accepted), reviewers on these papers have wondered aloud whether the situations presented in these scenarios are realistic or whether they could actually happen in a ‘‘real organization.’’ This is always interesting to me because that from opinion seems to be very different the opinions I have heard expressed by practitioners at SIOP poster sessions and by working managers in courses I have taught. Susan Mohammed: There are some JDM ﬁndings that do get cited in IOOB venues. The work on team cognition and team mental models, in particular, had its origins in decision making (e.g., Klimoski & Mohammed, 1994) and has preserved some of this focus over time (e.g., Kellermanns, Floyd, Pearson, & Spencer, 2008). Similarly, that sense-making and framing effects have traditionally been investigated at the individual level have also been examined at (e.g., Mohammed & Ringseis, 2001). In addition, the program of research by Hollenbeck and colleagues on hierarchical decision-making teams with distributed expertise (e.g., Hollenbeck et al., 1995) was featured in IOOB journals. Although more the exception than the rule, the multidisciplinary work by Cannon- Bowers and Salas (1998) on improving team training in tactical decision-making teams under stress is an example of the merging of JDM and IOOB research.

However,

# the group level

Scott Highhouse: Expectancy theory has had a lot of inﬂuence on IOOB research over the years (e.g., Van Eerde &

# I–Opsychologyandworkplacedecisions

Thierry, 1996), but IOOB research based on expectancy theory did not keep up with all of the limitations of the rational decision-making model the way that the JDM literature did. And certainly a ﬁeld that is founded on mistakes and biases—as JDM is—is not very consistent with positive psychology. However, there are many JDM ﬁndings that have a lot of relevance to what we do. For example, Maggie Brooks and I wrote a chapter on situational judgment tests (Brooks & Highhouse, 2006), arguing that we should try to ﬁgure out what ‘‘situational judgment’’ is and try to develop a test that actually measures it.

Another area that is attracting a lot of attention within IOOB is how to commu- nicate validity information beyond relying on correlations (see, e.g., Facteau, 2009; Kuncel, 2008). That is alsoa very active area within judgment and decision making. For example, Gigerenzer (Gigerenzer, Gaiss- maier, Kurz-Milcke, Schwartz, & Woloshin, 2008) argues that doctors do not under- stand the statistics they are communicating to patients. This is very relevant to us in IOOB in that we need to communicate the utility of our technology to clients—and do that in such a way that they can understand its impact. We can learn a lot from the research that is going on in JDM and we can contribute to it a lot.

As another example, there was a recent discussion on whether executives are paid too much (O’Leary, Bartol, Can- nella, Greenberg, & Locke, 2009). That is a perfect area for judgment and deci- sion making to make contributions. What does it mean to be paid too much? What are the psychophysics of pay and salary perception (Highhouse, Brooks-Laber, Lin, & Spitzmueller, 2003)? How ﬂexible is too much pay (Highhouse, our idea of Luong, & Sarkar, 1999)? There is a litera- ture on jury awards of punitive damages that to these ques- tions (Sunstein, Hastie, Payne, Schkade, & Viscusi, 2002). I should add that Sil- via and Reeshad have done some very interesting work on advice giving and tak- ing (e.g., Bonaccio & Dalal, 2006), which

is directly relevant

to understanding how is quite relevant organizational decision makers respond to advice.

Question 4: What are some examples of IOOB topics or problems where cross-fertilization from JDM has not yet occurred but would be beneﬁcial? How, speciﬁcally, would the cross- fertilizationbebeneﬁcialvis-`a-visthese IOOBtopics?

team commonly research in IOOB outlets exclude work on group decision making (e.g., Mathieu, Maynard, Rapp, & Gilson, 2008). Moreover, although team task typologies include decision making (Mc- Grath, 1984), execution or performance tasks have received the primary emphasis in the IOOB literature on teams. Nevertheless, effective decision making is often a precur- sor to achieving effective team-performance outcomes. Indeed, many of the simulations and tasks frequently used in team research have a heavy decision-making component that is often not directly modeled or mea- sured in data analysis. Given the criticism that ‘‘the criteria side of the team effec- tiveness framework continues to be the least well speciﬁed’’ (Mathieu et al., 2008, p. 418), a more concerted effort to examine decision-making behaviors as part of the team criterion space would help to address this need.

# Susan Mohammed: Reviews of

One speciﬁcareathat wouldbeneﬁt from cross-fertilization between JDM and IOOB is the work on the information sharing bias in groups—the phenomena that groups are better at rehashing shared information than pooling diverse (i.e., non shared) informa- tion (e.g., Stasser & Titus, 1987). Over 2 decades of research has produced a homo- geneous body of empirical research primar- ily using a hypothetical, hidden proﬁle task (e.g., murder mystery, select the best can- didate). However, this type of design has been criticized for introducing an inherent confound because information that sup- ports a superior option is unshared, whereas information that supports an inferior option is predominantly shared (Wittenbaum,

# 397

# 398

Hollingshead, & Botero, 2004). Thus, researchers have called for future work to expand to other kinds of tasks and ﬁeld studies to examine the ‘‘potentially powerful effects that the embedding con- text and external environment have on information-sharing processes in groups’’ (Wittenbaum et al., 2004, p. 305). Through JDM cross-fertilization, information-sharing research by incorpo- rating motivational inﬂuences and con- text, whereas JDM can assist IOOB team research with a greater emphasis on group discussion and the dynamics of infor- mation exchange. The meta-analysis of information sharing and team performance that recently appeared in JAP (Mesmer- Magnus & DeChurch, 2009) is a step in the right direction towards greater integration between areas.

IOOB can assist

Jerel Slaughter: One applied IOOB ‘‘problem’’ where I think cross-fertilization might be beneﬁcial and probably does not occur very often is implementing decision- making training programs for managers that include things like multi-attribute utility analysis, heuristics and biases, and deci- sion trees. I admit to having relatively little experience in the applied world, so I can not say for certain this is not already hap- pening. But what I have gathered from my experiences teaching decision-making topics to working managers is that apply- ing JDM ﬁndings and strategies is com- pletely foreign to almost all of them. This is actually a little scary to me, given that some of them have been managers for 10 or 15 years, because they are able to recognize the biases in their previ- ous decisions and judgments once they learn about them formally. Assuming that the training is done well, is clear—employees will be making fewer biased decisions. The costly effects of over- conﬁdence (Hayward & Hambrick, 1997) and escalation of commitment (Ross & Staw, 1993) are pretty well documented, and perhaps more training can reduce these tendencies.

psychology that has yet to be discussed is emotion. Emotions research has exploded in IOOB; we know a lot more about emotions at work now than we did just is 10 years ago. But one emotion that relevant is almost to the workplace that completely unaddressed in the IOOB lit- erature is regret, particularly the role of in decision making (cf., Wong & regret Kwong, 2007). I believe there is a lot of opportunity for studying regret in IOOB contexts, such as regret over having made poor acquisition decisions (also known as ‘‘buyer’s remorse’’), hiring decisions, and job-choice decisions. Anticipated regret is often posited, in the JDM literature, as a reason for the omission bias and status quo biases, and so examining regret might inform organizational research about things like inaction inertia (Arkes, Kung, & Hutzel, 2002). In sum, regret is the most researched emotion in the JDM literature (Connolly & Zeelenberg, 2002), and one at which I think IOOB researchers could take a closer look.

Question 5: What are your recommen- dations for increasing cross-fertilization from JDM to IOOB? How can we increasethenumberofpeoplewith‘‘one footintheIOOBworldandonefootin theJDMworld?’’

Dan Ilgen: For cross-fertilization, each party must see the advantages of the other for addressing its concerns. One way to do this is to increase the likelihood that each will see the work of the other.OBHDPis an attempt to do that by creating a journal in which both disciplines publish. As we have implied, the cross-fertilization effects of this effort were limited. Another approach is to have persons from each discipline work- ing jointly on the same problem. The early work at NASA is a classic case study where a common objective pulled multiple dis- ciplines together for a successful outcome. In a far more limited way, Jim Naylor, Bob Pritchard andIfelt thatwewere abletolearn a lot from the combination of JDM with OB as we created a book on a theory of orga- nizational behavior (Naylor, Pritchard, & I believe such combined Ilgen, 1980).

# I–Opsychologyandworkplacedecisions

efforts can be extremely valuable, but how one moves from case-by-case experiences to institutionalizing the cross fertilization escapes me.

Scott Highhouse: I am going to answer this question a little differently. think IOOB researchers and practitioners could learn from JDM how to apply psychology inﬂuences everyday deci- in a way that sions and large-scale policy making (see Thaler & Sunstein, 2008). One need only look through past issues of the journal Psy- chologicalScienceto see that JDM research attacks big questions, presents hypotheses that challenge conventional wisdom, and generally makes us think differently about things (e.g., Schkade & Kahneman, 1998). As a former associate editor of OBHDP, I noticed that JDM reviewers placed con- siderable emphasis on the creativity with which authors approached a research ques- IOOB reviewers, on tion. the other hand, were often more con- cerned with evaluating the conventions of research design and analysis. Of course, this is a very general impression, and there are many exceptions on both sides. Never- theless, I believe that IOOB scholars could place more emphasis onthe development of hypotheses that surprise and even entertain (cf., Lee, Frederick, & Ariely, 2006).

# I

I noticed that

think that IOOB researchers should reengage with topics that they have abandoned in recent years—ones that have now become the domain of JDM research. One example of this is rater judgment errors. After a ﬂurry of research on this topic in the 1970s IOOB researchers became and 1980s, discouraged. Research on halo error, for example, showed that if you train raters to avoid engaging in false halo they will start ignoring true halo. Or, if you train raters to avoid leniency, they will be too training programs strict. These types of are not for example, interviewers to understand how they are prone to infatuation with detailed narratives, small samples of behaviors, and self-serving biases. I do not think we should dismiss rater error training just because it is

At a more speciﬁc level,

Anotherexample isgoalsetting. AsIOOB researchers have become less interested JDM researchers in the effects of goals, have become more interested (e.g., Larrick, Heath, & Wu, 2009; Ord´o˜nez, Schweitzer, Galinsky, & Bazerman, 2009). Ed Locke and Gary Latham’s research should be just the beginning not the ﬁnal word. Finally, peo- ple interested in management development (and derailers) and multisource feedback should be closely following the JDM lit- erature on comparative evaluation (e.g., Dunning, Johnson, Ehrlinger, & Kruger, 2003; Moore & Small, 2007). Perhaps joint workshops and symposia at SIOP would help engage IOOB more in the latest devel- opments in JDM.

Question 6: Ifyoubelievethattheﬁeld ofIOOBshouldattempttoinﬂuencethe ﬁeldofJDM,whatareyourrecommen- dations for increasing cross-fertilization fromIOOBtoJDM?

the topics I mentioned earlier, including how to communicate effect sizes and utility, are such new areas within JDM that I think that IOOB could really be of added value. We certainly have the psychometric background that is often lacking in JDM. We love methodology in IOOB, so this is an area where we can make a lot of contributions.

# Scott Highhouse: Some of

Another area that is much more devel- is in JDM is the oped in IOOB than it criterion space. JDM researchers often use one-item tests, as they have more of an experimentalist perspective on the world. JDM researchers need to do a better job of studying choice in a way that is reliable and construct valid. I think that is an area where we certainly can make a lot of inroads.

Susan Mohammed: I want to reiterate I Scott’s comments about methodology. think that our training in methodology is a key contribution that IOOB researchers bring to the table. For example, in research on regret and decision making, the typical

# 399

# 400

measure of regret is a one-item measure (e.g., Ku, 2008). ToanIOOB researcher, this automatically raises red ﬂags. Measuring the major criterion variable with only one item is not consistent with our training in psychometrics. Another

JDM area that could bene- ﬁt from IOOB research is individual dif- ferences associated with decision mak- ing (Mohammed & Schwall, 2009). There are many areas within IOOB that have had a ‘‘personality renaissance’’ of late: leadership, motivation, and even macro constructs change. like organizational However, decision making has been excluded from this list. That is, researchers have talked about situational characteris- tics and the context being very important in decision making but have largely ignored the person, the decision maker himself or herself, and the inﬂuences that he or she brings to the process. There is a litera- ture on individual differences in decision making, but it tends to be dispersed across many different, eclectic journals and sev- eral decades, so it has not had the kind of that many other areas have had. In addition, some of the individual differences that have been looked at histori- cally in the decision-making literature, such as need for cognition (Cacioppo & Petty, 1982) and risk-taking propensity (Bromiley & Curley, 1992; see also Kahneman & Tversky, 1979), have been very close to decision making itself. A valuable way that IOOB can contribute is by introducing addi- tional individual differences into the JDM literature, such as motivation-based differ- ences (e.g., action-state orientation; Kuhl & Beckmann, 1994). Because of its norma- tive focus, JDM research has been oriented more towards trying to ﬁnd commonali- ties rather than differences. The methods (e.g., experimental paradigms in which the task characteristics are manipulated) contribute to overwhelming the individual (Weiss & Adler, 1984). difference effect In addition, limiting decision making to the choice point (e.g., do decision makers choose investment A or investment B?) is

indi- also a poor context vidual differences (Mohammed & Schwall, 2009). Thus, JDM does not have the best paradigm to study individual differences. However, widening the JDM paradigm to look at earlier stages of decision making (e.g., framing effects, sense making, the pre decision search for alternatives), and at post decisional affect and attitudes (e.g., implementation, regret), will allow for indi- vidual differences to manifest themselves to a greater extent. Dan Ilgen:

for looking at

I will build on Susan’s point. The JDM literature takes a normative approach of asking what kinds of things people do when they make a decision (the issue of bias in decision making, for example). But then the next questions to ask are, Why does this happen? What is the psychological process behind these observed biases? As IOOB researchers and practitioners, we have something to offer in terms of asking questions on individual differences, the interactions between person and situations, and the way in which we issues. We are look at much more likely to look to motivation, social processes, and other constructs not so closely linked to cognition as would be the case for JDM researchers. That is an area where I think we in IOOB can add value.

# those kinds of

IOOB can con- topic, tribute to JDM research in that decision making in organizations is a within-person process. Decision making happens over time: The decision at time t is inﬂuenced by times t− 1, t− 2, and so on. It is a constant process of building over time. In there tends to be a the JDM literature, cross-sectional view of models that cap- ture the decision at one time. So, in the kinds of worlds in which we work, the ones to which we want our research to gen- eralize, within-person changes over time are important—and they are getting more attention in the IOOB literature than in the decision-making literature. A delight- ful exception to this is Lee Roy Beach’s (2010) book on the narrative thinking in decision making, a book that deserves everyone’s attention.

## Table 1. MajorPointsRaisedinthePanelDiscussion

# Topics

# Conclusions

# Philosophical traditions

JDM typically follows a normative, paradigmatic approach involving formal models, such an approach facilitates the cumulation of knowledge (e.g., Pfeffer, 1993). IOOB typically focuses on outcomes, and the selection of models is based on what appears most useful in each case. Such an approach facilitates the examination of a broader set of problems. The two philosophical approaches should be viewed as complementary.

# Methodological traditions

JDM primarily uses well-crafted lab experiments or ‘‘paper’’

simulations involving undergraduate students as subjects. These designs are internally valid and allow for better comparison of ﬁndings across studies. IOOB places greater emphasis on context and external validity and tends to use ﬁeld studies involving employees as subjects. The two methodological approaches should be viewed as complementary. It is often difﬁcult to get lab research or simulations using undergraduate students published in IOOB journals, which is unfortunate. IOOB should be much more open to lab research because such research allows for stronger causal conclusions than correlational ﬁeld studies and because the theoriesoften generalize to applied issues.

Examples of content areas include team decisionmaking and

More generally, IOOB could emulate JDM’s emphasis on the creativity of the research questions as well as its ability to apply psychology in a way that inﬂuences large-scale policy making.

# OBHDP and other ways to

# increase cross-fertilization

OBHDP is an ongoing attempt at cross-fertilization. Although both JDM and IOOB researchers publish in OBHDP, the extent of cross-fertilization has been very limited despite the fact that there are several JDM topics that IOOB researchers should be following closely and vice versa (Naylor, 1984). Additional ways to increase cross-fertilization include topic-based interdisciplinary efforts (e.g., goal-setting and rater judgment errors) as well as interdisciplinary workshops or symposia at SIOP. The challenge has been, and remains, how to institutionalizethe cross-fertilization

OBHDP does serve to illustrate the beneﬁts, to IOOB, of having a common paradigm on which to evaluate the merit of submitted research. At OBHDP, acceptance rates appear to be higher, and review times shorter, for the JDM section than for the IOOB section.

Examples of ways in which JDM could beneﬁt from IOOB

The focus in IOOB on psychometrics, methodology, individual differences, and within-person phenomena are likely to be beneﬁcial to JDM.

Note. JDM = the ﬁeld of judgment and decision making; IOOB = the ﬁeld of industrial–organizational psychology and the related ﬁeld of organizational behavior and human resources; OBHDP = the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes; SIOP = Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology.

# Summary and Concluding Comments

The discussion among Highhouse, Ilgen, Mohammed, and Slaughter addressed sev- the lack of eral potential cross-fertilization between JDM and IOOB and pointed to the way forward. Table 1 summarizes from this the conclusions discussion.

# reasons

# for

We feel that the format of the journal Industrial and Organizational Psychology provides a unique vehicle for a conver- sation among the IOOB community on these issues. We invite commentaries from readers who disagree that more cross- fertilization between IOOB and JDM would be beneﬁcial, but we also invite commen- taries from readers who agree that cross- fertilization would be helpful. We hope that the following topics (among others) will be fruitful starting points for commentaries:

- Can core

to topics of IOOB researchers and practitioners be thought of as fundamentally involving decisions or judgments? If not, why not?

# interest

- Do the philosophical and methodolog- ical traditions of JDM have much to offer IOOB? Would IOOB beneﬁt (e.g., in terms of disciplinary prestige and the ability to inﬂuence public policy) from developing more normative mod- els and a tighter paradigm (e.g., Pfeffer, 1993)? Does IOOB emphasize exter- nal validity to the detriment of internal validity? Should IOOB be less resis- tant to lab studies? If your answer to these questions is a deﬁnitive ‘‘no,’’ what concerns do you have about the prevailing philosophical and method- ological traditions in JDM?

- Have additional IOOB content areas (beyond the ones speciﬁed in this article) already been enriched sub- stantially by JDM—and, if so, what was most useful about JDM in these areas?Couldadditional IOOB content areas beneﬁt substantially from JDM in the future and vice versa?

- Should one of

the major prescrip- tive functions of IOOB involve train- ing employees how to make better decisions? • How might

Our hope is that this article generates a robust discussion on cross-fertilization between the two ﬁelds. Some of our ideas are likely to be points of contention, but we trust they will also convey our hopefulness regarding the prospect and the promise of increased cross-fertilization.
