Prior research on poaching “star” employees has shown that

hiring stars is not only diﬃcult but often counter-productive. Newly

hired stars often ﬁnd it challenging to reproduce their exceptional

performance. They may also harm their new employer, for example,

by hindering innovation or lowering incumbents’ performance. This is both surprising and troubling given the costs, time, and eﬀort involved

# in the hiring process.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: Hiring a Superstar Can Backfire

Organizations that rely on the knowledge and skills of their employees

as their primary asset and source of competitive advantage still struggle

with this dilemma. As such, they are under the strategic imperative to

recruit the “best and brightest,” even or perhaps especially, if this means

poaching them from their competitors.

This practice is known as lateral hiring and knowledge-intensive

organizations, such as large law ﬁrms, are increasingly reliant on it

for their growth strategies. A recent industry report shows that in the

largest 200 American corporate law ﬁrms there can be as many as 3,000

lateral hires per year at partner level. This is an annual average of 15

# lateral hires per ﬁrm.

This leads to a very interesting question: If hiring stars is unlikely

to work, as recognized both in the academic and in the practitioner

literature, why do organizations continue to do so?

Our recent working paper, which has been presented at AOM and other

conferences, on the lateral hiring of stars in the UK legal industry helps

to answer this question. We followed 2,700 star lawyers working in more

than 100 UK based corporate law ﬁrms over a 17-year period (2000-2017)

and looked at whether practice areas that hired a star performed better

in the year after hiring than comparable practice areas that did not

do so. We deﬁne a lawyer as a star if they were listed in the annual

UK Chambers Legal Directory. Inclusion in “Chambers” indicates that

a lawyer is recognized by peers and clients as being amongst a small

## group of outstanding performers in their respective practice area for the

year in question. In the context of our study, we deﬁne performance

in relation to the rating that a particular practice area is awarded in

Chambers. We complemented our analysis of statistical data by talking

to some key decision-makers in the law ﬁrms featured in our study,

including senior management, recruitment professionals, as well as star

# lawyers themselves.

Our study shows that, on average, practice areas that hired a star had up

## to 10% lower performance in the following year than practice areas that

did not do so. Yet a closer look at our results reveals a more nuanced

picture, with some instances in which hiring stars may work.

# The Main Problem with Hiring Stars

There are a number of arguments against recruiting stars. First, there

is the issue of portability of individual performance. Research has

shown that organization and team factors are important contributors

to the stars’ individual performance. When a star is recruited, these

factors do not transfer as easily as the stars’ own knowledge and skills.

Superior performance is often a collective endeavor, and dependent

## on the contributions and support of many others beyond the star in

question, including professional colleagues both in the star’s own team and across their broader organization, clerical and support staﬀ, and of

# course clients.

Performance also depends on routines, systems, and cultures of work

which are often organization speciﬁc. As they move, stars lose their

broader support networks and systems which greatly facilitated their

exceptional performance. Moreover, research has shown that stars

often struggle to adjust to their new organizations’ systems, routines,

networks and cultures, as they are too invested in their previously

successful ways of working. Indeed, many stars also feel that their star

status insulates them from the need to change, and instead expect their

new organization to adapt to them. They might in other words buy into

## the myth of their own exceptional talent.

Second, one needs to consider the reactions of incumbent employees

in the new organization, some of whom may also be stars or may

have ambitions to become one. For instance, studies of scientists and

investment bankers have shown that the arrival of new stars negatively aﬀects the performance of incumbents. Incumbents may resent the

arrival of the new stars and the attention and resources these receive.

They might fear for their own career development opportunities and

for their reputation within their organization. They might interpret the

hiring event as a lack of conﬁdence in their own abilities and future

# prospects.

Furthermore research has shown that multiple stars may not work

together smoothly, as they jostle for status and compete for resources,

ultimately resulting in the group failing to take full advantage of its

collection of exceptional individuals. As such, when hiring stars ﬁrms

risk triggering non-cooperative and even hostile forms of behavior

which undermine the integration of the star and the ability of the ﬁrm

to capture the full value of the move.

It is not surprising therefore that a lot of lateral hires (upwards of

50% according to some estimates) fail within a few years, with the star

moving to new pastures.

When does hiring stars work (or not)?

Our ﬁndings lend support to the arguments above, as they show that

in the ﬁrst-year post-hiring, those practice areas that hired star lawyers

have lower performance than comparable practice areas that didn’t do

so. This relative underperformance is approximately 10%.

Yet our results also show some variability in outcomes, including two

scenarios when hiring stars may actually work.

The ﬁrst scenario is when a star joins a practice area where many

incumbents are stars. In this case, the performance disadvantage

reduces by up to 74%. The second scenario is when a star joins one

of the strongest practice areas in the organization. In this case the

performance disadvantage dissipates entirely, and the hiring practice

enjoy a performance advantage compared to non-hiring practices.

In fact, we observe a 162% swing from negative to positive relative

# performance.

Importantly, these two scenarios can also intersect. Indeed, the best

conditions for hiring stars occur when the star joins one of the strongest practice areas in their new organization and when this new practice

area that they are joining is better than the practice area that they are

moving from. In these circumstances our results indicate a 270% swing

## from negative to positive relative performance.

We also identify instances when hiring stars is likely to be a particularly

bad idea. Many of these are simply the reversal of the positive instances

identiﬁed above, such as situations when the star joins a relatively weaker practice area within the organization, and when they are moving

from a higher quality practice area to a lower one. These instances may

# again interact with each other.

However, we also identify a third scenario: instances where a practice

area’s quality has been declining over time. Here, bringing in stars not

only doesn’t help—it makes things even worse. This is surprising and

concerning because, as our data suggests, this is exactly a situation

when organizations may be more likely to bring in new talent from

# outside.

# Hiring Stars Is a Risky Business

Our research shows that in most cases hiring stars may be detrimental

to performance. Yet there are some important exceptions where hiring

stars may work and make a positive contribution from the start.

- 1) Hiring stars works better when you already have other stars in the same area. It has been previously argued that when recruiting stars, too many

cooks may spoil the broth. This does not seem the case in our research.

Rather, the brighter the stars you already have in an existing group, the

# better the chances for the move to work.

This is probably because in these cases, the new hire is likely to view the

move as a step up in their own career and therefore be more willing to

adjust to their new context. At the same time, incumbents are less likely

to view the new hire as a threat and more likely to engage in cooperative

behaviors that help to quickly absorb the incoming star into the group.

In this context, the group and the broader organization are likely to

capture and leverage the skills, competences and relationships of the

new arrival and to exploit synergies between their old and new stars.

In short, it seems that hiring stars works better when they are joining an

existing constellation.

- 2) The hiring group must already be one of the best within the organization. Hiring stars can work to further improve your best groups but is much

less likely to work in lifting the performance of weaker groups. In short

high-quality groups deliver better outcomes even when it comes to their

capacity to absorb star hires.

There are several reasons at play. Your best groups may already include

your brightest stars and therefore are more likely to satisfy the condition

discussed above. Furthermore, they are likely to have the resources

and capabilities, such as robust systems, routines and relationships,

required to absorb the disruption cause by the recruitment of a star.

They might also be viewed across the organization as being a source of

competitive advantage. As such attempts to further invest in them are

less likely to cause resistance from other parts of the organization and

more likely to elicit support and collaboration.

In short, the rest of the organization is more likely to be invested in

the move and committed to making it work, something that is very

important in situations where there is usually a need for cross-group

# collaboration.

- 3) Bringing in stars cannot stop the rot.

Trajectories are important. Although it might sound like a good idea

to strategically hire stars into a declining group to stop the rot, this

not only doesn’t work—it can actually make things worse. In these

situations, we can expect existing routines, systems, practices, and

relationship to already be under strain and therefore less likely to cope

with the disruption caused by a new star entrant. Furthermore, we can

expect incumbents, even if they are stars themselves, to feel under

pressure and be less conﬁdent, and, therefore, more likely to resist

the arrival of newcomers and cause further disruption that undermines

the quality of their practice’s work. Only recruit into an already well-

performing group.

If one follows these principles, recruiting stars may pay oﬀ. In all other

situations, it is generally a bad idea. In these cases, organizations are

advised to rely on other talent management strategies such as nurturing existing staﬀ and developing them into new home-grown stars, and to

prioritize the retention of existing stars. Organizations, however, should

not panic at the prospect of losing their stars, as it is not clear that the

hiring ﬁrm will beneﬁt. As such the loss of a star should not prompt

hasty attempts to bring in a replacement star.
