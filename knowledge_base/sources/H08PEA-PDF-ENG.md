Imagine that you are a salesperson. You’ve noticed that prospective

clients always contact you several times after your meetings with them,

asking you more or less the same kind of questions, which often delays

contract signing. One morning, you spend time and eﬀort thinking

about how to improve this aspect of the process, and after imagining

diﬀerent solutions, you opt for compiling a list of FAQs to provide to

prospective clients right before sending them your contract.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: When Extra Effort Makes You Worse at Your Job

At the end of that same proactive day, you head to an important

meeting, where you notice that being fully focused has become more diﬃcult: your attention starts to wane, you’re missing important details,

and coming up with a concise answer to a question feels harder than

# usual.

In short, you may be experiencing the cognitive cost of being proactive.

In a new study, we found that the more eﬀort people spend seeking

out ways to improve their job (rather than just doing it), the worse their

cognitive performance was at the end of the day compared to days on

which they haven’t been especially proactive. In other words, going the extra mile can be mentally costly. So should you not be proactive

or not encourage your team to be? Are there better ways or times to

improve your tasks? Our research suggests that in order to harness

the beneﬁts of proactivity, we ﬁrst must understand how costly it can

be to deviate from your routine—and which activities can help buﬀer

# negative eﬀects.

# The Importance of Routine

Previous research has established that taking initiative at work—in addition to obvious gains in eﬃciency for companies—can help workers

ﬁnd more meaning in their jobs and increases their engagement and

adaptability. But we wondered if it also depleted employees’ cognitive

reserves by presenting a departure from their daily routines.

Routines are important because they help people be more eﬃcient

with their time and conserve mental energy. Think about cycling, for

example. When you are just beginning, it takes eﬀort to remember

to keep your balance in movement, to slow down when turning, to

transition between gears and to brake, to keep in mind and respect

rules of the road, and to remain alert to what happens around you as

to protect yourself and others. Eventually, with time and practice, all

of this becomes routine and takes less mental eﬀort. The same goes for

work tasks. When the same task is completed repeatedly, using the same

methods in the same order, over time, the task will become automatic

and require less mental eﬀort.

We hypothesized that, by contrast, individuals engaging in task proactivity—initiating better or more eﬃcient ways to perform one’s

core tasks—will have to deviate from these established routines,

sacriﬁcing cognitive beneﬁts to take on additional mental demands.

This in turn would create greater mental fatigue, which previous

research has found makes it harder to focus, process information, or

# make decisions.

# The Research

In our ﬁrst study, we asked 163 participants in France to complete

a survey at the end of their real workday (participants represented a

range of ages, positions, and industries). These workers were asked to

rate on a scale of one to ﬁve how much they agreed with statements

such as, “Today, I initiated better ways of doing my core tasks.” We

also asked them how well they felt they fulﬁlled the routine tasks

of their job, which helped us track day-to-day performance. Finally,

they took a cognitive test, a memory game in which they were shown

abstract shapes and later asked to recall which ones they had seen

before. We collected data over three to ﬁve workdays and found a

## signiﬁcant association between proactivity and low scores on cognitive

# performance tests.

We found the results of these studies encouraging. However, it was

not clear whether the lower cognitive performance was a result of the

proactive work behavior, or whether participants already began the day

## with lower cognitive capacity—for example, due to poor sleep. This

could have inﬂuenced end-of-day test scores regardless of proactivity.

So, in our second study, we tested the cognitive performance of

## 93 French workers both in the morning and evening over three to

seven workdays. This gave us an accurate baseline of daily cognitive

performance. We also included questions about workload, conﬂict

with coworkers, and multitasking to exclude other factors that may

explain our ﬁndings. Even after accounting for these factors, we still

found that proactivity was associated with poorer end-of-day cognitive

# performance.

In follow-up experiments with 637 workers in the United Kingdom,

we asked participants to describe both a routine task and a task

they believed they could improve, including how they would improve

it. They then rated the mental eﬀort each task required and how

much it deviated from their usual routine. These results supported

our hypothesis: proactive work breaks from established routines and

demands more mental eﬀort, compared to simply completing a routine

# task.

# Should You Not Be Proactive?

Our research found that proactivity comes at a cost by creating mental

fatigue which can make it harder to do complex tasks later on in the day.

But proactivity is still an important way for people to feel connected

to their jobs and for companies to gain valuable knowledge and new eﬃciencies. With this in mind, we oﬀer the following suggestions to

help you improve your job tasks while still protecting yourself and your

## team from mental fatigue or bad decisions.

- 1. Take breaks

Research outside our study suggests that regular breaks can help

ease mental fatigue, so taking frequent breaks on proactive days (or

encouraging or requiring them for your staﬀ) may help you feel

mentally refreshed. Giving yourself space to breath—literally, not just

by scrolling on your phone—may help you recover some mental

# resources.

- 2. Be ﬂexible and offer ﬂexibility in scheduling and task prioritizing

If possible, try to make your schedule ﬂexible to accommodate the

mental fatigue of improving your tasks. Consider prioritizing tasks of

greater importance earlier in the day or moving some of your traditional

tasks to diﬀerent days so you can concentrate on improving processes.

Additionally, to help your team be the most successful while experimenting with new eﬃciencies, consider restructuring their

deadlines or reordering when they do certain tasks. For example,

an employee who spends the morning brainstorming process

improvements shouldn’t be expected to handle a high-stakes contract

# negotiation in the evening.

When possible, managers should also allow for greater ﬂexibility in their

employees’ schedules—by providing alternative work arrangements

such as ﬂexible hours or remote work, for example—to oﬀset some of

the strain that comes with being proactive.

- 3. Create a safe space for experimenting

Leaders should also create a culture where mistakes are accepted as

part of the learning process. Clear safeguards should be in place to

protect employees from the consequences of honest errors made while

experimenting. Reducing this pressure can help employees feel more at

ease—one less concern could free up some mental power to focus on

# improvements.

# Some Caveats

Our study examined the short-term impacts of proactivity, but we’re still

exploring what a long-term study of cognitive performance following

proactivity might look like. An interesting avenue for future work would

be to test whether engaging in proactivity for several days in a row

might eventually make it less taxing. In other words, if you continually

look for new ways to do things, does it strengthen that ability,

so that proactivity has a weaker impact on cognitive performance?

Additionally, future research can explore how long it takes for cognitive

performance to bounce back after an especially proactive day. This

might give us better insight about how much proactivity workers can

engage in before it starts leading to mental fatigue.

. . .

While proactive behavior is widely seen as essential in today’s complex

work contexts—and with good reason—it is important to consider

its less visible downside. Both individuals and organizations need to

recognize that proactivity may come—at least in the short term—with

cognitive costs that may aﬀect performance by the end of the workday.

## Simple adjustments, such as breaks, ﬂexible scheduling, and clearer

task prioritization, can help reduce the mental strain of proactivity

while still allowing organizations to beneﬁt from it.
