For multinational enterprises (MNEs), expatriate managers are vital to

implementing strategy and driving success in global markets. These

leaders, assigned to new locations to manage initiatives for their

company, are tasked with bridging corporate objectives and local

market needs, making their assignments critical to organizational

## success. Yet, high turnover and incomplete assignments among

expatriates remain persistent and costly challenges. These failures can

drain millions of dollars in productivity, rehiring costs, and strained

stakeholder relationships. Conventional wisdom suggests that success

hinges on selecting the “right” expatriates — those with extensive

## international experience and high cultural intelligence.

Our research reveals a diﬀerent truth: expatriate success — or failure —

## depends greatly on the speciﬁc structure of the organization in which

expatriates work. To reach this conclusion, we studied 192 expatriate

## general managers in charge of hotel properties in nine global hotel

chains. We found that whether or not these employees succeeded in

their new environment rested on the degree to which their assignment

oﬀered them three key elements: decentralization (empowering local

managers to make decisions), formalization (providing clear guidelines

## and policies), and global knowledge integration (tools and systems that

# enable cross-border collaboration).

Furthermore, we found that scoring highly on one of these factors was

not enough to drive success — the most successful employees (those

most likely to express intention to complete their assignment and report

high commitment to their organization) worked for companies that

had alignment on all three elements. Our work suggests that while

alignment can allow employees to thrive, misalignment can undermine

# even the most talented individuals.

We examine our ﬁndings to show the ways these structural elements

interact, isolate potential pitfalls and oﬀer actionable lessons for leaders

to optimize expatriate success.

## The Three Key Elements of Expatriate Success

- 1. Empowering Local Decisions Through Decentralization

Decentralization grants local managers the authority to make decisions,

allowing them to adapt operations to regional needs and market

dynamics. This ﬂexibility is especially critical in culturally diverse and

rapidly changing environments.

Take IKEA as an example. The global furniture retailer empowers local

store managers to adjust product displays and layouts based on regional

preferences. In China, where IKEA stores are largely in urban locations,

stores highlight compact furniture for smaller living spaces, while in the

United States, where IKEAs are often located in suburban areas, displays

more regularly emphasize larger items. By delegating decision-making

authority, IKEA ensures relevance in diverse markets while maintaining

articulated global brand standards.

Similarly, Marriott International retains expatriates by decentralizing

decision-making. Local managers tailor guest experiences to cultural

preferences — from menu adaptations to room designs — while

adhering to overarching corporate guidelines. This approach fosters

## engagement among expatriates and enhances customer satisfaction.

In the technology sector, Google demonstrates eﬀective

decentralization by allowing regional teams to localize products such as Google Maps, adapting them to regional traﬃc patterns, cultural

landmarks, and user behaviors. This approach ensures that products

meet local needs while beneﬁting from the company’s global expertise.

While decentralization empowers local managers, it can lead to inconsistencies, ineﬃciencies, and fragmented customer experiences

if not properly coordinated. For example, a global retail chain

would likely struggle if regional managers made decisions that

deviated from global brand standards, such as using locally preferred

packaging designs or promotional materials that misalign with the

company’s universal branding strategy. Consider Starbucks, which

## ensures that its global brand standards—like logo placement, store

## layouts, and product presentation—remain consistent worldwide to

reinforce brand recognition, even while adapting menus to regional

preferences. Organizations must implement mechanisms like regular

check-ins and global alignment sessions to mitigate these risks.

- 2. Providing Clear Guidelines Through Formalization

Formalization ensures consistency by establishing clear policies,

procedures, and expectations. While decentralization promotes

ﬂexibility, formalization provides the guardrails that keep operations

aligned with corporate goals.

Consider Pﬁzer, which balances formalized global protocols with

regional ﬂexibility to meet diverse regulatory requirements. By doing

so, the company ensures consistent product quality across subsidiaries

while allowing teams to navigate local challenges eﬀectively. For

example, Pﬁzer’s expatriate managers in Southeast Asia are trained to

follow standardized manufacturing processes while adapting marketing

strategies to align with local healthcare regulations and cultural norms.

In the retail sector, Walmart’s formalized supply chain management system ensures operational eﬃciency. The company uses bespoke

technology to provide clear guidelines to its expatriate teams, ensuring

consistent practices while enabling them to address unique regional

## challenges, such as logistical hurdles in remote areas.

## The automotive industry oﬀers another compelling example.

Toyota’s formalized quality control systems, including its Just-In-

Time production methodology, are rigorously followed across all

subsidiaries. These protocols ensure consistency in manufacturing

while granting local teams the ﬂexibility to manage supplier

## relationships and adapt to regional market demands.

Formalization can backﬁre when it becomes overly prescriptive,

## however. For example, global pharmaceutical companies can

experience delays in product launches when regional teams get bogged

down by inﬂexible compliance protocols. In contrast, companies that

embrace more adaptive guidelines allow teams to simultaneously

innovate while maintaining global standards.

- 3. Facilitating Collaboration Through Global Knowledge Integration

Global knowledge integration involves systems and processes that

## enable cross-border teams to share insights, best practices, and

innovations. This alignment prevents silos and maximizes the collective

# expertise of the organization.

McKinsey & Company exempliﬁes eﬀective global knowledge

integration. The ﬁrm’s consultants worldwide rely on a shared

knowledge repository containing case studies, frameworks, and best

practices. This platform enables expatriate managers to apply proven

strategies tailored to local contexts while maintaining alignment with

# global objectives.

Unilever’s “One Unilever” strategy demonstrates another eﬀective

approach. The company’s expatriates access global sustainability

initiatives and consumer insights, allowing them to implement

campaigns like reducing plastic waste or promoting sustainable

sourcing while sharing what worked and what didn’t in speciﬁc

contexts. By integrating global knowledge into local decision-making,

Unilever achieves consistency and innovation.

In the energy sector, Shell employs global knowledge-sharing platforms

that allow expatriates in diﬀerent regions to collaborate on complex

projects, such as oﬀshore drilling operations. These tools ensure that

lessons learned in one location can be applied elsewhere, reducing risks and improving eﬃciency.

While a bright, culturally-savvy employee may come to a position

with fresh new ideas, other equally competent workers may struggle

to understand how to address some culturally-speciﬁc challenge.

Knowledge sharing allows workers to harness the trial-and-error,

successes, and failures of their team across contexts, giving them more

information to help make the best decisions in their new environment.

That said, knowledge integration isn’t without challenges. For example,

consulting ﬁrms often encounter barriers to eﬀective knowledge

sharing, such as technological constraints, cultural diﬀerences, and

organizational silos. These challenges can inhibit the seamless

exchange of information across diﬀerent regions, impacting overall

## performance. Signiﬁcant investment in infrastructure and training can

mitigate these challenges by addressing these inequities and ensuring

# global participation.

## Why Structures Matter More Than Individual Traits

While individual traits like cultural adaptability and international experience are valuable, they are insuﬃcient without structural

support. Misaligned structures can frustrate even the most skilled

expatriates, leading to disengagement and early departures — both

## from their assignment and from the company entirely.

Our study revealed that aligned structures — encompassing decision-

making autonomy, clear guidelines, and robust collaboration tools —

signiﬁcantly improved organizational commitment and assignment

completion rates. While these principles are broadly applicable, their

implementation must account for industry-speciﬁc contexts.

For instance, regulated sectors like pharmaceuticals and energy

often require stricter formalization to ensure compliance, whereas

## creative industries such as technology and fashion thrive with greater

ﬂexibility to foster innovation. Tailoring structural elements to these

diverse demands ensures they support expatriates while aligning with

# organizational objectives.

## By contrast, a technology ﬁrm with an overly centralized structure

that requires expatriates to seek headquarters approval for nearly

every decision can stiﬂe local responsiveness, leading to missed

opportunities and high turnover. The takeaway is clear: even the most

capable expatriates cannot succeed in environments where structural

misalignments create avoidable obstacles.

# A Roadmap for Leaders

To create a supportive structure for expatriates, leaders should:

- 1. Assess current structures: Use surveys and feedback from current

employees and former expatriate managers to identify misalignments

in decision-making, guidelines, and collaboration tools. What were

the pain points? What autonomy did managers crave? What formal

structures would have been helpful to keep things on track or from

going too far aﬁeld?

- 2. Optimize decentralization: Delegate authority where

responsiveness is crucial, while setting clear boundaries.

- 3. Reﬁne formalization: Develop adaptable policies that balance

consistency and ﬂexibility. Regularly update these policies based

on feedback from on-the-ground employees and changing site-

speciﬁc regulations. Check-in regularly to help provide structure that

managers may need as they experiment.

- 4. Leverage knowledge integration: Invest in platforms that facilitate

cross-border collaboration and create cross-functional teams to share

# best practices.

This diagnostic checklist can help leaders evaluate their organization’s

## structural alignment and pinpoint areas for improvement.

. . .

Expatriate success is not solely a function of individual brilliance;

it is deeply rooted in the structures that support them. By aligning

decentralization, formalization, and global knowledge integration,

leaders can create an environment where expatriates thrive. This

alignment not only reduces turnover but also drives superior

performance, enabling MNEs to achieve their global objectives.

The call to action for leaders is clear: Shift focus from individual

selection to structural alignment and unlock the full potential of your

# global talent.
