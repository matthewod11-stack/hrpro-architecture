For years, managers have been advised to avoid pay transparency

among rank-and-ﬁle employees, but our research using employee

## ratings of compensation satisfaction from more than 1,300 publicly

traded ﬁrms shows that this may not always be the right choice.

The old thinking assumed that employees who discover they are paid

less than others will be unhappy, while those who learn that they earn

more than others will feel their pay is justiﬁed, leading to no change in

their satisfaction. If these reactions to pay transparency hold true, ﬁrms

only face downsides from being more transparent about pay.

However, our research shows this conventional thinking may be

unfounded. We conducted a study using Glassdoor compensation

## satisfaction ratings from before and after the SEC’s 2018 mandate that

companies disclose the CEO pay ratio, which compares CEO pay to that

of the median employee. We found that the transparency brought on

by the new disclosure made employees more satisﬁed, on average, with

# their own pay.

Employees develop beliefs about what their colleagues are paid whether

or not a company discloses salary information. They can develop

intuitions from whatever information they have access to. They hear

gossip from their coworkers and form judgments based on visible

## signals of wealth, such as expensive cars in the company parking lot

or their peers’ vacation photos on social media. Additionally, they can

use anonymous online sources like Glassdoor, Monster, and Indeed,

which provide a view of rank-and-ﬁle worker pay levels, although the

data may be incomplete or inaccurate. By not giving employees accurate

and trustworthy information, managers leave employees to guesstimate

what a fair wage is for them—and that self-determined wage is likely

inﬂated. Indeed, other research shows that employees overestimate

what their peers make.

The CEO pay ratio rule provides a great example of how employees

can use accurate salary disclosures to update their perceptions of their

own pay. In 2018, when the SEC mandated the disclosure, ﬁrms had to

disclose the pay of the median employee alongside the pay of the CEO.

In the years since, researchers have studied the negative impacts of the

disclosure on share prices and the fact that it did not lead to reductions

# in CEO pay.

But our research, which looked at approximately 300,000 individual

compensation ratings across ﬁrms in 62 diﬀerent industries, shows that

employees focused on a diﬀerent part of the disclosure: the surprisingly

low values of median employee pay. Employees already knew their

own personal CEO pay ratio (i.e., the ratio of the CEO’s pay to their

own pay). What they didn’t know, before the pay ratio disclosure, was

that their peers were also earning a lot less than the CEO. Seeing

the median employee pay value gave them a more realistic and lower

reference point for their own pay. We ﬁnd that this eﬀect holds even

when controlling for CEO pay, the ratio itself, ﬁrm characteristics,

and market-wide factors. Moreover, we ﬁnd that the eﬀect strengthens

when employees had less pay information available to them before the

disclosure, conﬁrming our intuition that they were responding to the

# new median employee pay information.

The disclosure of median employee pay was one small step toward more

pay transparency. Looking to the future, managers can use the lessons

learned from the CEO pay ratio to develop pay transparency policies for

their ﬁrms. What the research shows us is that sharing more meaningful

pay reference points can help employees understand how fair (or unfair)

their pay actually is.

Managers who seek to develop their own pay transparency policies

should consider the following critical questions:

What salary information is available already?

Employees can and do check salary information posted on job

search websites. Managers should assume their employees see this

information. Are these numbers accurate? If the information online

is wrong and inﬂated, managers may beneﬁt from providing accurate

salary information to employees. Take control of the information about

your ﬁrm, as doing so can improve employee morale.

What are the current sentiments of employees?

Many ﬁrms conduct anonymous surveys annually. They often ﬁnd that

employees believe they are underpaid and that some demographic

groups believe that more strongly than others. If employees think this,

even though the pay practices may be fair, a ﬁrm may stand to beneﬁt

from increased pay transparency. Correct the incorrect assumptions,

and employee satisfaction may increase.

How competitive is the labor market?

If employees are in a tight labor market, where they can easily get oﬀers

from other ﬁrms, they likely know what they can earn elsewhere (i.e.,

they know the market wage). They are not dreaming of salaries and roles

that do not actually exist. However, if the employees are not likely to

receive outside oﬀers because of labor market conditions or geographic

location, they will have more limited information. Our research shows

that these employees’ pay satisfaction levels will likely beneﬁt the most

## from the accurate disclosure of rank-and-ﬁle employee pay information.

. . .

Instead of maintaining an old-fashioned approach to pay, where secrecy

reigns, managers should develop pay transparency policies that ﬁt the

information environment of their workforce. In doing so, employees

can base their ideas about fair pay on accurate information from their

managers, instead of relying on gossip and online rumors. Our research

indicates that knowing the truth might make employees happier.
