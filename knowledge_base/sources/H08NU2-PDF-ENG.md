The silo effect, characterized by limited communication between

specialized business departments, has long been a pervasive issue

in organizations. Multiple studies highlight the profound impact of

silos: a Salesforce study revealed that 70% of customer experience

professionals and executives view silo mentality as the biggest obstacle

Services survey indicates that 67% of collaboration failures are due to

silos. This isn’t a new problem. An American Management Association

survey from 2002 found that 83% of executives recognize the presence

of silos in their companies, with 97% reporting a negative impact

on business. These ﬁndings emphasize that the silo eﬀect presents a

signiﬁcant challenge that organizations must address to enhance their

# operations and enhance collaboration.

As trainers and consultants, we have engaged with hundreds of

businesses across Asia, South America, Africa, and the U.S., and have

ﬁrst-hand observed the silo eﬀect. Companies have tried a range

of resource-intensive methods to eliminate silos—including cross-

## functional teams, collaboration technology, and organization-wide up-

skilling—but in many cases, they fall short. This happens because

businesses treat the silo eﬀect problem as a monolithic entity, attacking

it with a hodgepodge of solutions. Our experience and research has

led us to understand that the silo eﬀect is merely a symptom of

deeper, varied root causes. Each of these root causes demands a speciﬁc

solution—a precise tool to systematically dismantle the silo it targets.

In this article, we present a reﬁned approach through examples of three

companies, demonstrating how each type of silo—systemic, elitist, and

protectionist—requires a distinct strategy to be eﬀectively resolved. Our

goal is to shift the perspective from a generalized struggle against silos

to a more targeted, cause-speciﬁc conﬂict, leveraging our expertise to

## oﬀer more sustainable and eﬀective solutions.

# Diagnosing the Silo Effect

To better understand the three types of silos, we will use three

composite examples based on real situations we have encountered

in companies we have worked with: Goal-Diﬀ Beverage Co., EliteMed

Pharma Co., and ProtectParts Inc. These examples illustrate common

## manifestations of the silo eﬀect across industries. Goal-Diﬀ Beverage

Co. is a consumer-focused company blending and packaging diﬀerent

types of teas. The sales team plans promotions and sets sales goals

without conﬁrming with the manufacturing team, leading to cost

overruns and reduced proﬁts. In EliteMed Pharma Co., the R&D team

is reluctant to share data with the plant process design teams, resulting

in missed opportunities for process optimization. Lastly, at ProtectParts

## Inc., resistance from one of their small automobile parts manufacturing

facilities to automating its bill of materials (BOMs) results in manual

planning at that location, limiting centralized control and impacting eﬃciency across the company. We will use these three examples to

understand the three types of silos: systemic, elitist, and protectionist.

# Systemic silos.

Systemic silos arise when departments prioritize their own goals over

organizational objectives or when they have a narrow departmental

tunnel vision, creating barriers to collaboration. This often stems

from structures that encourage department-speciﬁc targets rather than

shared success. At Goal-Diﬀ Beverage Co., the sales team focuses solely

on sales volume, disregarding production costs or proﬁtability. Their

incentives do not align with manufacturing, leading to frequent product

promotions that cause demand ﬂuctuations, overtime labor, and

increased costs. Since obtaining manufacturing buy-in isn’t required,

misalignment persists, ultimately reducing proﬁtability.

Recognizing systemic silos is diﬃcult because these goals may have

worked perfectly when the company was smaller or focused on a

narrower line of products. However, as the organization grows or

diversiﬁes, these once-aligned goals can start to conﬂict, creating ineﬃciencies and friction. A good way to diagnose systemic silos is by

observing patterns such as frequent escalations to senior management,

or inter-departmental meetings that turn hostile. Departments often

blame others for delays or unmet goals, revealing the underlying

friction caused by conﬂicting objectives. These behaviors are strong

## indicators of systemic silos within the organization.

# Elitist silos.

## Elitist silos form when certain departments or groups within an

## organization perceive themselves as inherently superior in knowledge

or status, which discourages them from sharing information with other

parts of the organization. These departments believe that their work,

expertise, or contributions are too valuable or complex to be fully

understood or appreciated by others. The “elite” department isolates

itself and restricts information ﬂow to maintain its status and control

# over speciﬁc knowledge areas.

At EliteMed Pharma Co., a divide exists between the R&D department

and the process design team. In this organization, R&D creates

processes in the lab, and the process design team is tasked with

scaling these processes for real-world manufacturing. R&D believes that

process design engineers lack the expertise to fully understand the

complexities involved and hence they share limited reasoning about

the lab design. Since scaling up requires adjustments to account for the limitations and eﬃciencies of large-scale equipment, without the

details on lab design, the process design team is forced to rely on

a lengthy trial-and-error approach to create functional designs. This

selective sharing of information highlights the challenges posed by

elitist silos, where knowledge hoarding undermines the organization’s overall eﬃciency and innovation.

Elitist silos can be diﬃcult to diagnose because the root cause often

lies in subtle power dynamics. While the “elite” department operates

without disruption, the dependent department faces frequent rework, delays, and overall ineﬃcient performance. The frustration arising

from these challenges leads to higher attrition rates, lower morale,

and diminished job satisfaction. When disparities in performance,

morale, and job satisfaction emerge between departments, it signals the

# presence of an elitist silo.

# Protectionist silos.

## Protectionist silos occur when departments or groups within an

organization withhold information to protect their own interests,

status, or authority. Driven by fear of losing relevance or budget,

these teams treat information as a bargaining chip rather than a

tool for collaboration, hindering overall eﬀectiveness. At ProtectParts

Inc., managers at an older manufacturing facility resist automating

the BOMs and sharing detailed planning master data. They fear

transparency will expose higher per-unit costs, risking plant closure. This behavior prevents eﬃcient, integrated inventory and production

management across locations, stiﬂing broader improvements.

Unlike other silos, protectionist silos often involve excessive but

unproductive communication. Teams create bureaucratic delays, using

back-and-forth emails and misinformation to stall decisions while

appearing cooperative. A clear symptom is persistent discussions that

generate activity but fail to provide essential data. These behaviors

signal an intentional eﬀort to withhold essential data while maintaining

# an illusion of cooperation.

# How to Address the Silo Effect

Businesses must ﬁrst determine whether silos require immediate action

or a long-term strategic solution. Severe issues—such as customer service delays, cost overruns, or operational ineﬃciencies—may

necessitate short-term ﬁxes. A focused team led by senior management

can facilitate communication and ensure critical information ﬂows.

However, this provides only temporary relief, as misalignment, elitism,

or self-preservation behaviors will likely resurface. While useful for

stabilizing operations, short-term measures must lay the groundwork

for addressing root causes through strategic interventions.

We recommend three key strategies for addressing root causes: aligning

goals, improving communication, and fostering secure data sharing.

Aligning goals ensures all departments work toward uniﬁed objectives,

enhancing collaboration. Improving communication keeps teams

informed and engaged, promoting cross-functional understanding.

Secure data sharing builds trust, encouraging open information

exchange. Each strategy targets a speciﬁc silo type, and its eﬀectiveness

depends on correctly matching it to the root cause.

Aligning goals.

At Goal-Diﬀ Beverage Co., the silo eﬀect stems from misaligned goals

between sales and manufacturing. Simply increasing communication

or securing data sharing won’t resolve the issue, as these eﬀorts

do not inherently align departmental objectives. Without uniﬁed

goals, communication can exacerbate tensions, and data sharing may

still leave teams working independently. Addressing this disconnect

requires top management to establish overarching goals that integrate

the needs of both departments. One eﬀective approach is sales and

operations planning (S&OP), which aligns sales, operational, and

## ﬁnancial planning. Through regular review meetings, stakeholders

discuss forecasts, production plans, and inventory levels, fostering

collaboration, shared accountability, and balance between sales volume and production eﬃciency.

Improving communication.

At EliteMed Pharma Co., elitist silos arise from the R&D department’s

perception of superior expertise over the process improvement team,

limiting the sharing of critical data. Since R&D believes engineers

lack the necessary scientiﬁc understanding, simply setting common

goals or securing data sharing won’t resolve the underlying knowledge

disparity. To break down these silos, cross-functional teams should

be established, allowing R&D to directly observe the expertise

of process engineers and their role in scaling production. Job

rotation programs can further expose R&D personnel to real-world

manufacturing challenges, fostering appreciation for process design

complexities. These eﬀorts encourage mutual respect and knowledge

exchange, dismantling elitist silos and unlocking cross-departmental

# collaboration.

Fostering secure data sharing.

At ProtectParts Inc., managers’ fear of a plant closure drives the

withholding of information and crucial data. Simply improving

communication or aligning goals won’t resolve the underlying fear of

job loss. To break this silo, creating a secure environment for data

sharing is essential. Employees must feel safe knowing transparency

won’t lead to negative consequences but will support collective success.

Clear communication from top management about the facility’s role in

the company’s future can ease concerns. Encouraging a culture where

identifying issues is rewarded, not punished, and involving the facility

in collaborative projects demonstrating the beneﬁts of data-sharing can

further build trust. By fostering openness and security, ProtectParts Inc.

can ensure smoother operations across all locations.

. . .

Much like in medicine, where accurate diagnosis informs the

## appropriate treatment, the key to eﬀective management of silos lies

in accurately diagnosing the root cause of the information-sharing

barriers. This diagnostic process is crucial, as it informs the strategic

approach to dismantling the silos and fostering a more collaborative

# organizational environment.

It is important to note that these categories may not be as neatly

separated and more than one cause of the silo eﬀect may exist

simultaneously. And while short-term interventions may be necessary

to alleviate acute symptoms of the silo eﬀect, such as operational delays or ineﬃciencies, the focus must remain on addressing the root

causes to ensure sustainable improvement. By linking these targeted

solutions to the root causes they are designed to address, companies can more eﬀectively mitigate the silo eﬀect, leading to improved eﬃciency,

## enhanced collaboration, and ultimately, a more successful organization.
