Amazon’s recent call for employees to return to the oﬃce (RTO) ﬁve

days a week is the latest example of high-proﬁle companies pulling

back from their remote-work policies. RTO advocates often cite the

## importance of in-person connections, with former Google CEO Eric

Schmidt even claiming, “Google decided that work-life balance and

going home early and working from home was more important than

winning.”

Our recent real-world study, which randomly assigned employees to a

three-day or ﬁve-day in-oﬃce schedule, could provide hard evidence

on the beneﬁts of hybrid work when it comes to reducing turnover and

increasing proﬁts. Indeed, the results were so strong that the company’s

middle managers reversed their previously skeptical views on working

# from home.

# Experiment Results

The company we worked with was Trip.com, one of the world’s largest

online travel companies, with 40,000 employees. One of us, James, is a

# co-founder and chairman of the company.

Approximately 1,600 China-based employees in marketing, ﬁnance,

accounting and engineering volunteered for the study and were

randomized into two groups, based on whether their birthdays fell on

even or odd dates. One group, the control group, went into the oﬃce ﬁve

days a week for six months. The other group, the treatment group, went

## to the oﬃce only on Mondays, Tuesdays and Thursdays within the same

timeframe. The company designed the hybrid work schedule in this way

to encourage collaboration.

We analyzed data from the six-month experiment and subsequent

performance reviews for the next two years, and found the two groups showed no diﬀerences in productivity, performance review grade, or

# promotion.

Before the experiment, managers estimated hybrid would reduce

productivity by 2.6%. After the six-month experiment they estimated

it increased productivity by 1%. Those working under the hybrid

model had a higher satisfaction rate, and 35% lower attrition. Quit-rate

reductions were largest for female employees. Non-managers and those

with the long commutes greater than 1.5 hours also had signiﬁcantly

reduced quit rates under hybrid.

According to the Society of Human Resource Management, each quit

costs companies at least 50% of the employees’ annual salary, which for

Trip.com would mean $30,000 for each quit. In Trip.com’s experiment,

employees liked hybrid so much that their quit rates fell by more than a

third — and saved the company millions of dollars a year.

# Managerial Lessons

After our study came out in Nature, executives were very interested

in ﬁnding out more. We think there are three critical ingredients that

contributed to the success of hybrid working at Trip.com.

First, Trip.com has a rigorous performance management system that’s

on par with best practices around the world. Managers don’t hover

over employees at their desks to check their progress, or give ad-

hoc feedback once a year. Instead, the company has an extensive

performance review process every six months to help employees course

correct in real time. Employee performance data, as well as feedback

from co-workers, clients, direct reports and managers, are synthesized

## into a detailed, multi-dimension performance review on a ﬁve-point

scale. Through a bell curve appraisal system which ensures a range of grades, Trip.com can eﬀectively recognize and reward the top

performers while identifying the bottom ones who are then placed

on performance improvement plans. Moreover, pay and promotions

are directly linked to the review. So, the company’s managers can eﬀectively motivate and reward high-performing employees whether

they work from home or in the oﬃce.

Second, in Trip.com’s approach to hybrid work, employees have a clear,

coordinated schedule of when their team will be in the oﬃce together.

This prevents the frustration of coming into an empty oﬃce only to

participate in Zoom calls they could have easily done from home.

Trip.com enables all employees to work from home on Wednesdays and

Fridays. Other businesses might choose to set their in-oﬃce days at the

team or company level, but schedule clarity is critical for successful

# hybrid policies.

Finally, Trip.com’s CEO and the full executive suite are supportive of

a hybrid policy. As common in many modern management practices,

from lean manufacturing to organizational agility, having leadership

buy-in is critical to support a successful strategy.

“At Trip.com Group, we are dedicated to unlocking the full potential

of our employees,” said Jane Sun, CEO of Trip.com Group, the parent

company listed on NASDAQ. “Our hybrid work model, reﬁned over a

decade of innovation and experimentation, is designed to support both

personal and professional excellence. We remain committed to fostering

an environment where everyone can thrive.”

# The Value of A/B Testing

One other lesson that managers can take from our study is the value of

organizational A/B testing. We’ve all been subject to A/B experiments

probably dozens of times when using online services, but doing A/B

tests with management practices is far rarer.

Trip.com has a tradition of A/B experimentation on management

practices going back more than a decade, using these to continuously

improve their productivity. For example, back in 2010 they ran

experiments on remote working for call center employees. The

current study involved a more diverse group — computer engineers,

accounting, marketing and ﬁnance. And with positive results the

leadership took hybrid to the whole company.

Trip.com has been highly data-driven in its decision-making to avoid

jumping to incorrect conclusions about productivity of hybrid work

model. The data showed hybrid employees were working about 1.5

hours less per home day, superﬁcially suggesting these employees were

working less. But in examining the data closely, they found hybrid

employees put in longer hours on their oﬃce days and weekends to

make up. Employees shared that they found home-days useful for

important activities like a doctor’s appointment, taking their children

to school or trips, or leisure activities like golf. Because these workers

were well motivated by rigorous performance evaluations, they made up

## for this with longer hours on oﬃce days and weekends.

Trip.com is also conducting more experiments to collect data in other

hybrid-related aspects, such as ﬁne-tuning the number of days in the

oﬃce to ﬁnd the optimal balance. The beneﬁts of happier workers and

better retention make it all very attractive.

Our results showed that under a hybrid-work policy, Trip.com was able

to generate millions of dollars of proﬁts by reducing expensive attrition

## without any impact on performance, innovation, or productivity. Firms

should expand their A/B testing from consumer experience to daily

practices for continuous managerial improvement. Only companies that

continually innovate and improve will survive — and to do that they

need to experiment and reﬁne even their own management practices.
