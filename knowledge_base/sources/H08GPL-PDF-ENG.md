Do you have an underperforming employee who has been falling short

of your standards recently? Have they caused a string of performance

failures, such as missed deadlines, gotten poor customer feedback,

or negatively impacted your team dynamics? If so, you might be

considering using a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP) as a way to

help the person succeed.

## What Is a Performance Improvement Plan (PIP)?

A PIP is a formal approach to remedy performance gaps, including

failures to meet speciﬁc job goals or behavior-related concerns. The plan

outlines the existing issues and deﬁnes what new outputs and behaviors

are needed by when. But is a PIP the right choice for your situation? Will

it work? Is it worth the eﬀort? Here are some tips on determining if a PIP

is the right path and, if so, how to implement one optimally.

# Why Use a PIP?

Providing an underperforming employee a chance to course-correct

rather than penalizing or ﬁring with little warning seems like a fair

approach. That said, PIPs have a lousy reputation with employees

and even with some leaders and HR professionals who view them as

adversarial, punitive, and controlling. Further, PIP detractors argue that

termination is the inevitable ending to the performance improvement

process and that it’s inappropriate to ask an employee to work through

a grueling set of requirements when you have no intention of changing

# your mind.

Whether a performance improvement plan is a kind, constructive way

forward or a coercive, punitive path with no return depends on how and

when it is used.

# When Should You Use a PIP?

Consider the following preconditions for making a PIP successful:

You can see a clear path to improved performance.

It sounds silly to be this explicit, but a performance improvement plan

should be used only when you have a plan to improve the person’s

performance. If you aren’t willing to support changes or recognize

improvements when they happen, implementing a PIP process is

unkind (not to mention a waste of time and eﬀort). It’s especially

important to skip the PIP when the employee has violated values,

policies, or laws that make it unacceptable for you to continue to

employ them.

You’ve already done routine performance management and regularly scheduled check-ins.

Before moving to a PIP, be sure that you have already invested in

regular day-to-day performance management where you’ve set clear

expectations on performance goals and targets, done skill development

coaching, given constructive feedback, and discussed the consequences

of failing to meet goals. If you haven’t already been through at least

## a couple of rounds of regular performance management with very

clear communication, start there. Your employee might still have

considerable room to improve through routine support and monitoring

without triggering the same adverse reactions as you would with a

# formal PIP.

You’ve provided the right resources and parameters for success.

Be sure that you have addressed factors beyond the employee’s

control that might have contributed to their performance failures. Were

there unclear expectations, unmanageable workloads, training gaps, or insuﬃcient resources for the person to succeed? If so, pinning a PIP on

the employee is not legitimate. Address the enabling factors ﬁrst.

You’ve already addressed any extenuating circumstances.

Have you taken any personal or health challenges into account? When

you provided negative feedback about their work, did they share

any extenuating circumstances that might explain why they haven’t

performed up to standard? If so, you might want to focus on what

support you, your team, or your organization could provide to help the

employee rather than triggering a PIP process. Ultimately, if the person

can’t do their work, you might choose to go the formal route.

You’ve enlisted some third-party perspective.

What might feel like a performance problem could be more about

## friction between your style and your employee’s style, rather than an

actual gap in their outputs. Remember that this is about performance,

not personality. Be sure to seek input from others, including HR, to

assess the problem’s pervasiveness and decide whether the issues are

appropriate to address with a PIP.

If, after considering these questions, you believe that performance gaps

are a function of factors within the employee’s control and that a formal

improvement process is the best way to help, here are some ways to

increase the likelihood of the process being eﬀective.

# How to Make a PIP More Effective

A PIP should be more than a plan; it should be a collaborative eﬀort to

help you succeed together.

- 1. Address root causes.

A PIP shouldn’t be generic; it should be speciﬁc to the individual and

the reasons for their poor performance. An employee with solid skills

but lackluster motivation will need a diﬀerent approach than one with

more will than skill.

- 2. Make it future-focused.

You need a PIP because of past events, but to create an eﬀective plan,

the focus of the PIP template should be on the future. If you ﬁll the

PIP with examples of past mistakes, it will feel punitive, as if you would

rather dwell on what went wrong than focus on what comes next.

- 3. Set unambiguous expectations.

Where possible, deﬁne the performance goals using measurable

## objectives with agreed-upon metrics and performance targets. Where

your expectations are more qualitative, be explicit and speciﬁc about

acceptable work quality and avoid equivocal and subjective wording,

which will only introduce more uncertainty. Replace adjectives such

as “precise” with nouns and verbs geared to speciﬁc tasks like “edited

to remove spelling and grammatical errors and to translate technical

jargon into language our clients can easily comprehend.”

- 4. Provide ongoing feedback.

Once the plan is in place, check in routinely to see if the employee is on

the right track. Reward success and provide regular feedback, ongoing

coaching, and course corrections. Failing to do so will only reinforce the

narrative that PIPs are a one-way ticket out the door.

- 5. Stick to an agreed-upon duration.

A PIP should position the employee to make tangible progress in short

order. Set a PIP period of one to three months, depending on the

magnitude and complexity of the change you’re looking for. If you

have seen demonstrable progress in that timeframe, you can conclude the PIP by oﬃcially accepting their performance and returning to

regular performance management. Some PIP processes include a 6- or

12-month follow-up period to ensure sustained improvement.

- 6. Make an employment decision. If you have not seen suﬃcient progress relative to the plan commitments, you must choose between assigning the person to a

new role where they are capable of succeeding or proceeding with

terminating their employment.

One ﬁnal suggestion is to engage with HR throughout each of these six

steps. They can provide information on company policy, share examples

## of eﬀective plans, help you access proper training or support for the

employee, and provide an objective third-party view on how you might

better support the person. From the employee’s perspective, it can also

be helpful to have another person to talk to who’s familiar with the issue

but not as invested as you are as their manager.

## What Does a Successful Performance Improvement Plan Look Like?

Suppose that at the end of the PIP period, you haven’t seen suﬃcient

change in the employee’s behaviors or work quality to justify continuing

their employment. Does that mean the PIP process failed?

No, it doesn’t.

If you genuinely try to help the person succeed, completing a PIP

process has several positive eﬀects, regardless of whether it resolves

the employee performance issues. First, you reinforce the importance

of fairness and your investment in due process. Second, you show that

you take both behaviors and outputs seriously. Third, although the PIP

process should be conﬁdential, seeing relatively swift outcomes (either

improvement or removal from role) will reassure your team members,

who have likely paid the price for their teammate’s underperformance.

Fourth, you can glean insights about unclear performance expectations, insuﬃcient resources, or poor hiring proﬁles that you can beneﬁt from

# next time.

When implemented sparingly and thoughtfully, the PIP process can

## enhance performance, culture, motivation, and team dynamics.
