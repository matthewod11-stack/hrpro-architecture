One of the responsibilities of leaders is to deliver bad news: that the

company is pulling the plug on a beloved project, forgoing raises or

bonuses, implementing return-to-oﬃce mandates—or even eliminating

jobs. When the economy weakens, more companies make these choices,

requiring leaders to communicate them in a way that minimizes the

# damage to morale.

# HBR / Digital Article / Q&A: Professor Robert Sutton on Communicating Difficult Decis…

Robert Sutton began thinking about this challenge as a doctoral student

at the University of Michigan in the early 1980s. For his dissertation,

he studied how managers dealt with workers during plant and store

closings. With a series of colleagues, including Robert Kahn and Jeﬀrey Pfeﬀer, Sutton further developed these ideas, and in 2009, he

articulated them in a classic HBR article: “How to Be a Good Boss in a

# Bad Economy.”

The core advice: To reduce trauma and anxiety caused by painful business decisions, good leaders must try to oﬀer predictability

(by sharing information and behaving transparently), understanding

(explaining why changes are happening), control (making people feel

like they have a say in what’s happening), and compassion (by trying

to put themselves in the other person’s shoes). “If you give people as

much information as you can about what will happen…and when it will happen, they will prepare to the extent they can and suﬀer less,” Sutton

wrote. “Just as important, they can learn to relax in the absence of such

# a warning.”

In 2025, amid eﬀorts to downsize America’s federal workforce, fears

about how AI will reshape roles and responsibilities, and rising tension

around hybrid work and job security, this advice feels as relevant

as ever. Sutton and I spoke about what’s changed since the article

was ﬁrst published—and what remains true. Here are excerpts of our

conversation, lightly edited for length and clarity:

Your original piece was published during the Great Recession.

Today the economy is growing and the stock market is at record

highs, yet we’re still seeing signiﬁcant anxiety and organizational

upheaval. What’s driving that?

There’s research that shows there are contagion eﬀects with layoﬀs. During the pandemic, many of the tech companies started doing layoﬀs,

despite being proﬁtable, and the sense here in Silicon Valley was that

many of them were doing it, in large part, because competitors were,

too. There are other reasons, of course. Many companies are citing AI

and saying technology is allowing them to do more with fewer workers,

though it’s not clear how much of that is true and how much of that

is just a smokescreen. And some of it is just that there are sadistic

leaders who take pleasure in doing it. Firing people can make them

feel powerful or tough: “I can cut more than you can.” Some of this is

# performative and egotistical.

Can you cite examples of leaders who illustrate the right way to

# deliver bad news?

In the original article, I cite Bill Campbell, the legendary Silicon Valley

coach and executive. He’s since passed away. Two more recent examples

are Ben Horowitz of Andreessen Horowitz, the venture capital ﬁrm,

and Brian Chesky of Airbnb. Ben wrote a fantastic essay called “The Right Way to Lay People Oﬀ,” in which he describes doing three rounds

of cuts at a startup he led without poisoning the culture, which is

hard to do. When the pandemic began, Airbnb downsized 25% of its

employees. Brian’s approach, starting with his memo announcing the move, was a textbook case of oﬀering predictability, understanding,

control, and compassion. He explained exactly why they were doing

it. He let everyone keep their company laptops for job hunting. He

gave generous severance and immediate vesting of stock options. He let

departing employees stay for a few days to say goodbye to colleagues

and wrap things up. You’d be amazed how many well-run companies still cut oﬀ people’s email immediately. It’s like they try to disappear you

into the vapor. That creates a lack of control—and it doesn’t make sense.

Have the transparency and optics created by sites like Glassdoor

and LinkedIn changed the way companies deliver bad news?

That’s one hypothesis. But there’s a countervailing force, which is that

journalism has declined signiﬁcantly since then, too. There are fewer

reporters, and newspapers are now owned by billionaires who stymie

independent journalism. So the alternative hypothesis is companies

have less check on their behavior than they used to. And even though

someone can complain about a leader on LinkedIn, most people won’t

do that, because they know their posts are searchable and could hurt

# their careers in the future.

In our hybrid work world, today unpleasant decisions are often

delivered via Zoom. Is that better or worse than doing it face to

# face?

In the old days, when a company was cutting employees, you’d see

people go into a conference room and come out crying, one after

another. Doing it by video may be less embarrassing for them. It may

be easier for managers, too, because they don’t have to see the employee

in person, and they can end the conversation unilaterally. And in some ways, if the person being laid oﬀ has a conversation with their boss,

whether on video or in person, they’re lucky. Some companies just send

an email telling people their role is eliminated, without a conversation. In 2020, the e-scooter company Bird laid oﬀ 406 employees during a two-minute Zoom call in which an oﬀ-camera HR person told the

assembled group their jobs were eliminated. Some employees thought

the announcement was pre-recorded. The CEO denied that but later said he regretted not oﬀering employees one-on-one meetings.

In an economy that’s as uncertain as this one, how can leaders oﬀer

# people predictability?

# HBR / Digital Article / Q&A: Professor Robert Sutton on Communicating Difficult Decis…

In the article, I refer to Martin Seligmann’s research on London air raid

sirens during World War II, and experiments in which animals received electric shocks at diﬀerent intervals. This and other research show that

when bad things happen unpredictably, it causes people to live with a constant state of anxiety. So as a leader, oﬀer whatever reassurance you can honestly give. I’ve seen CEOs say, “We will not have layoﬀs during

the next four months,” and while that may not sound very reassuring, it

tells people that they’re safe for now.

Here at Stanford, our budgets are under pressure because of federal

research cuts, just as they are at Harvard. I admire how the new dean

at Stanford’s Graduate School of Business recently sent out a memo saying that as of right now, our business school isn’t planning any staﬀ reductions. She’s not saying it will never happen, but she’s oﬀering what

## understanding and predictability she can, even at this diﬃcult moment.

When you look back on the 2009 article, is there anything you’d

# change?

The headline. I never liked characterizing this as something that

happens only in bad economies, because it happens in economies of all kinds. Staﬀ reductions were once primarily cyclical, but today

they also happen in very proﬁtable companies—Walmart, Google,

Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft. And companies have to make other

diﬃcult decisions, like killing projects, all the time. Right now the

return-to-oﬃce mandates are an example of that: They aren’t related

to the economy. It was a mistake to say the article was about managing

“in a bad economy.” I made that argument to HBR at the time, but I

lost. I learned from that, and now I ﬁght harder to have approval over

# headlines.

# HBR / Digital Article / Q&A: Professor Robert Sutton on Communicating Difficult Decis…

We’ve talked a lot about layoﬀs. How does your framework apply to other diﬃcult business decisions?

I believe the framework is useful for helping leaders implement any

decision that might threaten their people’s job security, prestige, or pay.

Just last week, I was talking to the head of a new AI solutions group that

was doing work that overlapped with an older group in her company.

She told me that her CEO heard rumblings that the leader of the existing

group saw the new group as competitors, and the leader was worried

that his older group (including him) was now seen as less important,

would get less interesting work, and might be eliminated. The CEO met

with that stressed-out leader and emphasized how much he admired

and valued both him and his team’s work. He informed the leader that

he didn’t yet know what the new team’s charter would be, because it was

under development. But the CEO assured the leader he wouldn’t take

away any of the older team’s projects for at least two months (if it all).

And that even if the older team was eventually disbanded or merged

with the new team, no members of the team would be demoted, laid oﬀ, or get pay cuts. In the conversation, the CEO treated that troubled

leader with compassion and provided him and his team with a lot of

predictability. The assurances of employment stability also gave team

members objective and perceived control over their work and lives.

That’s a model for how to communicate in a time of uncertainty.
