One of my clients is an executive who has been with her company for

more than 20 years. Over the past several months many of her peers

have moved on from the company, part of 2021’s turnover tsunami.

She’s now surrounded by new hires and she worries that she is being

associated with the “way things used to be” and unfairly seen as

someone who isn’t innovative, strategic or willing to take risks by virtue

of being a “long-timer” at the company.

## HBR / Digital Article / When Everyone’s Quitting … Except You

With a historic number — over 40% — of the global workforce reporting

that they plan on leaving their jobs this year, my client’s story is not

unique. You might even be in a similar situation and wondering what

happens to the workers who are not job surﬁng. When employers are

heavily concentrated on engaging and supporting their new hires, loyal

employees can feel left behind. In many cases, simply being a new

employee in a new company can pay oﬀ, as external hires enjoy many

beneﬁts not aﬀorded to internal hires in similar positions. In addition,

with so many new people joining a team, the work environment shifts in

# both subtle and obvious ways.

If you’re in the position of suddenly being the senior member on a team

of new recruits, here are four strategies to help you manage yourself.

## Give Yourself Space to Process the Changes Around You

When you see others leaving your company, you may feel an urge to

start looking for new opportunities as well. Their departures can trigger

a feeling of social exclusion as you feel left behind. It’s not uncommon

to engage in what psychologists call “aﬀective forecasting,” imagining

the regret you may feel in the future if you don’t follow suit. But before

you do anything hasty, give yourself time to think rationally about how

you should move forward.

Start by reﬂecting alone, or with the help of a trusted partner, on

your intrinsic values and goals, irrespective of others’ movements. Ask

yourself, “What is truly important to me in my professional life now and

# in the future?”

Then do an honest inventory of your current capabilities and

reputation, as well as where you still need to develop, in order to achieve

your ideal work life. At the same time, explore whether your values and

goals are aligned with what your employer deﬁnes for success in your

role. You may ﬁnd that you’re motivated by a diﬀerent set of criteria

than your company, or that with a bit more adaptability you could ﬁnd a

way to be fulﬁlled by staying.

The key is to engage in some patient introspection and observation

before acting. In this way you objectively evaluate whether your employer will suﬃciently respond to your growth and nurture your

career the way it supports your new colleagues or not.

# Develop Your Own “Re-onboarding” Plan

The new hires around you are likely to have been provided a consistent

onboarding plan of intentional activities with colleagues to enable

knowledge sharing and make sure they ﬁt in with cultural norms that

preceded their arrival. If they have a playbook designed to help them

excel, why not follow suit and “re-onboard” yourself? Doing so may not

only open your eyes to strategic opportunities to add more value and

keep you competitive with your peers, but also reinvigorate your sense

# of purpose at work.

Be a Teacher and a Student

In addition to executing your own re-onboarding plan, consider helping

your new colleagues with their onboarding. Doing so can enhance your

perception as a leader and bring harmony to a potentially competitive oﬃce dynamic. Just be careful to strike the right balance between being

the wise caretaker of the company’s traditions and being an adaptive

# agent for future change.

Without question, there’s value in sharing institutional wisdom when

you’re a company veteran. But be aware of when relying on traditions

impedes motivating others forward and welcoming change. The best

strategy is to simultaneously teach and learn. Share your experiences

as a wise mentor but be willing to invite their input with a beginner’s

mind. You will not only stay relevant as things change, but your

openness will help you cultivate greater inﬂuence with your colleagues.

# Stay Competent, not Complacent

Even after you do all the above in making the best of these changes

around you, you may still be dissatisﬁed. Perhaps you feel you’ll never

be at par with your new peers and that instinct may even prove right,

which can compel you to ﬁnd a home elsewhere. Staying too long at

your company has disadvantages, particularly if you become resentful

and demotivated. Financially, you may be stuck behind new hires

because of “salary compression.” This means that since your company

knows the ﬁnancial return of attracting high talent, they are willing

to pay outside candidates much more than they give raises to current

# employees.

Another disadvantage to staying too long is that you may never advance

to levels at which new hires enter, and even worse, if you’re over 50,

studies show you may be let go before you’re ready. So do consider

whether you can grow at your current company, but don’t write oﬀ

the option of leaving if the right opportunity arises. And to ensure you

have as many options as possible, avoid burning any bridges with your

# former associates.

One leader I worked with was deeply aﬀected when he found out several

of his colleagues were leaving their company. He took it personally,

feeling abandoned at ﬁrst and then insecure about how he compared in

a job market he wasn’t even thinking about before.

His ego took over and he wondered, “How did they get that job?” By

falling victim to superiority bias, he underestimated his colleagues’

competency while overestimating his own. This dual feeling of

inferiority about his value and superiority relative to his former

colleagues made him turn inward instead of being happy for their new

endeavors. Ultimately, he not only lost meaningful friendships with

them, but also potentially helpful external connections if he decided

to enter the job search. Don’t make the same mistake as he did, and

instead invest in the relationships you have with colleagues that are

leaving, just as you are doing with the new hires around you.

## Managing your Career in Changing Workplace Dynamics

The above principles have been successfully used by several executives

I’ve worked with. One client, an executive who had been with his

company for more than 25 years, crafted his own 90-day “re-onboarding

plan,” laying out a map of key stakeholders to inﬂuence above him,

below him and across his peers. He also focused on key success

## criteria like business goals, strategy, execution and people development.

Then he set up a cadence to meet with these colleagues to align on

performance in each focus area and gather ongoing feedback as well

as explore ways to add value to their priorities. In just the ﬁrst month

of carrying out his re-onboarding plan, he reported that his colleagues

were impressed with his initiative even started asking him for feedback.

The exercise also lifted his spirit, bringing him resilience and optimism

## despite the otherwise unpleasant changes around him.

Another client, a VP at a Fortune 500 company, found himself suddenly

surrounded by several newly hired VPs and directors from other

competitors. Given his extensive company knowledge and experience,

he committed to mentoring these new employees. He was aware of a

recent study that showed that mentors are six times more likely to get

promoted to a bigger job, but in our coaching, we explored how much he

was able to learn from the mentees themselves.

Managing your career in today’s competitive and ever-changing

workplace is tough, and even when you commit to staying with your

employer, the entry of new colleagues and exit of old ones can deeply

impact your future advancement and personal fulﬁllment. But by

following these strategies, you can make sure to respond to the changes in your oﬃce in a way that maximizes your potential value whether you
