We base this claim about HR’s digital skills gap on the results ofour latest

global leadership survey. Co-produced by our threeorganizations, the survey gauged nearly 28,000 business leadersacross industries about the state and trajectory of leadership.Among the findings: On average, HR leaders lag far behind otherprofessionals in their ability to operate in a highly digitalenvironment and use data to guide business decisions.It comes as no surprise that this skills gap has spurred acredibility gap between HR professionals and their colleagues.Only 11% of business leaders trust HR to use data to anticipate andhelp them fill their talent needs. When we last fielded the samesurvey three years prior, 20% of business leaders felt that way —still a low number, but nearly twice what it is today.Finding ways to improve HR’s digital acumen and data skills canchallenge even the most well-resourced companies. HR leaderscan start by upskilling their teams in areas that impact two criticalbusiness outcomes: building bench strength and tying HR metricsto financial success. To achieve both, companies can supporttheir HR leaders in taking these steps:Forge internal partnerships. At most companies, otherdepartments use data and technology in ways that HR couldapply to their own work. For example, HR can work withmarketing for guidance on search engine optimization (SEO), askill that can help HR improve its recruitment efforts. They canalso consider partnering with colleagues proficient in financetechnology for guidance about blockchain, a technology capable

of transforming how HR stores and verifies private employeedata. Such internal collaborations may not only help HR attainnew skills, but also help to foster a data-driven culture across theorganization.Map talent analytics to business outcomes. HR should learnhow to tie its data about people to performance and businessoutcomes. This process must begin with gathering data about theskills, capabilities, and behaviors of the existing leaders andworkforce, often done through assessments. For example, ahospital seeking to improve patient safety might look to HR todiscover that the highest rates of patient safety are tied to nurseunits where supervisors showed specific behaviors, such asdemonstrating empathy. By collecting data on employee skillsand experience and tying it to business outcomes, HR canhighlight key areas of risk and opportunity for the company.

Develop data visualization skills. Simply collecting data andanalyses won’t help HR leaders advance their efforts unless theyknow how to leverage that data to influence others. One studyfound that when presenters supplemented their stories withvisuals, audience members had around a

40% greater likelihoodof taking the desired course of action versus those who receivednon-visual presentations. As such, HR should learn how to creategraphical presentations of data. HR needs to get more proficientwith sophisticated software programs such as Power BI, Tableau,or R Studio, all of which give visual context to data.

Implement leadership planning models. Beyond using data tohighlight current talent trends and gaps, HR should use it to fuelpredictions about future talent needs, especially for leadershippositions. HR professionals should employ leadership planningmodels to map a business’s long-term strategic plan to the leadersit will need to implement that plan. Leadership planning modelsenable HR to create data-driven projections for the quantity ofleaders needed, the skills they will require, and where they will belocated. On an ongoing basis, these models can compare theleadership talent it has against what it needs. As such, HR cancourse-correct when necessary by revising or shifting its prioritiesamong hiring, development, and performance-managementsystems.Taking these four initial steps can yield big dividends. Ourresearch shows that companies excelling in using data andanalytics to drive their talent strategy are more than six timesmore likely to have a strong leadership bench. Moreover, thosewith the strongest digital leadership capabilities outperform theirpeers by 50% in a financial composite of earnings and revenuegrowth.And when HR executives use their digital savviness to advancetheir companies, they often move up themselves as a result. Wefound that HR professionals who leverage advanced analytics areover six times more likely to have opportunities to climb thecorporate ladder.Today, unemployment stands at the lowest level in nearly fivedecades. As the economy continues growing and Baby Boomersretire in droves, the labor market will further tighten and increasethe pressure on HR. These demographic and economic dynamicswill push HR to be better, faster, and smarter about how it finds
