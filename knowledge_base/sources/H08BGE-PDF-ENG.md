In our book Glass Walls, we tell the story of a newspaper employee

whose publisher asked her if she planned to have kids. She replied,

“Someday.” The publisher responded, “That will be your career.”

Subsequently, the publisher moved her around the newsroom, never

gave her a promotion, and assigned her to the night shift. She quit.

## HBR / Digital Article / How Biases About Motherhood Impact All Women at Work

While this employee had no children, her employer upended her job due

to her aspiration to have children in the future.

Women’s experiences as parents in the workplace are completely

diﬀerent from men’s. Men get a “fatherhood wage premium,” such

that fathers earn more than everyone else, including men without

children. However, mothers encounter a “motherhood penalty” in

wages and advancement opportunities. Pregnant women experience

discrimination to the point that they are often afraid to let their

employers know they are expecting. One might think that women

without children, who make up almost half of U.S. women aged 15 to

50, have workplace advantages on a par with their male counterparts.

But they don’t. Among women with similar levels of education, non-

mothers have the same gender wage gap as mothers. Women don’t have

to be mothers or even want children to be aﬀected by a “maternal wall.”

Simply being a woman means being viewed as a potential mother — or

someone who should be a mother — which is enough to create such a

# wall at work.

In our research, consisting of survey data from 913 women leaders as

well as social media posts, numerous women without children reported

experiencing signiﬁcant bias and discrimination. As our research

shows, the maternal wall hinders all women’s careers, whether they

plan to have children or not. Here are a few of the speciﬁc biases we

discovered.

# “Maybe baby” bias

In our research, we heard from many women who were not hired or

promoted due to an assumption that they would become mothers. One

higher education leader learned she wasn’t oﬀered a promotion because

she “planned on having a family and would need maternity leave.”

Interviewers asked an animator about future motherhood plans: “When

I said, ‘I don’t want children’… I could tell I was considered suspicious

and probably a liar. The places that asked did not hire me.” A chief executive oﬃcer noted the futility of actions like ﬁling a complaint or

suing: “It’s illegal but there’s no way to hold these hiring managers

accountable unless we have a ton of money because the system is

rigged. We have to prove that one question was why they didn’t hire

us.” Several women noted that they were advised to remove wedding

and engagement rings for interviews to avoid the perception of needing

maternity leave.

## Researchers Jamie Gloor, Tyler Okimoto, and Eden King call this

practice “maybe baby” discrimination. Managers’ assumptions that

an applicant will have a baby “increases their perceptions of risk

associated with employing childfree, childbearing-aged women — but

not men.” Even just changing one’s last name at marriage is enough to

trigger “maybe baby” bias against women. And unfortunately, women

themselves can hold this bias, as one participant did: “I’ve had several

people I manage get pregnant and have children, and it…makes things

tough as far as being able to count on them.”

“Do more” bias

Many women with no children found that they were expected to work

longer and harder than their peers with children. A project manager

stated, “What I have experienced is that I would go the extra mile, or

that I had capacity to do more work or longer hours because I didn’t

have children. Which I greatly resented. All of us have a life, with or

## without children.” Another non-mother expressed how her choice of

vacation time was constrained: “It was assumed that I would always

cover school [breaks] for mothers and not take any holiday at those

times. There was never any taking it in turns or husbands bearing the

burden.” And a professor noted, “It is automatically assumed we have

nothing to do.” If women aren’t literally bearing the next generation’s

children, people may believe they have nothing else to do besides their

paid career.

# “Pay less” bias

Many women expressed dismay that they were seen as less deserving

ﬁnancially because they were “not working to support a family.” One

professional who was single with no kids learned that a male coworker

hired at the same level was paid more because “he was married with

a family to feed.” After another male colleague wrote to the manager

and got a raise because he was a newlywed and expecting a child, this

woman asked for a pay increase. According to our research participant,

the manager replied that “business was bad, and he would review in six

months’ time.” Another woman’s boss explicitly stated, “I like to hire

women because I can pay them less because they don’t have to support

their family.” There is still a pervasive view that women’s earnings — no

matter their family status — are optional or “just for fun.”

# “Never quite right” bias

Not having or wanting children is another way women are “never quite

right.” As one professional reported:

I was told by a previous employer that nonparents aren’t cut out to be

managers. Previous employers have also assumed I was either over-

or under-invested in my career based on parental status — either

forgoing children for a career (bad) or pursuing a career until I start

# a family (also bad).

Black women are often subject to these opposing expectations. “Either

we have children too early, or we choose to have them too late if we

put our careers ﬁrst,” as anthropologist Khiara Bridges observed in an

article in Harpar’s Bazaar.

Whether women have children or don’t have children, want children

or don’t want children, they are perceived as less worthy of positions,

promotions, and earnings than their male colleagues. As noted in legal

scholar Joan C. William’s book Unbending Gender, “The impact of

motherhood shadows every woman, narrowing her options. Even those

without children may be harmed.” Yet if we keep marginalizing women

at work — no matter their parental status — we all lose out. Innovation

requires a diversity of ideas and perspectives. As a World Economic

Forum study found, companies with above-average diversity reported

## higher innovation revenue than those with below-average diversity.

When half the population is kept from contributing or advancing at

work, societal progress is slowed.

As we have found in our research and work with organizations, there are

business practices that will ensure all women are valued and provided

# with equal opportunities at work.

# Flexibility — not judgment

Flexibility in where and when work gets done is crucial for parents

and nonparents alike. But a 2022 survey found that 86% of respondents

believed that parents take precedence when it comes to ﬂexible work;

81% believed that child-related reasons for being unavailable were more

valid than reasons of employees without children. Parenthood is a

demanding role but only one type of caretaking. Many nonparents also

have caregiving responsibilities for family, friends, neighbors, or even

pets. And everyone has a life outside of their job. Leaders should oﬀer

ﬂexible work without judgment, and model it by being transparent

when taking time oﬀ for reasons unrelated to children. Flexible work

should be oﬀered to all employees without requiring a justiﬁcation as to

why they use it.

“Flip it to test it”

In hiring and promotional discussions, use “ﬂip it to test it” to be

sure that inappropriate or oﬀ-topic assumptions are not being put on

women. For example, if you question whether a woman applicant or

promotional candidate will get pregnant and need maternity leave, ﬂip

it as if the candidate were a man. If you would not say, “Juan may

become a father and need to be oﬀ for paternity leave,” then don’t say it

# about a woman.

# Equitable work

Nonparents are often expected to “pick up the slack” for colleagues

who are out for parental leave or caregiving. Instead of dumping extra

work on these coworkers, consider how you can build coverage into

jobs. Ensure you have enough employees to cover short-term absences.

You can also use temporary workers to cover for people who are out,

oﬀer current workers overtime or a stipend to take on the additional

work, or hire an interim backﬁll when a person is on a prolonged

leave. If you must have an existing employee step in, compensate them

appropriately if they are taking on higher-level work and release them

# from other tasks.

Also, give employees options for extended time away unrelated to family

issues, such as sabbaticals. While parental leave is no vacation, ensuring

that nonparents can also have an extended leave will help with equity.

# Equal pay

Pay should be set based on a person’s position and not their family

status. Use policies to guide how pay and raises are determined. Use

standardized job classiﬁcations to set salaries based on the needed skills

## and competencies. Ensure opportunities for bonuses and promotions

are available to everyone. Conduct a pay audit for jobs at all levels which

analyzes salaries based on demographic data including gender, race,

and parental status. This will help to ensure that men are not making

more due to family considerations. If you discover inequities, correct

them immediately. Rerun the pay analysis annually to identify and ﬁx

any inequities that have crept in.

Encourage men to demonstrate caregiving

We know that paid parental leave is helpful to parents and especially

mothers. By also requiring fathers to take the leave, organizations

can dispel perceptions that only women will eventually need it. As

we have shown, women face discrimination due to both motherhood

and potential motherhood. Mandating that men use parental leave

neutralizes stigmas associated with caregiving, thus reducing workplace

bias against women. Men should also be encouraged to take family

sick leave and be vocal about their needs to leave early for caregiving.

Having men demonstrate their role in caregiving will help combat

notions that hiring or promoting women presents a risk to the company.

Eliminating the maternal wall against nonmothers and mothers alike

is entirely possible. Make the eﬀort and you will reap the results of an

engaged workforce.
