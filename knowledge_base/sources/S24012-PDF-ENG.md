# Leaders Must React

A framework for responding to unforeseen events by Nitin Nohria

During my many years as a professor of leadership, I’ve been asked

one question more times than I can count: Can leadership actually

be taught? I usually respond with a well-rehearsed answer: Much

like athletic prowess or musical talent, people’s innate capacity for

leadership varies. But just as good coaches and teachers can help

athletes and musicians realize their full potential, good educators can

help people become better leaders. To do that at Harvard Business

School, we draw heavily on John Kotter’s framework, which breaks a

leader’s job down into three key functions: articulating a compelling

vision, aligning people around it, and motivating them to execute it.

After listening to that answer, a prominent leader challenged me:

“That’s a useful theory you’re teaching, but you’re missing something

that makes or breaks leaders—something that’s much harder to teach.

It’s how they react in real time to events they can’t anticipate.” He was

referring to leaders like Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine. No one would

have called him a visionary, and because of his inexperience, many were

skeptical of his abilities. But how he responded to Russia’s invasion of

his country made him a hero. Jimmy Carter, on the other hand, may

well have been a visionary president, but he was undone by the Iran

# hostage crisis.

Leadership, my interlocutor concluded, is deﬁned as much by how well

people respond to unfolding events as how good they are at driving an

agenda. “You’re teaching only half of what leaders need to learn,” he

told me.

In 2018, my colleague Michael Porter and I published a study of how

CEOs spend their time, which conﬁrmed the validity of that argument.

We tracked the activities of 27 large-company CEOs in 15-minute

increments, 24 hours a day, for 13 weeks and found that, on average,

CEOs spend 36% of their time in reactive mode, responding to unfolding

events. This is an enormous commitment—hours they would probably

prefer to devote to advancing their plans, helping their companies hit

their goals, and strategically shaping their ﬁrms’ future.

The term “unfolding events” encompasses a broad range of issues that

eat up a CEO’s time. They can be externally driven—like ﬂuctuations

## in stock price; surprise moves by competitors, suppliers, and regulators;

or macroeconomic developments such as rising interest rates or major

geopolitical changes. CEOs also continually face unforeseen internal

events: workplace accidents, employee unrest, sudden resignations,

## just-discovered product ﬂaws, and the unpredictable reactions that

## stakeholders—from the board and the leadership team to workers on

the front lines—can have to things they hear or see.

Many CEOs I advise struggle with the fact that unexpected events

consume such a large chunk of each workweek. They worry that they’re

spending too much time in reactive mode and feel that their days have

a Sisyphean quality to them. Yet they can’t seem to break out of this

pattern. I have experienced this challenge while running organizations

# myself.

To help leaders better understand which issues truly need their

attention—and which do not—I have created a two-by-two matrix that

categorizes events according to two dimensions: how they initially

## present themselves (whether small or large) and how signiﬁcant they

will become over time. (It’s somewhat similar to the Eisenhower matrix,

which categorizes events by their current urgency and importance. My

matrix, however, considers how events may evolve.) In this article I will

describe how CEOs can determine which category issues fall into, craft

appropriate responses to them, and communicate their priority to the

# rest of the organization.

# The Reactive Management Framework

My matrix contains four quadrants: normal noise, clarion calls, whisper

warnings, and siren songs. Let’s look at the kinds of events that belong in

each one and how leaders should approach them.

stakeholders, and ﬂare-ups of human emotions fall into this category.

Most of these things don’t warrant the leader’s intervention or any

# disruption of ongoing practices.

CEOs must learn not to get distracted or drawn in by noise. They

should trust their organizations to handle these events and try to

resolve to treat them as routine. Although it’s best for leaders to avoid

getting personally engaged, they will beneﬁt from adopting the motto

“Trust but verify.” Even with seemingly trivial matters, they must

ensure that anomalies don’t go unnoticed. By occasionally checking

that the organization is responding appropriately, leaders can prevent

problems from being neglected and becoming bigger headaches. That

might involve periodically tuning in to customer feedback, reviewing

employee sentiments on platforms like Glassdoor, or ﬁnding other ways

to take the pulse of the organization.

Clarion calls: Signiﬁcant issues likely to remain signiﬁcant.

The leader’s task: Be all-in.

Occasionally, events and problems that can have a huge impact on an

## organization’s operations, reputation, and ﬁnancial standing announce

themselves loud and clear. Crises, such as catastrophic product

failures or deadly accidents, unmistakably fall into this category. Major

macroeconomic events, such as the geopolitical tensions arising from

## the Ukraine war or regulatory moves like antitrust suits or bans on

products sold to China, are other examples.

At Harvard Business School we teach several case studies on clarion call

## situations. The Volkswagen emissions scandal, the result of deliberate

test manipulations, had broad ﬁnancial and reputational fallout and

demanded concentrated CEO action. BP’s Deepwater Horizon oil spill

Facebook (now Meta), and Boeing’s fatal 737 Max accidents were all

clarion call moments. During them each company’s leadership team’s

priorities shifted toward managing the immediate situation, and most

other functions were temporarily deprioritized. The shared lessons from

these cases: It’s critical for leaders to get personally involved, and

they have to get all hands on deck as well. It’s important for them to

avoid the temptation to retreat into themselves, because they’ll need

the information, ideas, and resourcefulness of others. But they should

remain aware that other people have their own agendas. (Marketing

teams focus on optics, legal teams aim to minimize liability, and so

on.) In clarion call situations, leaders must always keep a hand on

the steering wheel and lead the organization forward. They must show

empathy for the people aﬀected by events but also ﬁnd ways to navigate

the stress, anxiety, and other emotions they may personally feel. Most

crucially, throughout the process, they must focus on doing what is

right (aligned with their organizational and personal values) instead of

feeling pressured into doing what feels safe.

Although it may sound counterintuitive, in some aspects leading in

clarion call situations is less challenging than leading in situations

that fall into the other categories. They are the easiest kind of event

to identify, and because their seriousness is obvious, it takes much

less eﬀort to mobilize the organization to respond to them. Ordinary

constraints (such as limited budgets) may be lifted in an existential

crisis. A CEO also doesn’t worry if the time spent managing it is

# worthwhile.

Whisper warnings: Small issues that might become signiﬁcant.

The leader’s task: Nip them in the bud.

Within the unpredictable ﬂow of organizational issues is a unique

category of challenges: those that initially appear minor but have

the potential to morph into major concerns. For leaders, this is the

most dangerous kind of event. It can be easy to dismiss or mistake a

whisper warning as normal noise—and fail to recognize the likelihood

that an issue will escalate into a substantial threat. Perhaps the most

famous example of this occurred in the months before 9/11, when U.S.

intelligence agencies received various tips about suspected terrorists

enrolling in ﬂight schools and an imminent attack involving airplanes. Still, oﬃcials failed to connect the dots or recognize them as more than

# run-of-the-mill intelligence chatter.

Whisper warnings can take various forms. They might be emerging

competitors that could disrupt market dynamics, murmurs of employee

dissatisfaction, nascent regulations with the potential to widen in scope, or seemingly insigniﬁcant operational ineﬃciencies that could

balloon if unchecked. Quite often, major product or safety failures start

as whisper warnings. In the mid-1990s plaintiﬀs’ attorneys began ﬁling

lawsuits alleging that the tread on Firestone tires on Ford Explorer

SUVs tended to separate at high speeds, causing accidents. Several

dealers, insurance agents, and other players received isolated reports of

problems during those years. But the larger problem remained hidden

until 2000, when media reports made its scope clear. Over time the

defective tires were implicated in 203 deaths (most of which occurred

after the earliest whisper warnings) and caused signiﬁcant reputational

damage to Ford and Firestone. Leaders who were more attuned to

whisper warnings might have reacted earlier.

Leaders need to pay careful attention to small signs of discontent that have the potential to fester and grow.

Cultural crises also often begin with whisper warnings. Many leaders

ousted for #MeToo misbehavior had been subject to quiet allegations

for years. At Uber signs of an arrogant, we’re-above-the-rules attitude

and a toxic culture were evident before Susan Fowler, an Uber engineer

who’d quit, wrote a 2017 blog post putting them in the public eye. She

recounted being sexually harassed by her supervisor and experiencing

an egregious lack of support when she reported his behavior to HR. The

ensuring uproar led to the ouster of Uber’s cofounder and CEO, and it

took the company years to rebuild its culture and reputation.

Leaders need to pay careful attention to small signs of discontent or

distress that have the potential to fester and grow, especially among

members of the board or the senior team or employees at large. When

they crop up, the best approach is to act quickly and nip problems in

the bud. With most whisper warnings, you can take steps to mitigate

the situation before it explodes into a crisis. Whether by announcing

a voluntary product recall, pulling the proverbial Andon cord on a

quality or safety issue, ﬁring a toxic executive, or reaching out to talk

to someone who is upset, leaders who respond early are more eﬀective

at tamping down simmering issues. Developing contingency plans to

address potential escalation can also be helpful, as initial preemptive

actions don’t always work.

While every whisper warning doesn’t warrant a CEO’s undivided

attention, discerning which minor issues could become much more

troublesome is a form of judgment that deﬁnes eﬀective leaders.

Siren songs: Signiﬁcant issues that are likely to diminish over time.

The leader’s task: Don’t overreact. Watch and wait.

people in but are ultimately deceptive and destructive—forces that

must be resisted. These siren song events appear signiﬁcant at face

value—and often prompt CEOs to clear their calendars. Over time,

## however, their urgency fades, and in retrospect the energy a leader

puts into dealing with them yields little return. Worse, in some such

situations, a leader’s response is like oxygen on a ﬁre and turns a small

# ﬂame into a conﬂagration.

Apple’s “Antennagate” is a classic example of a siren song. Soon after

the 2010 launch of the iPhone 4, customers began reporting that when

the device was held a certain way it dropped calls. The tech media

pounced—yet CEO Steve Jobs astutely discerned that the issue was

temporary. He addressed it while making it clear that he wasn’t very

concerned that it would dent Apple’s core value proposition. Another

example is the launch of Microsoft’s Vista operating system in 2007.

Vista was widely panned as slow and buggy and failed to gain market

share. Rather than getting dragged down, the company deftly pivoted to

more-successful product introductions without letting Vista’s problems

swamp the leadership team’s focus.

In 2015, Starbucks was widely ridiculed for its attempt to spark a

nationwide conversation on race relations by writing “Race Together”

on every customer’s coﬀee cup. Yet its leaders didn’t overreact, and the

furor quickly faded.

Though such situations can generate headlines and internal angst,

leaders must recognize that the initial assessment of their signiﬁcance

## doesn’t always correspond to their long-term impact on company

performance. The key to siren song situations is equanimity. Learning

to watch and wait is essential. It can be helpful to sleep on a matter

for a day or two and let the steam blow oﬀ to see if things calm down.

More time often allows more information to come in—which can be

extremely valuable. Staying informed is paramount, but overreacting

can be counterproductive, as it can inadvertently set oﬀ a controversy.

# The Framework in Action

## A three-step process—sensing, sizing, and responding—can help leaders

## react eﬀectively to the full spectrum of unfolding events.

Sensing. To manage their scarce time, leaders have to limit what

they devote their attention to. But in doing so, there’s a real risk

that they will ﬁlter out more issues than they should. Explicit

directives or implicit signals given to their assistants—such as who

gets time on their calendars, what emails are read carefully, and what’s

viewed as signiﬁcant enough for a meeting—can reduce the daily

ﬂow of information to CEOs. Although minimizing that ﬂow is a well-

intentioned way to eliminate distractions and keep the CEO focused

on top priorities, overdoing it can be a mistake. The best leaders stay

attuned to what’s going on in their organizations and their external

environments. In meetings they are mindful and present, which allows

them to pick up on small clues (such as someone’s body language) that

might indicate a developing concern. They cultivate a wide and varied

network of sources who provide them with timely feedback, and they

tend to that network purposefully, inviting candor and avoiding the

sycophantic “success theater” that surrounds leaders who want to hear

only good news. They especially work to create the psychological safety necessary for people to share diﬃcult news.

Awash in a river of information—a mix of fact, ﬁction, opinion,

## understatement, and overreaction—CEOs engage in a process that the

organizational theorist Karl Weick called “sensemaking.” This involves

recognizing patterns, gathering various perspectives, and putting things

into frameworks to make their meaning clear. Sensemaking helps

people mentally process complex, ambiguous situations. It improves

with practice, so most leaders get better at it over time.

Sizing. Identifying which quadrant an issue ﬁts into requires leaders to

estimate its magnitude, now and in the future. To tell a whisper warning from a siren song (to choose two of the more diﬃcult categories)

they need intuition and the ability to see how a current incident is

similar to or diﬀerent from past events. Sizing requires not only pattern

recognition but also skill at prediction and forecasting—abilities that

tend to grow with experience. Leaders also need to draw heavily on

their emotional intelligence to gauge the signiﬁcance of internal issues

and on their contextual intelligence to assess external events. Although

CEOs should seek help when sizing issues, they should recognize the

biases that the people they turn to may have because of their individual

functions or agendas. For instance, the social media team will likely

overweight an incident involving social media, and the sales team may

# overreact to customer feedback.

Ultimately, it’s the CEO’s responsibility to

determine whether an issue is normal

## noise, a clarion call, a whisper warning, or

a siren song. This takes an

# underappreciated leadership quality Max

Weber called “a sense of proportion.” It

entails the ability to separate the

insigniﬁcant from the important, see how

things are connected across diﬀerent levels

of analysis, move between details and the

big picture, and assess how material

something is. For leaders, having this sense of proportion is key. Even if

they choose to delegate some issues to others, their own judgments are

the ones they must ultimately live with.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Leaders Must React

Having sized an issue, leaders then must properly frame it and

communicate that framing to the organization. Sometimes they have

to address the fact that the organization may be tempted to overreact to

a siren song or underreact to a whisper warning and must explain why

an issue may be larger or smaller than people initially realize.

Responding. A leader’s actions in responding to any issue might seem

routine because coming up with a plan, delegating responsibility, and

overseeing execution is what a leader does daily. However, one key to

dealing with unfolding events is recognizing that by deﬁnition they are

evolving and require an adaptive response. They don’t lend themselves

to static six-week plans. Often a leader may ask for quick daily updates

to ensure that the response crafted yesterday still makes sense today

and that the initial categorization of an issue still ﬁts. An incident that

at ﬁrst presents as a whisper warning may eventually become normal

# noise—and vice versa.

Taking “robust action”—a leadership approach I have written about that

addresses ambiguity and emphasizes adaptability in decision-making

—is a good way to manage the changeable nature of unexpected

events. Instead of pursuing a ﬁxed trajectory, leaders embrace multiple,

even competing, interpretations and solutions. Like great chess players

they imagine diﬀerent scenarios and do their best to maintain several

strategic options for as long as possible. The core principle of robust

action is that in an unpredictable world, overcommitment to a single

## strategy limits opportunities and potential pathways, whereas strategic

ambiguity and ﬂexibility maximize the ability to adapt to emerging

# challenges.

. . .

With this framework in mind, how should leaders think about the

time they spend reacting to unfolding events? Remember that our CEO

study showed that the average leader spends 36% of working hours on

them—but that is just an average. Among individual leaders, the range

varies dramatically. One CEO we studied spent just 14% of his time in

reactive mode; another 81%. No doubt, the second leader was being

excessively reactive, but in our discussion with the ﬁrst leader, we raised

the possibility that he was underinvesting in it.

These polar cases illustrate a truth: The leader’s goal is not to

minimize time spent reacting to unforeseen events but to ﬁnd the

right proportion. Though managing them may at moments feel like

a distraction from eﬀorts to reach long-term goals, it remains an

essential part of what leaders do—and there can be immense costs to

handling it poorly. Many CEO ﬁrings result from missteps in responding

to unfolding events. And no matter how brilliant a leader’s plans

may be, unexpected issues inevitably intrude, and dealing with them

successfully might even be vital to achieving the plans.

Leadership often entails mastering dualities—strategy and execution,

## short- and long-term performance, proﬁts and growth, continuity and

change. We can add being proactive and reactive to the list. As much

as leaders must craft a vision and align and motivate the organization

around it, they must also sense, size, and respond to unfolding events.

I urge leaders to be thoughtful and intentional about managing them—

and to use my framework to do so more eﬀectively.
