Lev’s promotion to senior project manager came with an unexpected

challenge. Although he continued to report to his functional boss,

Gina, the head of product development, he now also answered to

## a project-speciﬁc boss, Navin, the leader of a critical new software

implementation. This dual reporting structure was meant to speed up

delivery, but Lev soon noticed that his two bosses hardly talked to

each other. He often found himself relaying information between them,

trying to align conﬂicting priorities and navigate diﬀerent directives.

Situations like Lev’s aren’t just frustrating — they’re becoming

## increasingly common. Gallup data ﬁnds that over 72% of U.S. employees

work in a matrixed organization to some extent, giving way to org charts

with dual reporting lines. The rise of cross-functional and project-based

work means workers may also answer to project leaders, regional heads, or client partners in addition to their oﬃcial managers.

Keeping one boss happy is tough enough. Add a second to the

mix and suddenly your job description includes extra, unanticipated

coordination and inﬂuencing. There’s no question that managing up to

multiple bosses isn’t easy. But the very things that make it challenging

— navigating diﬀerent communication styles, negotiating workloads,

building consensus — are exactly the skills that will set you apart in

your career now and in the future if you play it right.

So, what do you do when you’re caught between two leaders who don’t

talk? The answer isn’t cc’ing each of them on every email or throwing

up your hands and saying, “Both of you ﬁgure this out!” Here’s how to

create alignment while also getting the support and clarity you need.

# Spot the Sneaky Signs of Disconnection

Sure, it’s obvious your bosses aren’t communicating enough when they

## schedule you for two diﬀerent meetings at the same time. But there

are often subtler signs that go unnoticed until they create headaches.

For instance, do you ﬁnd yourself explaining (and reexplaining) basic

context in every meeting? Do you notice your functional manager still

refers to an initiative as “Project X” while other collaborators started

calling it something else weeks ago?

Look out for mixed messages around timelines and resources as well.

Maybe one boss casually mentions you’ll be working with Mariana from

operations next quarter, while your other boss already knows Mariana

is being transferred to a diﬀerent department. You may also notice that

each leader has a distinctly diﬀerent view of what “high priority” means

# for your deliverables.

These small disconnects are like early warning signals. Catch them

early and you can prevent minor misunderstandings from spiraling into

# major problems.

# Get Ahead of Conflicts

Be upfront with both bosses and acknowledge that disagreements and

communication breakdowns will happen. It’s not a matter of if, but

when. Bringing this up could sound like:

- “I’m excited about working with both you and David. Can we talk

about the best way to share information between us?”

- “I’ve learned matrix structures work best when we’re intentional about

our communication. Since I’ll be reporting to both teams, what’s your

preferred way to handle competing priorities when they come up?”

- “When I’m getting diﬀerent directions, would you prefer I ﬂag that

in our one-on-ones ﬁrst, or should I suggest a three-way conversation

# right away?”

Some leaders might push back with “We’ll ﬁgure it out as we go”

or “It won’t be an issue.” Try role-playing with a concrete example:

“Next month we have both X and Y due. How do you want to allocate

resources?” Show you’re thinking about how to make this arrangement

# work for everyone.

## Bring Visibility to the Decision-Making Process

Don’t simply hope your bosses will somehow sync up. Create a master

priorities document that’s shared with both managers, along with which

leader decided what and when. Review this log in your one-on-ones

with each boss, asking for corrections or additions. This keeps each

leader informed and highlights any conﬂicts.

Plus, when one boss adds something urgent, you can calmly refer to

this list and say, “Looking at my current priorities list, I’m scheduled to

deliver the audit to Vicky tomorrow and the vendor review to you on

Thursday. Which of these should I deprioritize to make room for this

# new task?”

# Be the Bridge

Sometimes you need to get everyone in the same room (even if it’s

a Zoom room). While your bosses might resist “yet another meeting,”

frame it as eliminating time-wasting back-and-forth. A monthly or

quarterly touch-base can head oﬀ dozens of issues before they start.

When urgent miscommunications do arise, take the lead to schedule

an ad-hoc session. For example, “Instead of me playing messenger, let’s

hop on a quick call with the three of us to sort this out. I’ll grab 30

# minutes in everyone’s calendar.”

In these meetings, present concrete options your bosses can decide

on: “If we push out the donor outreach campaign, we can focus on

the grant. But if we want to focus on donor outreach now, we’ll need

to request a grant extension. Here’s how either choice aﬀects our

fundraising targets…”

# Make the Costs Clear

Your bosses may not realize how much their lack of communication is

aﬀecting you or others. You have a responsibility to highlight the impact

— not to complain, but to justify why better coordination matters. Keep

the tone constructive and solution-focused and when possible, tie it

to metrics they track: delayed launches, duplicated expenses, missed

opportunities, or team burnout. For example, “We spent ﬁve hours

last week redoing work because we had diﬀerent interpretations of the

requirements from each department. If we could get on the same page

upfront, we’d save a lot of time and resources.” Humans are highly

motivated to avoid losses, which is why showing what’s at stake can

often provide the push they need to change.

While challenging, managing multiple bosses who don’t communicate

is a skill you can master — and it’s one that will serve you as you grow in

# your career.
