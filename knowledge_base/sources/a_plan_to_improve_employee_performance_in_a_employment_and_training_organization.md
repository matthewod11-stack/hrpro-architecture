# ABSTRACT

## A Plan to Improve Employee Performance in a Employment & Training Organization

# by Thomas E. Alvarez

This study proposes a plan to improve employee performance in the Intake and

Assessment department at Employers ' Training Resource (ETR). In this department , there

exists many factors contributing to reduced employee performance , such as: ineffectiveness

in performing the essential functions ofthe job ( counseling technician) ; lack of supervision

of front-line employees; lack ofclarity of work expectations for counseling technicians ; and

inconsistency of management techniques and training methods .

This paper proposes a plan to improve employee performance - the development of

an Effective Performance Evaluation System. The main sections of this plan include: a

performance evaluation process; performance improvement plan; guidelines for developing

written performance standards ; performance objectives and measurement criteria for

counseling technicians; and actions management can take in the development ofa Employee

Recognition program . As a result of this plan, management may be able to assess and

improve employee performance and the agency 's overall effectiveness and efficiency.

An effective performance evaluation system will contribute to higher employee and

organizational performance because the syst~m will address the following : establishing

standards of acc~ptable performance ; clarification of work expectations ; improved

communication ; performance feedback ; and, above all, the system serves as a focus to

instructing employees in the skills required and the new tools available to perform the

essential functions ofthe job. Perfomiance evaluation is the most direct way of improving

employee performance , increase productivity and it ·encourages

# the proper use of

# . orgamzation ~s resources.

A major barrier to implementation of this plan will be getting the support of upper-

level management to implement the new Performance Evaluation System proposed in this

study. This plan is only one of many alternatives t.o improving employee performance and

to addressing conditions at ETR. In retrospect, given more time, resources and information ,

the author would have liked to propose a future project - a Effective Training Program be

## implemented at Employers ' Training Resource.

Thus,

# the author concludes by

recommending a project to research and develop a program that will provide full, proper and

# equal training for all employees.

# CHAPTER ONE

# Introduction

In 1982 the Job Training Partnership Act (JTPA) was enacted by the United States

Congress for the purpose of establishing programs to prepare eligible individuals for

entry into the labor force. Most programs are federally funded. Funds are distributed to

the states then allocated by formula to each Service Delivery Area (SDA). Locally,

Employers 'o Training Resource (the SDA) receives funding and is the headquarters for the

## consortium of Kem, Inyo and Mono counties.

Employers ' Training Resource is responsible for implementing policies of the

Kem County Board of Supervisors while serving the general public. In addition, the state

sets performance standards that Employers ' Training Resource is required to meet.

Performance standards are the tools used to evaluate efficiency and assure achievement of

program objectives. Each year Employers ' Training Resource surpasses each of these

goals. The key to Employers ' Training Resource and JTPA's success is the

public/private partnership that works to meet the employment needs of local businesses.

Programs such as On-the-Job Training provide employers incentive to provide qualified

individuals an opportunity to gain valuable work experience.

Additionally, Employers ' Training Resource is dedicated to serving the individual

seeking employment through no-cost educational and training support. Literacy skills,

basic mathematics and English-as-a-second-language are examples of educational

programs. Some types of skills training are clerical, bookkeeping , welding, auto

mechanics and oil well servicing. Further support is available to help these people locate

permanent employment. Our main goal is to provide "stable, full-time, permanent

employment" to eligible customer s in the service delivery area. Employers' Training

Resource 's mission statement is as follows : "We are people serving people . . . Dedicated

to excellent service for all our customers ." It is the mission of Employers' Training

Resource staff to be customer-focused and accountable for the achievement of

performance outcomes , including customer satisfaction.

## Counselor's Role at Employers' Trainin~ Resource (ETR):

## The function of the counselor of the Intake and Assessment Unit require

performing duties such as:

# a) outreach;

# b) program orientation ;

# c) intake and eligibility determination;

## d) selection of participants for enrollment ;

# e) objective assessment ;

## f) individual service strategy development ; and

# g) referral to training programs.

As a counselor , our job is to determine eligibility , assess suitability and advise

customers for various JTPA programs and services at ETR. As an employee ofETR , my

role is to take the unemployed , those needing employment, those needing training for

employment, and provide services in the form of training and employment opportunities.

# Back~round

Within our organization and among counselors there exist many inconsistencies.

We better equip some counselors with better training - to provide a quality customer

2

service, be more knowledgeable , and be more productive than other counselors. Why?

On one hand, some counselors avoid doing intakes and average seeing two to three

people per day. On the other hand, some counselors grab the application when the

customer arrives and they average seeing six to eight people per day. Employees are not

maximizing their potential to perform/work , and they lack the motivation to do so.

Sometimes, counselors get an intake and they do everything possible in their power to

look for reasons not to do a complete intake. They will either refer the client or have the

client come back for another appointment , because the client forgot the necessary

information. In this event, the counselor just gets "rid" of the client and hope they come

back to see another counselor. Also, counselors can probably complete an intake in

approximately an hour to an hour and a half, but some counselors take two to three hours

per intake. Why? (Supervisors have not specified the optimal time to complete an

intake) . The central issue or "constraint" revolves around employee performance , which

has an influence on many other issues of concern, such as: customer service,

## organizational goals, communication , enrollments, etc.

ETR establishes various eligibility requirements and different ways a person can

# become eligible for our services under different Titles (Funding sources). Counselors

must be aware and knowledgeable about all aspects of the eligibility process. In addition

management is constantly sending memos regarding changes or updates to existing

programs/services . Some counselors are knowledgeable , read all memos and are clear of

ETR' s policies and procedures , while other counselors are not. Why?

3

Another factor that affects employee performance is the role of supervision.

Some supervisors are reluctant to point out clear inadequate performance to counselors

for fear of being offensive, since they have developed a good relationship. This only

creates a bigger problem and the employee may think supervisors condone his or her

behavior. Also, other employees will see this as favoritism and this can lead to low

# morale among certain counselors .

Furthermore, different supervisors have trained every employee differently which

contribute to inconsistencies and miscommunication about what is the right way to

complete an intake. Training sessions have ranged from a one day session to a one week

class format in our department. Watching other counselors has solely trained some

counselors, which is only part of the training process. These factors such as: morale,

# productivity, communication, knowledge , clarity of mission and goals, supervision and

training, can have a positive or adverse effect on employee performance , which leads to

meeting enrollments and performance standards . In turn, this increases/decreases the

chances of renewed funding levels and/or increases/decreases to current funding levels,

which fosters/creates job security for all employees.

# Discussion

I believe there are various solutions (alternatives) that can be implemented to

alleviate existing conditions. These existing conditions point to a lack of an effective

performance evaluation tool. If a counselor is properly and uniformly trained then he/she

should be able to acquire the following characteristics: provide excellent customer

service, top performer, productive, motivated , be clear about the organization ' s mission

4

and its goals, team worker , one who maximizes their potential to perform effectively and

# efficiently .

If employee performance is the problem , we as future public managers must

determine the exact cause of this constraint. Why aren't subordinates effectively

performing the tasks of their job? We must constantly ask what is contributing to this

problem and what are some of the solutions we can propose to improve existing

conditions that impede employee performance? Although training is an excellent option ,

there are many other alternatives available , but I feel an effective performance evaluation

system is the right alternative to improve the organizational problem at Employers'

# Training Resource.

There are many reasons employee performance may be low. Some possible

reasons why employees' performance levels vary include: a) Employees not knowing

'what they are supposed to do; b) Employees not knowing why they are doing it; c)

Employees do not know how to do it; d) Employees feel that there are obstacles to

completing their work; e) Employees are not interested in the work they do; f) Employees

have attitudes that interfere with their work; g) Employees lack the motivation to perform

their work; and h) the work environment may not provide incentive to be productive.

# Statement of the Problem

At Employers' Training Resource there are several factors contributing to the

problem of employee performance. First, employees are not maximizing their potential

to perform the essential functions of the job. It has been observed that some counselors

are consistently performing below the standard level of performance . Part of the reason

5

for this is because management has not specified what is the standard level of

performance , therefore some counselors are unclear as to what are the expectations of the

job. Secondly, there is a lack of supervision over front-line employees . Some

supervisors are reluctant to point out clear inadequate performance to certain employees

for fear of being offensive, since they have developed close relations with that employee .

Thirdly, supervisors practice various management techniques to manage and train

counselors differently . As a result, some counselors are unclear about which or whose

work methods are correct while performing the job or task. Lastly, ETR has no set policy

on rewarding and recognizing employees , nor do they have specified channels of

communication for employees and supervisors to provide feedback related to

performance problems . Currently, the only time supervisors discuss employee

performance are during annual performance evaluations . Also, the employee

performance evaluation sheet used by the county is arguably a subjective based civil

service evaluation tool. Existing conditions show internal inconsistencies among staff

and will continue, unless there is an effective performance evaluation system that ETR

can utilize to improve employee performance . Although many alternatives exist ·to

improve employee performance , this paper proposes one solution to the problem - An

# Effective Performance Evaluation System.

# Purpose of the Study

The purpose of this study is to propose an Effective Performance Evaluation

System to improve employee performance in the Intake and Assessment Unit at

Employers ' Training Resource. The main focus of this plan will be a combined effort of

6

# o

providing a system of quarterly performance evaluations , ongoing monitoring through

feedback and a policy for reward and recognition. This plan is only one step to improve

# the effectiveness and productivity of employees in the organizational unit. The plan

proposes the following be implemented:

- 1) An effective performance evaluation system, which includes : A new employee

performance evaluation tool, performance improvement plan, position statement ,

## guidelines for performance evaluation and the development of key performance

# standards/objectives/criteria

that supervisors can utilize as a guide when

conducting a performance evaluation with new and existing employees; The new

performance evaluation tool will not only enhance productivity but encourage

personal growth among employees at ETR. Also, this plan will propose

## recommended steps for the performance evaluation process and performance

standards or objectives; and,

- 2) Propose a list of actions management can take to develop a program for

the recognition of new and existing employees .

# Importance of the Study

Performance Evaluations are a powerful tool for enhancing productivity and

encouraging personal growth. Performance evaluations are most beneficial when

individuals lack the specific skills or knowledge necessary to perform their jobs

effectively . Performance evaluations also contributes in a major way to the quality and

effectiveness of each process involved in doing a job task. Designing a good

performance evaluation for the Intake and Assessment unit at ETR will not only be

7

0

productive for the organization but will improve employee performance as a whole .

Effective performance evaluations can foster a mentality among employees to do better

quality work, in turn their confidence soars and this acts as a powerful motivator to doing

a better job. Another benefit of performance evaluation is improved communication

between employees and management who share a common interest to enhance job

performance. Performance evaluations are beneficial to the employee 's ability to control

or manage change. An employee who becomes confident because of the factors or goals

conveyed during a review period can adapt to the changing work place. Good evaluations

can significantly improve productivity and quality of work.

How can public managers motivate their employees to aspire to high performance

levels ( everi when resources are scarce)? Public organizations, like ETR need to view

their employees as a source for strategic planning. Thus, an effective performance

evaluation system is critical to improving the overall performance of the organization and

to improve the efficiency and effectiveness of employees to do the job.

# CHAPTER TWO

# Review of Literature

In reviewing the literature, the author looked at various ways agencies have dealt

with employee performance and assessed some of the alternatives proposed. Many

authors provided important insights that can be adapted, enhanced or implemented in

organizations , like Employers' Training Resource, to resolve inadequate employee

performance. The reoccurringt themes and concepts that they emphasized were: Effective

training methods , Performance Feedback, Job Coaching and Counseling ,

# Communication, Employee Involvement/Participation , Reward and Recognition, and Job

Design. The literature states that many work-related problems can occur because of

# inadequate or inappropriate training, ineffective performance evaluations or feedback, a

dysfunctional organization lacking clear mission and clear goals, or a supervisor who

may be ill-equipped to deal with employees and performance related problems.

# Trainine

Training can increase employee productivity and contribute to achieving

organizational goals. According to Nilson, training plays an important role in developing

a productive work force and getting operations so effective that they contribute more

directly to outputs/goals of the organization (1990:1). She explains productivity as

outputs exceeding inputs, and the productive employee strives consistently to get more

units of output per unit of input. If all employees have this mentality , to optimize

resources and maintain a positive net profit of outputs over inputs, organizations can be

highly effective in achieving their goals. Nevertheless , we all know we have productive

9

and unproductive , high performing and low performing , and motivated and unmotivated

employees. As Scientific Management teaches us, a "mental revolution" has to occur in

workers' minds to foster high productivity in every employee within the organization. As

to what methods accomplishes this, there are many. Training is an excellent option for

increased productivity , personal growth, and enhanced employee performance . Training

should be selected for the right reasons and for the right people.

Training contributes in a majot; way to the quality and effectiveness of each

process involved in performing the job (Nilson, 1990:8-9). I believe well-trained

employees can provide high quality work, high productivity rates and quality customer

service. The personal satisfaction of being competent and able to do a good job is a

powerful motivator to do a better job in the future. Training is one major approach to

helping people control or manage change, because an employee who leaves training with

confidence in new knowledge and skills can handle a changing work place (Nilson,

1990:1). We all need to know and learn new information to acquire new skills and

develop new attitudes to cope with changes in the environment . Nilson provides three

tasks essential for public managers to know if training is the right method to pursue in

any organization. First, a manager must precisely define what are the employees'

training needs. Secondly, figure out the best way to present the training information, so

that such training as required is presented and learned in an appropriate amount of time.

Thirdly, as a manager, get the right training to the right people, so that the resources it

uses are an investment in productivity (1990:3) .

An effective training program will provide endless opportunities for practice in

solving problems directly related to the skill that they are teaching (Stokes, 1966:27). I

believe employees are continually faced with problems in their jobs and it is the mark of

their competence to be able to solve problems with minimum supervision or outside help.

Performing the work is the only way a trainee can get the necessary practice, and most of

this is done on the job. Many authors conclude that practice is a factor which leads to

smooth work patterns and the method by which employees develop skill. Stokes (1966)

# Q

presents a four-step process in workplace training: 1) Prepare the worker. Find out what

he already knows and stimulate interest in it. 2) Present the operation . Show and tell

exactly what each step is and how to do it. 3) Try out the worker ' s performance . Let

employees perform the operation and have them explain the steps and key points of the

operation. 4) Follow up. Put a trainee on his own, observe his performance to ensure he

is following correct methods. I believe when training an individual , we must focus on

accuracy , clarity, completeness of doing it right the first time, consistency and open to

continual improvement of tasks performed.

Training can be a powerful tool for maintaining work and for improving work

(Nilson, 1990: 10). According to Nilson , training that addresses standard of acceptable

performance , clarify the procedures of the job, instruct workers in the skills required and

the new tools available for doing a job, encourages communication and provides

feedback, can all help keep workers on the job (1990: 10). In view of this statement,

training is perhaps the most direct way of improving employee performance, overall

work, and ensures the proper use of organizational resources. Therefore , effective

11

training can be expected to significantly improve productivity and quality of work.

Adequate and timely training is an important responsibility that can have a quick and

substantial payoff (Nilson, 1990:14). Managers who choose training as a solution for

improved employee performance , productivity , growth and development , need to know

ways to plan and implement it to avoid wasted resources (time, money, personnel) that do

not add value to the organization . Nilson (1990) provides excellent guidelines as a

starting point for public managers : a) Build in quality from the beginning. Do not teach

# C

bad procedures , fix them before training; b) Design small sections of training around

specific objectives for specific learners; c) Think creatively. Be creative in delivery

methods that may save time ( charts, posters, videos, demos., structured discussion

groups); d) Shop around. May want to purchase outside training products and service_s;

e) Preview and customize a generic product. Irrelevant materials make trainees angry and

wastes resources; and f) Provide equal opportunity to a diverse trainee population.

- Provide the right training to the right people.

# Job Coachine and Counseline

Coaching is a process that is often used after the instruction of training to improve

or enhance employee performance . The use of coaching and counseling are prevalent in

solving performance problems. According to Maloney, coaching is an on-the-job training

activity that the supervisor uses to build on established employees ' performance to a

higher level (1983:82). The goal of coaching is performance enhancement , job

enlargement or preparation of future assignments/tasks (Maloney, 1983:83). As a coach,

a supervisor observes performance , provides effective feedback and then suggests ways

12

that the employee might perform the job differently to become more productive

(effective). Coaching can expand the employees ' understanding of the tasks of the job,

its importance and how it relates to others (teamwork).

Counseling is a technique used when a supervisor perceives that a performance

problem tends to be a "will not do" than a "cannot do" problem. Many organizations use

a counseling interview to improve performance. In the interview the supervisor follows

these steps: 1) description of performance in detail; 2) state effect or impact of a

performance problem; 3) ask employee how he/she might correct it; 4) ask if employee

needs assistance; 5) outline consequences of the problem if it persists; and 6) set a follow-

up date to review progress of performance problems (Maloney, 1983:93).

Coaching and Counseling methods are usually considered preventive strategies

used to head off performance problems before they require disciplinary action.

Productive employees can also become de-motivated if they view problem cases are

being ignored. Furthermore, for a supervisor to overlook clear inadequate performance ,

for fear of being offensive, is unfair to other employees who may have to pick up the

slack created by an unproductive employee. Also, an employee who operates below

standards can have a significant impact on the output and quality of operations. This can

lead to poor customer service and low morale in the unit. I believe it is a supervisor's

duty to make certain employees are performing to achieve goals and complete scheduled

# work.

13

# Job Design

Sometimes what appears to be a training problem, which result from a skill or

knowledge deficiency, may actually be a problem with the design of the job. Jobs may

change over time, technology becomes a challenge or the job itself does not live up to

employees ' expectations. Public managers may see how the job itself might be modified

so as to encourage better performance. The following are some key elements of the job

design that can be changed to cause a desired change in employee performance (Adapted

from Nilson, 1990:204-205): 1) specificity of procedure. Are procedures clear and

specific?; 2) Complexity of rules. Make rules simpler, break down complex rules into

smaller understandable parts; 3) Workflow. Observe how work passes through the

organization , does it flow smoothly without obstacles?; 4) Division of Labor. Check

organizational chart and responsibilities of employees in a unit; check productivity

records for employees with similar jobs ; check volume of work and interdependencies

among employees who affect the job. Does a person have too much or too little work?

The way the work is divided among employees in a unit has to change before

productivity can improve.

# Communication

Employees, who get the idea that their opinions about and experiences at work are

valued by others, will be more receptive to elaborate their ideas, be creative and provide

feedback. Good communication can contribute to motivating employees to enhance and

maintain good work. Also, having the support and sharing information with management

help create an environment conducive to improved communications . Communications is

14

a two way process (avenue) that gives employees the opportunity to talk over his/her

problems and goals. Employees should feel that they are getting all the pertinent

## information about the job and the organization. (Stokes, 1966:95).

The word communicate comes from a Latin word meaning "to share," and that's

what communication is all about sharing . .. it's sharing of ideas and feelings, as well as

a sharing of information, and it is a two-way process (Bruce, 1990:22). According to

Nilson, the ~ssentials of good communications are quality input, quality processing,

quality output and quality feedback (1990:207). I think we need to look at the original

intent of the message for accuracy, clarity, and relevance, then look at how information is

processed and lastly how the message was received. Often a simple change in any part of

the communication process will produce improved results. Many employee performance

problems can be solved just by defining what communication channels are, listen to what

employees are saying, value their ideas/contributions (input), and provide feedback to the

# employee.

# Reward and Reco~nition

Recognizing and rewarding small successes can be a powerful tool of building

motivation to keep doing a better job or to enhance employee performance. Recognizing

and rewarding employees can be a powerful and effective way for enhancing corporate

competitive advantage and is an important part of a commitment to continuous quality

improvement. Klubnik (1995) believes that recognition must be an integral and strategic

## process within an organization, regardless of a company ' s size.

15

# Worker Involvement and Participation

Efforts to incorporate employee participation reflect good management as well as

a desire to remain competitive in today' s market. (Wise, 1996:396-97). Greater

participation of front-line workers, like myself, can provide new ideas or approaches to

problem-solving . If decision-making authority is delegated to front-line workers, they

can offer insights to problem solving in service delivery or job processes. Front-line

employees have fiI;:;t hand experience that some managers lack and they can be more

aware of factors that prevent service delivery or undermine the effect of some public

services. This can lead to employees ' commitment to achieving organizational goals,

## higher productivity and morale within the organizational unit.

# Performance Monitorin~

According to Nilson (1990), performance monitoring and performance reviews

are excellent sources of information about knowledge and skill deficiencies that require

remedial attention (sources for uncovering other, non-training solutions to performance

problems). Most employees go meet with supervisors for an annual or semi-annual

review which various elements of their performance are rated on a scale ranging from

unsatisfactory to outstanding. A detailed breakdown ofjob parts or demonstrated skill

should be made (Nilson, 1990:206). During a performance appraisal other factors may

surface and indicate reason for poor performance , such as, skill deficiency, health related

problems, lack of resources to do the job, personal problems at home or attitude

# problems.

16

# Performance Feedback

Feedback can have a number of purposes, and managers need to distinguish

among different situations in deciding how to approach an employee. (Wise, 1996:398).

Opportunities for feedback should not be limited to annual performance evaluations or

reviews, but when a performance problem arises, it should be addressed at that time and

feedback should exist. According to Wise (1996), two other situations require feedback ,

first, when managers are not satisfied with employee performance , and secondly, when

# C

managers seek to maximize the performance or an already satisfactory employee. Wise

(1996) further states that if there is an opportunity for an employee to identify a solution

or arrive at a solution in concert with the supervisor, it maintains self-esteem and

attachment to the organization. Feedback can lead to identifying training needs specific

to the job, solutions, job rotation or termination . Feedback also has to be specific and

attainable if goals and objectives are set forth to the employee. Empioyees need to feel

that they have a significant influence over the change process rather than a symbolic

# impact.

Many performance problems can occur because of inadequate or inappropriate

training, ineffective performance evaluations , lack of supervision , lack of a clear mission

and goals for the organization , or a supervisor who may lack the skills appropriate to deal

with employee performance related issues. The author concludes that many angles can be

taken to develop a proper plan to improve employee performance. Developing an

effective performance evaluation system directly improves performance through ongoing

monitoring , which contributes to increased productivity and encourages personal growth.

17

# CHAPTER THREE

## A Plan to Improve Employee Performance in a Employment & Training Organization

Periodic performance evaluations can provide the feedback which lets employees

know where they stand. In addition, performance evaluations specify work expectations,

and assists employees and management to develop a performance improvement plan to

improve

job performance ( encouraging personal growth and enhancing productivity of

an organizational unit). Evaluation of performanctc can be treated as an on-going process.

A performance evaluation, between employee and supervisor, should be conducted

periodically, and at least annually. This plan proposes a performance evaluation system

which includes: an evaluation form to be conducted quarterly; a performance

improvement plan; a position statement outlining the essential functions and expectations

## of the job; guidelines for performance evaluations; and, the development of key

performance objectives that supervisors can use as a guide to measure employee

performance among counseling technicians at ETR's Intake and Assessment unit.

The new performance evaluation (see Appendix A) will provide the opportunity

for both employee and supervisor to review performance criteria, outline job

expectations, and develop a plan for future improvement. It is also an appropriate time to

clarify work plans and other work processes/procedures which might affect employee

performance or the job itself. The performance evaluation should be a give-and-take

situation, with both parties providing input and feedback. Lastly, this plan proposes some

incentive for employees to improve performance through reward and recognition

suggestions (Included will be ideas management can implement in the public sector).

18

# Performance Evaluation System

Performance evaluation is a process of assessing, summarizing and developing the

work performance of an employee. Writing the evaluation should be preceded by a

meeting with the employee to provide the opportunity for a mutual understanding of the

evaluation process. The employee will have the option to submit a position statement

(see Appendix B) which is a self-evaluation and to be considered in the development of

the evaluation . The position statement will outline what the employee and supervisor

think are the expectations of the job. Attached to the position statement will be an outline

of the essential functions of the job (see p.29), that will assist the employee in developing

summary statements of his or her job expectations . In order to be effective and

constructive, the supervisor conducting the evaluation should make every effort to gain as

much objective information about the employee 's performance as possible . Conducted

quarterly, performance evaluations provide further feedback to the employee and serve as

a reference point in assisting the employee and supervisor to develop more factual and

# comprehensive performance evaluations .

The new performance evaluation system will serve several useful functions:

- 1) To r~view progress against standards and to collect data for the evaluation.

- 2) To determine what standards of performance are app_ropriate for the work to be

performed by the employee, which should be changed, which should no longer be

appropriate and which new standards are needed.

- 3) To review performance standards to see whether they are adequate or need to

be revised.

19

- 4) To analyze what areas the employee is deficient in knowledge or skill so the

supervisor can act as a coach to eliminate any deficiencies .

- 5) To determine any additional assistance to help the employee improve his/her

performance and outline a plan for improvement.

When conducting a performance evaluation the goal should be to determine whether the

performance standards for an employee are being achieved and whether they are being

met and to what degree. Also, we are determining whether the employee's skill level is

appropriate to the tasks of the job. During the performance ev~luation, the supervisor

must act as a coach and identify how the employee could be more effective. Then, work

out an improvement plan outlining what could be done so performance standards will be

met or most likely to succeed in achieving those standards.

# Performance Evaluation Process

At least four performance evaluations should be conducted annually . For each

performance evaluation the following steps can be taken:

- 1) Schedule the performance evaluation according to the situation and as the

# competence of the employee demands.

- 2) Prepare for the Performance review.

Before the review starts, make sure the information or feedback has been gathered since

the last review and reviewed and analyzed. The analysis can begin with a review of the

job functions and responsibilities. The review provides an opportunity to evaluate any

changes that may have occurred in the job or key job performance areas, or in the goals

toward which the employee was working on. These may all affect performance. This

20

review of functions and responsibilities needs to be evaluated jointly with the employee

to ensure accuracy and consideration of the employee 's views of his or her job. The

following steps are recommended in preparing the performance evaluation :

a. Before meeting with the employee review his or her essential job functions

(see p.29) and personnel record for the evaluation period. Review any

## observations , notes, and previous performance evaluations before the meeting.

# c

Obtain feedback from other employees whom the employee has worked with, if

appropriate. This is important information to have when evaluating the key

performance objectives of an employee 's job. Locate and have ready any

supporting information (i.e., intakes,files, etc.)

b. Give the employee advanced notice of the performance evaluation so that he

or she has the opportunity to review (self-evaluate) and prepare for the

# meeting.

c. Hold a preliminary meeting with the employee before the actual formal

performance evaluation takes place. At this meeting, the evaluation form(s) and

process will be explained and reviewed. The employee and supervisor should

discuss his or her job description and decide which essential functions and

organizational goals the employee is responsible and should be evaluated for that

# period.

d. Conclude the meeting by scheduling the second meeting which will serve as

the formal performance evaluation. Encourage the employee to bring in a written

self-evaluation (see Appendix B), which can be used as the basis of discussion

21

during the formal evaluation process. The self-evaluation can illicit an

employee 's perspective on his or her performance for the review period, as well as

## suggestions for personal interests and goals for career development.

e. In writing the performance evaluation , for each essential job function to be

evaluated, management should consider three questions:

- 1. How does the level of performance compare with the

# l

## performance objectives for this function, task or goal?

- 2. How was the level of performance confirmed? What supporting

evidence is there to support the level of performance?

- 3. What were the results or impacts of the performance?

- 3) Planning and Delivering the performance evaluation. Planning for the

# performance evaluation meeting contributes to the success of the evaluation process. The

following are recommended guidelines that can assist management accomplish the goals

## of the formal performance evaluation meeting:

a. Prior to meeting with the employee, review the written evaluation of

the employee 's performance and ensure there is supporting evidence of the

rating that was given.

b. Plan the discussion for the evaluation, objectives can include:

- 1. Reviewing , discussing and understanding the essential

## functions of the job description, goals and performance objectives

# for standards of work performance.

- 2. Outline the employee 's strengths and achievements.

22

- 3. Outline functional areas that need improvement and establish an

improvement plan of how to accomplish performance objectives.

- 4. Specify methods by which the employee can work toward

accomplishing his or her performance objectives (i.e., training, job

## rotation , special work assignments for training purposes , etc.).

c. Plan to meet with the employee in private. Carefully review his or her

written self-evaluation if provided and discuss areas of agreement and

difference. Consider any points raised in the employee self-evaluation that

shows another perspective on the assessment, and be prepared to modify

# the evaluation if appropriate.

## d. Review the draft of the Performance Evaluation form with the

employee. Discuss the employee 's strengths first, which will set a positive

tone for the meeting ; Discuss areas of needed improvement and ask the

employee how he or she can improve performance. Then introduce ideas

# for improvement as well.

e. Close the evaluation when all key areas have been covered and the

employee has been given the opportunity to provide feedback and input.

Also, present the employee with an opportunity to come in at any time to

discuss performance issues and show interest in the employee 's progress.

- 4) During the performance evaluation the recommended areas should be covered:

# a. Performance standards

b. Knowledge and/or Skill deficiencies -

23

# c. Competence and effort

# d. Quantity and Quality of work

e. Cooperation and Ability to work with others(Teamwork)

# f. Job knowledge

# g. Initiative

# h. Communications

# I. Customer Service

# j. Adaptability

- 5) In addition to these performance areas outlined above (a-j), the following

questions should be raised:

a. Is the performance standard being met?

b. Are these standards likely to be met?

c. Are there any knowledge/skill deficiencies and what is being done

# about

# them?

d. Has any progress been made with respect to the improvement plan

developed at the last performance evaluation?

e. What performance standards are still appropriate in view of the ongoing

reviews and which should be changed/revised/added?

- 6) Take the steps necessary to develop a plan of action, i.e. the performance

improvement plan, to satisfy the conclusions from discussion of each performance area

# above.

24

- 7) Make the necessary comments in the employee 's performance record.

- 8) Set a follow-up date and/or date for the next performance evaluation .

Performance evaluations are important steps to ensure that the performance standards ·

remain valid and they add factual information to the day-to-day operations. The

performance evaluation process is intended for change in performance , breakdown

existing barriers and maintain open communication between management and employees.

This communication is part of the ongoing process of monitoring and feedback necessary

to producing successful performance evaluations.

# Performance Improvement Plan

Sometimes organizations fail to recognize that the goals of the organization , as

well as the employee can be best served if management helps the employee plan for

performance improvement, which indirectly has an affect on organizational performance.

An effective performance evaluation must place a great emphasis on the performance

improvement plan - on developing the plan and monitoring its progress. The

improvement plan must use a positive approach which will motivate employees to accept

the expectations of the plan. One way is to keep in mind questions like: What can we do

better in the future for you , the employee , and the organization? How can we avoid the

performance problems encountered in the past? These are key questions in which the

discussion of the plan can be centered .

The improvement plan will focus on what the employee and possibly the

supervisor will do differently to achieve desired outcomes. The improvement plan should

define individual growth activities that will enhance the employee 's competence and

25

confidence. When the employee achieves the plan his or her feeling of security on the job

will be enhanced as well as greater satisfaction from accomplishment on the job. By

developing the performance improvement plan during the performance evaluation,

employees are most likely receptive to change and the strongest commitment to the plan

can be achieved. The performance plan should be no different than the performance

evaluation with respect to the performance standards and areas. The improvement plan is

twofold: (1) it specifies what the employee will do differently than in the past; and (2) it

specifies the steps necessary for the employee to take to improve performance levels so

he or she can do the job more effectively.

The following steps should be followed to ensure a successful performance

improvement plan has been developed:

- 1) Specify the objective and benefits of the improvement plan - to improve the

## employee 's competence, performance and for better evaluations in the future.

- 2) Involve the employee in the improvement plan and ask him or her to suggest

what elements the plan should contain and what steps can be taken for individual

# growth and job performance.

- 3) Make suggestions for behavioral changes.

- 4) Define any priorities needed to accomplish the improvement plan and come to

## an agreement between the employee and supervisor over these priorities.

- 5) Set up a timetable with dates for review of accomplishments and the employee

should decide when these dates should be established. If employees set the

timetable, it will empower them to increase their performance and accountability.

# Performance Objectives/Standards

Performance objectives, usually referred to as performance standards, are written

statements or measures describing how well a job should be performed . Performance

objectives should be developed collaborativel y with employees , and explained to new

employees during the first month on the job. Performance objectives provides a standard

or benchmark against which to evaluate employee performance . The job description may

describe the essential functions and tasks of the job, the performance objective defines

how well each function or task must be performed to meet or exceed some level of

# acceptable performance or expectations.

Currently, Employers ' Training Resource does not have an effective or objective

measure to evaluate the essential functions of the job, as a counseling technician. This

plan will outline the essential functions of Counseling Technician I/II and propose key

performance objectives supervisors can use to evaluate employee performance during a

particular review period. But first the author will discuss what performance standards are

and how management can develop written Performance Standards before proposing the

## key performance objectives and essential job functions.

As stated earlier standards of performance are usually developed in collaboration

with employees and explained to new employees within the first month of employment.

Employers' Training Resource should specify general criteria for evaluation ratings,

which are found on the Performance Evaluation form (see Appendix A). These ratings

describe the level of performance of the employee compared to the essential job functions

and standard of performance . Supervisors will use this criteria to rate the employee 's

27

performance . Performance standards answer the question , "How will the emplo yee and

supervisor know when the emplo yee is meeting or exceeding expectations for his or her

# position? "

## Guidelines for Developin2 Written Performance Standards

Performance standards outline what the expectations are for the performance of

the essential job functions and related tasks , between management and employees . This

Ulilderstanding provides a basis for ongoing monitoring , feedback and counseling between

evaluation meetings as well as the formal performance evaluation. The following are

recommended guidelines for writing performance standards /objectives :

- 1) Discuss and describe those results which would constitute the minimum

acceptable performance for a particular job function or task. Describe the results

that would indicate performance exceeds expectations or falls below the standard .

- 2) Standards/objectives

should be clear in outlining which specific actions are

required for performance to meet , exceed or fail to meet expectations . Also , they

should be reasonable and appropriate regardless of the employee .

- 3) Describe performance objectives using specific terms that are measurable

# indicators of performance .

- 4) Specify the acceptable margin of error or percentage.

- 5) Ensure performance objectives are related to the employee 's assigned work and

# job requirements.

- 6) Lastly , quantifiable measures may not apply to all functions. ·Management

should keep in mind the following questions that should be used as a check on an

28

# organization ' s performance standards:

- 1. Are the standards realistic ?

- 2. Are the standards specific enough?

- 3. Are the standards based on measurable data or verifiable information ?

- 4. Are the standards clear and understandable to management and staff?

- 5. Are the standards consistent with organizational goals?

## Essential Functions of Counselini: Technician 1/11:

The essential functions of the job, counseling technician , will be used as a basis

for this part of the plan, which is designed to propose key performance objectives that

employees and management can use to evaluate employee performance. The following

are the essential job functions for counselors in the Intake and Assessment Unit at ETR:

## Essential Functions I: Under direct supervision and in a learning capacity:

- Learns and keeps informed of eligibility requirements for JTPA programs ;

- Interviews applicants for JTPA services to determine their job and training needs ;

- Assists in filling out forms;

- Explains eligibility rules;

- Completes intake forms;

- Screens applicants for knowledge , aptitude, interest and barriers to employment ;

- Administers and scores tests;

- Appraises client suitability for various JTP A programs ;

- Informs clients of available training programs ;

- Conducts classroom training sessions on pre-employment & work maturity skills

29

Level II: Under supervision: In addition to above :

- Refers clients as appropriate to other community service agencies ;

- Provides program information to the public in person or over the telephone ;

- Maintains records and files ;

- Works with difficult cases requiring more complex needs assessment , counseling

# and eligibility determination;

- Maintains close liaison <With other community service agencies and refers clients

# as appropriate ;

- Reviews completed intakes to insure accuracy;

- May present programs to community groups.

- Performs other job-related duties as assigned.

## Performance Objectives/Standards for Counseling Technicians

This section of the plan will focus on developing performance standards for

Counseling Technicians at ETR that supervisors can use to evaluate employee

performance. Specifically , only standards will be developed for the vital functions of the

job, which are:

a. Determining eligibility and suitability for JTP A programs ;

# b. Documentation ;

# c. Attendance ; and

# d. Orientation.

As stated earlier effective performance standards must be developed in collaboration with

employees and they should be based on measurable and verifiable data. At ETR, there is

30

enough data to measure performance , for example , when counselors do an intake or

interview an applicant for JTP A programs and services, they sign in on a sheet for every

client seen. On that sheet, is the client's name, social security #, time arrived, time client

was seen, result of interview (i.e., eligible/ineligible and what activity the client will go

into next), and time client left. All this data can be researched to gather the necessary

information to develop performance standards . From the data gathered ETR can develop

# general performance standards such as:

# a. Quality of Work and/or Documentation

# b. Clarity of Work/Documentation

# c. Quantity of Work

# d. Attendance Rate

# e. Margin ofError/Percentage rates

All other essential job functions (see p.29), will be evaluated on an ongoing basis. Once

the counselor feels that they are competent in that essential function, he or she will notify

the supervisor and the supervisor will have a checklist of essential functions he or she can

check off to say that employee x has competently performed job function x. There has to

be some honor regarding essential functions , meaning the counselor has to have integrity

when reporting that a certain job function has be competently achieved . Also, as a check

and balance, the supervisor can randomly pull files that employee x has completed and

observe the variety of essential job functions present and necessary to effectively

complete an intake or interview , the data is there, all supervisors have to do is ~ather it

# for evaluative purposes .

31

Quality of Work/Documentation - In order to assess the quality of work we are

measuring the extent to which an employee can complete an intake or interview.

Specifically, we are looking at documentation - to complete an intake each file must

# contain three major elements:

- 1. The client goal has been identified - Why the client is interested in

ETR's programs and services and how can ETR meet those goals and

# interests of the client?

- 2. All suitability issues have been identified and discussed with the

client - What, if any, barriers does the client have regarding training and

employment ?, Are there any unresolved issues the client needs to take care

of before entering a training program at ETR? (i.e., financial,

transportation, housing issues) . Based on this the counselor will identify

candidates that are suitable or not suitable for ETR' s programs /services

- 3. The next step in the process has been discussed with the client -

Now that eligibility and/or suitability has been determined , what is the

next step for the client in ETR' s process? (i.e., further assessment ,

# training , job search activities, etc.).

All three of these elements must be present in the clients file in order to complete

an intake, and the data again can be gathered from the clients' files. The standard can be

files that address 2 out of 3 major elements are an acceptable level of performance .

Clar~ty of Work/Documentation - Clarity of work refers to the extent that an

employee's work is clear, legible and understandable. This means that if a counselor or

32

supervisor picks up a particular file, they can understand what went on in that intake or

interview. They would not need any further information or explanation about a particular

intake file. Specifically, we are measuring the degree to which files are:

- 1. Legible; and

- 2. Understandable.

Quantity of Work- What we are measuring is inputs and outputs, the extent to

which the number of intakes that were seen and completed. It would be invalid to

measure quantity of work based on outputs, because often counselors are unable to

complete an intake for reasons beyond the counselor' s control. Meaning not every client

that a counselor sees is the same and they may have issues that would prevent counselors

to enroll them into a program, therefore we would refer the client to other community

agencies as appropriate. Another indicator of output, can include the number of referrals

made to other community agencies.

First, an average tally per week of the number of intakes seen, completed and

referred can be kept by the employee, recorded on the sign-in sheet, and evaluated by the

supervisor. Quantity is defined by the number of customers/clients seen, output is

defined by the number of intakes completed, or referred (this would be up to management

to decide if they would want to include the number of referrals as an output measure).

The formula to be used is the total number of intakes divided by the population of

counselors (this can also be tallied as to what was the FTE a counselor solely did intakes

for the week - meaning if fifty percent of his or her time was in intake, than we would

only count that counselor as .50 into the population, when doing the formula).

33

The following formula can be used :

## Total # oflntakes + Population of Counselors= X

For example , if the total number of intakes were 300 for the week , and the counselor

population available for intakes that week was 15, the resulting intake number per

counselor would be 20 for that week. That number would be the standard , and if a

counselor was below that standard if would be apparent , the numbers would tell all. So,

if~a counselor was consistently below the standard , then a meeting should take place

between th~t employee and supervisor to indicate what are the reasons for his or her

below standard number . (Also , this formula can be computed per month , quarterly, bi-

annuall y or annuall y, this is to the discretion of management).

Attendance - Attendance is an important factor in measuring the quantity of

work. If a counselor is not present all the time, one his or her numbers would always be

below the norm, and two, this would be a performance problem. The following formula

can be used to rate attendance:

## # of shows per month + days of the month = %

The standard for attendance should be a high percentage , such as 90-95% , since

attendance is vital to completing the work for a unit and to balance the workload among

# counselors.

Error Rate - The extent to which a counselor performs the work correctly or

incorrectly. A standard should be set for new counselors , counselors who have been

employed for six months , one year, two years , etc. Management can specify how many

methods a counselor uses per intake , then supervisors can evaluate according to the

34

percentage of methods correct for each counselor. The following formula can be used:

# of correct methods ..;.. total correct methods = %;

Again, management can specify what is an acceptable percentage rate or margin of error

for counselors based on the length of time employed with the organization .

Orientation - Orientation is a major function for those who perform that specific

task. This performance area can also be evaluated with the use of a questionnaire which

can be completed, by customers or clients. At the end of each orientation , the counselor

can have the customers complete a questionnaire/surve y (see Appendi x C). The purpose

of this survey will not only serve as an evaluation tool for the counselor , but for the

organization as well. The ratings also can be calculated from this Orientation Survey, and

a standard of rating can be used as the norm (i.e., anything above 4.5 is an acceptable

# rating).

The plan has proposed performance standards that can be used to evaluate

employee performance. They are measurable and verifiable . Furthermore , they are clear

and consistent with the goals of the organization , who are concerned with inputs and

# outputs .

# Reward and Reco2nition Pro2ram

If the organization ' s goal is to improve performance and help employees gain

higher levels of motivation , then the organization must provide some form of recognition

that provides satisfaction on the job. Sincere recognition can bring about greater

satisfaction on the job and at times increase the productivity of an organizational unit.

Recognition also shows that the organization has confidence in the employee ' s

35

capabilities . Recognition gives the employee a sense of personal satisfaction , a sense of

achievement , personal growth, recognized by peers, and a sense of personal

responsibility . Recognition is a key to motivation which is a factor to improving

employee performance , their effectiveness on the job and the productivity levels of an

organizational unit. I believe an organization can set up the following schedule to

# implement recognition:

- Recognize highly successful employees whenever they surpass their goals.

- Recognize moderately successful employees whenever they reach their goals.

- Recognize less successful employees whenever they almost reach their goals.

Recognizing and rewarding employees can be an integral part of a commitment to

continuous quality improvement. In an organization , like Employers ' Training Resource,

it is hard to provide rewards and recognition of employees because of budget constraints,

but the following is a list of suggestions that can be used to establish a program for

recognition , that are mostly non-monetary or very inexpensive to institute:

# Written Recognition

- 1. A personal letter ofthanks from the Deputy Director for a significant

# contribution .

- 2. A memo about the accomplishment to go into the employee's personnel file.

- 3. A note/memo included in the company publication "Monday Memo" about the

# employee ' s accomplishment.

- 4. A special "Wall of Fame" to recognize people and their accomplishments

posted in the front lobby.

36

- 5. A company Certificate of Achievement or Employee of the month plaque .

- 6. Something engraved with the person 's name, i.e., pen set, paperweight or cup

# Non-tan~bles

- 1. An extra long morning or lunch break.

- 2. Special apparel day for the employee recognized - jeans , tennis shoes, etc.

- 3. Ask the employee to teach or share his/her accomplishment with others as a

way of recognizing the person 's ability an.d role.

- 4. Give the person increased or changed responsibility.

- 5. Recognize the individual 's accomplishments in front of peers.

- 6. Ask the employee for advice or opinion which demonstrates respect.

# Miscellaneous

- 1. Once-a-month/quarter potluck or lunch in someone 's honor to recognize a

# major accomplishment.

- 2. Lunch outings for the entire unit (can be a pay your own way) but the value is

placed on the individual and the outing.

- 3. Dinner out for two for the "Emplo yee of the Month. "

- 4. Free coffee or soft drink delivered to the employee 's desk (one day or several).

- 5. Doughnuts or bagels as a morning starter valuing the employee 's efforts.

- 6. A box of candy, nuts or fruit.

These suggestions can serve as a basis to establish a recognition program and to develop

a strategy for recognition at ETR. Making a recognition program successful requires the

37

personal commitment of team leaders and managers to make it valuable and meaningful

to their employees. Putting the recognition program in place is only the first part.

# Interpersonal Skills and Teamwork:

Every employee should also attend a one-day seminar on interpersonal skills and

team work/team building. The areas to be covered in the seminars would range from

effective communications to team work and group problem-solving. Employees who

possess these techniques enhance their ability to work together and solve organizational

problems. Training can be organized around certain group problem-solving tasks, with

groups meeting periodically , to assess and study a particular process or product, so they

can be in a position to recommend a solution to a particular problem. Seminars cost -on

the average of about $100-$150 per person. The cost to Employers ' Training Resource

Intake and Assessment department would be $5250 (35 employees @ $150).

# Barriers to Implementation

The following is a list of external/internal factors that may present barriers to effective

implementation of the discussed alternative to employee performance. (Some of these

were found in the review of literature) :

A. Efforts to revise work methods/job design are impeded by existing rules and

# regulations.

B. Lack of management support or a failure to engage employee support for an

# action.

C. Traditional job classifications may hinder effective use of employee skill and

# abilities.

38

D. Strong group or professional norms may inhibit employees.

E. Self-interests may limit the success of team work efforts.

F. Organizational and process factors can impede efforts to enhance performance.

# G. Lack of leadership roles.

# H. Lack of interpersonal skills.

I . Political pressure to conform.

J. Failure to include front-line workers.

39

# CHAPTER FOUR

## Summary, Conclusions, and Recommendations

# Summary

The paper addressed the problem of employee performance and how to improve

current conditions contributing to this problem in the Intake and Assessment department

at Employers ' Training Resource. The essential task of this paper was to propose a plan

to improve employee performance . This paper reviewed literature that dealt with various

alternatives to improving employee performance, these alternatives included areas, such

as: Training, Job Design, Job Coaching and Counseling, Effective Communications ,

## Worker Involvement and Participation , Reward and Recognition , and Performance

Feedback. The author proposed a Effective Performance Evaluation system as a solution

to the problem of employee performance . The purpose of this plan was to propose an

Effective Performance Evaluation System. The main sections of this plan include: a

## performance evaluation process; performance improvement plan; guidelines for

developing written performance standards; performance objectives and measurement

criteria for counseling technicians ; and recommended actions management can use in the

development of a Employee Recognition program (Recognition can be an integral part of

a commitment to continuous quality improvement) . In addition, the author produced

three new forms, to be considered drafts and open to changes in format, which includes:

# Employee Performance Evaluation form; Employee Position Statement/Self-Evaluation

form; and a Orientation Survey form. As a result, management will be able to assess and

improve employee performance and the agency's overall effectiveness and efficiency.

40

# Conclusions

Efforts to enhance or improve employee performance can be assessed through

many options, so public managers can see which alternative can have the greatest impact

on an agency' s overall effectiveness and efficiency. From a professional perspective , a

Effective Performance Evaluation System, and providing incentives through recognition

are needed at Employers ' Training Resource to improve employee performance . I

believe this plan will have the greatest net benefit to the problem of employee

performance. I recommend Performance Evaluation, as a solution to achieving high

employee performance , because many benefits come out of this solution, such as:

## productivity, morale, motivation , competency, consistency and a commitment to

achieving organizational goals. The rationale is that performance evaluations addresses

standards of acceptable performance , clarifies the procedures of the job, instructs

employees in the skills required and the new tools available to do the job, improves

communication channels and provides feedback, which are all beneficial to improving

employee performance. Performance evaluations are perhaps the most direct way of

improving employee performance , overall work and ensuring the proper use of

organizational resources. That is why the author has chosen to implement this plan as a

solution to improving employee performance and address the existing conditions at

# Employers ' Training Resource.

41

# Recommendations

This plan will be presented to the Deputy Director of Client services at

Employers ' Training Resource, as a recommendation to improve existing conditions and

overall employee performance. A major barrier to implementation of this plan will be

getting the support of upper-level management to implement the new Performance

Evaluation System proposed in this study. It has been observed that management is

reluctant to drastic changes in the organization and what this plan is calling for is just c

that. In order to implement this plan, we would have to re-evaluate the current

performance evaluation structure for the county and decide to replace the civil service

evaluation form with the new forms presented in this study (see Appendices ).

Performance evaluations will be conducted every three months and treated as an ongoing

# process.

At Employers ' Training Resource, there exist many issues confronting

management , regarding employee performance and many angles this project could have

taken. Given the necessary time, information and resources, the author would like to

implement a policy providing for a standard, uniform Training program. ETR does not

have a consistent training policy for all employees in the Intake and Assessment

department. A recommendation to develop a program that will provide full, proper and

equal training for new and existing employees should be considered for a future project or

department committee. This can be done by, first, conduct a needs analysis of employee

training needs; secondly, develop an agenda for training; thirdly, develop areas of training

and outline a program that addresses each of those training areas; and lastly, publish a

42

training manual that can be referred to for future training of new and existing employees .

In retrospect , developing a training program for all employees is an excellent option to

improving employee performance in the Intake and Assessment department at ETR.
