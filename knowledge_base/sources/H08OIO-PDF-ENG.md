Cecily, the ﬁnancial controller of a startup tech ﬁrm, describes what

typically happens when her CEO returns from a conference. “She always

comes back with a ‘great’ idea. And for a while we all put our shoulders

to the wheel trying to implement it. But usually, her attention moves on

to some other shiny new thing, and it ﬁzzles out.”

Cecily is suﬀering from strategy fatigue—a phenomenon that’s on

the rise. Recent studies show a notable increase in the frequency of

strategy shifts. A survey of 1,284 executives revealed that 85 percent of

senior leaders have observed “an explosive increase” in transformation

projects over the past ﬁve years. Gartner reports that the typical

organization has undertaken ﬁve major ﬁrmwide redirections in the

past three years with nearly 75 percent of respondents expecting an

## increase in the number of major initiatives in the next three.

Strategy fatigue is not the same as change fatigue. Change fatigue

is triggered by frequent alterations to workplace processes. It results

from the sheer volume of changes in how people work. Strategy

fatigue, in contrast, is caused by frequent and capricious shifts in an

organization’s strategic direction. When leaders continually ﬂipﬂop on

priorities, employees struggle to understand the company’s purpose

and objectives. This gives the impression that leaders don’t know

what they’re doing. A lack of coherent progress leads to uncertainty

and becomes conﬁdence sapping. Strategy fatigue doesn’t discriminate

—it can plague scrappy startups, corporate giants, and even public

institutions. Let’s review two examples to illustrate:

- A tech startup that keeps changing course

## The strategy-du-jour CEO in the opening story of a tech ﬁrm hinders

performance because she changes course “at a moment’s notice,”

chasing new ideas before the last one gained traction. Early on, this

approach created buzz and energy. But over time, employees grew

frustrated with the constant whiplash. One month, the priority was

international expansion; the next it was pivoting to a new product—all

without clear reasons. Productivity gave way to chaos. As one former

team member noted, “the CEO hit a wall and so did the company.”

This is strategy fatigue at its most acute: talented people rendered

ineﬀective because leadership can’t stick to a direction long enough to

reach a successful ﬁnish line.

- A fashion company that keeps ﬂipﬂopping about its strategic

directionJennifer had been Senior Account Manager for a company

that sells high-end women’s fashion clothing, bags, and accessories.

She had been hired to “expand the business internationally via

wholesale” (B2B) and had identiﬁed a critical but complicated path to

make this happen. But after just two years she had left due to strategy

fatigue brought on by her CEO’s ﬂipﬂopping about corporate direction.

When I asked why the CEO kept changing course, Jennifer said she

“lacked a retail background, came from a large strategy consulting

ﬁrm, and didn’t have industry knowledge.” The CEO had trouble

staying on track with the plan and “changed the strategy every three

months,” switching from international expansion to extra focus on

retail (B2C), to opening more stores, to using a diﬀerent brand for a

certain product—to anything the board okayed. “The CEO was always

looking for a silver bullet to deliver unrealistic ﬁnancial results,”

Jennifer observed, none of which worked. In the end, the CEO was

ﬁred a year after Jennifer left.

# How to Fight Strategy Fatigue

Having too many initiatives in play or rapidly switching them for no

apparent reason dilutes focus and produces strategy fatigue. So how do

you combat this? For leaders, this can be something of a mind game.

You need to channel reactive responses to shiny new ideas through

sober testing processes:

Set up screening criteria

Create clear screening criteria to evaluate whether a new idea or project

aligns with your strategic direction. Be willing to say “no” or defer

ideas that don’t align. For example, on returning to Apple, Steve Jobs

conducted a comprehensive review of the company’s product lineup

eliminating 70 percent of existing models to refocus on core products.

This decisive action streamlined operations and redirected employee

focus towards innovation. The subsequent introduction of the iMac

G3 exempliﬁed this renewed focus, leading to signiﬁcant commercial

success and revitalizing Apple’s market position. At a time when

proliferating opportunities in tech were ﬂooding Silicon Valley, Jobs

opted to stay on message by oﬀering a limited range of simple, elegant,

# blockbuster products.

# Use data-based scoring frameworks

Adopt a data-driven method to rank ideas by impact and feasibility.

## Techniques like weighted scoring or a value vs. eﬀort matrix help

quantify an idea’s business value against the resources it requires.

Netﬂix for instance employs the Prioritization by Innovation Outcome

(PIO) framework which leverages customer usage data, market research,

and ﬁnancial metrics to assess the potential impact of product

innovations. Other organizations utilize frameworks like the RICE

(Reach, Impact, Conﬁdence, Eﬀort) scoring model to systematically

evaluate and prioritize products, ensuring that development eﬀorts

are focused on high-impact initiatives. By integrating structured

methodologies, companies can avoid strategy fatigue and maintain a

# competitive edge in the market.

# Employ proof-of-concept experiments

One reason companies fall into strategy fatigue is the fear of missing

out on the Next Big Thing. So, they greenlight numerous projects hoping

one succeeds. A smarter way to go is to adopt a proof-of-concept (PoC)

approach—a small-scale test of an idea to validate its feasibility before

major resources are committed. For instance, in software development,

a PoC can help determine the viability of a new product by assessing

its functionality and alignment with user needs, ensuring that only

## viable solutions progress to full-scale implementation. This approach

has two beneﬁts: it prevents the entire company from being dragged

into every unproven venture, and it maintains an innovative culture by

encouraging a test-and-learn mindset.

Maintain a single, visible pipeline

Keep an idea or project pipeline where all non-business-as-usual

initiatives are listed and tracked to avoid strategy fatigue. This provides

visibility into how many ideas are in play and avoids duplicate or

competing eﬀorts. Regularly review this list with senior leadership to

cull lower-priority projects. When organizations map out all ongoing

projects and change initiatives, they’re often shocked by the sheer

number and must then stop or postpone some initiatives to let higher

priorities succeed. Some companies adopt a rule like “one in, one out”

for major projects to enforce this balance. Creating a project tracking

system not only provides visibility for prioritizing projects it also fosters

# a culture of accountability and focus.

. . .

In an uncertain business environment, many organizations fall into

the trap of adopting reactive strategies under the mistaken impression

that the more initiatives, the more chances of success. But as you’ve

seen, unchecked proliferation of strategic priorities carries a heavy

cost: strategy fatigue can stealthily sap your organization’s strength,

eroding employee engagement and blunting performance. You can

avoid this outcome and restore your organization’s energy and purpose

by applying judicious ﬁlters to new strategy initiatives. Your employees

will thank you with renewed engagement. And your business will reap

the rewards of considered and deliberate strategy that inspires rather

# than exhausts.
