AI in the Enterprise

A new way(cid:8) to work

As an AI research and deployment company, OpenAI prioritizes partnering with global companies because our models will increasingly do their best work with sophisticated, complex, interconnected work(cid:13)ows and systems.

We’re seeing AI deliver signi:cant, measurable improvements on three fronts:

01

Workforce performance Helping people deliver higher-quality outputs in shorterY

# time frames.

02

Automating routine operations

Freeing people from repetitive tasks so they can focusY on adding value.

03

Powering products

By delivering more relevant and responsive customer experiences.

3

AI in the Enterprise

But leveraging AI isn’t the same as building software or deploying cloud apps. The most successful companies are often those who treat it as a new paradigm. This leads to an experimental(cid:24) mindset and an iterative approach that gets to value faster and with greater buy-in from(cid:24) users and stakeholders.

# Our approach: iterative development

OpenAI is organized around three teams. Our Research Team advances the foundations of AI, developing new models and capabilities. Our Applied Team turns those models into products, like ChatGPT Enterprise and our API. And our Deployment Team takes these products into companies to address their most pressing use casesV

We use iterative deployment to learn quickly from customer use cases and use that information to accelerate product improvements. That means shipping updates regularly, getting feedback, and improving performance and safety at every stepV

The result: users access new advancements in AI early and often—and your feedback shapes future products and models.

# Start with evals

How Morgan Stanley iterated to ensure quality and safety

As a global leader in ]nancial services, Morgan Stanley is a relationship business. Not surprisingly, there were some questions across the business about how AI could add value to the highly personal and sensitive nature of the work.c

The answer was to conduct intensive evals for every proposed application. An eval is simply a rigorous, structured process for measuring how AI models actually perform against benchmarksa in a given use case. It’s also a way to continuously improve the AI-enabled processes, with expert feedback at every step.

How it started

Morgan Stanley’s ]rst eval focused on making their ]nancial advisors more e†cient and exective. The premise was simple: If advisors could access information faster and reduce the time spent on repetitive tasks, they could oxer more and better insights to clientsu

They started with three model evals:

01

# Language translation

Measuring the accuracy and quality of translations produced´ by a model.

02

# Summarization

Evaluating how a model condenses information, using´ agreed-upon-metrics for accuracy, relevance, and coherence.

03

# Human trainers

Comparing AI results to responses from expert advisors, grading for accuracy and relevance.

These evals—and others—gave Morgan Stanley the con]dence to start rolling the use cases´ into production.

6

AI in the Enterprise

# How it’s going

Today, 98% of Morgan Stanley advisors use OpenAI every day; access to documents has jumped from 20% to 80%, with dramatically reduced search time; and advisors spend more time on client relationships, thanks to task automation and faster insights.

The feedback from advisors has been overwhelmingly positive. They’re more1 engaged with clients, and follow-ups that1 used to take days now happen within hours.

How Indeed humanizes job matching

When AI is used to automate and accelerate tedious, repetitive work, employees can focus on` the things only people can do. And because AI can process huge amounts of data from many sources, it can create customer experiences that feel more human because they’re more relevant and personalized9

Indeed, the world’s No. 1 job site, uses GPT-4o mini to match job seekers to jobs in new ways.

# The power of why

Making great job recommendations to job seekers is only the start of the Indeed experience.` They also need to explain to the candidate why this speci…c job was recommended to them9

Indeed uses the data analysis and natural language capabilities of GPT-4o mini to shape these ‘why’ statements in their emails and messages to jobseekers. Using AI, the popular ‘Invite to Apply’ feature also explains why a candidate’s background or previous work experience makes the job‰ a good ‚t.

The Indeed team tested the previous job matching engine against the GPT-powered version with the new, customized context.` The performance uplift was signi…cant:

A 20% increase in job applications starte(cid:16)

A 13% uplift in downstream success—not only were more candidates likely to apply,` but employers were more likely to hire them.

9

AI in the Enterprise

# With Indeed sending over 20 million messages a month to job seekers—and 350 million visitors coming to the site every month—these increases scale up to signi(cid:14)cant business impactG

But scaling up also meant using more tokens. To increase e(cid:8)ciency, OpenAI and IndeedC worked together to (cid:13)ne-tune a smaller GPT model that was able to deliver similar resultsC with 60% fewer tokens.B

Helping job seekers (cid:13)nd the right jobs—and understanding why a given opportunity is right for them—is a profoundly human outcome. Indeed's team has used AI to help connect more peopleC to jobs, faster—a win for everyone.

We see a lot of opportunity to continue to invest^ in this new infrastructure in ways that will help^ us grow revenue.

How Klarna bene ts from AI knowledge compounding

AI is rarely a plug-and-play solution—use cases grow in sophistication and impact through iteration. The earlier you start, the more your organization bene?ts from compounding improvementsG

Klarna, a global payments network and shopping platform, introduced a new AI assistant to streamline customer service. Within a few months, the assistant was handling two-thirds of all service chats—doing the work of hundreds of agents and cutting average resolution times fromS 11 minutes to just 2. The initiative is projected to deliver $40 million in pro=t improvement, all while maintaining satisfaction scores on par with human support. These results didn’t happen overnight. Klarna achieved this performance by continuously testing and re=ning the assistantE

Just as importantly, 90% of Klarna’s employees now use AI in their daily work. Growing organization-wide familiarity with AI has enabled Klarna to move faster, launch internal initiatives more e3ciently, and continuously re=ne the customer experience. By investing early and encouraging broad adoption, Klarna is seeing AI’s bene=ts compound—driving returnl across its business.

# Customize and fine-tune your models

How Lowe’s improves product search

Enterprises seeing the most success from AI adoption are often the ones that invest time and resources in customizing and training their own AI models. OpenAI has invested heavily in our API to make it easier to customize and 4ne-tune models—whether as a self-service approach or using our tools and support6

We worked closely with Lowe’s, the Fortune 50 home improvement company, to improve the accuracy and relevance of their ecommerce search function. With thousands of suppliers, Lowe’s often has to work with incomplete or inconsistent product data.

13

AI in the Enterprise

The key is in accurate product descriptions and tagging. But it also requires an understanding& of how shoppers search, a dynamic that changes across product categories. That’s where& (cid:5)ne-tuning comes in(cid:19)

By (cid:5)ne-tuning OpenAI models, the Lowe’s team was able to improve product tagging accuracy& by 20%—with error detection improving by 60%.

Excitement in the team was palpable when we saw results from 5ne-tuning GPT 3.5 on our product data. We knew we had a winner on our hands!

# What is (cid:5)ne-tuning?

If a GPT model is a store-bought suit, fine-tuning is the tailored option—the way you customize% the model to your organization’s specific data% and needs.

Why it matters:

Improved accuracy

By training on your unique data—such as product% catalogs or internal FAQs—the model delivers more% relevant, on-brand results.

# Domain expertise

Fine-tuned models better understand your industry’s terminology, style, and context.

# Consistent tone and style

For a retailer, that could mean every product description stays true to brand voice; for a law §rm, it means properly formatted citations, every time.

# Faster outcomes

Less manual editing or re-checking means your teams can focus on high-value tasks.

# Get AI in the hands of experts

BBVA takes an expert-led approach to AI

Your employees are closest to your processes and problems and are often the best-placed to <nd AI-driven solutions. Getting AI into the hands of these experts can be far more powerful than trying to build generic or horizontal solutions:

BBVA, the global banking leader, has more than 125,000 employees, each with a unique set of challenges and opportunities. They decided to get AI into the hands of employees—working closely with Legal, Compliance, and IT Security teams to ensure responsible use. They rolled out ChatGPT Enterprise globally, then let people discover their own use cases.

“Normally, in a business like ours, building even a prototype requires technical resources and time,” says Elena Alfaro, Head of Global AI Adoption at BBVA. “With custom GPTs, anyone can create apps to solve unique problems—it’s very easy to start.”

In <ve months, BBVA employees created over 2,900 custom GPTs—some of which reduce¿ project and process timelines from weeks to hours. The impact was felt across many disciplines and departments:

# The Credit Risk team

Uses ChatGPT to determine creditworthiness faster and¿ more accurately.

# The Legal team

Uses it to answer 40,000 questions a year on policies, compliance, and more.

# The Customer Service team

Automates the sentiment analysis of NPS surveys.

16

AI in the Enterprise

# And the wins continue to spread across Marketing, Risk Management, Operations, and beyond. All because they got AI in the hands of the people who know how to apply it in their own disciplines.

We consider our investment in ChatGPT an investment in our people. AI ampli#es our potential and helps us be more e(cid:29)cient and creative.

# Elena Alfaro Head of Global AI Adoption

Product Note: With deep research, ChatGPT can do work independently. Give it a prompt, and it can synthesize hundreds of online sources to create comprehensive, PhD-level reports. This unlocks employee productivity and gives them access to deep, detailed research on any topic in minutes. In an internal evaluation by experts across domains, deep research saved an average of 4 hours per complex task.

# Set bold automation goals

How we automate our own work at OpenAI

At OpenAI, we live with AI every day, so we’re often spotting new ways to automate our own work.j

An example: Our support teams were getting bogged down, spending time accessing systems, trying to understand context, craft responses, and take the right actions for customers5

So we built an internal automation platform. It works on top of our existing work7ows and systems to automate rote work and accelerate insight and action5

Our ,rst use case: working on top of Gmail to craft customer responses and trigger actions.h Using our automation platform, our teams can instantly access customer data and relevant knowledge articles, then incorporate the results into response emails or speci,c actions—suchh as updating accounts or opening support tickets3

By embedding AI into existing work7ows, our teams are more e(cient, responsive, and customer- focused. This platform handles hundreds of thousands of tasks every month, freeing people to do more high-impact work. Not surprisingly, the system is now spreading across other departments3

It happened because we set bold automation goals from the start, instead of accepting ine(cient processes as a cost of doing business.

# Conclusion

Learning from each other

As the previous examples show, every business is full of opportunities to harness the power of AI for improved outcomes. The use cases may vary by company and industry but the lessons apply across all markets&

The common theme: AI deployment bene(cid:30)ts from an open, experimental mindset, backed by rigorous evaluations, and safety guardrails. The companies seeing success aren’t rushing to inject AI models into every work!ow. They’re aligning around high-return, low-eOort use cases, learning as they iterate, then taking that learning into new areas$

The results are clear and measurable: faster, more accurate processes; more personalized customer experiences; and more rewarding work, as employees focus on the things peopleX do best&

We’re now seeing companies integrating AI work ows to automate increasingly sophisticated processes—often using tools, resources, and other agents to get things done&

We’ll continue to report back from the front lines of AI to help guide your own thinking.
