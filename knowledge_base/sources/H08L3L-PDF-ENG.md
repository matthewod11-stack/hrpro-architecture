As generative artiﬁcial intelligence becomes more prevalent in

business, the key to success for all of us humans — whether we’re

junior employees or senior executives — will be to delegate our routine

work to technology and dedicate ourselves to more creative pursuits.

Whether we’re reimagining sales and marketing strategies, improving

internal processes, or generating alternate revenue streams, this is our

opportunity to become the people who drive innovation and progress in

# our careers and organizations.

Indeed, a 2024 survey conducted by Canva and HBR Analytic Services,

found that 91% of respondents believe creative thinking is a key

attribute for working professionals, while 96% of people agree

it is essential to an company’s long-term performance and success. And

yet a lot of us still struggle to reach our creative potential.

So how do you jumpstart your own and your team’s creativity? Based on

our decades of experience leading media and advertising agencies and

advising clients, here are a few guidelines and prompts that we’ve found

particularly helpful in sparking fresh thinking.

# Prepare

Creativity requires being in the right headspace for it. There’s a reason

that some of our best ideas come while showering; we’re often doing

it after mind-clearing sleep or exercise and, for at least a few minutes

as the water rains down on us, we’re removed from the distractions of

# day-to-day work and life.

So, before you embark on any of the exercises we describe below,

it’s important to get yourself ready. Block out time, engage in some

breathing exercises to boost your focus, and ensure that you are open

and receptive to your own thoughts and feelings as well as those of your

creative partners. Remember that the process will be messy — full of

iteration and reiteration — but that the end goal is to emerge with novel

ideas that spur growth.

Whether working alone or with colleagues, it can also be helpful to ask

yourself context-setting questions, such as “Where are we? Where do we

want to go? Do we have the right support and systems to think and act

more creatively? How deep and long a commitment can we make? How

much discomfort are we willing to live with during the process?”

After this prep work, you should be ready to try four diﬀerent types of

creativity prompts. The ﬁrst set is designed to spark change when you’re

in a rut. The second, to nourish your team after a fallow period. The

third, to renew and refresh on top of success. And the fourth, to test

transformation if you think it might be necessary.

# Spark Change

Perhaps you’re worried about falling behind competitors, or customer

feedback is mediocre, or you’ve seen previous change initiatives fall ﬂat.

When individuals or teams are in a rut and looking for reinvention, we

often recommend these two exercises.

# Exaggerate.

Take a problem or challenge and think about the most extreme way

to solve it. What would you do if you had unlimited inﬂuence, time,

or budget? Consider, for example, the outlandish idea proposed by

the organizers of the London Olympics opening ceremony: have James

## Bond escort Queen Elizabeth II to a helicopter, from which she would

parachute into the stadium! Though a stunt double pulled oﬀ the latter

feat, the Queen and actor Daniel Craig gamely agreed to the videotaped

setup, providing a memorable kickoﬀ that was made possible only

because someone was willing to think way outside the box.

Start a revolution.

Discuss all the spoken and unspoken rules about the work you do

and the oﬀerings you deliver. Write these heuristics or conventional

wisdoms down, then talk about how you might defy or do the opposite

of each one. For example, in the 1990s, a marketing manager for Ajax

noticed that all ad agency pitches he was getting for his latest product

— a cleaning spray that left no residue — featured a smiling housewife

using it to clean quickly and then devoting the time saved to friends or

a hobby. But one proposal showed a man doing the cleaning with the slogan, “Save him time. Buy New Ajax Liquid.” The manager chose this

stereotype-defying option, and the campaign generated huge sales for

# Ajax.

# Nourish and Flourish

These are strategies to use when you’re trying to push past a fallow

period. Maybe you’re thinking, How do we get our rhythm back?, or

you’re trying to bounce back from burnout, or you’re just bored and

looking for something new.

# Re-express with different language.

Simply replacing key words in your creative challenge will enable

your team to think diﬀerently. If your task is keeping clients, use

the language of marriage counseling. Ask: How can we improve this

relationship? What can we do to increase aﬀection and ensure loyalty?

Or if you are not a market leader in a competitive category, re-express

this to your advantage. A brilliant example of this was the Avis Car

## Rental advertising campaign from the 1960s with the tag line, “When

you are only number two, you try harder.” This simple switch of

positioning helped the brand move from loss to proﬁt for the ﬁrst time

# in a decade.

# Use an old idea.

Could an idea from the past help solve your current problem? Human

nature doesn’t change much, so something that’s fallen out of fashion

might just work again now. Find the person in your sector who has

the most experience and interview them to see if any old strategies or

techniques are worth reviving. Keep a bank of the ideas that didn’t quite

make it but could be given another try.

Consider Jenny, a manager who wanted to encourage more of her team to return to the oﬃce post-pandemic. After listening to employees

explain why they were reluctant — since people’s schedules varied,

there was little professional or personal upside to coming in — she

realized that she needed to create a short, interesting, collective

experience in which everyone would want to participate. She thought

## back to old-time county fair pie contests, in which a community

would gather to see who among them was the best baker, and then

instituted her own version: the Cookie World Cup. Each Wednesday,

two colleagues would bring in their best homemade sweet treat to share

with colleagues, who would then vote on whom to advance to the next

round. After seven weeks, a winner was crowned, and Jenny’s team was

newly energized about commuting in one day a week to interact with

# one another.

# Refresh and Renew

These strategies are for when you’re looking for not a revolution but a

refresh and renewal. Maybe your business has had an extended growth

period and you’re trying to ﬁgure out how to keep it going or your team

has worked together for a long time and needs something new to get

excited about.

What is missing?

Think about what you’re not doing and ask why. Look where the

competition isn’t and consider what you might gain by extending

there. Shortly after gay marriage was legalized in the United States in

2015, marketer Benjamin Vendramin realized that there weren’t many

same-sex love songs. His team developed an idea for MGM Resorts —

commissioning new or reimagined recordings from six artists including

Bob Dylan, Kesha, and St. Vincent — and the campaign (dubbed

## Universal Love) won ﬁve Cannes Lions in 2018.

Likewise, Rich, a marketing strategist, saw that many brands were

falling ﬂat in their sustainability campaigns because consumers weren’t

seeing tangible impact: the connection to their lived environment was

missing. He thought of the most prominent nature-related cause he

could — National Parks — and linked the organization with his clients

to work together on visible and popular purpose-driven initiatives.

What would your enemy do?

Deﬁne the enemy to your business, team, or project. Why are they a

challenge, and what can you do to preempt their next move or outsmart

their thinking? For example, before a rival brand was poised to launch

its washing-up liquid in UK supermarkets, legacy brand Fairy oﬀered

a big and widely used discount on bulk purchases of its products,

ensuring that few people would need to buy any more for the next few

# months.

# Test Transformation

These strategies are for when you want to turn a page. Times are lean,

you lost your biggest customer, or a new startup has disrupted your

business, and you’re wondering what do to.

Get it up and running in six weeks.

Decide on something you want to try, and give yourself a strict

deadline for doing so. Work backwards; to get it done that quickly, what

must happen in the ﬁrst week, the ﬁrst three days? Set unreasonable

benchmarks, break the work into smaller chunks, and be amazed by

what you can accomplish in a short time. Spanish retail giant Zara can

go from fashion sketch to ﬁnished garment on store racks in as little as a

month. What idea might you test in the same amount of time?

Push until it scares you.

Don’t accept the ﬁrst idea, or the second, or the third. Keep going until

you get to one that scares you. For example, when Sarah took over as

managing director of her company, she knew that its three divisions,

each led by a strong personality, weren’t working well together. Her

initial thought for solving the problem was to enroll the trio in a

## joint management course or individual and collective coaching. Her

second was to bring them together for a weekly meeting with her. But

she suspected such measures wouldn’t result in long-term behavior

change. Her third idea was to reorganize the company, moving from

three divisions to two and giving each leader a reimagined role, team,

and objectives. It was a controversial choice, and there were teething

problems, but a year later, the silos had disappeared, all three executives

were working well together, and revenues were up 20% in part due to

# new revenue streams.

. . .

In the age of AI, human creativity is a superpower that brings growth

to your career and organization. It also makes the workplace a more

interesting and fun place to be. Try these exercises. Get inspired by

these examples. And start bringing your best creative mind to work in

# the new year.
