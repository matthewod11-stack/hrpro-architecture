## Gender equity in the health workforce: Analysis of 104 countries

Key messages 1	 Women form 70% of workers in the health and social sector.

 Women’s representation in the most highly paid health occupations has been improving

# steadily since 2000.

 Women are less likely than men to be in full-time employment.

 Overall, an average gender pay gap of around 28% exists in the health workforce. Once

occupation and working hours are accounted for, the gender pay gap is 11%.

 Although the sector performs well regarding women’s participation, gender transformative policies are needed to address inequities and eliminate gender-based discrimination

in earnings, remove barriers to access to full-time employment, and support access to

## professional development and leadership roles.

# Background

The health and social sector, with its 234 million workers,

is one of the biggest and fastest growing employers in the

## world, particularly of women.1 Women comprise seven

## out of ten health and social care workers and contribute

## US$ 3 trillion annually to global health, half in the form of

# unpaid care work.2

## Underinvestment in the health and social workforce

undermines the prospects of achieving the Sustainable

Development Goals (SDGs). The WHO SDG health price tag

study finds that almost half of the investment required to

achieve the health SDGs relates to education, training and employment of health workers. The WHO Global Strategy

## on Human Resources for Health: Workforce 2030 (GSHRH)

## estimates a global shortfall of almost 18 million health

## workers by 2030, primarily in low- and lower middle

income countries.3 The GSHRH also calls for strengthening

## data and progressive implementation of National Health

Workforce Accounts (NHWA). Investing in the health and

social workforce not only contributes to the achievement

of universal health coverage and to global health security,

but, as the United Nations Secretary-General’s High-Level

## Commission on Health Employment and Economic Growth

found, investments in the health and social workforce have

## a powerful multiplier effect on economic growth and can

contribute to maximizing women’s economic empowerment

# and participation.4

Gender equity in the health workforce: analysis of 104 countries

## programme in 2017, a joint inter-agency multi-SDG

programme to accelerate the expansion and transformation

## of the health and social workforce. The programme

embraces gender as a core tenant and seeks to utilize

workforce plans, investments and actions to seize the

opportunities to realize the gender dividend. In November

## 2017, WHO established the Global Health Workforce Network

which includes a Data and Evidence Hub and a Gender

Equity Hub, which both bring together key stakeholders for

strengthening data and evidence and supporting gender

While gender issues have been at the top of the global

## agenda, few comprehensive studies on gender in the health

and social workforce have been conducted at the global level. This brief is based on an analysis of WHO NHWA data5

## for 104 countries over the last 18 years.

# Key ﬁndings

# Occupational segregation by gender

The analysis confirms previous findings6 that women’s

share of employment in the health and social sector is high,

with an estimated 67% of the health workforce in the 104

countries analysed being female. Nevertheless, systematic

differences exist in gender distribution by occupation across

all regions. In most countries, male workers make up the

## majority of physicians, dentists and pharmacists in the

workforce, with female workers comprising the vast majority

## of the nursing and midwifery workforce (Figure 1).

# Gender pay gap

Analysis based on median wages from LFS data from

21 countries showed health workers face gender-related

gaps in pay, with female health workers earning, on average,

28% less than males. This is slightly greater than global

estimates of gender pay gap data, showing that women are

paid approximately 22% less than men.7 The gender pay gap

among health workers can be explained by several factors:

different working hours between men and women (6.9%),

different occupations between men and women (9.9%),

and a remaining unexplainable gap of 11.2% for similar

# occupation and working hours (Figure 3).

A 13% pay gap for hourly wages was observed for physicians and a 12% pay gap for hourly wages for nurses

and midwifes. This suggests that a sizeable portion of the

overall pay gap is attributable to occupational segregation

within the sector. Projecting the changes in the health

## workforce distribution for physicians and nursing and

midwifery personnel indicates the 9.9% gap due to

occupational segregation will decrease to 7.0% over the

coming 20 years.

Gender equity in the health workforce: analysis of 104 countries

The remaining pay differential of 11.2% could be

attributable to a wide array of factors, including women’s

## underrepresentation in senior positions, fewer opportunities

for career advancement, and gender discrimination. Using

data from European countries, the analysis showed that male

physicians are more than twice as likely as females to be in

# the highest income category (Figure 4).8

# Decile

# Source: Data from LFS.

Divergent working places and conditions

LFS data from 56 countries showed higher average working

## hours per week for men than women for most occupations

and regions. This likely reflects different type of contracts,

with more part-time jobs occupied by women. On average, women work 4.2 hours fewer per week than men among

## physicians, 3.5 hours fewer per week for nursing and

## midwifery, 3.7 hours fewer per week for dentists, 4.6 hours

## fewer per week for pharmacists, and 3 hours fewer per

week for personal care workers. Census data showed similar

# patterns.

8 The likelihood for earning in the highest income category for men as compared with women was OR = 2.10 (95% CI: 1.83–2.40) for physicians; OR = 2.27 (95% CI: 1.76–2.93) for nursing and midwifery personnel; and OR = 3.38 (95% CI: 2.27–5.03) for personal care workers. (OR – odds ratio; CI – conﬁdence interval.)

## Data on the share of health workforce by sector (public

or private) indicate that for highly paid occupations, such

as physicians, men are more frequently employed in the

private sector than women (49.2% vs 39.2% respectively, P < 0.001). However, the contrary is the case for low paid jobs, such as personal care workers, where women are more

frequently employed by the private sector (53.0% vs 81.8% for men and women respectively, P < 0.001). This contrast illustrates a gender imbalance, with men more likely to

obtain private sector jobs in occupations where public sector

wage ceilings often exist, whereas women are more likely to

obtain lower paid private sector jobs, which tend to offer less

job security and favour part-time employment.

# Considerations for policy

Women represent around 70% of the health workforce,

but earn on average 28% less than men. Occupational

segregation (10%) and working hours (7%) can explain most

of this gap, but even when considering “equal work” an

“equal pay” gap of 11% remains. The trend of increasing

participation of women in highly paid occupations is

predicted to narrow this gap by 4% in the coming 20 years.

There is a window for policy to harness this momentum and

take concrete action to accelerate participation of women in

highly skilled health occupations. To achieve equal pay for

equal work, the 11% gap needs to be addressed. In line with

ILO’s Convention No. 100 (Equal Remuneration), ratified by

## 173 countries, labour rights against sexual discrimination

should be enforced to ensure equal remuneration for men

## and women workers for work of equal value.

Although not captured by the LFS data, it must be recognized

that much of the work in health done by women is unpaid

work. Investments in creating decent work in the health

sector can support the translation of informal work into

# formal sector employment.

Labour market policies should remove barriers to full-time

## employment for women, support career advancement

## and support gender parity in leadership positions. These

# G N K R O W

# I

measures need to form part of a gender transformative

policy that can push the health sector into a leading role in

empowering women and girls and achieving gender equality.

# Data sources and methods

## This new analysis of gender inequities in the health

workforce was made feasible by improved data availability

for various indicators from NHWA. The establishment of the

## Working for Health Inter Agency Data Exchange in 2018

enabled the generation of new evidence through analysis

of LFS micro-data from ILO and census micro-data from

the Integrated Public Use Microdata Series (IPUMS). It is recommended to continue the progressive implementation

## of the NHWA and expansion of partners and data sources

# through the Inter Agency Data Exchange.

Data from over 104 countries from 2000 to 2018 were

included in this analysis from NHWA data, which combines

country reported indicators, OECD statistics, LFS data

compiled by ILO, and census data compiled by IPUMS.

Micro-data were obtained through collaboration with ILO for

## LFS data and with IPUMS for census data. Micro-data from

LFS and census data were available for detailed analysis

and modelling. Occupations were coded using the current

## International Standard Classification of Occupations 2008

(ISCO-08). For occupations already coded in ISCO-88,

correspondence tables from ILO were used. The following

occupations were considered: medical doctors, nursing

## personnel, midwifery personnel, dentists, pharmacists and

# personal care workers.

## For all analysis except temporal trends, data from the

latest available year were included in the analysis. The

following indicators were used to assess gender topics:

## demography with age and sex distribution, temporal trends

## in the share of women, the gender pay gap from individually

reported earnings and from distribution of earnings in

deciles, individually reported hours of work per week, and

# employment in the private sector.
