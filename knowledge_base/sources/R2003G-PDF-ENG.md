## When new CEOs with a change mandate take over a company, they

typically invest time in reshaping its strategy and determining the kind

of culture needed to succeed. Those choices guide other decisions,

including who their senior managers will be and how the leaders will

allocate their time.

Most new CEOs pay little attention to a key factor that will help

determine their eﬀectiveness: the administrative system that guides day-to-day operations in their oﬃces. This system ensures that leaders

make the most of their limited time, that information arrives at the right

## point in their decision-making process, and that follow-up happens

without their having to check. Many new CEOs default to the system

they’ve inherited, even if it is poorly suited to their style or to the

operational changes they must make. Often there’s a better way to

handle the information ﬂow necessary for a CEO to succeed—and very

often a chief of staﬀ (CoS) can play an essential role.

During the 25 years I spent working at a consulting and software ﬁrm—a

dozen as chairman and CEO—I had a chief of staﬀ myself. As an adviser

and as a board member, I’ve recommended to several dozen executives

that they add the position to their teams—and in some cases I’ve helped

# them hire for and structure the job.

Although each leader should tailor the position to his or her own

needs, the CoS should handle several principal duties, all focused

on making time, information, and decision processes more eﬀective.

## Patrick Aylward, a vice president and CoS at Horizon Blue Cross Blue

Shield of New Jersey, breaks the job down into ﬁve roles: serving

as an air traffic controller for the leader and the senior team; as

an integrator connecting work streams that would otherwise remain

siloed; as a communicator linking the leadership team and the broader

## organization; as an honest broker and truth teller when the leader needs

## a wide-ranging view without turf considerations; and as a conﬁdant

without an organizational agenda. Aylward points out that “while a

CEO’s other direct reports typically emphasize their own areas, a good

CoS can consider the needs of the whole enterprise.”

The most sophisticated chiefs of staﬀ also assist CEOs in thinking

through and setting policies—and making sure they are implemented.

They anticipate problems and are especially sensitive to issues that

require diplomacy. They function as extra eyes and ears by pointing

out political potholes their bosses may not recognize (especially if the

bosses are new to the company). Importantly, a CoS acts with the

implicit imprimatur of the CEO—something that calls for humility,

# maturity, and situational sensitivity.

The CoS role is decidedly diﬀerent from that of the leader’s executive

assistant (EA). Unlike an EA, a chief of staﬀ works autonomously and

does not handle routine correspondence or manage the leader’s day-to-

day schedule. The highest-level CoS should be a full-ﬂedged member of

the senior leadership team, albeit without the rank or compensation of a C-suite oﬃcer.

Regardless of speciﬁc responsibilities, a CoS can help a leader achieve

sharp gains in productivity and impact. Take an executive I’ll call Joe,

who was promoted from head of sales and marketing to president of a

midsize company that had just been acquired—meaning that Joe was

now reporting to a chairman and CEO at a distant headquarters, adding

political complexity to the job. A few months in, he was struggling. “I

wasn’t myself,” he recalls. “I was a step slower. I was working longer

hours than I ever had but not getting as much done and not spending

time on what mattered most.”

A CoS’s primary duties make time, information, and decision-making more effective.

Joe hired a chief of staﬀ—someone who’d held that role at a larger

company in the same industry. Within three months Joe was better

prepared for meetings and more conﬁdent delegating (because he knew

that his CoS would follow up). Within six months his communications

to the organization were more frequent and clearer. He’d built a better

relationship with corporate headquarters. Perhaps most satisfying, he

had more time to think through big decisions, with the CoS serving as

his most reliable sounding board. “He’s the best listener of anyone who’s

ever worked for me,” Joe says. “It’s not that he gives me the answer but

that our discussions make the answer clearer.”

At some large companies, executives reporting to the CEO also choose

to have a CoS. One CHRO has employed ﬁve over the past 10 years (the

ﬁfth is still with him) while working at two Fortune 100 companies. “The

most visible beneﬁt for me has been time,” he says. “I’ve picked up a

third more time, and I’ve been able to get more done. Just as important

is that my chiefs of staﬀ created a system so that I can stay focused on

my CEO and board and still make sure that the day-to-day things don’t

fall by the wayside.” This executive treats the CoS role as a rotational one

lasting two to four years. It’s a coveted assignment because it’s typically

a springboard to a bigger job: Three of his prior chiefs of staﬀ went on to become the chief learning oﬃcer, the head of talent acquisition/

## planning and leadership development, and a senior manager in the

# compensation department.

# Is a Chief of Staff Right for You?

The CoS role originated in the military and government, and it dates

back centuries. Cicero, the Roman politician and orator, used a slave

named Tiro, who, according to Cicero’s biographer Zach Bankston,

served as a secretary, a ﬁnancial overseer, and a political strategist.

Andrew Roberts’s Napoleon: A Life describes the vital role that

Louis-Alexandre Berthier played in assisting Napoleon at the height

of his powers. The historians Ron Chernow and Joseph Ellis have

described the CoS-like role that Alexander Hamilton played for George

Washington. These people aren’t to be confused with the personal

secretaries or aides-de-camp that each leader also had. Rather, they

were close advisers who handled the most-delicate strategic matters and

became trusted conﬁdants.

Lately the CoS position has become more common in corporations.

## According to Tyler Parris, the author of Chief of Staff: The Strategic

## Partner Who Will Revolutionize Your Organization, 68,000 people held

## the CoS title in 2015 in nonmilitary, nongovernment organizations in

the United States—mostly large companies. Parris found that half the

companies use a rotational model in which high potentials are tapped

to spend a set period (typically two years) in the role and then move to

a line job. At companies that don’t use a rotational model, people often

# remain CoS for ﬁve years or more.

Not every executive needs a CoS, and the role is not right for every

corporate culture. Liza Wright, who served as the director of presidential

personnel in the White House for George W. Bush and later cofounded

a search ﬁrm specializing in hard-to-ﬁll jobs (including CoS), looks for

three signs that a CEO would beneﬁt from adding the role: concern

## about productivity, poor information ﬂow that results in slow decision-

making, and too much time spent on back-and-forth and follow-up. She

says, “If the leader is experiencing these areas of dissatisfaction, the

right kind of chief of staﬀ may well be the best solution.”

If you’re an executive looking to increase your eﬀectiveness, these seven

questions will help you decide whether a CoS might help you:

- Are you spending enough time on the vital A items on your agenda, or

are you frustrated by time spent on B and C items?

- Do you have enough “white space” in your calendar to consider future

opportunities, or is most of your time spent reacting to what has

already happened?

- As you deliberate on the decisions that only you can make, are you

getting the best available information? After you’ve made a call, do you

get surprised by new information that you should have known?

- Is it common for you to feel unprepared for important meetings

or when making important decisions? Do you get information soon

enough for you to think through the consequences before having to

# act?

- Are problems identiﬁed early enough that action can be taken before

they create damage, or is it common for large problems to occur

unexpectedly? When that happens, do you ﬁnd that some of your

senior people were also unprepared?

- Do political or cultural factors—such as relationship problems

## between powerful subordinates or destructive gamesmanship between

competing departments—block progress? Does the culture encourage

resistance to change or insulated silos rather than embracing new

ways to improve?

- When you direct that some action be taken or ask for data on a

particular issue, do you often not hear back until you remind people?

When managers say they will follow up, do you have conﬁdence that

# they will?

Even in these circumstances, some chief executives are reluctant to add

the CoS role. That may stem from unfamiliarity: Without ever having seen a skilled CoS in action, it can be diﬃcult to envision the value one

can add. Sometimes reluctance is more about optics and concern that a

CoS will make the leader seem imperious or desirous of an “entourage.”

Those considerations are understandable. But when set up in the right

way, a CoS position can make it much easier to solve the problems

facing a leader with a change agenda.

# Shaping the Job to Fit the Need

My observations of how this position has evolved in business

organizations suggest that it entails three levels of responsibility.

Level 1. A CoS at level one has typically been promoted from an

executive assistant role. An example is Susan, who was the more senior

of two EAs to the CEO of a large energy-related corporation before she

became his CoS. Her replacement as senior EA and the other assistant

now report to her. In addition to overseeing use of the CEO’s time

and ensuring his focus on the most important issues, she manages

## special projects for the CFO and the head of human resources. She

also prepares prework, handles follow-up, and sits in on most board

meetings. Susan has worked at this company for almost 20 years, under

three chief executives, and she understands the culture. She has good

project-management skills, is well regarded by each of the CEO’s direct

reports, and was underutilized in her EA job.

Level 2. Greg is typical of a level two CoS. He joined a large life sciences

company as chief of staﬀ after earning a PhD and an MBA from top

programs and then working for a strategy consulting company, where

his current boss was a client. Greg works closely with the heads of

business development and R&D on alliances and acquisition projects, and with the chief human resources oﬃcer on ﬁnding scientiﬁc talent.

Much of Greg’s time is spent helping manage relationships with the

company’s scientiﬁc partners and studying the forces that have an

## eﬀect on the company’s strategy, such as academic research, medical

advances, and the activity of competitors. He also interacts with

regulatory agencies regarding approval of the company’s emerging

products. Greg has no direct reports, but he does have important

responsibilities and a constantly changing portfolio of projects that

# require sophisticated skills.

Level 3. Chiefs of staﬀ at level three are typically found in large, complex

organizations facing the need for dramatic strategic, operational, and

cultural change, especially when the leader is new to the top post. This

role is closest to the inﬂuential CoS jobs common in government and

the military. It is exempliﬁed by someone I’ll call Carol.

After earning degrees in economics, psychology, and management,

Carol spent 12 years in a multinational technology and operations-

improvement consulting ﬁrm specializing in the integration of

acquisitions and the management of alliances. That was followed by

## several years at a global corporation as a division president’s CoS and

the head of its planning and analysis departments. She was then hired

as a CoS for the new CEO of a large and growing technology provider.

In that role Carol manages the oﬃce of the CEO and is responsible

for ensuring the execution of her agenda—a job that includes time

management, ﬂow of information to and from the CEO, and seeing that

the CEO is always prepared and rarely surprised. Carol also coordinates

## special projects and drafts presentations and other materials for board

meetings, investor conferences, and employee town halls. She runs an

analysis/program management unit and is involved in alliances and

acquisitions, often working closely with the heads of strategy, M&A, HR,

and the company’s innovation center. She is a member of the executive

committee, which oﬀers her an opportunity to build relationships and

credibility with other direct reports to the CEO. Carol has earned

the CEO’s trust, becoming an important internal adviser and “honest

broker” who presents both sides of complex issues while maintaining

# objectivity.

The tasks done at levels one and two are not new; what is new is that

the people doing them are increasingly being given the title chief of

staﬀ. The level three role is a relatively recent development in business.

Carol’s work is distinguished from Susan’s and Greg’s by its depth and

because she works on the company’s top priorities, at its strategic core.

Another diﬀerence: Carol spends two or three hours a week one-on-one

with the CEO and often travels with her. (Greg and Susan, in contrast,

may meet with their CEOs for just two or three hours a month and don’t

# travel with them.)

A good CoS knows which relationships are most important to the leader’s agenda.

Another distinguishing factor is where each job is likely to lead. Susan’s

next step could be a managerial position in either ﬁnancial planning

or the beneﬁts department. Greg will probably move to a district

manager’s job for ﬁeld experience and then go on to head up strategy

or business development. Carol’s career path could move through senior

marketing or operations positions and might eventually lead to chief operating oﬃcer.

Whether a CEO requires a level one, two, or three CoS depends on a

number of things. If the leader enjoys a stable environment, needs help

mostly with time management and information ﬂows, and perhaps has

an experienced EA who is ready to handle more responsibility, level

one may be the right choice. A new-to-the-organization CEO who is

facing more-complex challenges—such as implementing a new strategy

or a cultural transformation while simultaneously driving short-term

## operational results in a volatile industry—will most likely beneﬁt from a

level three CoS. CEOs whose situation falls somewhere in between and

who need research, analysis, and program management might consider

# level two.

There are considerations beyond context, however. Which level of

responsibility a CoS should have depends as well on the skills and

ambition of the person hired for the role and the chemistry and trust

that develop between the CoS and the CEO. In some cases a level two

CoS may evolve to level three duties over time as trust and abilities

develop and the relationship deepens.

Each level requires the same handful of foundational abilities. One

is well-developed project-management skills: being organized and

disciplined, showing attention to detail, and following up doggedly

to ensure the right results. Another is business savvy, including an

## understanding of the marketplace, competitors, and technology and

what is required for sustained operating results. A third is the ability to

see what pressures the leader faces in pushing the company to change

and to ﬁnd ways to lessen them. A fourth is the ability to recognize

which relationships are most important to the success of the leader’s

agenda so as to assist in strengthening them. Finally, communication

skills are crucial, because the CoS must help reﬁne the leader’s message

and ensure that it is understood by the right audiences. (This is why

many governmental chiefs of staﬀ are former speechwriters.)

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Case for a Chief of Staff

Leaders who are new to an organization—with or without a mandate to

create signiﬁcant change—will require even more from a CoS: the ability

to envision the culture that the CEO wants to create and a sophisticated

## mix of emotional intelligence, judgment, discretion, diplomacy, and

political acumen, which enables the CoS to interact with powerful direct

## reports to the CEO and board members with conﬁdence and poise.

Because of the added responsibilities required of a level three CoS,

it is crucial that onboarding include a careful review of the culture,

including who has inﬂuence and why, the leader’s style and personality,

and the board’s expectations for change.

When ﬁrst establishing the CoS position, it is also important to prepare

the organization. The CEO’s executive assistant should understand the

CoS role, because she or he sits upstream in the ﬂow of information and

will continue to handle routine duties that support the chief of staﬀ’s

activities. More critical is ensuring that the leader’s other direct reports

understand why the role was created, how they and the company will

beneﬁt from it, and what the CEO expects from them in terms of

support. If these issues are ignored, adding a CoS can upset the balance

of working relationships at the most senior level of the company—a

place where status, power, and access are always delicate matters and

are carefully calibrated.

Two ﬁnal factors will determine whether incorporating a CoS into the chief executive’s oﬃce will improve things. First, is the leader willing

to make some changes to his or her routine once the chief of staﬀ is

aboard? If the CEO is used to being his or her own chief of staﬀ and

continues to act in that way after hiring one, not even the best aide will

succeed. Second, will the two of them have a relationship that allows

the eﬀective giving and receiving of feedback? From the very outset,

the CEO should make a deal with the new CoS: If she hones her ability

to give feedback, the CEO will be open to it and listen carefully. The

relationship that results will improve performance and satisfaction for

Everyone requires help to achieve his or her highest potential and to
