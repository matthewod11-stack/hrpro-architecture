## On May 11, the U.S. Covid-19 Public Health Emergency oﬃcially

expires. But if you’re like most of the working parents in my coaching

practice, what hasn’t yet expired are many of the perspectives and day-

to-day practices that got you through the pandemic.

## Amidst the unprecedented pressures of the past three years, all of us

who are combining career and kids had to use new moves, and a lot of

them, in order to “make it work.” Maybe you and your partner learned

to alternate shifts on the days daycare was closed, or you led oﬀ each

Zoom call with a disclaimer that the baby was in the background — and

# so on.

Some of these hacks continue to serve us well. Maybe thousands

of Zoom-call disclaimers later, you’ve gotten comfortable discussing

family responsibilities with colleagues and feel more authentic on the

job. Or maybe continuing to work remotely, at least part time, allows

you to stay more involved in the kids’ school activities than you ever

could have while commuting ﬁve days a week. And certain practical

pandemic-era solutions (think: virtual parent-teacher conferences) are

so working parent–friendly that we’d all do well to keep them.

At the same time, many of our Covid-era routines and beliefs aren’t

helping us anymore. In fact, some of these practical and mental moves,

now deeply embedded in our muscle memory, are actually making it

harder for us to do what we really want: to succeed in our careers, while

being loving and present caregivers, and staying healthy, whole, and

# ourselves in the process.

In order to set yourself up for success in combining career and children

going forward, I want you to challenge that muscle memory a little.

You’ve likely already done some deliberate, careful thinking about how

to take the good from the pandemic era, homing in on the routines

## and behaviors (like those more regular family mealtimes) you absolutely

want to keep. Now, try going one step further and ask yourself: What

isn’t serving me anymore?

To spur along that thinking, let’s get speciﬁc. Below are four diﬀerent

pandemic-era working-parent habits and perspectives that I see many

moms and dads holding onto — and that you may be also, even at

personal or professional cost. Scan the list and observe which ones land

for you. For each one, I’ll then share a low-stakes but eﬀective way for

you to reset: to tweak and update that particular habit or perspective so

that it can work better for you going forward.

## Four Pandemic-Era Habits and Perspectives

- 1. Making do with limited childcare.

Throughout the Covid crisis, many or most of us had to work full

time while simultaneously parenting full time, and that was downright

heroic. But somewhere along the way, what was once heroic became

normalized, and even expected. The fact that we survived without

regular or reliable daycare morphed into a creeping feeling that I should

be able to function without too much help, or worse, congealed into a

belief that good parenting means using as little care as I can.

As a result, many of us are now either seeking less help than we actually

need or feeling guilty when we do. As one of my new working-mother

clients — a corporate ﬁnance executive — recently told me, “The baby

should be with me throughout her ﬁrst year. And if other parents

managed to get through without care during the pandemic, I can

too!” This previously high-performing professional, now attempting to

simultaneously care for her baby and her company’s budgeting process,

was referred to me when, unsurprisingly, her work quality began to slip

and, by her own admission, she was rapidly nearing burnout.

Her particular case may be pronounced, but do you recognize a bit of

yourself in it, or are you being bullied by your own childcare shoulds?

New Move: Make prudent, ongoing decisions about the childcare you really need.

Instead of holding yourself to unrealistic standards borne of a wartime

environment, ask yourself: What care arrangement do I need today in

order to do my job effectively? Maybe that means having the kids stay

in the school aftercare program two days a week so you can make it to

in-person sales calls, or maybe now that your partner is back at work

full time, you decide to extend the nanny-share arrangement to cover

# Fridays as well.

There’s no right or wrong here, and diﬀerent care arrangements work

for each family. The point, however, is to get away from being chained

to unrealistic standards and to start proactively managing toward

current needs. And no, getting adequate care doesn’t make you a bad

or negligent parent. It means that when you’re with your kids, you can

be with them — and not frazzled, ground down, and/or trying to do a

demanding job at the same time.

- 2. Seeing remote work as The Answer.

You worked at home for two-plus years and never missed a Zoom call,

much less a deadline. Now, your company is pushing for a return to

the oﬃce…and it feels as if you’re being asked to relinquish the single

precious tool that makes being a working parent possible.

New Move: Think as broadly and creatively as possible about the ﬂex arrangement that will work for you.

Remote work was a godsend during the pandemic, and it may still be

a powerful, core tool in your working-parent arsenal — but it’s not the

only one. If a key goal is to be available to your kids during evening

homework time, perhaps shifting your hours or working a compressed

schedule could do the trick instead. Or maybe other, more structural

changes are what’s really called for at this point in your life and career

— for example, a job-sharing arrangement could allow you two full days oﬀ per week. The more expansive your thinking, the more likely you are

to be able to craft the speciﬁc working-parent life you want.

- 3. Getting through today.

Schools were closed, work was endless, and the isolation was draining.

And to hoard what little energy you had left, you learned to take life one

day at a time. Goals? No — life was about getting through til 5 PM.

New Move: Actively imagine the bigger picture and longer term. Short-term thinking is an eﬀective self-preservation maneuver during

a crisis. But if it’s still your go-to move, then you’re doing yourself a

disservice, making life tougher and more daunting than it needs to be.

Instead, try opening up the aperture. If you can create a mental picture

of where you want to be professionally, personally, and as a parent years

from now, it will make the responsibilities of working parenthood look

much more feasible today. With a speciﬁc positive outcome in mind —

an outcome that you’ve chosen — all the smaller, daily decisions you

face will become more straightforward, and you’ll have the satisfaction

of knowing that all the hard work you’re putting in right now is serving

an important purpose. With a sense of momentum toward that goal,

you’ll also feel more energetic and motivated. If, for example, you know

that you want to one day lead this division, while remaining the central

adult in my children’s lives, then you’ll feel much more “together” than if

you simply try to endure whatever stresses and strains come hurtling at

# you in any 24-hour period.

Don’t have that “success picture” in mind? Not to worry. Simply spend

some time mulling what you want your career and family life to be life

a few years from now, and observing other working parents you admire.

Over time, your working-parent goals will naturally begin to crystallize.

- 4. Framing work as the enemy.

Your son bursts into the background of a Zoom call or starts vying for

your attention while you’re reading an urgent message from your boss

— and you snap, “Not now! Daddy has work to do!” Or on mornings

you have to be in the oﬃce, you remind the kids that “Mommy won’t be

## home for dinner tonight” with a heavy sigh.

## New Move: Discuss work in a positive way with your kids.

When work and home-life responsibilities clash, as they did so often

and starkly throughout the pandemic, it’s natural to view and talk about

them in oppositional terms. And you’re only human, after all: Your

boss’s message is stressful to read, or you’re disappointed about missing

# dinner.

But try ﬂipping things around and seeing them from your kids’

perspective. They’ve watched you quite closely these past few years.

They’ve seen your tension and disappointments and witnessed your

short fuse. As you nurture them toward their own eventual adulthoods,

are those really the feelings and attitudes you want them to associate

# with work and career?

There’s no need to talk about work in purely rosy terms, but think

about updating your script a bit. Say, “Mom is going to work” instead

of “Mom has to go to work” — or talk with the kids about a recent work

success, or a moment you were proud of, or what drew you into your

ﬁeld or function in the ﬁrst place. Let them see some of the upsides and

satisfaction you ﬁnd in your work so they can start imagining their own.

As you read over this list, what resonated? Jot down your ideas, or bounce them oﬀ your partner or a few trusted friends. And then broaden

the frame further. Ask yourself what other pandemic-era habits you

want to hold onto ﬁrmly, forever — and which to pivot away from,

starting today. Trust your instincts. This is your life and career and

family, and you know what works. As you iterate and reﬁne your

thinking, what will emerge is your new, unique playbook — not for

surviving as a working parent in a crisis, but for thriving now, and in the

# future.
