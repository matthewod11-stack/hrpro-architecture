A common misperception about the CEO’s role is that they are the

ultimate decision-maker, and that the prize of getting this coveted

position is that you now get to make all the decisions. In reality, the

CEO’s role is much more about shaping rather than making decisions.

There’s a fundamental reason for this subtle diﬀerence. Organizations

face countless decisions daily, and it would be impossible for a CEO

to be involved in each one. Attempting to do so would slow down the

entire operation and could even bring it to a standstill. As a result,

rather than making decisions directly, the proper role of the CEO is

to enable others to make decisions the CEO can support. Of course,

there are times when the CEO must be the ultimate decision-maker,

but the CEO’s approach should be inspired by Occam’s razor: The fewer

decisions the CEO can make, the better.

CEOs have several tools at their disposal to shape decisions in their

organizations. Some are at the level of the organization as a whole. CEOs

can shape decisions by aligning everyone around a shared purpose,

articulating priorities, and setting goals. Decisions are also shaped by

developing a clear strategy, adopting an organization structure that

allows for the proper distribution of responsibilities, and fostering a

## strong culture. A clear performance measurement and reward system

can also help.

Even as they build the broader context that shapes decisions across

the organization, CEOs cannot step away from decision-making entirely.

Indeed, they must choose where and how they personally engage in

# decision-making.

The decision-making landscape in any organization is vast. A useful

map is to think of categories of decisions on one axis (e.g.,

## strategy, structure, culture, people, products, investments, etc.) and

the organizational level at which decisions need to be made on the

other axis (e.g., corporate, business unit, region, function, subsidiary, plant, oﬃce, etc.). CEOs must choose how to personally engage to

shape decisions across this entire landscape. This involves, at each

intersection of category and level, determining the extent to which they

are involved in designing the decision-making process, choosing when

to participate directly, monitoring the work, and creating clarity around

when and by whom a decision will be made. This framework is based on

the 25 years I have spent alongside colleagues teaching CEO workshops

at Harvard Business School, as well as my own experience leading

organizations and advising CEOs as a board member and advisor.

# Designing the Process

CEOs can inﬂuence any decision by thoughtfully designing the

decision-making process. This involves setting parameters such as who

is to be involved, what questions to answer, what kinds of information

to gather, what guardrails to keep in mind, how many meetings to

have, the structure of the discussions, and what gets decided when and

by whom. The CEO may play a major role in designing some decision-

making processes and a lighter role in others.

For example, a CEO we studied was heavily involved in designing the

process for making key portfolio choices, such as keeping, divesting,

and acquiring businesses. Working with his direct reports and a small

group of high-potential managers, he deﬁned the metrics against

which to evaluate each business, chose a set of rivals to benchmark

performance against, set a time frame of three months to complete the

analysis, and established weekly three-hour meetings during which the

team reviewed progress and agreed on next steps.

The same CEO delegated to his CFO and CHRO the task of preparing

recommendations for structural changes that would result in cost-

reduction goals in shared services such as HR, IT, and ﬁnance. Other

than specifying that he wanted the two to work together to identify cost

savings exceeding 15%, he gave them full leeway to design a process to

# generate these recommendations.

These two examples illustrate the intentionality CEOs must bring to

these design choices. Depending on the speciﬁc matter they want

to inﬂuence, they must choose the various parameters (e.g., who to

task, what goals/metrics to set, what time frame to establish, and

what expectations to create), and identify which issues they want to

personally be involved in, and which others they are happy to delegate

and trust others to make.

Participating in the Process

CEOs must then choose how much they want to participate at various

stages of the decision-making process. The CEO may be active at every

step, check in from time to time, or get engaged at a speciﬁc point, such

# as the beginning, middle, or end.

CEOs’ choices about when and how to personally step into decision-

making situations often reﬂects their desire to make their teams active

participants in the decision, as a way to increase buy-in. If you watch

CEOs in these settings, what’s striking is how many of their actions

are aimed at guiding others toward a decision, instead of overtly

inﬂuencing the decision in a way that may feel heavy-handed. They

provide this guidance by challenging the process, raising the bar, asking

tough questions, and demanding better answers. Even though the CEOs

are involved, they are careful to leave actual decision-making to their

# colleagues.

For example, the CEO who designed the strategic portfolio review

process attended ﬁve of the 12 meetings. He attended the ﬁrst two to

set the right tone and direction. He then allowed the team to do its

homework. He did one check-in in the middle of the process to ensure

things were on track. Finally, he re-engaged by attending the last two

meetings when the group presented its recommendations.

In contrast, on the cost-cutting workstream, he attended no meetings

and instead asked the CFO and CHRO to brief him on their progress and

to seek his input whenever they felt it would be helpful.

## The level of personal participation CEOs choose in situations such

as these reﬂect how tightly they want to manage each process, the

importance they attach to the decision, the level of conﬁdence they

have in the leaders involved in each case, and how costly they feel it

would be to intervene and change course as the process unfolds.

# Monitoring the Work

CEOs must also choose how much they want to be personally engaged

in monitoring the work. Providing feedback as any decision-making

process unfolds is a vital element of the CEO’s role. In the case of

periodic reviews, CEOs describe themselves as monitors who must

check to ensure things are on track and that the organization is

executing as planned. Sometimes, CEOs describe their role as a

coach, educating people, providing constructive feedback, and helping

improve performance while doing little to actually inﬂuence the ﬁnal

# decision under discussion.

By monitoring decision-making processes personally, CEOs set

standards, encourage alignment, and enable course correction. In some

cases, the CEO may meet regularly with the team to monitor progress.

In others, they may only check in occasionally to ensure things are on

# track.

A key choice while monitoring decision-making processes is the

altitude, or level of granularity, at which the CEO wants to engage. CEOs

can choose to engage at a high level or dig deeply into the details.

Some CEOs set these altitude expectations in advance; others choose

them strategically in real time to keep the team alert and prepared to

engage with them at any altitude they choose. Although the team may

experience this as inconsistency or unpredictability, imagine yourself

in this position: Might you prepare more thoroughly for a series of

meetings if you know the CEO might ask questions that range from the

## big picture to the most nitty-gritty details?

# Making the Decision

For some matters, such as setting the overall performance targets of the

company, the CEO may be the principal decision-maker, choosing to

make the ﬁnal call after a set of recommendations have been presented.

In other situations, the CEO may choose to consult with a small group of

key executives and board members, as in the case of M&A deals, or while

selecting top management team members. In other situations, such as

formulating a business unit’s strategy, the CEO may let others, such as

the business unit heads, make decisions, and then endorse them. In yet

other circumstances, such as deciding which R&D projects the company

should pursue, although the CEO may participate at some stage to better

understand the choices under consideration, the CEO may delegate the

ﬁnal decision to a senior manager such as the head of R&D, because the

CEO may lack the technical expertise to weigh in.

## Factors to Consider in Choosing How Much to be Engaged

CEOs often use various criteria to determine the level of personal

involvement they have across the decision-making landscape. These

include the decision’s strategic importance: Does it matter for the

CEO’s key priorities and have long-term implications for the company’s

direction, vision, or mission? High-level strategy decisions almost

always warrant the CEO’s direct engagement. Other factors that may

inﬂuence the CEO’s involvement include the decision’s impact on

the company’s ﬁnancial health, either in terms of revenue, costs, or

proﬁtability; or the risk associated with the decision, either in terms of

## potential loss, legal implications, or harm to the company’s reputation.

If a decision involves the allocation or reallocation of signiﬁcant

resources — like capital investments or human resources — it may

# warrant CEO oversight.

CEOs may also factor the extent to which the decision impacts the

company’s core values and ethics. Any decision that could challenge or

redeﬁne these values require greater CEO involvement. Decisions that

set a precedent for future company actions or policies often also require

# CEO engagement.

If a decision spans across multiple segments of the organization or has

the potential to lead to signiﬁcant internal disagreement or conﬂict,

the CEO should get more involved and consider making the ﬁnal

call. Decisions that will notably impact key stakeholders — including

shareholders, major customers, regulators — might also draw the CEO’s

attention. Urgent decisions, especially those that must be made rapidly

to address immediate challenges or capitalize on opportunities, may

warrant the CEO’s prompt attention.

Although CEOs tend to focus on these more signiﬁcant decisions, some

CEOs wisely note that they ﬁnd beneﬁt from periodically involving

## themselves directly in decision-making on smaller issues or at lower

levels in the organization. For example, the CEO may engage with

some decisions far removed from the top, such as the strategy for

a ﬂedgling business unit or the design of an executive development

program, because they want to signal its importance to the company.

These symbolic opportunities for engagement can be just as important

as the more substantive matters that warrant the CEO’s involvement.

Decision-making isn’t the only activity in which a CEO must make

## conscious choices about the right level of personal involvement. CEOs

must be strategic about when to personally engage with customers,

## investors, regulators, the media, and other stakeholders. They must

decide which senior roles require an interview with the CEO as part of

the hiring process. They must decide when and how often to engage

## with individual directors in one-on-one conversations between full

board meetings. Making the right choices about the level of personal

involvement is key to a CEO’s overall eﬀectiveness.

In conclusion, the role of the CEO is not about making every decision,

but rather about creating an environment in which decisions are

made eﬀectively. By shaping decisions rather than making them, CEOs

empower their teams, foster agility, and drive the organization toward

success. The CEO is more of a conductor, orchestrating the many parts

to produce harmonious results, than a dictator issuing commands. It’s a

shift in perspective that is required when leaders assume this pinnacle

position and can be transformative for many leaders and organizations

# alike.
