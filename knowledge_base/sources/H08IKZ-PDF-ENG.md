AI’s rapid advancement has ignited enthusiasm about its potential to

revolutionize corporate decision-making by substituting for expensive,

fallible humans. But it’s naïve to believe that by gathering ever more

data and feeding it to ever more powerful algorithms alone, businesses

can uncover the truth, make the right decisions, and create value. We

call this false belief “dataism.”

Decisions are not merely exercises in data aggregation and algorithmic

analysis. They necessarily involve many additional nuanced elements,

such as selecting trustworthy data sources, employing imagination to

envision possibilities beyond available facts, and judging the feasibility

of solutions. These are areas where humans have innate advantages

over machines. Crucially, these involve implicit and often untrained

# human capabilities.

Consider the case of Kodak and Fuji. Both companies had access to the

same data indicating the rise of digital photography, and they evaluated

it subject to the same objectives of maximizing growth and proﬁtability.

Still, they came to diﬀerent decisions: Kodak doubled down on its

analog products, while Fuji diversiﬁed, investing in digital technologies

and pursuing other options like cosmetics, which collectively were suﬃcient to ensure its survival. The same data inspired yet another

decision for Sony, which, as a challenger in the market, saw the rise

digital photography as an opportunity worth embracing.

This divergence underscores that decisions depend on interpretation,

## context, and strategic framing — areas where human judgment will

remain crucial.

# A Holistic View of Decision-Making

Based on our experience with corporate decision-making, as well as the

## literature on decision science (for example, from the military, health

care, and R&D), we have identiﬁed eight dimensions beyond data

and algorithms that factor into most decisions, albeit often implicitly.

They can be understood by walking through the simple example of

purchasing a car.

- 1. Deﬁning the ultimate goal.

Every decision ultimately serves a human end. Specifying this is crucial

to understanding what success might look like. The human end for a car

buyer might be signaling their status with a luxury vehicle, or ensuring

their children have a safe way to travel to and from school.

Businesses too have ultimate goals — from achieving economic

prosperity to contributing to society to protecting the environment —

which can diﬀer markedly. Given the subjectivity of human values,

deﬁning the human end cannot be outsourced to machine intelligence.

- 2. Framing the immediate objectives.

To achieve your ultimate goal, you often have to make smaller, more

immediate, and tangible decisions along the way. In our car-buying

example, the ultimate goal may be to purchase a vehicle that meets

certain safety standards, but you also want to make sure that the car

ﬁts within a given budget. For a business, the ultimate goal might be

to achieve 10% sales growth over the previous year, but you also have

to ensure that optimizing short-term sales growth doesn’t compromise

# long-term brand reputation.

This kind of decision framing cannot be derived from data and

analytic tools alone since it involves trading oﬀ individual and

collective preferences. Human involvement is crucial in identifying

these objectives and balancing them. Quite often, they need to be

reﬁned through iterative interactions, as humans often discover “what

they really want” by pursuing an objective and adjusting as they

## discover new features and new sources of value.

- 3. Charting the realm of the possible.

Once the objectives are deﬁned, it’s time to identify possible options.

While data is a crucial input for this step, it will not usually tell the

full story. Data is retrospective but human decisions are often based on

counterfactuals: what might happen, and how we could inﬂuence the

likelihood of diﬀerent possibilities playing out.

Human imagination is crucial to extending the realm of the possible.

For example, if the need driving a car buyer is a short commute to work,

they might consider alternatives like public transportation, ride-sharing

# services, or electric scooters.

All ﬁrms are built on an act of imagination. For instance, Airbnb’s

founders envisioned a platform where homeowners could rent out spare

rooms — upending the belief of leading hospitality companies that

you had to build or own the accommodations oﬀered to customers.

This idea didn’t emerge from analysis of existing hospitality data, but

from humans imagining how they could address the need for aﬀordable

# lodging.

- 4. Selecting data sources.

Assessing your options can beneﬁt from relevant data. But even though

the word data derives from the Latin “datum” (something that is given),

data needs to be created: captured, ﬁltered, selected, interpreted and

corrected — a task that requires human agency and discernment.

We must avoid the trap of focusing only on given or easily

accessible data. In our car-purchasing scenario, relying solely on manufacturer-provided fuel-eﬃciency data may not provide the

complete picture. Supplementing this with independent reviews of real-

world performance can lead to a more informed decision.

In business, think of the ease with which we can query current

## customers on their satisfaction with our oﬀerings — and of the

additional insights gained speaking to non-customers about why they

are choosing a competitor’s services or not choosing any service at all.

Moreover, not all valuable information is quantiﬁable. For a car, factors

like comfort, aesthetics, or driving experience are subjective. We need

to identify proxies for these qualitative aspects or gather ﬁrsthand

experience to ﬁll in the gaps. For example, Procter & Gamble developed

## the Swiﬀer after ethnographic studies (observations of consumers in

their homes) identiﬁed a desire for more convenient cleaning methods

— information that could not be gleaned from existing quantitative

# datasets.

- 5. Establishing trustworthiness.

In an era where misinformation can spread rapidly, establishing the

credibility of data sources is more critical than ever. AI systems lack

this ability. Humans, on the other hand, can evaluate the reputation,

## expertise, and potential incentives or biases of information providers.

For example, in the car-buying process, a buyer might trust

## recommendations from friends or family over advertisements from

manufacturers. In business, assessing the incentives and credibility

of diﬀerent data sources ensures that decisions are based on reliable

# information.

- 6. Choosing a decision algorithm.

While many AI products are marketed as being universally useful,

mathematics has shown that no single optimization algorithm can

be superior across all problems. Thus, humans must decide which

## decision-making framework aligns best with their objectives.

In the car example, a cost-focused buyer might use a tool that calculates

life-cycle-ownership costs, while another buyer who prioritizes

aesthetics might choose a very diﬀerent approach. Some buyers may

forego the expected value of perfect computation and opt for a fast and

frugal set of heuristics, and another may prefer an exhaustive search

# process.

- 7. Assessing competitiveness.

When purchasing a car, solving the functional problem — i.e., choosing a practical option that satisﬁes your objectives — may be suﬃcient,

unless, of course, you are competing for status with your neighbors

or classmates. In business, the ideal solution usually needs to be

competitively advantageous by being robust to competitors’ likely

responses and hard for others to imitate. Using the same data and

algorithms your competitors have access to, to solve the same problems

they face, will not reveal unique or superior opportunities. Rather,

it is tantamount to commoditizing one’s business by using a generic

# problem-solving process.

Human strategists play a vital role in assessing the competitive

implications of decisions by understanding the incentives, advantages,

mindsets, and behavioral patterns of competitors. For example, Apple’s

success with the iPhone was not merely driven by incorporating the

## most advanced technology, but also by the company’s emphasis on

## design aesthetics, user experience, and ecosystem integration.

- 8. Incorporating ethical considerations.

## The functionally, economically, or competitively superior solution may

not be ethically acceptable. Humans are responsible for ensuring that

decisions adhere to ethical norms and societal values. This requires

the application of models and principles of moral reasoning to the

speciﬁc interpersonal and social context of the decision — which is also

# a quintessentially human ability.

In the car-purchase example, a buyer might consider the environmental

impact of their choice, opting for an electric vehicle over a gasoline-

powered one, even if it costs more.

## New Rules for Human-Led, AI-Supported Decision-Making

## Many crucial aspects of decision-making lie beyond the realms of data

## and algorithms. Indeed, the spread of more powerful tools and larger

datasets will likely make the human elements of decision-making more

# diﬀerentiating.

However, human capabilities, like making moral judgments, and using

imagination or intuition, are often untrained, impulsive, or implicit.

Thus, to distinguish and elevate their decision-making processes,

organizations need to actively codify and foster the requisite human

decision-making skills. We outline ﬁve imperatives towards this end.

# Reject simplistic dataism.

Leaders should acknowledge that eﬀective decision-making

## encompasses more than data analysis and algorithmic optimization.

This does not mean abandoning AI tools and techniques — it means

integrating AI in a more holistic, human-led process. The emerging

discipline of designing and deploying bespoke AI agents jointly shaped

## by human acts of interpretation and imagination and the computational

and informational resources of large language models oﬀers one path

# forward.

Ensure that problem-solvers get their hands dirty.

Just as pilots practice manual ﬂying to keep their skills sharp despite

the availability of autopilot systems, business leaders should immerse

themselves in the underlying phenomena of their industries to prevent

over-reliance on AI and maintain critical decision-making skills. This

## entails direct engagement with customers, employees, competitors, and

# regulators.

For example, Toyota’s “Genchi Genbutsu” philosophy, meaning “go

and see for yourself,” encourages managers to visit the shop ﬂoor to observe processes ﬁrsthand. This practice helps identify ineﬃciencies

and fosters a deeper understanding that data alone cannot provide.

Make implicit human decision-making skills explicit.

Human decisions are often shaped by intuition — our powerful,

unconscious intelligence that’s based on our experience and heuristics.

Companies can help employees develop their intuition through

acknowledging and fostering experiential learning and having decision

markers participants reﬂect on questions like:

- What was my initial reaction or gut feeling?

- Where did I rely on individual or collective experience?

- Where did I supplement my experience or expertise?

- What mental shortcuts did I rely on to simplify the decision?

Another uniquely human skill is imagination — the ability to come up

with what does not yet exist, but could. While often believed to be the

## result of uncontrollable strokes of genius, organizations can actually

systematically harness imagination through tactics like seeking out

anomalies (rather than focusing on averages), questioning previously

held assumptions, and conducting experiments.

Foster an environment where human skills can thrive. It may be diﬃcult for intuition and imagination to shine in a

technocratic culture dominated by rational justiﬁcation. To create

an environment that promotes unique human decision-making skills,

organizations must begin with a culture of psychological safety in which

employees can express diverse perspectives, debate ideas openly, and

challenge the status quo.

# Build hybrid decision-making systems.

With human skills appropriately honed, leaders must set about

rebuilding decision-making systems that combine the best of human

# and AI capabilities.

This may involve segmenting decision-making tasks, such as data

## processing, pattern recognition, and optimization for quantiﬁable

criteria, best suited for AI from those requiring human judgment, like

setting objectives and considering ethics, values, and context.

The pumpkin spice latte, one of Starbucks’ most successful products,

is an example of human decision-makers taking the lead and

leveraging their understanding of context. While initial tests showed

that customers preferred the taste of chocolate or caramel-ﬂavored

products, the product developers believed that for a seasonal special,

uniqueness was even more important than taste. In subsequent studies,

they gathered information on this criterion, where the pumpkin ﬂavor

excelled.

There will also be tasks where human and machine intelligence

intersect and cooperate, forming what might be called a bionic

organization in which humans review AI-generated solutions to assess

## their feasibility, as well as ethical and competitive implications.

Consider Netﬂix, which is famous for making production choices based

on its vast trove of viewership data. Its decision to create the chart-

topping show Stranger Things may have been driven by an observation

that content dealing with supernatural themes performed well, or the

enduring popularity of 1980s shows. However, Netﬂix also had to make

several bets driven by intuition, such as hiring a pair of unproven

showrunners that would inject their own vision or taking a chance on

# a set of inexperienced child actors.

. . .

As AI grows ever more capable, the belief — or fear — that it can

substitute for human decision-making grows more prevalent. However,

decisions entail more than data collection and analysis — and humans

have innate advantages over even the most powerful AI in these

## domains. Thus, the rise of AI presents an opportunity for humans to

step up to the challenge of reﬁning, emphasizing, and applying our own

human strengths to diﬀerentiate corporate decision-making.
