## In October 2021, Delta Air Lines CEO Ed Bastian noted a signiﬁcant

shift in the airline’s workforce as it emerged from the Covid-19

pandemic. Speaking to investors, he called it a juniority beneﬁt. “Many

of our most experienced employees have chosen to retire, and that’s

opened up opportunities for younger people,” he said, framing the

change as advantageous for the company. But juniority beneﬁts were

# not without costs.

Delta, like other airlines, struggled to bring its new employees up

to speed. “The chief issue we’re working through is not hiring but

a training and experience bubble,” said Bastian in an earnings call

months later. Bastian emphasized the complex work of airlines, calling

attention to “a pretty big learning curve” for people new to their role.

“You don’t step into these jobs and learn [them] overnight,” he said.

The challenge is not unique to Delta. Across industries, from

manufacturing to health care, the luxury of waiting years to beneﬁt

from new talent is long gone. Thriving in today’s dynamic economy

means bringing new hires up the learning curve faster than ever. Yet,

our latest research suggests one catalyst for learning is often lacking

when it’s needed most: psychological safety. Here’s what leaders need to

# know.

## Psychological Safety: Lost When Needed Most

Decades of psychological safety research underscore its role in helping

people learn, collaborate, and perform at work. By reducing the fear

of being seen as ignorant or inept, psychological safety enables the

learning behaviors that are integral to settling into a new role and

organization, such as asking a question or seeking help. Psychological

safety is important for new hires because it allows them to manage the

discomfort of admitting fallibility, confront a steep learning curve on

new tasks, and embrace new perspectives.

Our latest research reveals a fascinating, if concerning, pattern for

psychological safety. We studied more than 10,000 employees in a large

organization and discovered that new hires’ psychological safety eroded

swiftly. On average, newcomers joined the organization with higher

psychological safety relative to their more tenured colleagues, then lost

it and waited years to reach levels comparable to when they arrived.

This “swoosh,” as we started to refer to it,

piqued our interest. It was persistent. It

held across years — before, during, and

# after the Covid-19 pandemic — and across

# characteristics like race and gender. It

implied that it could take 20 years or more

for employees to get back to the levels of

psychological safety they had when they

started. Further, while our analyses showed

that a supportive context — that is,

# departments with high psychological

safety — dampened the decline, it was nonetheless present in all

# conditions.

## Why Would New Hires Lose Psychological Safety?

Starting a new job is exciting. After making it through the hiring

process, you feel conﬁdent you were hired for a reason, eager to do

a good job. Surely your colleagues and manager want to hear from

you! Soon, however, you may ﬁnd things aren’t quite as you imagined;

a single problematic interaction can kill the psychological safety you

initially experienced.

To prevent this from happening, leaders need to understand why

newcomers are vulnerable to this loss:

# Reality shocks

First, expectations about a new organization are invariably altered after

arrival. Called “reality shocks” by MIT professors John Van Maanen and

## Ed Schein in their studies of new employee socialization, these shifts

occur when newcomers confront the reality of their new environment,

which may diﬀer from expectations, leading to a recalibration of beliefs

# about interpersonal risk-taking.

# Good-bad asymmetry

Consider the diﬀerence between a positive and negative experience

following an interpersonal risk. Imagine your manager responds

thoughtfully when you report a problem; your psychological safety

## remains intact. In contrast, a moment of dismissal or humiliation

for having raised it at all dramatically inhibits your willingness to

try again. The belief that it’s safe to speak up is easily negated,

automatically reducing the opportunities to reverse it in the future.

Even a single negative experience can harm psychological safety —

whereas rebuilding it takes deliberate management eﬀort over time.

## Protecting Newcomers’ Psychological Safety

For a leader overseeing organizations experiencing any degree of

turnover (and these days, who isn’t), our ﬁndings point to a signiﬁcant

challenge. Without psychological safety, new hires might choose to

lay low and keep their ideas and concerns to themselves — putting

teams and companies at risk of making bad decisions, experiencing

preventable failures, or missing out on improvement ideas. Bolstering

psychological safety for new hires is thus a vital leadership task. We

suggest three strategies to help preserve new hires’ early willingness to

speak up:

Interpersonal skills training

Our research showed that while new hires’ psychological safety

initially declined in all conditions, the trend was less severe in

departments with high psychological safety. In those departments,

members’ psychological safety was 5–15% higher than their colleagues

in departments with low psychological safety. The diﬀerences already

These trends suggest that strategically assigning new hires to

departments with positive climates ensures preferable socialization,

kicking oﬀ a virtuous cycle that builds psychological safety over

time. When placement in settings with low psychological safety is

necessary, investing in departments’ psychological safety, such as

through manager or team leader skills training, could help stave oﬀ

# losses among newcomers.

Framing the work

Use framing to establish and reinforce the need for interpersonal risk-

taking to do a good job at work. For example, framing work as complex

and uncertain clariﬁes the expectation that things will go wrong,

and the sooner someone notices and speaks up about it, the better

oﬀ everyone is. Similarly, asking questions and listening attentively

## demonstrates appreciation for ambiguity and uncertainty and fosters

shared expectations related to mutual learning.

Responding appreciatively

When colleagues and managers respond to newcomer questions, ideas,

or mistakes with curiosity and support, they can prevent the loss

of psychological safety. Appreciation is not about tolerating repeated

failures or incompetence, but rather about ensuring learning.

. . .

Psychological safety is not the default in any workplace, and those

who need it most — newcomers — are also most vulnerable to losing

it. Cultivating and reinforcing a climate favorable to learning requires

# deliberate leadership.
