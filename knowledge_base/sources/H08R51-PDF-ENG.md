Liza, an emergency medicine physician, had a fever and a persistent

cough, but rigid shift requirements left her little ﬂexibility. Returning

from maternity leave recently, she worried that calling out sick would

brand her as “less committed,” so she worked despite exhaustion,

potentially exposing her patients and coworkers.

Jordan, a marketing manager at a tech ﬁrm, had chills and fatigue. Even

with the ﬂexibility to work remotely and explicit encouragement from

his boss to take sick leave, Jordan feared that missing critical meetings

and deadlines could signal unreliability. He pushed through, joining

meetings camera-oﬀ and responding to emails throughout the day.

Liza and Jordan’s experiences, while distinct, point to a growing

workplace challenge: presenteeism, or working while ill. Even among

workplaces that oﬀer sick leave, a 2023 survey estimated that nearly

90% of U.S. employees worked while sick during the past year, and

40% hesitated to use available sick leave. Ironically, working while sick

with an infectious disease is most prevalent among those who work in

# healthcare, speciﬁcally physicians.

The costs of presenteeism extend beyond individual discomfort and

inconvenience; it’s quietly draining U.S. businesses of up to $150

## billion annually, nearly 10 times more than absenteeism. Yet many

senior leaders underestimate the problem. Employees who work while

sick experience reduced focus, slower decision-making, and increased

errors, ultimately reducing individual productivity by one third or

more. These impacts ripple throughout teams, creating bottlenecks, ineﬃciencies, and diminishing overall output. Presenteeism also

accelerates the spread of illness and drives up absenteeism costs, which

exceed $225 billion annually.

## Chronic presenteeism also intensiﬁes work-related stress and burnout.

Nearly 60% of U.S. workers in 2024 experienced burnout, ranging from

moderate to very high. Burnt-out employees are also far more likely

to quit, with each departure costing between 40% and 200% of that

# employee’s annual salary.

Finally, persistent presenteeism can worsen health conditions,

potentially leading to serious long-term illnesses and increasing

healthcare expenses and disability claims, signiﬁcantly burdening

# organizational resources.

For U.S. employers, the stakes are particularly high due to the lack of

universal paid sick leave, rising healthcare and child care costs, and

inadequate social safety nets. In this context, employees aren’t choosing

between work and rest—they’re choosing which risk they can aﬀord:

their health, their next paycheck, or their career. By understanding the

root causes of presenteeism, leaders can move beyond reactive policy

# tweaks to proactive structural change.

Here are three levers that senior leaders can directly control, and a

framework to combat presenteeism at work.

## Three Organizational Forces Behind Presenteeism

Our recent study, supported by broader research and drawing on

a national sample weighted to represent over 168 million American

## workers, reveals that presenteeism isn’t just about individual decisions

or even sick leave policies. It’s a symptom of deeper, structural issues:

how jobs are designed, how work is structured across industries, and

how cultural norms around availability and commitment are reinforced.

From this, we identiﬁed three core organizational drivers that shape

# presenteeism:

- 1. Men and women experience job ﬂexibility differently.

Women in our study with rigid, low-ﬂexibility jobs like nursing,

teaching, and administrative support reported working signiﬁcantly

more days while sick than men in similar roles. Concerns about job

security, ﬁnancial strain, and potential repercussions for taking sick leave may make it more diﬃcult for women in these roles to prioritize

# their health when unwell.

In contrast, men with highly ﬂexible roles reported working more

days while sick than women in similarly ﬂexible roles, challenging the

assumption that job ﬂexibility leads to better ability to care for one’s

health (for instance, scheduling appointments, taking sick time). Even

## in highly ﬂexible work arrangements, some employees—particularly

men—may feel pressure to remain constantly available, reinforcing

cultural norms that equate being “always on” with commitment,

# success, and career advancement.

- 2. Working while sick reﬂects gendered job roles and pressures.

Occupational sorting (the tendency for men and women to cluster into

diﬀerent sectors) further compounds these gendered pressures. Female-

dominated sectors, such as education, healthcare and social services,

and administration, often feature rigid schedules, strict attendance requirements, limited autonomy, and chronic understaﬃng, creating

structural barriers that discourage sick leave use. Male-dominated

sectors, such as engineering, ﬁnance, and tech, while typically oﬀering

more formal schedule ﬂexibility, frequently perpetuate an availability

culture that rewards visible responsiveness, paradoxically increasing

# presenteeism.

Our analysis further reveals that job security intensiﬁes occupational

presenteeism patterns. When job security was perceived as low,

women consistently missed fewer workdays than men, suggesting they

feel heightened pressure to demonstrate reliability under insecure

conditions. However, as job security improved, women were more

likely to use sick leave, indicating that stability helps alleviate fears

of professional repercussions. By contrast, men continued to report

presenteeism even with increased job security, indicating deeply

## ingrained cultural expectations of constant availability.

3.When job demands outweigh resources, people work more while sick.

The Job Demands-Resources (JD-R) model, developed by

organizational psychologists, explains how workplace conditions aﬀect

## employee health, productivity, and organizational performance. This

## framework classiﬁes work environments into two categories:

- Job Demands: Tasks requiring sustained physical, mental, or

emotional eﬀort, such as high workloads, rigid schedules, tight

## deadlines, and expectations of constant availability.

- Job Resources: Factors supporting employees in managing these

demands, including scheduling and location ﬂexibility, decision autonomy, clear managerial support, backup staﬃng, and open

# communication.

When job demands consistently outpace resources, employees

experience higher rates of presenteeism, burnout, absenteeism,

diminished productivity, and lower job satisfaction. Conversely,

balanced demands and adequate resources boost motivation,

# productivity, and workforce health.

This structural imbalance, exacerbated by gender norms and

occupational sorting, helps explain why expanding sick leave or well-

intentioned gestures such as leaders modeling time oﬀ or setting email

boundaries often fall short. Without redesigning jobs to address deeper

## gaps in ﬂexibility, autonomy, and support, surface-level policies alone

cannot meaningfully reduce presenteeism.

## A Strategic, Structural Approach for Senior Leaders

Executives who intentionally evaluate and redesign organizational

structures using the JD-R framework can meaningfully reduce

presenteeism, bolster employee well-being, and strengthen long-term

# organizational resilience.

- 1. Map job demands and resources across roles to identify imbalances.

Start with a broad diagnostic to assess core pressures and supports

across major role categories. Map the degree of job demands (e.g.,

workload, scheduling, expectations of responsiveness) alongside job resources (e.g., autonomy, ﬂexibility, backup staﬃng, managerial

support) across roles. Use this diagnostic framework to identify where

imbalances are most pronounced. Here are some strategies to gather

# this information:

- Conduct conﬁdential pulse surveys, stratiﬁed by job type/role

- Host manager-led focus groups to capture qualitative insights

- Integrate questions into existing surveys to streamline data collection

- Use data visualization tools like heat maps to identify roles with

## consistently high demands and low resources

Roles that skew heavy on demands and low on resources are red ﬂags for

presenteeism and burnout. These imbalances provide a clear starting

point for intervention: reducing excessive demands, strengthening

## available resources, or a combination of both.

A practical guide on applying the JD-R model describes how one of

## the largest hotel chains in the Netherlands—operating 22 hotels with

more than 1,000 employees—used the Energy Compass, an online

survey tool, to assess job demands and resources. The intervention

focused on increasing job resources such as autonomy, social

support, and professional development opportunities. As a result, the

organization reported measurable reductions in burnout and signiﬁcant

improvements in employee engagement. This case demonstrates how

systematically applying the JD-R framework can lead to meaningful

## gains in workforce well-being and organizational performance.

- 2. Train managers to identify and act on early signs of stress and presenteeism. Equip managers with practical tools to proactively recognize and

## address early warning signs of stress and overwork. These signals

can include employees working while visibly unwell, consistently

sending late-night emails, or hesitating to take needed sick leave.

Managers can be trained to intervene early through strategies such as

redistributing tasks, oﬀering temporary ﬂexible schedules, and creating

clear delegation plans to ease workload pressures.

A comprehensive study analyzing data from more than 7,000 U.K. ﬁrms

between 2020 and 2023 found that organizations that provide line

managers with training in mental health awareness were signiﬁcantly

less likely to report presenteeism among their employees. Managers

who learned to recognize stress indicators and act early helped reduce

employee burnout and improved overall organizational well-being.

- 3. Build ongoing feedback and response mechanisms.

While initial diagnostics highlight structural imbalances, ongoing

feedback loops help leaders monitor how demands and resources shift

over time and help them respond before issues escalate. Implement

brief, recurring surveys to track workload, ﬂexibility, and perceived

# support across teams.

What happens next is equally important: Leaders must share the results

transparently and take visible, timely action, such as adjusting project

timelines, reassigning tasks, or oﬀering temporary support during peak

periods. These ongoing feedback loops can reduce presenteeism and

burnout as well as build trust by showing employees that leadership is

listening and responding continuously—not just once.

## For example, during the height of the Covid-19 pandemic, Microsoft

implemented continuous “daily pulse” employee surveys to track well-

being, workload, and stress levels in real time. Managers reviewed

results weekly and responded by adjusting priorities, shifting project

timelines, and encouraging no-meeting days to reduce overload. This

type of rapid-response system allows senior leaders to intervene early—

## before presenteeism spirals into long-term burnout or attrition—while

also reinforcing a culture of accountability, responsiveness, and care by

showing employees their feedback matters.

. . .

Executives have unique leverage to reshape the structural forces that

drive presenteeism. Rather than treating presenteeism as a personal

failing or a mere sick-leave policy shortcoming, eﬀective leaders

recognize it as a symptom of broader issues with organizational design

and cultural norms. By strategically applying the JD-R framework,

leaders can cultivate healthier workplaces, boost productivity, enhance

employee satisfaction, and signiﬁcantly strengthen organizational

# resilience.

We all get sick. Forward-thinking organizations don’t merely encourage

sick leave—they systematically embed employee well-being into their

## organizational design, culture, and business strategy.
