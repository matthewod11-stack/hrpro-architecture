team members’ individual performance. Yet, any leader can tell you that

this kind of blanket advice doesn’t always seem to track with what they

see in the oﬃce: sometimes well-timed negative feedback can help drive

performance and positivity can be more impactful in some moments

# than others.

In new research, recently published in Organization Science, we aimed

to understand whether the timing of leaders’ positive or negative emotional expressions shapes team member performance diﬀerently.

We indeed found that positivity can help drive performance—but the

timing matters.

# The Impact of Early Positivity

In our ﬁrst study, we analyzed data on 9,968 consultants at a leading

professional services ﬁrm over the course of 20 months. We collected

the formal written feedback (approximately 250,000 comments) that

they received from their leaders and we used software to see the degree

to which leaders expressed positive and negative emotions in that

# feedback.

Examples of positive emotions in this context include comments like,

said-employee “is a joy to work with” or “has been a pleasure to work

with and I would love to have him on my team in the future.” Negative

comments include language like “concern” and “disappointed,” as well

as repeating words like “very” in phrases like they have a “very, very

long way to go” that signal frustration from the feedback giver.

At this consultancy, the year is broken into three terms, early, middle,

and late, and consultants may receive feedback when they ﬁnish any

component of a project during any of these terms, giving us ample

data throughout the teams’ lifecycles. We also tracked each individual

consultant’s performance throughout the year, as indicated by formal

performance reviews. These formal performance reviews asked leaders

## questions about each consultant’s performance and whether they would

like to continue to work with this consultant. Leaders were also asked to

provide input on whether the consultant deserved a raise and/or bonus.

We found that when leaders expressed a lot of early-term positivity,

their employees performed better throughout the year, compared with

all other leader expressions (for example those leaders who expressed

## more positivity at the mid-point, or end of year, or leaders who

were primarily negative at the outset). This remained true even after

controlling for factors like past performance or tenure in the ﬁrm.

To examine why early positive emotions played such a strong role in

performance, we conducted a second study with 245 student-athletes

and their 86 coaches on 20 N.C.A.A. Division 1 sports teams over the

course of a season. We used multiple, time-lagged surveys to capture the

degree to which team members received positive or negative emotional expressions from their coaching staﬀs over the course of the season

and how it related to team members’ sense of worth and individual performance (as measured by coaching staﬀ evaluations).

We found similar results: athletes whose coaches showed highly

positive emotions during the preseason performed better than other

athletes, even when controlling for things like playing time or previous

performance. We found that this is because when leaders expressed

positivity during the early time period, team members felt more highly

respected and desired to maintain that respect throughout the year,

thus motivating stronger performance.

## While strong positive emotions at the beginning of a season or year

were the best indicator of strong performance, we also found that in

both studies, those individuals whose leaders showed strong positivity

at the outset, then a little negativity at the midpoint, had the highest

performance. This is likely because these individuals, sensing a dip in

their leader’s evaluation of their contributions, were inspired to work

even harder to regain their leaders’ early-term respect.

# Recommendations for Leaders

Our research provides useful insights for leaders who hope to inspire

their teams and unlock their employees’ potential.

- 1. Take advantage of early opportunities to express genuine positivity

Our research dispels the theory that showing harsh emotions at the start

of a project drives performance (picture Bobby Knight). Instead, those

leaders who hope to inspire strong performance should thoughtfully express how much they care about their staﬀ, enjoy working with them,

and value their speciﬁc contributions—and they should do this early.

Even the late Steve Jobs, who is notorious for embracing a more

negative emotional leadership style, made sure to express enthusiasm to engineers during the kick-oﬀ meeting for the iPhone’s development

# process.

- 2. The best time for negative feedback might be the midpoint

Our research found, perhaps unsurprisingly, that leaders who express

constant negativity hurt team members’ performance. However, our

study also revealed that some mid-term negativity might just inspire

your team to go the extra mile. Put simply, genuine tough love (that is,

an abundance of love early on, sprinkled with a little toughness at the

midpoint) works well as a performance-enhancer. Indeed, past research

ﬁnds that when employees feel they received tough love, it increases

their perceptions of their ability to grow and be promoted. Examples

of leader tough love could include sharing feedback about areas for

## improvement even within a positive mid-year performance review or

giving candid feedback about where a team member missed the mark in

# a recent work project.

To be clear, we are not recommending that leaders should be abusive

or arbitrarily negative at the midpoint to drive success. For negative

feedback to be meaningful and inspire positive change, it needs to be

substantiated in a way that feels fair, proportional, and accurate so that

it will encourage workers to want to improve. Everyone has space to

grow—our study found that the midpoint just might be the best time to

provide this constructive feedback.

Some Caveats Our ﬁndings speak strongly to the timing eﬀects of leaders’ emotional

expressions during long-term projects, but less strongly to the timing eﬀects during a meeting or shorter project. Despite this, other research

powerfully argues that timing matters when it comes to other aspects

of good leadership, like expressing gratitude. This suggests that timing

is an important consideration for leaders looking to motivate their

# employees for projects of any length.

. . .

A key aspect of leadership in a team or organization is a leader’s

emotional leadership style. This involves expressing emotions towards

## their team members with the added burden that these expressions can

have powerful impacts (intended and unintended) on recipients. Given

this, it is important that leaders are thoughtful about their emotional

leadership style and consider timing as a central dimension that shapes the eﬀect of their emotional expressions. By eﬀectively using

more nuanced and timely emotional leadership styles, and considering

both the timing and sequencing of emotional expressions over time,

leaders can not only unlock performance potential, but also make team

members feel a greater sense of worth and respect while performing at

# their best.
