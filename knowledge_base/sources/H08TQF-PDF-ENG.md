The prevailing wisdom in artiﬁcial intelligence suggests that bigger

models yield better results. In our work for health insurance companies

and third-party administrators of health plans, we’ve discovered that

this assumption holds in many cases but breaks down when AI moves

## from general tasks to specialized professional domains.

We have built generative AI systems for prior authorization: the

process that health insurers employ to determine whether a doctor’s

recommended treatments are covered by the patient’s policy. In this

article we share what we have learned about how executives evaluating

## investments in AI for professional problem-solving applications should

## decide between generalist AI models and specialized ones.

# When Scale Delivers the Greatest Value

## Well-known generative AI oﬀerings like ChatGPT, Claude, and Gemini

are built on large language models (LLMs) and other AI technologies

that are trained on text and images from countless domains and

therefore seem capable of answering almost any question imaginable.

As tempting as it might be for business leaders to actually rely on

these generalist models to do just that, however, it’s critical to recognize

where their broad capabilities create the greatest competitive and

# operational advantages.

Simply put, these systems excel at many enterprise applications precisely because they don’t specialize. Their value derives from

their ability to synthesize information broadly across domains, make

unexpected connections, and handle the full spectrum of business

communications. They can simultaneously draw on legal precedents,

## technical speciﬁcations, and customer psychology.

For organizations seeking to both deepen and accelerate the creativity

and productivity of content teams, generalist models oﬀer unmatched

versatility. Leaders are well advised to think of them as sophisticated

## generalists—AI versions of the most valuable utility players on the team

—and employ them as such.

In contrast, specialized generative AI models understand not

just what information to retrieve but also how that information

## operates within a speciﬁc domain’s decision-making framework. These

generative AI technologies add highly contextualized training data and

## methodologies to the core capabilities of generalized AI technologies.

The result is that they can generate far more intelligent and accurate

outputs in speciﬁc domains like healthcare and ﬁnance than would be possible for generalist AI models. For example, a specialized model

designed to assist a physician making a treatment decision must not

only know what aspects of a patient’s current clinical status and medical

history are relevant but also be able to identify appropriate treatment

protocols and the strength of the evidence supporting that protocol.

# When AI Must Think Like Experts

First things ﬁrst: No one in their right mind would question whether

generalist models are valuable; they clearly are. When leaders rely

on specialized solutions for tasks better suited to generalist models,

they waste resources and set the stage for weak performance

across important domains. Meanwhile, misapplying generalist AI to specialized professional domains isn’t just ineﬃcient; it can

## create liability, regulatory violations, and an erosion of trust among

## stakeholders and the public more broadly.

We should know, because we nearly fell into this very trap. When

we ﬁrst applied generalist models to prior authorization, we were

conﬁdent that their capabilities would translate well. But we quickly

encountered a fundamental mismatch between how these systems

process information and how healthcare professionals actually make

# decisions.

## This challenge reﬂects what Martin Reeves and Mihnea Moldoveanu

recently described as “dataism”: the false belief that gathering ever

more data and feeding it to ever more powerful algorithms alone

can help businesses make optimal decisions. Our experience building

healthcare AI taught us that this approach breaks down precisely where

it matters most: in the nuanced, contextual reasoning that deﬁnes

## professional expertise in medicine and across industries.

Prior authorization requires mapping complex clinical presentations

to equally complex insurance policies—a process that involves

understanding not just what information is present but also how

to interpret that information within speciﬁc medical and regulatory

frameworks. It’s not enough, for example, to understand that a patient

with a Stage 2 lung cancer diagnosis would qualify for a speciﬁc

chemotherapy under an insurer’s policy; the system would also need

to account for other medical conditions—say, end-stage renal disease

accompanied by a recent hospice referral—that would impact a

# treatment or coverage decision.

This mirrors challenges across multiple professional domains: Legal

teams must map case facts to relevant precedents, ﬁnancial advisors

must align client circumstances with regulatory requirements, and

engineers must connect design speciﬁcations to safety standards.

To solve a prior authorization problem, a generalist AI model would

seek to ﬁnd statistical patterns between symptoms and approval

decisions, but this pattern-matching approach misses the underlying

clinical and policy logic that drives these decisions—especially with

more complex cases like the one mentioned above—just as it would

## miss similar considerations in legal, ﬁnancial, and engineering realms.

The breakthrough idea, for us, came in the form of a question: “Why

would we try to make the AI think like a computer when it needs

to think like a doctor?” Put another way, we observed that eﬀective

professional AI requires understanding not just what information to

retrieve but also how that information operates within a speciﬁc clinical

and insurance coverage framework. This insight led us to replace a

pattern-matching approach with one that starts by understanding the

prior authorization policy criteria, then searches clinical documents for

the speciﬁc evidence a clinician would use. We trained our generative

AI agents to follow how clinicians read—understanding the structure of

charts, moving from sections to subsections, and identifying the right

ﬁndings in context. To maintain clinical precision, we built specialized

agents for distinct tasks, avoiding the cross-specialty overlap that

general models often introduce.

## What Enterprise AI Solutions Must Deliver

This shift represents more than a technical reﬁnement; it’s a

fundamentally diﬀerent philosophy. Rather than retrieving text and

hoping the model parses it correctly, eﬀective specialized solutions

extract structured professional facts ﬁrst, then apply domain-speciﬁc

reasoning to those facts.

Consider how experienced physicians approach a complex case. They

## don’t simply pattern-match symptoms to diagnoses; they systematically

evaluate speciﬁc clinical criteria, understand how diﬀerent ﬁndings

interact, and apply established medical practices to reach conclusions.

Clinicians are also able to intuitively and eﬀectively grasp context

## and, perhaps more importantly, discern irrelevant or out-of-context

## information. The most eﬀective specialized AI solutions mirror this

structured approach rather than relying on the more impressionistic

## reasoning of generalist large language models.

The broader principle here extends well beyond healthcare. Enterprise

decision-making across the other domains we’ve referenced—and many

others—involves precise interpretation of domain-speciﬁc data points,

not just general language understanding. The thing about generalist

models, however is that they’re democratic in the worst possible way.

They treat all information equally, potentially weighing irrelevant

## details as heavily as crucial professional ﬁndings.

## Why Transparency Beats Performance in Enterprise Contexts

Perhaps our most important observation was that in many enterprise

contexts, AI applications must oﬀer transparent reasoning for their

outputs—something large general models struggle to provide. In

healthcare, physicians, patients, and insurers need to understand not

just what decision was made but also why speciﬁc evidence was

prioritized and how diﬀerent clinical factors were weighted. The same is

## true in a host of other domains such as structural engineering, ﬁnancial

advising, and legal decision-making.

This transparency requirement also reﬂects a deeper truth about

professional domains: It’s not nearly enough to be right most of

the time. Enterprises need to trace the logical chain from evidence

to conclusion, identify potential weaknesses in reasoning, and

understand how new information might aﬀect decisions. As Joe

McKendrick and Andy Thurai have noted, AI systems notoriously

fail in capturing the intangible human factors—ethical, moral, and

## contextual considerations—that guide real-life professional decision-

making. Generalist models, despite their impressive capabilities,

## remain largely opaque in their decision-making processes.

We essentially had no choice, then, but to ensure our system generated

explicit rationales for every decision, showing which clinical criteria

were evaluated and how they mapped to speciﬁc policy requirements.

This wasn’t just about regulatory compliance; it became essential

for earning physicians’ trust. Transparent reasoning proved vital for

enabling eﬀective human-AI collaboration.

## Evaluating Adaptability to Enterprise Evolution

Great leaders achieve that status largely because they’re able to evolve

## strategies in lockstep with competitive and regulatory changes in their

domain. Reliable AI solutions must be able to do the same; they must

be able to perpetually recalibrate how new information aﬀects existing

frameworks. This is precisely the kind of contextual reasoning that

generalist models ﬁnd challenging, however. Specialized models, by

contrast, are tuned to recognize domain-speciﬁc signals and understand

when seemingly small shifts might have major implications for industry

# professionals.

When evaluating AI vendors, leaders should prioritize those that

understand the underlying structure of professional decision-making

in their domain and can incorporate new information more eﬀectively

than approaches requiring complete model retraining. The same

principle applies whether you’re assessing solutions that understand

how new legal precedents apply to particular factual circumstances or

those that can quickly contextualize new ﬁnancial regulatory changes

rather than simply optimizing for returns.

# Hybrid Architecture as the Path Forward

Our experience suggests that the future of enterprise generative AI

implementation lies not only in choosing between generalist and

## specialized models but also in thoughtful hybrid implementation

strategies. The most eﬀective approaches leverage generalist models for

tasks they excel at—e.g., customer service chatbots, content creation,

## document summarization, exploratory data analysis, and internal

knowledge management—while relying on specialized vendors for

## domain-speciﬁc reasoning and decision-making in areas like regulatory

## compliance, health insurance, legal precedent analysis, and ﬁnancial

# risk assessment.

This hybrid approach allows enterprises to beneﬁt from the broad

## capabilities of large models for routine business functions while

accessing the speciﬁc professional logic that drives expert decision-

making in high-stakes domains. Rather than replacing professional

judgment, these solutions can enhance it by handling routine

applications of established frameworks while ﬂagging cases that require

# human expertise.

## How to Choose an AI Vendor and Avoid Common Pitfalls

Given how well today’s biggest LLMs perform across less-mission-

critical tasks, it’s hard for business leaders to make grave errors

when choosing among them for such purposes. That’s not the case

when evaluating more specialized AI models, however. Through our

experience, we’ve developed several key questions business leaders can

ask during specialized AI vendor evaluations to avoid the most common

# pitfalls:

Can the vendor clearly demonstrate the logic behind its AI and make its reasoning transparent?

The critical question isn’t whether AI can process information faster

than humans but whether it can reason—i.e., use that information

—in ways that your key domain experts can trust, understand,

and build upon. This question helps avoid the trap of “shallow

transparency illusions,” which happens when vendors show which

criteria were evaluated, for instance, but fail to capture deeper

professional reasoning. Look for solutions that embed professional

judgment frameworks, not just decision trees, and can explain why they

prioritize speciﬁc evidence.

Does the vendor maintain ongoing collaboration with domain experts in your ﬁeld? How does it handle evolving practices?

This requires deep collaboration between AI developers and domain

experts—not just to gather training data but also to understand

the underlying frameworks that guide professional decision-making.

Success comes from vendors that embed this professional logic into

their architecture rather than hoping their models will somehow

discover it through pattern matching. This question ensures your

vendor can adapt as professional standards change, while maintaining

access to the domain expertise that drives continuous improvement.

Can the vendor’s proposed solution address cross-domain integration and scope expansion, or will its offering only function as a point solution?

As researchers from McKinsey highlighted in HBR, the key to

capturing AI’s full potential lies in understanding and addressing the

organizational and cultural barriers that AI initiatives face, rather than

simply deploying more powerful general-purpose models. This question

helps leaders choose vendors that anticipate how professional decisions

interconnect across domains and ones that expand their capabilities as

an organization’s needs evolve.

The competitive landscape for industry-speciﬁc AI may look quite

## diﬀerent from the current focus on ever-larger generalist models.

Companies that understand the unique reasoning patterns of speciﬁc

professional domains and can partner with AI vendors that participate

eﬀectively in that reasoning will create more sustainable advantages

than those competing purely on a model’s scale.

## In high-stakes enterprise environments, specialized expertise trumps

## general intelligence—for humans and AI systems alike. Our journey

building healthcare-speciﬁc AI taught us that the path to eﬀective

professional AI lies not in simply choosing bigger models but also

in selecting smarter solutions that understand how professionals

actually think, decide, and act. The lessons we’ve learned in healthcare

authorization apply broadly: When AI moves from general capabilities

to speciﬁc professional applications, architecture matters more than
