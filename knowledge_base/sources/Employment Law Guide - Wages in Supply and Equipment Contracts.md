# Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (PCA)

(41 USC §6501 et seq.; 41 CFR Parts 50-201, 202, 203, and 210

# Updated: May 2024

# The wage and hour requirements of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (PCA) are administered by the

# Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The PCA applies to contractors with contracts in excess of $15,000 for the

manufacturing or furnishing of materials, supplies, articles, or equipment to the U.S. government or the District of Columbia. The PCA covers employees who produce, assemble, handle, or ship goods under these

# contracts.

The PCA does not apply to executive, administrative, and professional employees, or to outside salespersons

exempt from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act, nor does it apply to

# certain oﬃce and custodial workers.

Certain contracts are not covered by the PCA. They include:

Contracts to purchase materials, supplies, articles, or equipment that may usually be bought in the "open

# market"

Contracts to purchase perishables, including dairy, livestock and nursery products

Contracts to purchase agricultural or farm products processed for ﬁrst sale by the original producers Contracts made by the Secretary of Agriculture for the purchase of agricultural commodities or products of

# agricultural commodities

# Contracts for public utility services and certain transportation and communication services

Contracts awarded to sales agents or publishers representatives for delivery of newspapers, magazines

and periodicals by their publishers Contracts for materials, supplies, articles, or equipment no part of which will be manufactured or furnished

within the geographic limits of the States of the United States of America, Puerto Rico, the Virgin Islands, or

# the District of Columbia

Contracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor in special circumstances to avoid serious

impairment of government business when the exemption will serve justice or the public interest

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

Covered contractors must pay employees on the contracts the federal minimum wage. The employers may

pay special lower rates to apprentices, students in vocational education programs, and disabled workers if

they obtain special certiﬁcates from the Department of Labor. Employees must also be paid one and one-half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

The PCA prohibits the employment of youths less than 16 years of age and incarcerated individuals, except

under certain conditions. Not included are persons paroled, pardoned, or discharged from prison, or prisoners

participating in a work-release program.

# Employee Rights

# The PCA provides employees on covered federal contracts the right to be paid at least the minimum wage for

# all hours worked and time and one half their regular rate of pay for overtime hours. The Wage and Hour

Division(https://www.dol.gov/whd/) accepts complaints of alleged PCA violations.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

# Notices and Posters

Every employer performing work covered by the PCA is required to post the "Employee Rights on Government Contracts"(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters/government-contracts/sca) notice (including any

applicable wage determination) at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place where it may be

easily seen by employees. There are no size requirements for the poster. The Employee Rights on

Government Contracts poster is also available in

## Spanish(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/scaspan.htm).

If the contractor employs workers with disabilities under special minimum wage certiﬁcates, the "Notice to

# Workers with Disabilities/Special Minimum Wage (PDF) poster"(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters/section-

14c) must also be posted. This notice explains the conditions under which special minimum wages may be

paid. The poster must be posted in a conspicuous place on the employer's premises where it can be readily

seen by employees and the parents or guardians of workers with disabilities.

# Recordkeeping

Under the PCA, contractors and subcontractors are required to maintain certain records which must be

available for inspection by the Wage and Hour Division. Records providing the following information for each

covered employee must be kept on ﬁle for at least three years from their last date of entry:

# Name, address, sex, and occupation

Date of birth of each employee under 19 years of age. If the employer has obtained a certiﬁcate of age, the

following must be recorded: the title and address of the oﬃce issuing the certiﬁcate; the number of the

certiﬁcate; the date of issuance; the name, address and date of birth of the minor as the name appears on

the certiﬁcate Wage and hour records, which include the rate of wages and the amount paid each pay period, the hours

worked each day and each week, and the period during which the employee worked on a government

# contract, and the contract number

The employer must maintain records providing the following information for at least two years from their last

## date of entry, or their last eﬀective date, if later:

Basic employment and earnings records such as daily time cards, time sheets, or records showing amounts

of work accomplished

# Wage rate tables

# Work time schedules

# Reporting

There are no reporting requirements.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Contractors and subcontractors who breach the required contract terms or violate the Act may be subject to a variety of penalties. The underpayment of wages and overtime pay may result in the cancellation of the

contract and/or withholding of contract payments in amounts suﬃcient to reimburse the underpayment.

Liquidated damages and/or penalties may be assessed on a daily basis for each underage minor or

incarcerated individual who is employed, for which contract payments may also be withheld. The Department

of Labor may also bring legal action to collect wage underpayment and ﬁnes for underpaying workers and/or illegally employing underage minors or incarcerated individuals. Willful violations may subject the employer to

cancellation of the current contract and debarment from future federal contracts for a three-year period.

Upon issuance and service of a formal complaint on the contractor, a hearing shall be scheduled before an

Administrative Law Judge. The decision of the Administrative Law Judge may be appealed to the

Administrative Review Board (ARB). ARB determinations on violations and debarment may be appealed to and are enforceable through the federal courts.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

State and local laws regulating wages and hours of work may also apply to employment subject to the PCA.

When this happens, the employer must observe the law setting the stricter standard.

The Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act and the Fair Labor Standards Act may apply simultaneously to the

# same employer.
