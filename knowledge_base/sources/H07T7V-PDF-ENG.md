How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management Geeks are “obsessive mavericks”, and every company can benefit from their leadership style.

The secret to success for many Silicon Valley tech companies isn’t

necessarily that they’re ultra-nimble start-ups, or that they’re led by

tech-savvy geniuses. In fact, their success often has more to do with

a speciﬁc type of corporate culture—and it’s a culture that even

companies not based on the US West Coast or focused on technology

can adopt.

## HBR / Digital Article / How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management

According to Andrew McAfee, a principal research scientist at the MIT

Sloan School of Management, business leaders need to think more

like geeks, but not the computer-based stereotype you may be familiar

## with. In his forthcoming book, The Geek Way: The Radical Mindset that

Drives Extraordinary Results, McAfee says geeks are nothing more or

less than “obsessive mavericks” who are absolutely ﬁxated on ﬁnding

unconventional solutions to their business’ hard problems. You need

them throughout the organization, not just at the top, and you need to

entrust them with the power to make real changes.

For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR

editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with McAfee to discuss:

- Evolving a company’s culture not by focusing on organizational

# structure, but on company norms

- Building organizations that can get things right, even when the person

at the top of the org chart is wrong

- The delicate balance of human judgment and evidence, data-driven

# insights.

“The New World of Work” explores how top-tier executives see the

future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for

success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on LinkedIn Live —

previous interviews included Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and former

PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. He also shares an inside look at these

conversations —and solicits questions for future discussions — in a

newsletter just for HBR subscribers. If you’re a subscriber, you can sign

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Adi it’s great to be here.

ADI IGNATIUS:

It’s great to have you. I’ve read the book. It lavishes fulsome praise

## on geeks in business, not just for their technological innovation, but

also for developing an approach to business itself that you’ve come to

# respect.

Let’s start with a deﬁnition. How do you deﬁne a geek?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

I’m walking away from the computer-based deﬁnition of a geek, which

was kind of where it started. My deﬁnition has two parts. For me a geek

is somebody who gets obsessed with a hard problem and is willing to

# embrace unconventional solutions.

The patron saint of geeks is probably Maria Montessori, who about 100

years ago got obsessed with the problem of how you educate young

children best, and came up with the Montessori educational method,

which is this radical departure from the industrial scale model of

schools that was dominant then, and sadly still dominant now. Think

about Maria Montessori when you think about a geek.

ADI IGNATIUS:

How do you deﬁne the “geek way” that you’re talking about in the book?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

The particular geeks I got excited about that led me to write the book

were not educational geeks like Maria Montessori, they were business

geeks. They were a group of people concentrated on—but not exclusive

to—the West Coast of the US who got obsessed with this problem of,

“How do we run a company in an age of really fast technological change

and lots of uncertainty? And in particular, how do we avoid some of the

## classic dysfunctions of the internet era?”

The geek way is what they’ve come up with. It’s the business model,

or the culture, or the set of norms that they’ve settled on to try to

# accomplish that really hard goal.

ADI IGNATIUS:

It’s sort of people who nerd out on, in this case, management, right?

# Processes of management.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

“Obsessive maverick” is my preferred phrase for a geek. And the

obsessive mavericks that I got really interested in were the ones who

dove in, again, on this problem of, “How do we run a company and

keep doing well in our markets and avoid the dysfunctions that seem to

plague so many successful companies as they get older and bigger? How

do we avoid those dysfunctions? How do we do something that’s higher

performing, more sustainable, and a better place to work?”

## HBR / Digital Article / How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management

ADI IGNATIUS:

As I read the book, some of those attributes you talked about, they

had to do with speed, they had to do with experimentation. Is this just

another term for being digital, or for applying design thinking of the

business? Are we talking the same thing here?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

No, I don’t think so. Adi, you remember Quibi, right, the Jeﬀrey

Katzenberg-led video startup? It was going to do short-form videos and

it was going to change the way we consume entertainment.

Quibi was entirely digital. It was a completely digital enterprise. It was a

miserable failure. They raised $1.75 billion. They shut down within 200

days of their launch. It was just a catastrophe. It was a completely digital

# enterprise.

Netﬂix is a geek company. They follow all four of my great geek norms of

science, ownership, speed and openness. And I think their results speak

# for themselves.

Geek for me is entirely separate from digital. You can be a non-digital

geek, and you can certainly be very digital and not geeky at all.

ADI IGNATIUS:

The Quibi thing is an interesting example. I guess what was missing

from your framework was the openness. You had a powerful guy who

had been successful, who wasn’t listening.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Not listening to his peers, to his colleagues, to his advisor. He didn’t

appear to be a great listener, which is this kind of stereotypical trap that

a lot of industrial-era companies fall into. Tech leaders also fall into this

trap quite often. You become enamored of your own success and you

really stop listening. It’s incredibly common.

One of the things that is powerful, and that I respect about people like

Reed Hastings at Netﬂix is that he was able to build a business that got

important decisions right when he himself was wrong about them. In

the book I talk about a couple of them.

He was dead-ﬂat wrong about the utility of downloading to the Netﬂix

app. He thought it wouldn’t be very useful at all; it’s incredibly useful.

He was wrong about the importance of kids’ programming for Netﬂix.

And he admits this in the book, No Rules Rules that he wrote with Erin

# Meyer.

He successfully worked hard on building a company that would correct

him, the boss, the high status prestigious person at the top of the

organization. It’s part of this great geek norm of openness that I talk

about. How do you build a company that will get it right when the

person at the top of the org chart is wrong? Man, that’s a hard problem.

ADI IGNATIUS:

It’s a hard problem. And I’m sure some people are going to read your

book and think, “Hang on, a lot of these companies we’re talking

about are Silicon Valley startups or somewhere in that realm.” The

popular perception is these are not cultures that you necessarily

want to emulate. They’re often male-dominated bro-cultures. The boss

frequently is an overly demanding bully. How do you square all this?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

There clearly is some of that going on in the Valley. There are toxic

cultures. You mentioned the bro-culture. I would say that Theranos

is one of the most toxic cultures I’ve ever heard about, and it was

headquartered in Silicon Valley.

I don’t think those are geek companies at all. They might be in the

right geographic location, but they’re not following the geek way, which

is about these norms and about creating a culture that is fast-moving,

## free-ﬂowing, argumentative, autonomous, evidence-driven, and pretty

egalitarian. That’s the goal of the geek way.

Now you point out some of these companies that I do think follow the

geek way that are still too pale, stale, and male. That’s absolutely true.

The evidence is pretty clear on this. I hope that gets better over time.

But Adi, you said something that I disagree with, that a lot of these

cultures that are not good places to work. That’s true in some cases.

Remember when LinkedIn did its top attractors survey, I believe in

2016, they said, look, we’re just going to look at objective criteria.

We’re going to look at which company pages get viewed the most often

by LinkedIn members. Which companies get the most interest from

LinkedIn members, the most applications, and where do people stick

around when they take their ﬁrst job?

The top 11 attractors in the LinkedIn list were all companies

headquartered on the West Coast in the industry that we loosely call

tech. The geek culture is an extremely attractive culture to work in.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Some of these founders, entrepreneurs who got into whatever they

got into because they wanted to make the world a better place, Serge

and Larry in their garage trying to systematize our access to all the

world’s information, these great ideals: when they are actually running

companies, they not only are trying to run a company, but they become

killers, wanting to wipe out the competition, to foster monopolistic

practices, to just grab as much market share as possible.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Is any of this new? Within the businesses? No, I’m serious. Were the

businesses of previous eras cuddly? Did they want their competitors to

succeed? Were they trying to rise all boats?

Capitalism is an inherently competitive process. These companies are

very, very good performers. If you want to use the adjective “killer” for

them, I think that’s by design. You’re not in business not to succeed. You

want to grow your market share. You want to grow your proﬁts, you want

grow. That is often at the expense of somebody else.

I think it’s for the courts to decide whether they meet the deﬁnition

of monopolist. It’s a word we toss around a lot. The courts so far have

tossed out a lot of the recent lawsuits against some of these giant tech

companies. I don’t think they meet the deﬁnition of monopolist. In

general, for a lot of these companies, the competition is one click away.

And is Tesla a monopolist in the auto industry? You simply can’t make

that case. SpaceX has become pretty close to a monopolist in the rockets

and satellites industry, but they didn’t start that way, and they’ve

become so large and inﬂuential because they do the job better.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Let’s talk about companies that are doing it right. This is not universally

for digital companies. Some follow the geek way, as you’ve laid it out,

# some don’t.

How many companies, large, small, digital, otherwise live into these

principles, do you think?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

I think that’s a really interesting question, and I don’t have a great way

to answer it yet. Because the only way that I can think to answer it is to

administer a survey to everybody and get them to ﬁll it out. That’s just

not going to work.

But you can look at what we know about the cultures at these

companies. You can also look at the fantastic Culture 500 research that

Don and Charlie Sull did, published in a competitor magazine of yours,

Sloan Management Review. They grabbed all the LinkedIn reviews and

put them through a machine-learning analysis to see what companies’

own employees said about them.

Three areas I was most interested in were execution, agility, and

innovation. And wow, the scores for companies clustered on the West

Coast, clustered in Silicon Valley, clustered in industries that we

call high-tech, those scores are oﬀ the charts. There’s not any real

# competition for them.

There’s something brewing on the West Coast in industries that we label

(for reasons that I don’t like very much) high-tech. There’s something

brewing that’s new, that is diﬀerent than what’s going on elsewhere in

the economy, and it’s pretty demonstrably powerful. The label that I

hang on that is the geek way.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Was Steve Jobs a geek, and did his Apple follow the geek way or was that

# a diﬀerent model?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Jobs has some really classic non-geek characteristics. He believed that

he knew best. He had a very, very large ego. He also screamed at his

subordinates all the time, which I think is absolutely not what an open

leader does.

However, I interviewed Eric Schmidt for the book, and I brought this up

to him and he said, “Look, I was on Apple’s board for a while. I knew

Steve pretty well.” He said Steve was a tough person in all those ways,

but he learned that if you want to stay on top, you have to listen to

the people around you. You have to stop thinking that you have all the

# answers.

We see a really clear example of that with the App Store. Jobs did not

want to open up his beautiful, perfect walled garden iPhone to outside

developers. He had to be talked into it. He eventually realized that he

was wrong about that. There is a little bit of that openness going on.

One thing that Apple is pretty fanatic about, as I understand it, is they

make decisions based on evidence. And whether or not that’s a huge

AB testing infrastructure is one thing. Apple loves to demo features,

and gets everybody in the room to look at this and say, for example, is

it better to have blurry portrait photos where you can adjust the blur

before you take the picture? The instant they did a demo, they had the

answer to that question. They did not sit around and argue from their

diﬀerent points of view. They said, OK, let’s run an experiment. Let’s do

a demo here. That’s an extremely geeky approach.

ADI IGNATIUS:

## One of the interesting things about Jobs, and certainly something he

would’ve said about himself, he did say about himself, was that he

didn’t, and that one shouldn’t, slavishly follow the focus groups. People

don’t know what they want.

It’s a combination of let’s get input, but there is a lot of personal

touch, personal feel. It’s like Moneyball versus the old school. Maybe

the answer is a combination of skills.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Absolutely. And Ted Sarandos, who’s the co-CEO of Netﬂix, says their

decision-making is pretty algorithmic. It’s 70-30 algorithmic versus

human judgment. But he said, if anything, the human judgment is on

top, if that makes any sense.

I think that makes a ton of sense. This norm of science that the geeks are

pretty passionate about, it’s not just dry analysis and do whatever the

data says. That’s an inaccurate caricature.

Science is about settling arguments with evidence. It’s a ground rule for

how you’re going to come to a decision. You’re going to do a test, you’re

going to do an experiment. You’re going to sit around in a group and

argue about it. And if you can’t agree, evidence is going to settle this

# issue.

## HBR / Digital Article / How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management

Science is this inherently, deeply social, deeply argumentative process

with a ground rule. Evidence is the queen here. That’s what we’re going

to follow. And a lot of the geek companies that I respect do that as

# naturally as breathing.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One of the examples in your book of geek culture triumphing is

Microsoft, and speciﬁcally when Satya Nadella came in and rekindled

that early success and more. Talk a bit about what he got right,

particularly in the framework that you’ve created.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Can you think of a more impressive corporate turnaround story in living

# memory?

ADI IGNATIUS:

No. Microsoft went from the tech company we liked least to maybe the

one we like best.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

And if you were an investor, you really didn’t like it for about a decade.

The stock price was ﬂat as a corpse’s EKG. And then Nadella took over,

and it’s become one of the most valuable companies in the world. It’s an

astonishing comeback story.

I got to interview Nadella for the book. He’d made brilliant strategic

moves, a bunch of them. You have Microsoft embracing open source,

# wow.

## HBR / Digital Article / How the Geeks Rewrote the Rules of Management

But I was interested in the cultural changes that he made. And he

did a couple things that I think are straight out of the geek playbook.

Some of them are obvious. He embraced agile development methods as

widely and quickly as possible inside Microsoft. He did a couple things

to reduce the sclerotic bureaucracy that was in place at Microsoft, which

was just hamstringing their ability to do anything important out there in

# the world.

One of the brilliant things he did was say, “Look, you cannot own a

digital resource inside Microsoft. You cannot own the data. You cannot

# own the code.”

And what he meant by that was you can’t be the gatekeeper. You can’t

say yes or no to other groups who might want to use it. With that one

simple move, he said to the company, “Look, if the AI group wants

to go grab all of the GitHub code to train up a model to help provide

assistance to programmers, you don’t have to ask permission. Just go do

that, subject to all the right constraints and safeties on it.” Man, that is

## an astonishingly good bureaucracy-reduction mechanism.

Maybe the deepest thing that Nadella did was that he pulled oﬀ this

amazing feat of helping Microsoft become a less defensive organization.

What I mean by that was, he said in his interview with me, “We had

a culture where it was not OK to be wrong, to show any weakness, to

not hit your numbers, to not be the smartest person in the room.” He

said, “We just had that culture and it had to change.” He did a number

of really brilliant things to move from a culture of defensiveness to a

# culture of openness.

When I used to hear this word, “vulnerability”, in connection with

leadership or business, I thought it was just a buzz phrase, hand wavy,

nonsense business. The company is not a therapy group. It’s not there so

you can sit around feeling vulnerable all the time. I was just wrong.

Now, the company is not your therapy group. However, a successful

company needs to be a place where it’s okay to be wrong, to fail, to

not have the answer, to show that you’re uncertain. Nadella helped get

Microsoft down that path, and it was an absolutely fundamental thing

to do.

I also interviewed Yamini Rangan, who’s the CEO of HubSpot here in

Cambridge, who took over a culture and has strengthened it through a really diﬃcult time through the pandemic.

She discussed one of the things she learned and that she was good at

was saying in this unbelievably uncertain time of the pandemic where

tech companies were shrinking. It was all weird. She said to a lot of

her constituencies, “Look, I don’t know. I don’t know what the future

holds here. I’m going to be honest with you.” She also shared her board

## performance review with her direct reports, not just the good parts, but

the stuﬀ that she needs to work on too. These are all just great moves to

start to show the rest of the organization it is okay not to be perfect, not

to put on the brave front, not to be winning all of the time.

Jack Welch’s autobiography was called Winning, and it epitomized this

industrial era view of what you have to do all day every day. I love the

geek view, which is, “Hey, man, we’re going to launch some rockets and

they are going to blow up. Now, we’re not going to kill anybody, but

we’re absolutely going to launch some rockets that are going to blow up

# on the launchpad.”

Bezos said a few years back in the shareholder’s letter, “We are

incubating multi-billion dollar failures inside Amazon right now. That’s

appropriate for a company of our scale.” And you look at Alexa and I

think maybe he was right about that.

But the point is that this obsession with winning and being on top and

being right and being dominant, that has to go away.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I want to get to audience questions. One came from Shabana

in Pakistan. What kinds of organizational design, organizational

structures, do you need to foster this sort of geek culture?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

I don’t think org structure is the key because the companies that I

surveyed have very, very diﬀerent org charts. They also have very

# diﬀerent formal practices.

Netﬂix is fairly famous for having the no-vacation-days policy. Amazon

has extremely strict vacation policies for diﬀerent levels of employee.

I think it’s not a matter of the org chart or the org structure that you

have. It’s not so much a matter of how formal a lot of your policies are.

It’s a matter of your norms. I love that word and I use it in the book all

# the time.

A norm is a behavior that the people around you expect. Maybe

it’s written down in the employee manual. Very often it’s not. It’s

community policing. It’s what the people around you expect. If you go

out of line and violate a norm in a community, you will know that fairly

quickly and you will either come back into line or you’re just not going

to stick around very long.

If you can work on these norms of science, argue about evidence,

of ownership, push authority and decision-making down to an

uncomfortable degree, speed, iterate, don’t plan, don’t analyze, build

stuﬀ, get feedback, learn from reality and then openness. Don’t be

defensive. Be willing to pivot. Be willing to admit that you’re wrong.

They show a little vulnerability. Those are the norms that are critical for

# the geek way.

ADI IGNATIUS:

So Bob from our audience is asking, “Is the stack of books on your right

# your reading list for the week?”

ANDREW MCAFEE:

These are from all over the place. But there was a stack of books that I

kept referring to when I was writing The Geek Way, and they were not

business books. I am sorry to admit this as a business book writer.

They were books from this relatively new ﬁeld called cultural evolution,

which gets at this fundamental question, “Why are we the only species

on the planet that builds spaceships?” Nothing else is even close. We’re

really the only ones out there. The octopuses are not going to do it.

The ants, the bees, the chimpanzees are not going to do it. Why are we

## humans the only spaceship-building species on the planet? This ﬁeld

of cultural evolution to me has come up with the best answer to that

question, which is we are the only species that cooperates intensely with

large numbers of people that we’re not related to. We are the species

that learns the quickest, that improves its toolkit, its technologies, its

# cultures most rapidly over time.

You can take that and put that to work in a company. A company is a

large group of mostly unrelated people. And the goal of a company is to

improve its culture, its artifacts, its technologies, its practices over time.

The goal of a company is to practice very rapid cultural evolution. Now

that we know a bit about how cultural evolution happens, we can put

those insights to work.

There’s this massive unexplored opportunity to take the insights from

this ﬁeld and put them to work inside the company. I think it’s so

massive because I haven’t heard anybody talk using cultural evolution’s

terms inside even very geeky companies. This is very, very new stuﬀ.

And I think The Geek Way is the ﬁrst applied business book of cultural

# evolution.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I think I just ﬁgured something out. You’re a total geek.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

We’ve been working together for years. It took you this long to realize

# this?

But the thing that I got obsessed with was that in my career, I’ve spent

a lot of time in the (I hate these labels) old economy and the new

## economy, lots of industrial-era incumbents, and then a lot of companies

clustered in the tech space, clustered on the West Coast.

For my whole career, I have been trying to pattern match and ﬁgure out

what the deep diﬀerences are between the two. Is it the foosball tables?

Is it the hoodies? Is it bringing your dog to work? No, obviously not.

Where the action is in the economy, where the excitement is in the

economy, what are they doing diﬀerently? And The Geek Way contains

my answers to that kind of career long, geeky, head scratching question.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Let’s get practical for our viewers who aren’t in classically geeky

cultures. How can they apply the approaches you’re championing, at

# their own companies?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Here are a few things you can start doing tomorrow that are extremely

geeky practices that will get some traction. When you’re in charge of

your group or you’re a team member or you’re leading a team, if you

say things like, “Oh, that’s a good point. I hadn’t thought of that. Let’s

go that way,” or, “Oh, I was wrong about that. That’s really good to

know,” you have just demonstrated openness and vulnerability instead

# of classic defensiveness.

That’s hard to do. Human beings are inherently defensive people, we

don’t like being shown to be wrong in public. It’s deeply uncomfortable.

But if you model that behavior, it will start to spread. And I’ve seen geek

leaders do that over and over.

You can start to push decisions and responsibility down to a place that

makes you uncomfortable, and to get out of saying, “Just run that by me

ﬁrst,” or, “Make sure I’m included on that,” and try to get rid of the hard

and soft bureaucracy that gets in the way.

I was talking to Sebastian Thrun, who’s an alpha geek in all kinds of

things, and he said, “One of the things I try to get my teams to do is stop

so much communicating.” He had this great image. He said, “A team

works on something, and then they run it up the ﬂagpole.” He said the

really natural tendency is for the people at every layer of the org chart

to add something to that because they want to be part of the solution,

they want to be part of this winning idea. By the time that idea gets

back down to the originating team, it’s unrecognizable. Get out of that

# business.

Again, this is uncomfortable stuﬀ to do, but it’s a big step toward the

geek way. And then ﬁnally, you can start to say, “How are we going

to make this decision? Can we agree on what evidence we’re going to

look at to make this decision?”, as opposed to saying, “Well, I’m the

boss,” or, “I got it right last time, so you should listen to me this time,”

all these other ways we have to make decisions, credentials, hierarchy,

charisma, excellent PowerPoint, all these things: get out of that business

and start asking for the consensus on, “How are we going to settle this

argument? What evidence are we going to look at?” These are all super

geeky practices you can start doing tomorrow.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Here’s another audience question. This is Lori from North Carolina, and

it’s another very practical question: how can organizations get leaders to

unlearn the idea that failure is bad?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

This is a super hard question, and I fall back on something that I

learned from Clay Christensen: one of the things Clay taught me is that

managers are voracious consumers of theory. He said, “Don’t be afraid

to tell them why this needs to change, what the principle, what the

framework is.” And he said, “If you want to get people to change, there’s

a kind of a tripod. There are three things you have to do over and over

again more until you’re absolutely exhausted.”

First of all, tell them a vivid story. We humans respond to narratives.

Second, give them some evidence, give them some numbers to show

that it works. And third, give them a theory. Explain why it works.

You’ve just got to go through all three of those legs.

“Why can’t we make decisions this way? I’m a pretty smart person. I

reached this place on the org chart because of my excellent judgment.

What do you mean we should be relying a lot less on my judgment?”

Again, three part answer to that question, keep iterating on it. It is not

# an easy process.

I think a lot of companies who get interested in what Silicon Valley

does diﬀerently or might want to embrace the geek way are going to

ﬁnd it hard going because a lot of it is unnatural and uncomfortable.

Challenging your boss in a meeting in most circumstances is

uncomfortable, until it becomes a norm, until it becomes what people

around you expect.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I can’t let you go without talking a little bit about generative AI. You

have an article in the next issue of HBR on how businesses can most

eﬀectively capitalize on the technology. What is your thinking, your

quick overview, on the utility of GenAI, and its likely impact on, let’s

# say, the white-collar workforce?

ANDREW MCAFEE:

The more I think about GenAI, the more I think we’re underestimating

its impact. It is so general, it is so powerful, it is improving so quickly,

it’s leading to so many complementary innovations. I have never seen

## the computer science geeks, the economic geeks, and the business geeks

all get so excited about anything in my career, which is actually a

# quarter-century long by this point.

Generative AI is going to change the business world. It’s probably going

to do it quicker than a lot of us are thinking, and waiting around on

the sidelines and not being part of that transformation is a deeply lousy

strategy: get a plan together and then just go do stuﬀ.

ADI IGNATIUS:

All right, Andy, we’ve run a little bit long, so we’re going to cut you

oﬀ here. I could talk all day with you about all these topics, and our

audience is clearly into it and engaged. Thank you very much for being

# on the show.

ANDREW MCAFEE:

Adi, always a pleasure. Thank you for having me.
