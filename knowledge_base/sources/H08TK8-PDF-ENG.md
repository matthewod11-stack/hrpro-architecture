You have to lay off a team member, deliver hard feedback in a tense

meeting, or end the day absorbing the resignation of a top performer.

Each of these moments is emotionally taxing on its own. But taken

supporting teams through crises and global turmoil—they quietly add

# up.

Newly released Gallup data reﬂects this toll. In 2024, global employee

engagement declined for only the second time in over a decade. Unlike

the ﬁrst drop in 2020, however, the drop wasn’t driven by frontline

workers. Instead, it was entirely due to declining engagement among

## managers. In a March 2025 survey by Modern Health, 77% of managers

reported that their role was more challenging now than ever before.

Understandably, leaders focus on managing others through challenging

moments. Faced with external expectations and a genuine desire to

show up for their teams, they direct their attention and energy outward:

guiding, steadying, and responding. But with that external focus and

the nonstop pressure for results, it’s easy for leaders to overlook a

crucial step: processing their own emotional experience. Pressing on

feels eﬃcient, even the only choice to stay aﬂoat amid all the demands

on your time. Indeed, it can feel nearly impossible to process your

emotions when you’re in the thick of it at work. But over time, just

powering through weighty situations without pausing to process your experience can come at a steep cost to your health, eﬀectiveness as a

# leader, and relationships.

Emotional depletion is a real and signiﬁcant tax of modern leadership.

Recovery is no longer a luxury. Instead, it’s a leadership imperative,

critical for protecting your well-being and sustaining your capacity to

lead over the long haul. After a challenging event or period, use these

three proven practices to process your emotions and replenish your

# energy.

Reflect: Don’t just move on—make meaning.

While revisiting weighty times may sound undesirable, taking the

time to reﬂect on them is key to moving forward. When we ignore

or suppress our emotions, they don’t disappear—they accumulate in

the background, resurfacing later as increased stress, reactivity, and

health issues. Reﬂection helps us process and metabolize what we’ve

experienced so that we don’t unintentionally carry it around.

Carve out a few minutes after a challenging moment or day, and ask

# yourself:

- What am I feeling?

- Where do I feel it in my body?

- What are my emotions trying to tell me?

- What do they reveal about what matters to me?

Acknowledge and accept your feelings without judgment. All emotions —even the unpleasant ones like frustration, sadness, or anxiety—oﬀer

## valuable insights into our values, needs, and limits. Judging and

resisting them only escalates the feeling and increases your reactivity.

Consider writing down your responses to these questions. Writing

creates space between you and your emotions, allowing you to identify

meaning and purposeful next steps. Furthermore, research has shown

that writing about your feelings for just 20 minutes a day over three

days can improve both mental and physical health, reduce anxiety,

and even boost job performance. If writing isn’t your cup of tea, try

leaving yourself a voice memo instead. What matters most is giving your

thoughts and true feelings space to surface without editing or ﬁltering.

## Alternatively, share your experience and challenges with a trusted peer

or other sounding board. Social support not only helps us make sense

of and process diﬃcult events but also enhances our resilience to stress,

protects us from burnout, and promotes our mental and physical well-

being. Leadership is often a lonely experience, and having trusted peers,

mentors, and other supports can be a powerful source of connection

# and clarity.

Reﬂection doesn’t require a lot of time. It just takes the discipline to

pause amid the busyness. Even a few intentional minutes can help

you build the self-awareness, emotional intelligence, and resilience essential for eﬀective leadership in today’s complex and challenging

# world.

Reframe: Shift the narrative.

Reappraising emotionally taxing experiences can also speed recovery by

reducing our distress and freeing up our cognitive resources. Reframing

doesn’t mean you’re ignoring the diﬃculty of a situation; instead, it’s

about shifting your perspective to ﬁnd new meaning or possibility.

For example, after successfully leading a major turnaround, my client

Jacob was blindsided by a reorg that reassigned his team and left his

role uncertain. Understandably, he was both frustrated and stressed. But over time, Jacob began to see the situation diﬀerently: as a chance

to recharge after an intense chapter, and an opportunity to stretch into

something new. By ﬁnding a silver lining, Jacob shifted his emotional

state and was able to show up with more steadiness and optimism, while

## the organizational changes and his new role solidiﬁed.

On the backside of a tough event, consider asking:

- What are the possible silver linings in this situation?

- What are the potential long-term beneﬁts despite the short-term costs?

- How can I grow from it, or use it to build something better in the

# future?

When you change the story, you change your experience—and you gain

## access to new energy, insight, and direction.

Sometimes, however, it’s not just the situation that needs reframing;

it’s how you see yourself in relation to it. Many emotionally intense

leadership moments involve performing “necessary evils,” making

decisions or taking actions that cause discomfort or harm to others,

such as delivering tough feedback, letting someone go, restructuring a change-fatigued team, or implementing layoﬀs. Even when these

actions are necessary for the greater good, they can leave leaders feeling

anxious, guilty, and questioning their self-image as a fair and moral

# person.

In these moments, self-compassion is a critical tool. It doesn’t mean

lowering your standards or avoiding responsibility. In fact, research

shows self-compassion improves leadership, increasing emotional

## intelligence, composure under pressure, and resilience. Further, it

enhances our psychological well-being and increases the compassion

we show to others. Practicing self-compassion simply means treating

yourself as you would a friend: acknowledging the challenge,

recognizing anyone in your position might feel the same way, and

responding with kindness instead of criticism.

After hard moments, ask yourself: What would I say to a colleague

struggling with this same situation? Then extend that same support

inward. This quiet act of self-kindness will help you feel better, recover faster, and lead more eﬀectively.

Restore: Replenish your emotional reserves.

When we push through emotionally diﬃcult events without pausing to

recover, we slowly drain our emotional and physical reserves. Over time,

this can lead to emotional exhaustion and damage our mood, health, and eﬀectiveness. Just like athletes need rest after an intense game,

professionals must replenish after emotionally demanding situations at

# work.

## Without replenishment, the risk of burnout and long-term health issues

climbs. Ironically, the more depleted you become, the less likely you are

to engage in the very behaviors that would help. This is known as the

recovery paradox: when you need a break the most, you’re least likely to

take one.

Critically, recovering isn’t just about taking time oﬀ. It’s about engaging

in the right kinds of experiences. Research highlights four that are particularly eﬀective:

- Detachment, or giving your mind a true break. Resist checking email

after hours and avoid replaying the workday in your head.

- Relaxation, or building in moments like taking a walk without your

phone, listening to a calming playlist, or spending quiet time outdoors.

- Mastery, or doing something that challenges you in a positive way.

Try a new recipe, pick up a hobby, or learn something unrelated to

# your role.

- Control, or protecting pockets of time where you choose what to do,

even if it’s just saying no to one more commitment.

If you think you don’t have time to relax, or worry that it might seem

selﬁsh, think again. Research shows that when leaders spend time on

## hobbies, relaxation, or other enjoyable activities after work, both they

and their teams feel and perform better the next day.

Intentionally investing in recovering after an emotionally demanding

stretch isn’t just helpful; it’s essential to leading today. Reﬂecting,

reframing, and restoring don’t just help you reset in the short term; they

also help you build the emotional muscle to handle future challenges

with more steadiness and strength. Because your team doesn’t just need

you today—they need you to last.
