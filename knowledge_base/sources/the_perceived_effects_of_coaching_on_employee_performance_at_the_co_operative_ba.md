# ABSTRACT

The classroom can deliver the knowledge and theory, but the learning takes place through supported problem solving, action planning, application and review that are inherent in coaching. The coach provides the guided conversation, support and challenge needed to enable the coachee to find solutions, change and improve in an individualistic way that works for them. Coaching can have a positive impact on the performance and development of employees and can impart significant competitive advantage to an organization as a whole. This study sought to establish the perceived effect of the coaching on the employee performance at Cooperative Bank of Kenya. The study indeed found out that the employee performance at the bank as measured through the quarterly performance reviews has improved since coaching was commenced. Indeed this is reflected in the overall bank performance as measured by the key performance indicators, has improved over the last four years. The research was conducted during a period of intense organizational change at the Co- operative bank and provides a unique perspective on the value of encouraging coaching behavior by managers to stimulate sustainable organizational performance and improvement. The research provides an insight as to whether managers at the Co-operative bank of Kenya value the effectiveness of a coaching style and what they consider to be the benefits to such a management approach. The study used both primary and secondary data. Primary data was collected from line managers and employees who report to the line managers by way of a questionnaire. This was the most appropriate method of collecting data as it involved the key people involved in coaching and managing employee performance. The study provided an understanding to managers and coaches and supports the view that managers and coaches are receptive to the benefits of a coaching style of management which has the potential to transform workplace dynamics and productivity. Coaching requires a behavioral approach which is relevant to all managers who should recognize this as an integral activity to managing their employees. The effectiveness of coaching is evaluated by the positive changes in behavior in its participants. The implementation of coaching has not been smooth. It has faced challenges thus making it difficult for all the staff to embrace coaching practice. Some of the challenges include inadequate coaching skills, increased workload among the employees and employees not fully embracing coaching. However, the bank has made efforts to mitigate these challenges. The researcher recommends further studies to be done to find out how coaching can be used to enhance employee motivation and career growth. Further studies also need to be done to establish the best coaching practices, how to measure coaching outcomes. The study exposed a gap in evaluating the coaching program.

# CHAPTER ONE: INTRODUCTION

# 1.1.(cid:32) Background of the Study

Traditional forms- of learning for instance formal educational courses and

instructor- led training are still the most popular and widely used methods of training

and development. This is despite the evidence that employees prefer active on –the-

## job methods of learning and highlights something of a mismatch between

## organizational practice and employee preference (CIPD 2005) The Chartered

Institute of Personnel and Development (CIPD) 2005 annual survey report indicates

that expected changes in training and development methods points to a growth in e-

learning and coaching by line managers and more on- the- job methods are also

predicted to increase in use. Management development can, however, encompass a

very wide range of activities, and techniques such as coaching and mentoring are

increasingly being recognized as more effective in management development

# (Robinson, 2006).

Coaching is about developing and enhancing the performance of the individual

which has a direct impact on their performance. The value of coaching is that it is a

way of learning that is highly flexible and individualized. Coaching is becoming an

increasingly popular in learning and development. The main reasons organizations

use coaching are to improve individual performance, deal with under-performance

and improve productivity (CIPD, 2005). Coaching may be delivered by a wide range

of individuals including external providers and line managers, and it is important

that coaches are selected in line with organizational requirements and the needs of

individuals. It is therefore important that coaches have appropriate skills and are

(cid:49)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

trained for the coaching role. Despite the widespread popularity and growth in

coaching, there are issues about the management and delivery of coaching in an

organization setting. Few organizations have a policy, with the result that coaching

can be an ad hoc activity with a concentration on senior management (Marchington

# and Wilkinson, 2005).

## Recent challenges such as globalization, a knowledge-based economy, and

technological evolution, have encouraged many organizations to seek new ways to

maintain competitive advantage. In response, the prevailing sense is that the success

depends in large part on the people with higher levels of individual competence.

People are becoming valuable assets and can be recognized within a framework of

human capital. The research therefore will be guided by the Human Capital Theory

which is an influential economic theory of education and a key determinant of

economic performance. Individuals are viewed as human capital together with other

economic representations such as technological change, research, innovation,

# 1.1.1.(cid:32)The Concept of Perception

The process of perception is a key factor in individual behaviour. (Buchanan and

## Huczynski, 2004) define perception as the dynamic psychological process

responsible for attending to, organising and interpreting sensory data. Essentially

perception relates to the way in which we make sense of our environment and

interpret and respond to events and people in the environment around us. We are

constantly subjected to a wide range of sensory data which requires sifting, sorting

and interpreting and our perceptual process enables us to focus on certain stimuli

that are significant to us and to ignore others (Robinson, 2006). It is thus our

(cid:50)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

# personal perception of our social and physical environment that shapes and directs

## our behaviour rather than some objective understanding of external reality.

Gikuya (2014) argues that employees are constantly going to assign meaning to the

human resource policies that govern their daily working lives and individual

attitudes in turn, tend to accumulate into unit- wide perceptions. To achieve desired

organizational outcomes, it is important to have not only the right human resource

## practices but the right employee perceptions to those practices.

# 1.1.2.(cid:32)The Concept of Coaching

Grant (2001) defines Coaching as a collaborative, solution-focused, result-

orientated systematic process, used with normal, non-clinical populations, in which

the coach facilitates the enhancement of the coachee’s life experience and

# performance in various domains and fosters self-directed learning, personal growth

and goal attainment of the coachee. Coaching is a regular series of training or

## development sessions where an experienced employee with considerable expertise

guides a trainee. Since coaching takes place on a one- to-one basis, it provides a

more intense training and learning experience customized to the specific needs of

the individual. It is a more formal and regulated method of passing on expertise

through on- the-job training and hence coaches have to be specially selected and

trained to train so as to pass on their skills and knowledge effectively. The main

reasons organizations use coaching are to improve individual performance, deal

with under-performance and improve productivity. The key features of coaching as

highlighted by Robinson (2006) are; coaching is a relatively short-term activity, it

is time bound, it focuses on improving performance and developing individual skills,

(cid:51)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

coaching works on the premise that employees are self-aware and do not need

clinical intervention among others. Coaching is a widespread tool but there is a lack

of established standards, professional bodies and qualification frameworks.

As it applies to the workplace, however, coaching is a much more recent

development. There has been individualized training in the form of apprenticeships

for hundreds of years, but the earliest form of such coaching as we know it today

was called “developmental counseling” (Flory, 1965). Kampa-Kokesch and

Anderson (2001) report that from 1940 to 1979, coaching tended to be performed

by organization consultants. During this initial period, coaches were primarily

psychologists and organization development (OD) professionals who were focused

on OD issues. There was often an informal aspect to it.

From 1980 to 1994, the field of coaching experienced rapid growth, quickly

expanding into many new areas of service (life coaching, outplacement, career

coaching, etc.). According to Hudson (1999), the field was accelerated by

complexities associated with increased downsizing, mergers, acquisitions, and

outplacement. The leader’s role evolved to deal with rising levels of ambiguity and

pressures to perform in an increasingly global context. Top managers were asked to

be both strategic decision makers and masters of the “soft” skills required to

effectively manage people (Sherman & Freas, 2004). From 1995 to the present, the

amount of executive and workforce coaching has continued to grow. There has been

an increase in the number of publications devoted to coaching, in organizations that

offer training to coaches, in the establishment of coaching organizations, and in the

focus placed on coaching research by academia.

(cid:52)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

# 1.1.3.(cid:32)Employee Performance

Armstrong and Baron (1998) define performance management system as a process

which contributes to the effective management of individuals and teams in order to

# achieve high

## levels of organizational performance Effective performance

management systems provides employees with direction and support in carrying out

their responsibilities and has a positive impact on worker satisfaction and other

employee outcomes. The results are increased innovation, higher level of customer

service and lower turnover of employees (Obwaya, 2010). Poor performance is

addressed through the development of goals with the employee and periodic

feedback on how to achieve the goals. Gaps in knowledge and skills is addressed

# though training programs.

Abdi (2008) states that employee performance management system seeks to create

a new performance culture which places greater emphasis on the importance of

## motivation, development and optimal utilization of human resources towards the

achievement of a client focused and results oriented policy framework. Employee

performance management helps individuals and teams achieve their specific

objectives in order to succeed in organizational roles, develop their skills.

Training encourages good performance, strengthens job related skills and

competencies and helps employees to keep up with change in the work place.

Evaluating employees development needs has increased the capacity of employees

to perform through multiple intervention process that includes training, coaching,

mentoring, counselling, guiding, giving assignments that introduces new skills or

higher levels of responsibility and improving work processes (Obwaya, 2010).

## 1.1.4.(cid:32)The Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd

The Co-operative Bank of Kenya (Co-op Bank) is one of Kenya’s fastest growing

banks. It is currently one of the five largest financial institutions in the country. The

bank has been in business for over four decades. After recovering from substantial

losses in 2000, Co-op Bank saw an impressive turnaround and has been on the

upswing ever since. Initially the bank was registered under the Co-operative

Societies Act in 1965, Co-op Bank did not actually see its first year of business until

- 1968. In 2008, Co-op Bank resolved to incorporate under the Companies Act. This

qualified the bank for listing on the Nairobi Stock Exchange, which occurred in

December of 2008. Since then, the bank has seen incredible growth. The number of

accountholders and branches skyrocketed. The bank’s rapid and steady growth

prompted its inclusion in the Nairobi Stock Exchange 20-Share Index in 2009. In

both 2010 and 2011, the bank received recognition in the Financial Times of

London magazine as Best Bank in Kenya. In 2011, the bank also received the Best

## in Corporate Governance Award at the Annual Financial Reporting (FiRe) awards.

In 2013, the bank received recognition as the Most Green Bank at the 2013 Energy

Management Awards. It has also greatly increased its customer base from 125,000

to 4 million. Its branch network also grew from 30 branches to over 130 with over

# 4,000 employees.

According to the 2014 annual report and financial statements the bank engaged

McKinsey and Company- a global consultancy company in August 2014 to perform

a growth and efficiency review of the banks business. Subsequently the bank

commenced the soaring eagle transformation project intended to re-tool and re-

energize the business for superior competiveness in the banking sector. The

(cid:54)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

transformation also focused on improving staff productivity by adopting a new

performance management tool based on leaner key performance indicators that are

aligned to strategy.

# 1.2.(cid:32) Research Problem

The emergence and development of human capital as an academic field has seen

researchers attempt to clarify how the human capital can contribute to sociopolitical

## development and freedom (Alexander, 1996; Grubb & Lazerson, 2004; Sen, 1999).

Professionals have become interested in best practices in the field of coaching

because the area is so open and relatively unregulated, organizations want to know

which practices result in the best organizational outcomes. Employers also would

like to know how best to evaluate coaching programs. Just over half (52%) of the

## respondents to the AMA/Institute for Corporate Productivity Coaching Survey 2008

reported that they currently have coaching programs in place in their organizations.

What’s more, of the 48% that don’t offer coaching at this time, 37% plan to

implement a coaching program in the future. There doesn’t appear to be a universal

methodology for evaluating coaching benefits (Leedham, 2005). Of the existing

coaching evaluation methods, some are based purely on the perception of the

recipient, which can be an unreliable gauge.

An assessment on previous studies in the field of training are limited to formal

educational courses and instructor led training methods. Local Studies include;

Onyango (2012) who conducted a study on The Influence of training and

development on employee’s performance and found out training and development

has a positive impact on employee performance in terms of productivity. Another

(cid:55)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

study by Cephas (2013) on the training interventions on performance found that

there is a direct correlation between training and performance. Ngugi (2014) carried

a study on the perceived relationship between training and development and

employee performance and found out that training and development has an

influence on the employee performance. Training and development helps

employees work together as teams, ensure harmony and consistency across the

teams and this helps improve performance (Musili 2010).

This research therefore seeks to address some of the knowledge gaps in the

development of the coaching discipline in Kenyan organizations. It mainly focuses

on coaching practices in organizations with the hope that it will address the question,

is there a relationship between coaching and employee performance?

# 1.3.(cid:32) Research Objective

The objective of this study was to establish the perceived effects of coaching on

## employee performance at The Co-operative Bank of Kenya Ltd.

# 1.4.(cid:32) Value of the Study

The study will be of significance to the bank management as it would uncover the

impact of coaching to driving and managing employee performance. The results of

the study will guide the bank management in formulating policies and business

processes that are supportive of coaching as a strategy to improve performance.

The results of the study will also assist the employees in the bank to appreciate and

embrace coaching in the organization in order to embed a high performance culture

in the organization. The results of the study may also be applied to other

(cid:56)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

organizations in the banking industry to consider coaching to improve the

# performance.

Finally, other researchers may use information and knowledge provided in the study

as a reference or for further research in the area of training and development. The

Study will provide information that will be used by scholars as a basis for further

research and add to the existing body of knowledge. Scholars can undertake further

## studies on the various categories of disciplines.

# CHAPTER TWO: LITERATURE REVIEW

2.1(cid:32)

# Introduction

In this chapter relevant literature by different authors has been reviewed on coaching

and employee performance. The chapter seeks to provide the conceptual framework

necessary for coaching and the best practices for coaching.

## 2.2(cid:32) Theoretical Foundations for the Study

The research will be guided by two theories that have helped explain the relationship

between coaching and performance.

# 2.2.1(cid:32) Human Capital Theory

Human-capital theory is a modern extension of Adam Smith's explanation of wage

differentials by the so-called net (dis)advantages between different employments

(Fitzsimons, 1999). Schultz (1961) recognized the human capital as one of

important factors for a national economic growth in the modern economy. Frank &

Bemanke (2007) define that human capital is ‘an amalgam of factors such as

education, experience, training, intelligence, energy, work habits, trustworthiness,

and initiative that affect the value of a worker's marginal product’. The costs of

learning the job are a very important component of net advantage and have led

economists to claim that, other things being equal, personal incomes vary according

to the amount of investment in human capital; that is, the education and training

undertaken by individuals or groups of workers. A further expectation is that

# widespread investment in human capital creates in the labour-force the skill-base

# indispensable for economic growth.

(cid:49)(cid:48)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

Training is the component of human capital that workers acquire after schooling,

often associated with some set of skills useful for a particular industry, or useful

with a particular set of technologies. There is a widespread belief that learning is the

core factor to increase the human capital. In other words, learning is an important

component to obtain much knowledge and skills through lots of acquisition ways

including relationship between the individual and the others (Sleezer, Conti, Nolan,

2003). At some level, training is very similar to schooling in that the worker, at least

to some degree, controls how much to invest. But it is also much more complex,

since it is difficult for a worker to make training investments by himself. The firm

also needs to invest in the training of the workers, and often ends up bearing a large

fraction of the costs of these training investments. The role of the firm is even greater

once we take into account that training has a significant “matching” component in

the sense that it is most useful for the worker to invest in a set of specific

technologies that the firm will be using in the future. So training is often a joint

# investment by firms and workers.

Critics of the human-capital theory however point to the difficulty of measuring key

concepts, including future income and the central idea of human capital itself. Not

all investments in education guarantee an advance in productivity as judged by

employers or the market. In particular, there is the problem of measuring both

worker productivity and the future income attached to career openings, except in

## near-tautological fashion by reference to actual earnings differences which the

theory purports to explain. Empirical studies have suggested that, though some of

the observed variation in earnings is likely to be due to skills learned, the proportion

of unexplained variance is still high, and must be an attribute of the imperfect

(cid:49)(cid:49)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

# structure and functioning of the labour-market, rather than of the productivities of

the individuals constituting the labour supply.

## 2.2.2(cid:32) Cognitive Behavioral Theory

Cognitive Behavioral Theory (CBT) integrates behavioral theory with cognitive

theory. Behavior theory argues that learning occurs through an observable

association between a stimulus and a response. BF Skinner, described reinforced or

operant conditioning, which is the process of behavior modification when the

behavior is a result of a consequence. Cognitive theory describes the importance of

the thinking and choice in determining behaviors including our perception of the

meaning of events. Cognitive theory was pioneered by Albert Ellis, who

subsequently developed Rational Emotive Ellis created the ABC theory of

personality, which is the concept of an antecedent or an activating (A) event, a

behavior (B) that occurs from that event, and finally the consequence (C) of that

event Ducharme (2004). If you can understand your thoughts about the event, then

you can change your behaviors and therefore the consequences that come about due

to your future behaviors. As aspiring coaches, we can question our clients about

their beliefs about an event so they may become aware of irrational thoughts that

could be contributory factors to engaging in unhelpful behaviors.

CBT and its approaches to therapy have been widely adopted in the coaching field

wherein clients are encouraged to identify and re-evaluate self-defeating thoughts

and engage in more effective ways of thinking, and therefore behaving (McMahon,

2007). Coaching in this area is more issue focused and examines a specific event

and developmental need of the client (Ducharme, 2004). Once the critical activating

(cid:49)(cid:50)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

event or situation that is causing the client’s distress has been identified, it is

important to use cognitive restructuring to replace negative or maladaptive thoughts

with positive ones. Another key aspect of CBT is the assignment to the client of

homework that will keep them engaged and encourages ownership of the process.

CBT can induce demonstrable behavior change through objective-setting and

homework that must be completed by the client through self-observation, self-

# reinforcement, and self-maintenance.

# 2.3(cid:32) Coaching Practices

The success of coaching in any organization will depend on many factors that are

difficult to standardize, such as corporate culture and attitudes toward coaching.

However the best practices of coaching programs can be discussed under the

GROW Model. The grow model has proved successful in many organizations and

it forms the most common basis of coaching in many organizations. Whitmore

(1992) in his book Coaching for Performance identifies the need to adopt the

GROW model in coaching. The GROW model is an acronym standing for Goals,

Reality, Options, Will. By working through the four stages the model raises an

## individual awareness and understanding of their own aspirations, their current

situation and beliefs, the possibilities and resources open to them and finally the

actions they want to take to achieve their personal and professional goals.

(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

In the first stage, the skilled coach invites the employee to identify what he sees as

the key goals for the planning period for instance six months. The goals should be

selected within the broad context of the organization and departmental goals and

should be framed to reflect what the employee feels will be possible to deliver. The

goals may initially be expressed as end results. The coach asks questions to raise

awareness not to criticize or challenge. If the goals first selected are vague, hard to

measure or completely unrelated to the job, then the coach will seek clarification

(Whitmore, 1992). Organizations that simply have a well-defined purpose are more

likely to report coaching success than those organizations that aren’t sure what their

purposes in coaching are. According to Collins (2001) in the management Good to

Great, improvements in both leadership development and retention rates are

essential in getting the “right people on the bus,” which is a consistent precursor to

improvements in gaining a competitive advantage in the marketplace. Stone (2007)

notes that heightened productivity is one of several benefits attained through

coaching interventions.

(cid:49)(cid:52)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

The second stage is to raise the employee self-awareness of all the factors

underlying and surrounding present performance against the goal (Robinson, 2006).

The employee will rate themselves in relation to the goals and determine whether

the set goals are realistic. This will trigger the employee to realize the factors that

have been preventing progress.

With the goal and reality understood by the employee, the coach help the employee

determine what they can do. This is aimed at helping the employee generate as many

ideas as possible without evaluating them in any way yet.

Once the employee is satisfied with the number of options the coach can ask how

the options will be evaluated. The coach and the employee will agree who will write

up the key points especially the goal and the action plan for both parties. There

doesn’t appear to be a universal methodology for evaluating coaching benefits

(Leedham, 2005). Of the existing coaching evaluation methods, some are based

purely on the perception of the recipient, which can be an unreliable gauge. The

most prevalent method used to evaluate coaching is soliciting the coachee’s reaction

to the service through a self-report. Sometimes a second level of evaluation is added

through ratings completed by others during and after coaching. What are usually

missing, however, are measures of behavioral changes brought on by coaching.

These can be determined by obtaining ratings by team or peers over a one- to three-

month period of time. An even higher level of evaluation can be attained by

measuring the impact of coaching on the organization or business. Data such as sales

increases, retention, satisfaction, promotion, and so forth, are generally required to

(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

do this and must be done over a much longer time frame such as one to two years

(MacKie, 2007).

The implementation of the GROW Model, by using carefully structured questions,

promotes a deeper awareness and responsibility and encourages proactive behavior,

as well as resulting in practical techniques to accomplish goals and overcome

obstacles. The use of continuous and progressive coaching skills support provides

the structure which ultimately helps to unlock an individual’s true potential by

increasing confidence and motivation, leading to both short- and long-term benefits.

The GROW Model has been seen to yield higher productivity, improved

communication, better interpersonal relationships and a better quality working

# environment.

## 2.4(cid:32) Coaching and Employee Performance

Evaluating employee performance can provide management with information

necessary for the success of the organization (Nzuve 2010). The evaluation can

## reveal strengths and weaknesses of the personnel and indicate areas in which

training, transfers, or recruitment is needed. The appraisal can also give feedback

about the effectiveness of supervision. A person learns most effectively at work

when he associates what he is learning with his job. By learning about a job and

improving his skills, he should improve his performance and waste less time on

trivial detail and repeating work. Feedback is often provided to employees formally

# through performance appraisals

Coaching is concerned with creating conditions so that people can perform to the

best of their ability (Richard, 1995). In coaching the learner receives instant

(cid:49)(cid:54)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

feedback about their performance, this reinforces success and helps them to quickly

correct any mistakes. Coaching therefore accelerates the performance improvement

processes. Coaching helps leaders to bring out the best in employees throughout the

organization and they begin to embrace and engage in critical thinking. Employees

at all levels accept ownership and accountability for their work product and

relationships. They require less daily and direct supervision from managers as they

develop their skills and strive to reach their full potential.

Coaching to improve or increase performance usually includes an urgent need. For

example, often bad behaviour needs to stop or a new behaviour must be ramped up

in a compressed time frame for a job role (Homan and Miller, 2013). In both

scenarios, it is critical that a manager (or an HR representative) be involved to refine

the goals and focus for performance coaching. In the case of problem behaviour,

there needs to be a documented message to the individual about what is at stake.

The individual receiving coaching must have clarity about what he or she stands to

lose or gain by accepting the influence of a coach and by making specific change.

In other words, the consequences must be spelled out.

# Summary

Coaching is a means for developing a partnership between the manager and

employee that creates a shared understanding about what needs to be achieved and

how it is to be achieved. This research was guided by two theories that helped

explain the relationship between coaching and performance. For coaching to be

effective, the best coaching practices need to be applied. The GROW model has

proved successful in organizations that carry out coaching.

(cid:49)(cid:55)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

The literature confirms that there is a direct relationship between coaching and

employee performance. Organizations that use coaching are more effective in their

# performance.

# CHAPTER THREE: RESEARCH METHODOLOGY

3.1(cid:32)

# Introduction

This chapter describes how the research was conducted. It explains the research

design, population sample used and the sampling methods applied. It also explains

the data collection methods applied and how the data was analyzed to produce the

required information for this study.

# 3.2(cid:32) Research design

The research was descriptive in nature. The object of descriptive research is to

portray an accurate profile of persons, events or situations. Mugenda and Mugenda

(2003), a descriptive design is adequate in describing phenomena, attitude, values

and characteristics. A survey strategy was employed to allow the researcher to

collect quantitative data. According to Sanders (2007), the survey strategy is usually

associated with the deductive approach. It is most frequently used to answer who,

what, where, how much and how many. Surveys are often used to collect a large

## amount of data from a sizable population.

# 3.3(cid:32) Target Population

The total workforce of Co-operative bank is 4,260 working under 120 different

branches and departments namely; Finance and Administration, Retail banking,

## Institutional and Corporate banking, Human resources, Legal and Sacco banking

# divisions.

3.4(cid:32) Sampling design

Out of the 120 branches the researcher selected 20 top performing branches from

which respondents were drawn. Stratified sampling was used to get five respondents

(cid:49)(cid:57)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

from the selected branches; two line managers and three employees who report to

# the line manager.

# 3.5(cid:32) Data collections Methods

Primary data was collected through questionnaires which were administered

electronically. The questionnaires were distributed via e-mail link. Multiple

questions on coaching using the Likert-type scale with a 1 rating designated as’’

Strongly Agree’’ and a 5 rating designated as ‘Strongly Disagree’.

# Secondary data such as bank profitability, customer satisfaction surveys and data

related to employee performance was obtained from company financial reports,

## information from the company website, and Co-operative bank employee

# performance reports.

# 3.6(cid:32) Data Analysis

Descriptive statistics such as percentages were used to analyze the quantitative data.

The results were presented in bar charts and line graphs.

# 3.7(cid:32) Summary

The research design used in the study was descriptive in nature. The sample for the

study was obtained through stratified sampling where five respondents were

identified from the 20 top performing branches. Both primary and secondary data

collections methods were used in the study.

(cid:32)

(cid:50)(cid:48)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

## CHAPTER FOUR: DATA ANALYSIS AND INTERPRETATION

# OF RESULTS(cid:32)

# 4.1(cid:32) Overview

This chapter presents the analysis and findings of the study. It provides general

information gathered from the respondents in determining the perceived effects of

## the Coaching on Employee performance at The Co-operative Bank of Kenya. Two

Line managers and two employees from each of the 20 branches were asked to

respond to the questionnaire. The questionnaire was designed to capture data

relating to two key areas of coaching. The first was the primary coaching practices

comprising of goal setting, successful planning, effective feedback processes as

practised by line managers and support and development. The second part focused

on the impact of coaching on employee performance.

## 4.2(cid:32) Coaching Practices at Cooperative Bank

Coaching is widely used in the organization. The respondents confirmed to be using

coaching more than they did in the past. Coaching has been accepted by line

managers and is viewed as an integral and essential part of the manager’s core

competences. From the survey the key coaching practices that are used include;

Planning and Goal setting, focus on performance, effective feedback process,

# support and development.

# 4.2.1(cid:32) Planning and Goal Setting

The responses to this practice were captured in question A2, A5 and A7. As shown

in figure 4.2.1, the respondents acknowledged that coaching sessions are done on a

face-to-face sessions which is a standard practice in coaching. This has had a

(cid:50)(cid:49)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

positive impact on goal achievement. Clarifying the purpose of coaching and setting

the desired goals was associated to the success of coaching. Most Coachees

responded that they were satisfied with progress they had made against their goals.

A majority of the line managers indicated that if the coachee’s commitment is low,

goals are reviewed or actions are agreed that will build commitment to the original

goal. The respondents overwhelmingly agreed that through coaching they are able

to discuss on the development goals and actions plans to achieve the goals. This is

illustrated in the figure below.

## Figure 4.2.1: Planning and goal setting responses

The findings indicate that the more a coach has a clear reason for using a coaching,

the more likely that its coaching process will be viewed as successful. The fact that

each of the goals was significantly correlated with coaching success suggests that

organizations that simply have a well-defined purpose are more likely to report

(cid:50)(cid:50)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

coaching success than those organizations that aren’t sure what their purposes in

coaching are.

# 4.2.2(cid:32) Focus on Performance

This responses to this measure are contained in question A3 and A10. As illustrated

in figure 4.2.2, the survey found out that line managers recognized the importance

of coaching on improving performance. Performance reviews are done on a

quarterly basis. 100% of the respondents acknowledged that the appraisals are done

quarterly. Coaching is focused primarily on underperforming employees to improve

their performance, increase their capability and helping them to feel motivated to

develop and progress. On the question of whether coaching is used as an integrated

part of a training and development program to improve employee performance and

skills, the responses were split. Some respondents felt that it should and others it

should not. This is shown in the figure below.

(cid:50)(cid:51)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

## Figure 4.2.2: Focus on performance responses

The findings indicate that coaching is associated with higher performance.

Respondents from the organization that used coaching reported that the organization

had higher levels of success in the area of coaching and are performing well in the

market, as determined by self-reports in the combined areas of revenue growth,

## market share, profitability, and customer satisfaction.

# 4.2.3(cid:32) Effective Feedback Process

The results of the survey found out that coachees are given an opportunity to

participate in the coaching sessions by asking questions rather than the coaches

providing questions. 71% of the respondents did confirm that constant feedback is

provided to the coachees regarding their performance. Assessments are conducted

at the beginning of a coaching program and continuous feedback was provided.

These responses were captured in question 6A and 8A of the questionnaire. The

results are illustrated in the figure 4.2.3 below.

(cid:50)(cid:52)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

## Figure 4.2.3: Effective feedback responses

Evaluating coaching’s performance through effective feedback may help boost

success rates. The more frequently respondents reported using a measurement

method, the more likely they were to report success in their coaching programs.

# 4.2.4(cid:32) Support and Development

The survey found out that a majority of the line managers had not been trained as

coaches. 85% of the respondents acknowledged having not received a training on

coaching. They however did agree that coaching is part of the line manager’s core

competencies and they should support and develop the coachees. The line

managers are receptive to the coaching practices and are raising awareness of

coaching within the workplace. These responses were captured in question 1A, 4A

and 9A and are illustrated in the figure 4.2.4 below.

(cid:50)(cid:53)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

## Figure 4.2.4: Support and development responses

Coaching is an integrated part of a training and development program. This method

is associated with coaching success. The findings also suggest that organizations

that want to train internal coaches should consider internal as well as externally

coaching programs.

4.3(cid:32)

# Improvement in Individual Performance

The respondents who had undergone a coaching program were unanimous in their

responses that their performance has improved tremendously which in turn has

impacted on the overall performance of the bank. The key perspectives of individual

performance include financial, customer, internal business processes and learning

# and growth perspectives.

(cid:50)(cid:54)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

# 4.3.1(cid:32) Financial Perspective

The improvement in employee performance had a ripple effect on the bank’s overall

performance. As illustrated in figure 4.3.3.1 below 94% of the respondents

overwhelmingly agreed that the overall performance of the bank, as measured by

profit before tax, has significantly improved. These responses were captured

# through question 8B and 10B.

Figure 4.3.1.1: The bank’s overall performance responses

The bank’s overall performance for the last four years is shown in figure 4.3.1.2

below. This improved performance confirms that engaged and high performing

employees make organizations more profitable.

(cid:50)(cid:55)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

(cid:32)

Figure 4.3.1.2: The bank’s profitability for the last four years

The findings indicate that coaching’s impact on the overall reported performance of

the organization (as opposed to performance of individuals) is also associated with

coaching success. When the bottom-line impact that coaching has on the overall

business, the association with coaching success is strong and positive

# 4.3.2(cid:32) Customer Perspective

The results of the survey indicated an increase in customer satisfaction and quality

of service offered by the employees. This has led to reduced customer churn rate

thus enabling steady growth of customers. These responses were captured in

question 5B and 7B. The analysis of these responses is as shown in figure 4.3.2

# below

(cid:50)(cid:56)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

## Figure 4.3.2: Improvement in Customer perspective

## 4.3.3(cid:32) Internal Business Processes Perspective

The results of the survey indicated an improvement in coachee’s skills, knowledge

and competencies. 87% of the respondents agreed that through coaching they are

able to identify their strengths and weaknesses. This removes the element of surprise

from performance reviews for coached employees who have already been apprised

of their strengths and weaknesses. Clearly, the stigma of coaching as a consequence

for poor performance is changing, as evidenced by the fact that almost as many

respondents view coaching as an engagement tool as they do a way to address

workplace problems. The respondents also agreed that they have been able to

acquire requisite skills, knowledge and competencies to enable them do their work.

Improvement in these skills and competencies are reflected in the efficiency of the

employees. These responses were captured in the questions 1B, 2B and 6B. The

analysis of the responses is shown in the figure 4.3.3 below.

(cid:50)(cid:57)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

## Figure 4.3.3: Internal Business Processes Perspective

## 4.3.4(cid:32) Learning and Growth Perspective

According to figure 4.3.4. below, about 70% of the respondents acknowledged that

through coaching they have been able to achieve their set career and performance

goals. They have shown steady progress in attaining these set goals. Their attitudes

have improved and also their leadership skills.

(cid:51)(cid:48)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

## Figure 4.3.4: Learning and growth perspective

The findings indicate that individuals are much more likely to regard coaching in a

positive light if they associate coaching with learning, and are already enthusiastic

about their own personal development. Coaching develops leaders not for

leadership’s sake but for the purpose of improving both individual and

organizational performance. Coaching has also enabled the coachees meet their

training needs. Improvement in these skills and competencies are reflected in the

performance of the employees. These responses were captured in the questions 3B,

# 4B and 9B.

# 4.4(cid:32) Summary

The research findings confirm that coaching practices are used at Cooperative Bank

of Kenya. These practices include: planning and goal setting, focus on performance,

feedback process and support and development. The coachees and coaches

acknowledged that they employs these practices and this has resulted in improved

# employee performance.

(cid:51)(cid:49)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

Through coaching, the respondents acknowledged that the individual employee

performance and the overall organizational performance has improved. The bank’s

performance has improved over the years as shown by profit before tax (PBT).

(cid:51)(cid:50)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

# CHAPTER FIVE: SUMMARY, CONCLUSION AND

# RECOMMENDATIONS

5.1(cid:32)

# Introduction

This chapter provides a summary of the research conclusions. It also offers a number

# of recommendations useful to the line managers, scholars, policy makers and human

resources practitioners who may want to implement coaching in their organizations

in order to improve their performance.

# 5.2(cid:32) Summary

This study sought find out the effects of coaching on the performance of

Cooperative Bank of Kenya. The study targeted the line managers who are involved

in the managing of employee performance and also the coachees who are managed

by the line managers. The study used primary data which was collected using a

questionnaire that was sent out to eighty respondents in 20 branches. Data was

edited for completeness and consistency. Secondary data was also used to provide

the bank’s annual performance to show trends in performance.

The survey found out that improving individual performance and productivity,

addressing leadership development and succession planning, and increasing

individual worker skill levels, were identified as some of reasons for coaching in

the organization. Coaching was however primarily focused on under performances

with the intent to facilitate the remediation of this poor performance to acceptable

# performance levels.

(cid:51)(cid:51)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

The bank has made tremendous effort to inculcate the coaching culture in the

organization. The bank has embarked on the training of line managers to equip them

with appropriate coaching skills. Coaching is now regarded as a core competency

among the managers. The staff at all levels have been implored to embrace coaching

as means to manage the staff performance. As coaching continues its evolution in

the bank, there appears to be a trend from managers being coached to managers

being coaches.

The bank has a Leadership and Management Centre has is tasked with providing

training for the employees. The skills learned from T&D compliments the coaching

efforts this accelerating both employee and organizational performance. The

employees are also encouraged to further their studies and also undertake

professional certifications to augment their skills and improve their performance.

Lack of time for employee’s participation, Questionable expertise of coaches,

Unwillingness of employees to engage in the coaching process are some of the

barriers associated with coaching. However, the bank has made efforts to mitigate

these challenges through education on the importance of coaching, allocating time

and number of coaching sessions to be done.

# 5.3(cid:32) Conclusion

Coaching is most frequently used as a remediation of poor performance. The bank

is committed to facilitate the embedding of a high performance culture by ensuring

inconsistent performers are given the necessary support for purposes of improving

their performance. The line managers are tasked with the responsibility of driving

and managing performance through coaching. The results showed that there is a

(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

significant relationship between using coaches for these groups and coaching

# success.

The coaching programs have impacted positively on employees and facilitated

behavioural changes in some key leadership competencies, such as self-awareness,

emotional intelligence and strategic thinking. Participants reported that coaching

impacted on their focus, goal setting and self-confidence which are associated with

# leadership and personal effectiveness.

There is a tendency to resort to using resources within the organization (developing

training courses and using existing internal coaches to provide the training) when

training internal coaches. The results of this survey suggest that, individual

productivity and engagement should be assessed, given their stronger association

with coaching success.

The results of this survey suggest that, individual productivity and engagement is

evaluated through regular meetings with the employees to review their progress

against set objectives.

# 5.4(cid:32) Limitations of the study

Out of the 100 intended respondents only 80 respondents from 20 branches

submitted their questionnaires. The sample size was also not large enough due to

time constraints. This left out valuable contribution from the respondents in the

remaining branches and head office units who are involved in coaching. These

respondents could have added more information to the study.

(cid:51)(cid:53)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

The study was focused on only one organization Cooperative Bank of Kenya. It

therefore may not be representative of all organization in the country. However it

has taken into account other views along theoretical analysis.

# 5.5(cid:32) Recommendations

The recommendations to the study includes both suggestions to Cooperative Bank

Management as well as other human resources practitioners that wish to implement

coaching in their organizations to manage the performance of their employees.

Given the significant impact of coaching on employee performance a number of

coaching sessions should be included in the training and development program for

the organization. The inclusion of coaching should not have to be limited to

improving employee’s performance on their current job. It should be designed to

meet the goals of the organization as well as those of the employees.

A personal analysis should be done before commencing coaching to determine if

the employee is ready for the program. The line manager should examine the

employee’s current performance against the standard to help them identify strengths,

weaknesses and needs. Records such as customer complaints, absenteeism,

productivity reports can be used to determine the employee’s needs

The line managers should undergo regular training to acquire skills and best

practices in coaching. This will assist them in identifying the specific job

performance skills needed and developing specific measurable and performance

# objectives.

(cid:51)(cid:54)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

The impact of coaching program should be evaluated. The line managers should

compare the benefits of coaching with the objectives that were set before coaching

commenced. This can be reflected through performance ratings, and employees’

reaction to the benefits of coaching

# 5.6(cid:32) Area of further studies

This study will pave the way to a clearer understanding of the possibilities of

employee coaching and its practice. Further research should be conducted into the

barriers line managers face in giving feedback on, and offering support in,

leadership development. Given the importance of the line manager/developing

leader relationship, follow up strategies should be implemented to reduce these

barriers. Also further studies need to be done on measuring the success of coaching

# programs.

5.7(cid:32)

## Implication of the study on policy, theory and practice

This study is of great significance to the Co-operative Bank of Kenya. The findings

of the study clearly show that there is a link between coaching and employee

performance. The bank can use the recommendations of this study to strategically

come up with newer initiatives that will enable it sustain the performance in the face

# of stiff competition.

Human Resource Managers can also use this study to re-examine their training and

development programs and come up strategies that will enhance employee

performance. The study brings out the best practices to be employed when coaching

to reduce the challenges associated with coaching. The practices of coaching found

(cid:51)(cid:55)(cid:32)

(cid:32)

in this study are applicable to all organizations with training and development

# programs.

The researchers in the area of coaching will find this study more useful. The study

provides a reference point for those researchers intending to carry out further studies

in this area. The study has provided a theoretical framework upon which further

studies can be done. It also provides an opportunity for the researchers to come with

theories supporting the relationship between coaching and performance of

# organisations.

In terms of practice, the results of the study will also assist the employees in the

bank and in other organisations to appreciate the importance of goal setting during

coaching in helping them achieve their career development goals.

# Dear Sir/Madam

# RE: MBA RESEACH PROJECT

I am a post graduate student at the University of Nairobi pursuing an MBA-Human

Resources Management course. In partial fulfilment of the course requirements, I am

undertaking a research on “The Perceived Effect of Coaching on Employee

## Performance at Cooperative Bank of Kenya”

I kindly request you to grant me an opportunity for an interview to gather information

regarding the research topic to enable me complete the project. The information to be

gathered is needed purely for academic research purpose and will therefore be treated

# with utmost confidentiality.

Your assistance in facilitating the same will be highly appreciated.

Yours faithfully,

## Evelyn B. Bwengi Prof. S.N.M Nzuve Student Supervisor
