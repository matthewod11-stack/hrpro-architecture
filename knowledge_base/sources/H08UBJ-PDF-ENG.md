circulated next quarter’s projections, and something feels oﬀ: Demand

is wobbling, and costs are creeping up, yet the forecasted curve still

rockets upward. Everyone knows the company needs an upbeat story

and that suppliers and investors require rosy numbers. You glance

around the room and sense that no one wants to be the naysayer. Do

you speak up about the risks, or quietly “go along” with the optimistic

# spin?

Economists label situations when a decision‑maker’s personal stake in the outcome threatens to cloud objective judgment as “conﬂict of

interest.” Employees might just call it “doing what it takes” or “being

a team player.” It’s what happens when incentives or group dynamics

push people—even subconsciously—to favor a particular outcome that

serves them best. One common distortion this tension produces is

optimism bias: the impulse to downplay real risks and paint a future that

looks brighter than the evidence warrants. In such cases, the question

haunting leaders is obvious: In the face of corporate pressures, how do

you uphold honesty in your team’s decisions?

Our new research, published in the Journal of Banking and Finance,

## points to an unexpected answer: gender diversity.

# The Limits of Regulation and Training

The tension between ethical standards and the forces that undermine

them is especially visible in competitive industries like ﬁnance, where

both incentive structures and corporate culture can appear to reward

complicity over candor. Despite all the policies, compliance training,

and hotlines intended to discourage misconduct, it still remains rampant. This damages eﬃcient information ﬂows in ﬁnancial markets

and poses a risk of sanctions to ﬁnancial institutions.

Even at companies that publicly champion integrity, day-to-day team

dynamics can undermine those values. Research has found that formal

rules need to be paired with an internal moral compass and peer

# accountability within teams.

## A Surprising Solution Hidden in Plain Sight

Our study focused on ﬁnancial analysts, who often feel pressure to

put a positive spin on stock valuations when their ﬁrm has a vested

interest in the deal. Our goal was to explore potential solutions to the

persistent issue of optimism bias in analysts’ stock recommendations.

We analyzed over 63,000 target-price forecasts issued by more than

## 3,400 sell-side analysts at 364 investment banks over eleven years.

To assess whether analysts were overly optimistic, we compared their

## one-year-ahead price targets for a company to both the actual stock

price and the consensus estimate from other analysts. This allowed us

to quantify the degree of an analyst’s optimism. We then studied how

this optimism varied across brokerages with diﬀerent levels of gender

# diversity.

The pattern that emerged was unmistakable: Teams with more women

exerted lower optimism bias in their issued target prices than those with

fewer women. Put another way, gender diversity was consistently found

to reduce the level of optimism bias. The eﬀect was strongest when

the pressure was highest—that is, when the analyst’s brokerage had a

big stake in the company being evaluated (for example, an investment-

## banking relationship). In other words, when conﬂict of interest would

normally bite hardest, gender-diverse teams showed the most resistance

to the optimism bias it induces.

How big a diﬀerence are we talking about? The statistics were eye-

opening: Increasing the proportion of women on an analyst team by

just 8 percentage points dropped the optimism bias in their stock price

targets by up to 12%. In an industry where even small forecasting errors

can translate into billions of dollars misallocated, that reduction in

bias is anything but trivial. Teams with higher female representation

were far more realistic in their assessments—that is, much less likely

to overshoot with rose-colored predictions—compared to homogeneous

# teams.

Crucially, this wasn’t because the women in the group were individually

more cautious or ethical. In fact, when operating solo under similar

conditions, male and female analysts were equally prone to optimistic

forecasts. Rather, it’s the group dynamic that changed with gender

diversity. With more women present, the entire team’s behavior shifted:

Both men and women analysts on those mixed teams dialed down their

own optimism, issuing more tempered, objective projections.

To be sure diversity was causing this integrity boost and wasn’t merely

correlated with some other factor, our study also looked at natural

experiments. One telling analysis tracked analysts who switched ﬁrms,

moving from a more homogenous team to a more gender-diverse

one. When the same analyst worked in the more-diverse environment,

their forecasting bias dropped noticeably. The analyst hadn’t suddenly

become more ethical, but the culture around them had changed, and

that made them act diﬀerently. A similar eﬀect occurred during mergers

of brokerage ﬁrms. Some analysts suddenly found themselves on teams

with a higher share of women after a merger. Those analysts became

## signiﬁcantly less optimistic in their target prices afterward, even for

clients with conﬂicts of interest. Even in the midst of a merger’s

challenges, diverse analyst teams were more likely to issue realistic

# forecasts.

To distinguish cause and eﬀect, the study introduced a timing test. The

idea was simple: If unbiased forecasts were followed by more women

joining the team, it would suggest that gender diversity was merely a

byproduct of a pre-existing ethical culture. In other words, an ethical

team might naturally attract more female analysts over time. However,

that’s not what we found. A forecast’s bias showed no association with

the number of women who joined the team afterward. Instead, only the

proportion of women already on the team at the time of the forecast

was linked to the forecast’s bias. This result helped dispel the skeptic’s

notion that ethical ﬁrms simply end up with more women. Instead, it

shows that gender diversity actively shapes a team’s ethics. In short,

having a diverse team caused the integrity boost—not the other way

# around.

# Implications for Leaders

Consider how powerful this is: Without new laws or stern guidance from

the CEO, simply changing gender composition tilted behavior toward

greater honesty about ﬁrm prospects. It’s a form of soft regulation

that arises organically from within the team, complementing formal

# compliance and external oversight.

In the halls of ﬁnance we often hear about excessive risk-taking. Our

ﬁndings ﬂip that narrative: Perhaps the most underappreciated lever

for curbing ethical lapses is diversifying that culture. This doesn’t just

improve ethical vigilance and intellectual honesty—it has the potential

to sharpen risk management and produce more reliable information

for decision-makers, investors, and markets. And we speculate that

this eﬀect likely could extend far beyond stock analysts or bankers—

any high-pressure team could potentially reap the gains that gender

diversity brings. In fact, these results give empirical weight to what

prior work has argued conceptually: That gender diversity isn’t just a

feel-good slogan or a box to tick—it’s a structural antidote to unwanted

behavior that can lead to better decisions under the right conditions.

If one relatively simple change such as adding more women to a team

can curb a pervasive bias in an ultra-competitive ﬁeld, what other

ethical boosters might we be overlooking? Diversity is a powerful piece

of the puzzle in building resilient, principled teams. Research shows

that this kind of diversity-driven integrity can also lead to greater ﬁrm-

level resilience, lower risk, and better innovation outcomes. It won’t

single-handedly eliminate all the pressure or temptation to fudge the

truth; no single change can. But it shifts the baseline of behavior. It

makes doing the right thing easier for everyone in the room.

. . .

The next time the pressure’s on and you’re asking how to safeguard

integrity in your organization, remember this: You can create rules,

roll out training, and repeat your values all you want (and indeed, you

should). But also ask a more strategic question: Who’s in the room?

Homogeneity can silently amplify blind spots. A more intentionally

gender diverse team won’t guarantee better decisions, but it makes

them more likely. In complex, high-stakes environments, that shift in

probability may be one of the most practical investments a leader can
