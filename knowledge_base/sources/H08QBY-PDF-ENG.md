As AI matures, the availability of so-called “digital labor” is exploding,

expanding the very deﬁnition of a qualiﬁed workforce. What was once

the exclusive domain of human talent has now been joined by AI agents

capable of handling many tasks once considered beyond the reach of

automation—and as a result, according to Salesforce CEO Marc Benioﬀ,

the total addressable market for digital labor could soon reach the

# trillions of dollars.

## HBR / Digital Article / Agentic AI Is Already Changing the Workforce

This requires a major shift in outlook. Emerging research out of Harvard

## Business School and the Digital Data Design Institute shows that AI

agents are fast becoming much more than just sidekicks for human

workers. They’re becoming digital teammates—an emerging category of

talent. To get the most out of these new teammates, leaders in HR and

procurement will need to start developing an operational playbook for

integrating them into hybrid teams and a workforce strategy. Those who take the time to do so will unlock not just eﬃciency but a more scalable

# and resilient form of collaboration.

It’s already happening: Deloitte, for example, reports that it in the

process of applying AI agents to “every” enterprise process, including

a marketing agent that orchestrates many tasks focused on optimizing

their customers’ journeys through their site. And some talent ﬁrms, among them rPotential (a spin-oﬀ from global staﬃng giant, Adecco)

have reimagined themselves as not just providers of human talent but

also architects of a broader model that includes both people and AI.

To succeed in this new environment, your organization must actively

shape how AI is integrated into its labor strategy. Leaders in HR

and procurement who act now will retain control over how AI is

sourced, structured, and regulated in the enterprise, whereas those

who hesitate risk missing out on new growth opportunities—or, worse,

being blindsided by compliance, ethics, and performance issues they

never saw coming. This is a general strategic concern when it comes

to anything disruptive: You can no longer ignore new technologies,

especially AI, hoping they’ll go away. You have to be deeply engaged

with building your systems so that you deeply understand how you

need to adapt as the world changes.

Firms that delay will also struggle to attract top human talent, as more

candidates will expect smart, AI-supported workﬂows that enhance

their productivity and creativity. Meanwhile, faster-moving competitors

will embed AI directly into their operating models, enabling them to out

scale and outlearn by increasing output without adding headcount. In

addition, as large enterprise and government buyers begin to demand

## robust, auditable AI policies and governance frameworks, organizations

that lack maturity in these areas will ﬁnd themselves at a disadvantage,

potentially losing out on critical contracts and partnerships. Inaction,

therefore, is not just a missed opportunity—it’s a tangible business risk.

# Seven Critical Actions

Drawing on our collective experience within data science and AI, and in the open-talent and staﬃng ecosystem, we’ve devised framework

to help you get started—a guide to help HR and procurement teams

design, test, and scale a new kind of workforce strategy based on the

# idea of human-AI teams.

# Map work tasks and outcomes.

The objective here is to deconstruct each role or project into its

component tasks and outcomes. Just as you would deﬁne competencies

for human candidates, you need to identify the tasks that can be better,

faster, or more cost-eﬀectively handled by AI agents. For instance,

high-volume data validation or repetitive call-center functions might be

prime candidates for AI. Meanwhile, tasks requiring complex judgment,

persuasion, or deep domain expertise may still lean on human insight—

or a hybrid approach. The key thing to remember is that you’re not just

“buying labor” anymore. You’re buying an outcome that might come

from a combination of people and AI. So, start each sourcing discussion

with a nuanced breakdown of tasks, so you can tailor the right mix of

# talent.

# Assess AI capability.

It’s vital to understand which AI models and platforms align best

with your speciﬁc tasks and workﬂows. To do that, build an internal

taxonomy of AI capabilities that map to your common roles not

only in, say, data validation or call-center functions but also other

roles, including marketing analyst, customer-support rep, scheduling

coordinator, and so on. Language models might excel at drafting

marketing copy, but specialized computer-vision agents might be

best for quality checks in manufacturing. By creating a capabilities

“catalogue,” you can avoid a one-size-ﬁts-all approach. In procurement

terms, this is your RFP for AI solutions. Know which models solve which problems, and partner with staﬃng or technology vendors that can

prove domain expertise. This ensures you’re not paying top dollar for

AI hype that may not match the actual needs of the business.

Integrate your hybrid team.

If you want AI agents and human teams to work well together, you need

crystal-clear role boundaries. So, develop a hybrid-workforce strategy in

which you deﬁne which tasks AI will own, which tasks people will own,

and how the escalation of problems should happen. For example, if an

AI customer-service agent receives a complaint about a complex billing

dispute that concerns an amount above a certain dollar threshold, a

rule might automatically route it to a human specialist. By documenting

roles, protocols, and “hand-oﬀ” points when responsibilities shift in

a workﬂow from one party to another, you build trust across your

organization, preventing conﬂict or duplication.

## Redesign your business (and workforce) model.

This requires envisioning new ways to procure and deploy talent,

including full-time employees, temporary hires, freelancers, and AI.

To do that, you’ll need to consider multi-tiered models such as client-

owned digital labor (you license or build your own AI solutions,

eﬀectively bringing “digital employees” in-house); leased digital labor

(you “rent” AI agents from a third party, in a manner akin to traditional temp staﬃng); and fully outsourced AI subdepartments (you partner

with a vendor that runs entire processes, such as order fulﬁllment or

call centers, using both AI and a small team of human experts). Align

## these models with your ﬁnancial, compliance, and strategic needs. For

instance, leasing AI might be ideal for seasonal spikes, whereas fully outsourced solutions could be more eﬃcient for repetitive but critical

functions. Keep in mind that your role is to integrate and manage a wide

spectrum of labor types, which will require developing new KPIs and

cost structures that reﬂect digital labor’s unique economics (scalability,

near-constant uptime, quick retraining) compared to human labor.

# Set legal and ethical ground rules.

The point here is to proactively address bias, liability, data governance,

and broader societal implications of AI-led work. To do that, you’ll

need to collaborate with legal, compliance, and ethics teams to draft

enterprise-wide standards for AI usage. These policies should deﬁne

whether and how AI learns from proprietary data, how to detect and

remedy bias, and how to safeguard personal or sensitive information.

If your enterprise is global, anticipate a patchwork of regulations

in diﬀerent jurisdictions. This is important: Ethical missteps—like

discriminatory hiring algorithms or data misuse—can ignite PR crises

and create regulatory liabilities. Many governments are moving quickly

on AI legislation. Firms that proactively create frameworks and foster AI

culture early will be able to adjust and react to future legislation much

better than ﬁrms who wait and are forced to start the process after any

# legislation.

Capture value continuously as it evolves.

To do this properly, you’ll need to constantly monitor performance,

measure outcomes, and reﬁne your AI-human mix. Think beyond

a one-time AI deployment. Establish feedback loops that measure

performance, update AI training data, and revise your sourcing

## strategies. For instance, if your AI-based scheduling tool frequently

encounters edge cases requiring human intervention, you may need

## more advanced AI training or more robust human oversight. Traditional

“set it and forget it” approaches to staﬃng don’t apply here. AI’s

value compounds over time as it learns from interactions. Negotiate

contractual agreements that let you capture improvements while also

respecting the intellectual property (IP) rights of your vendor or the data

# sovereignty of your enterprise.

# Remain human-centric.

AI reduces the need for people to conduct mundane tasks and

elevates the importance of high-value, human-led tasks. Ensuring that

employees can continue to carry these latter tasks out not only sustains

morale but also delivers diﬀerentiating value to your enterprise, which

is something your competitors can’t simply download. So invest in

## forms of training and skill development that enable employees to not

only adapt to working alongside AI but also leverage AI to amplify

their own impact. Focus on capabilities like relationship building,

ethical decision-making, and creativity—areas where humans still have

# a distinct edge.

# Preparing for Radical Change

Whether you adopt AI labor directly or source it through a staﬃng or

open-talent provider, ask yourself these pivotal questions to guide your

# strategy:

- When AI is trained on your proprietary data, who owns the resulting

## capabilities, you or the owner of the AI model or agent?

- Are new legal frameworks needed, including employment-like

contracts for AI agents, and who bears liability if the AI makes a

# mistake?

- Are there oversight and equity questions that remain unresolved?

- What guidelines exist for choosing between humans and AI for certain

jobs, especially when ethics, brand reputation, or job protection are on

# the line?

- And, ultimately, an open question for discussion: How will the very

deﬁnition of “work” evolve when AI agents become embedded in

teams, possibly even gaining legal or ethical status?

It’s not necessary to answer all of these questions upfront, but use them

as a guide and continue to answer them along your journey. These

are not theoretical concerns—they’re strategic inﬂection points. The

organizations that move ﬁrst to resolve them will shape how the future

of work is deﬁned and who controls its value.

As you consider how to move forward, reﬂect on the guiding principle

of human centricity. While AI can handle many tasks more quickly

than humans, your enterprise still relies on the insight, empathy, and

relationships that only people can deliver. By maintaining this dual focus—on unleashing AI’s eﬃciency and safeguarding human creativity

—you stand the best chance of driving sustainable growth.
