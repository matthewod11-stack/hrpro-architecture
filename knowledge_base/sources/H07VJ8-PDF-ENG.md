Two bills to provide protections for pregnant and nursing employees

were signed into law at the end of last year: the Pregnant Workers

## Fairness Act (PWFA) and the Providing Urgent Maternal Protections

for Nursing Mothers (PUMP) Act. How has your company met the

regulations in both bills? Has it simply complied, or has it taken extra

steps to support pregnant and nursing employees?

Beyond basic compliance lies an opportunity to revisit the culture

within your workplace. My background includes auditing existing

parental and caregiver programs while projecting future needs. Through

these years and work with organizations, I have seen a great deal of

creativity and smarts in action. It is more than possible to go above basic

compliance — it is an obvious investment with a high ROI.

## As Sarah Kellogg Neﬀ, CEO of The Lactation Network, told me, “When

it comes to attracting and retaining talent, the bare minimum just isn’t

getting it done. Companies with a lactation room — but nonexistent

paid leave or health plans without breast pump or postpartum lactation

care coverage — will ﬁnd those rooms empty because their employees

weren’t supported before returning to work.”

So how can your organization go beyond basic compliance? Looking at

the space that you’ve designated for pumping employees is a good place

to start. Consider these questions:

- Do you have enough pumping rooms to meet the size of your campus?

- How is the location of these rooms communicated?

- How do users schedule use of the room(s)?

- How have you organized and managed break tracking (if necessary)?

- When the room is in use, how is that communicated in a way that

# creates goodwill?

- Is the lactation room designed as a single or multiple-user space?

- Is it a warm, welcoming, and well-equipped space?

The ﬁrst of these questions often sparks the most concern within

organizations. How do you ﬁnd the space for one lactation room, let

alone enough to meet your campus size? This can often feel threatening

— how much space will I need to “ﬁnd”? — when really the opposite

is true. The PUMP law is ﬂexible based on need. So, break down your

assessment to consider temporary as well as permanent options.

One option that I’ve seen grow in popularity is the Nessel, an all-in-one,

portable lactation station. I spoke with the company’s co-founder, Della

Leapman, and she explained what drove her to start the business. “As

an architect and a pumping mother, I quickly understood how to ﬁll the

void and bring a new level of workplace pumping station to life. We built

the concept of Nessel around what I call ‘swing space’ — a space that

has multiple, often temporary functions, underused or forgotten areas.

Think a supply closet, for example. Recognizing that these spaces may move around within a campus or oﬃce suite, we added in ﬂexibility for

the employer by removing built-in plumbing as a requirement.” With its

fully functional sink, refrigerator, electrical outlets and chair designed

speciﬁcally for pumping, Nessel has been busy ﬁlling orders.

What more can your organization do to go beyond basic compliance?

Getting input from employees who have used the space is invaluable. It

not only informs, it actively engages, which underscores an authentic

desire to learn from employee experiences. Here are questions you

might ask in person, over email, or in an anonymous survey:

- Where did you get most of your information around pumping and

## other return-to-work policies and beneﬁts?

- Were you able to easily locate pumping rooms?

- Did workplace pumping rooms oﬀer a comfortable and user-friendly

# environment?

- What was missing from the pumping rooms?

- What would you add to the pumping beneﬁts and supports?

Assess the responses you get back, and look for ways to improve. Even

small things can make a big diﬀerence.

Examples of low-cost, high-return goods and services are not hard to

ﬁnd. And they are game changers. A sturdy chair with a straight back

(unlike breastfeeding, you want to be able to sit upright with your

feet on the ﬂoor). Generous amounts of outlets. A small table. A clean

refrigerator. User-speciﬁc cubbies. A full-length mirror for rearranging.

Notebooks for sharing encouragement between parents. Even snacks

and water. These small things go a long way, as do support services such

# as internal peer groups and ERGs.

As Molly Dickens, co-founder of the nonproﬁt &Mother, told me, “The

new legislation has created a fork in the road for organizations. Will

you take the path of basic compliance and fade into the average? Or

will you take the path that builds on this moment? Even if this means

baby steps on that path — articulating a commitment to actively listen

to where other weaknesses lie with the intention of raising the whole

organizational bar — speaks volumes.”

New laws protecting pregnant and pumping employees were long

overdue, and are now the standard. Taking organizational ownership

of the quality and ease of the pumping experience at work (including

business travel) signals an elevated level of commitment and care for

nursing employees returning to work. Word gets around — and even

more so if you amplify the commitments made as a point of pride

and with intention. What one can expect at the intersection of parent

and professional is a central theme in recruitment, retention, and

yes, reputation. Proceed with the authentic goal of delivering the best

experience possible for your working parents. The proof will be in the

pride even the simplest shifts will bring to their lives.
