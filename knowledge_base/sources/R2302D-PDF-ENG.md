Two years ago, as much of the world was gradually emerging from

lockdown, I argued in an HBR article (“How to Do Hybrid Right,” May–

June 2021) that we had a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity to adopt a new

hybrid model for work—one that, if embraced properly, could beneﬁt all

# of us.

I still believe that’s true. But ﬁguring it out will take time—

perhaps longer than we expected. That’s because reimagining work

is complicated. As we move into the fourth year of the Covid era,

organizations and employees alike are ﬁnding themselves in an

uncomfortably liminal state, unmoored from past ways of working but

lacking a sense of how best to move forward. There’s still so much we

just don’t know.

As I’ve thought about this problem and the opportunities it presents,

I’ve found myself returning to a model that was described decades

ago by the organizational psychologist Kurt Lewin. The model predicts

that when organizations are faced with an external threat, such as a

merger or a new competitor, their ﬁrmly established assumptions and

norms are put under pressure and begin to “unfreeze.” What follows is

## a period of uncertainty and transition, during which new assumptions

and norms take shape. Eventually they “refreeze.”

That’s what’s happening now, on an enormous scale. When the

pandemic hit, our long-standing structures, practices, and processes all

unfroze. Old ways of working fell away; we discovered new options for

remote and hybrid work; and as Covid restrictions eased, we began to

discern which of those options might be worth hanging on to.

We recognized that making sense of all this would be diﬃcult—and it

has been. In February 2022 I polled 266 executives from 68 companies

across 36 countries and asked them, “Where do you think you are

[with hybrid work] at the moment?” Only 2% chose the response “We’ve

implemented and rolled out a ﬁnal design of work.” The remaining 98%

located themselves somewhere earlier in the process by choosing one of

these: “We have a design and are beginning to roll out in some places”

(40%), “The ﬁnal design is still under discussion” (35%), or “We are

looking at options” (23%). Most companies, in other words, were stuck,

often uneasily, in the transitional phase: They had unfrozen old ways of

working and wanted the clarity and stability of a refreeze, but they just

weren’t there yet.

Companies have started to realize that the changes they’re contemplating to workplace practices and norms may be more significant than anything that’s happened in generations.

When I repeated the survey the following November, the percentage of

executives who reported having rolled out a ﬁnal hybrid-work design

had risen considerably, to 42%. Some companies are at last moving into

that phase, but many others remain in transition.

Why has this been so hard? Because so much is at stake. The new world

of hybrid work is about more than determining whether everybody

should come back to the oﬃce full-time, or whether two or three days

a week makes more sense, or whether employees should be allowed

to work from home. In debating those and other questions, companies

have found themselves testing long-held assumptions about how work

should be done and what it even is—and have started to realize that

the changes they’re contemplating to workplace practices and norms

may be more signiﬁcant than anything that’s happened in generations.

“This is the greatest change to work since the Industrial Revolution,”

## Phil Thomas, the CEO of Ascential Futures, part of a global intelligence

and events organization, recently told his leadership team during a

discussion of their hybrid future. “We need to acknowledge that.”

Perhaps it’s far-fetched to liken the convulsions of our present moment

to those of the Industrial Revolution. But perhaps not. At the very least,

we have to acknowledge that the transformation we’re living through

will probably take years to settle in. That means it’s time for leaders to start thinking diﬀerently about the problem. It’s time for them to

approach it as they would any other major change in how they do

business: by asking tough questions and learning from the answers.

# Where We Are Now

In navigating the shift to hybrid work, we’re heading into a future we

know very little about. It’s important to admit that, and to keep in

mind some of the fascinating research ﬁndings on what works and what

# doesn’t.

## When the pandemic hit, the only signiﬁcant experiment in hybrid

work that leaders could rely on for guidance was the 2013 study “Does

Working from Home Work? Evidence from a Chinese Experiment,” by

## Nicholas A. Bloom, James Liang, John Roberts, and Zhichun Jenny

Ying. In that study workers in a call center were randomly assigned

to do their jobs at home or in the oﬃce. The home-based workers

turned out to be more productive than their oﬃce-based colleagues,

largely because they took fewer breaks and sick days and had a quieter

environment in which to work. They also turned out to be more likely to

stay in their jobs. Nonetheless, after the experiment was over, many of

them decided to return to the oﬃce at least a few days a week, because

they felt isolated and lonely at home and were worried that people in

the oﬃce were getting promotions more often.

In the early days of the pandemic this study gave some support to

advocates for a shift to remote work. But it was a small study with a

narrow focus. Only as the pandemic progressed did it become possible

to consider larger populations, including knowledge workers. And when

Harvard Business School’s Raj Choudhury and other researchers did

so, they found that many workers enjoyed hybrid arrangements. Those

workers were more likely to stay with a company if such arrangements were oﬀered, and at times they delivered greater customer satisfaction

and retention than did their oﬃce-bound counterparts.

Designing hybrid work to support innovation requires a level of intentionality that may have been missing in traditional colocated firms.

But how does working virtually aﬀect connectivity and innovation?

It’s a fraught question. In 2022 a Microsoft research team analyzed

the communication patterns of more than 60,000 of the company’s

## employees during the ﬁrst six months of 2020, when hybrid work

was widespread, and found that collaboration networks became more

static, with fewer bridges connecting disparate parts of the company.

That ﬁnding has been replicated by other studies, which have also

demonstrated that when employees don’t work together in close

quarters, they get less feedback and guidance from coworkers. In

## 2022 the economists Natalia Emanuel, Emma Harrington, and Amanda

Pallais studied this problem at a software company and found it to be

## particularly acute for young engineers and women engineers.

Videoconferencing, too, seems to have a negative eﬀect on creativity.

## When Melanie S. Brucks of Columbia Business School and Jonathan

Levav of Stanford studied its use in teams, for example, they discovered

that it was helpful for making decisions about known ideas but it

narrowed team members’ cognitive focus, which inhibited their ability

to generate ideas that could result in innovation.

Designing hybrid work to encourage knowledge ﬂows and support

innovation requires a level of intentionality that may have been

missing in traditional colocated companies. That’s what Jen Rhymer of

University College London concluded when she studied six successful

location-independent organizations. Rhymer identiﬁed a range of

factors that contributed to the success of those businesses. Among them

were commonly understood norms for engagement and information

sharing; an emphasis on short, iterative project cycles (two to four

## weeks); regular organization-wide retreats (every six to 12 months); and

## up-to-date company histories and knowledge repositories.

Other researchers and practitioners are studying the profound unknowns that remain: Can culture be transmitted eﬀectively in a

virtual environment? How well can new employees learn their jobs and

understand company culture if they rarely spend time in the oﬃce?

If young employees early in their careers can’t cultivate relationships

and networks through face-to-face interaction, what are the long-term

# consequences?

It’s likely to be years before we have enough data to provide useful

answers to such questions. But leaders can’t just sit back and wait until

everything has been ﬁgured out. They need to develop a strategy for

navigating the long period of uncertainty that lies ahead.

# Four Crucial Questions

Many executive teams have begun that process by engaging in a

conversation acknowledging that their company is unique, that no one-

size-ﬁts-all solution exists, and that determining what’s right is going to

be a long and arduous process. Those conversations have gone in many diﬀerent directions, depending on the companies’ needs and goals, but

what I’ve learned in talking to leaders involved in the process is this:

Every executive team must ask four crucial questions as it thinks about

how best to deal with the ongoing transition to hybrid work.

- 1. What are our overarching values and principles? This question,

## a familiar and important one in conversations about strategy, must

be answered before you move on to the other three. Make sure that

all your answers align with the values and principles you’ve deﬁned

here. That’s what the executive team at Ascential Futures did: It

established that creativity and innovation were the two values it

wanted to adhere to during its transition, and then it moved forward

accordingly. Leaders at Mars Wrigley considered the ﬁve Mars principles

## —quality, responsibility, mutuality, eﬃciency, and freedom—as core to

their decision-making to ensure the safety of their employees, known as

# “associates.”

- 2. What is special about the people we employ, the jobs we do, and the

customers we serve? This question gets at what makes your company

unique. Think long and hard about it. Ultimately the decisions you

make about the redesign of work will have to do more than just align

with your values. They will have to support these speciﬁc traits.

Early in the pandemic the executive team at Mars Wrigley grasped

the importance of understanding the needs of speciﬁc groups of

associates. From the outset it focused on factory workers, who make

up a signiﬁcant proportion of the company’s workforce. “Our priority,”

says Mike Carabok, the vice president of global supply at Mars Wrigley

Confectionery, “was to ensure the health and well-being of associates,

to minimize spread [of the coronavirus] while maintaining business

# continuity.”

Focusing on individuals is not enough, because it’s in the relationships among people where many connections fray under the novel strains of hybrid work.

To that end Mars, like many other companies, instituted companywide

beneﬁts that supported all employees impacted by Covid. But it also

encouraged its factories to be creative in addressing the operational

complexities that the pandemic had created for them. For example, at

one factory work schedules were changed to introduce more ﬂexibility;

associates were temporarily allowed to work from home for up to two hours a day; and they were oﬀered additional opportunities for digital

# and other learning experiences.

## Diﬀerent operational practices at diﬀerent factories? Factory workers

doing their jobs in part from home? Few companies before the

pandemic would ever have considered such options. But the Mars

experiments, although temporary, were a clear success, and that led to

## more conversations among the company’s leaders about what the future

of work for manufacturing could look like. “It invited us to think about

possibilities that we have not considered before,” says Juli da Silva

Domingues, Mars’s global supply, people, and organization business

partner, “creating a chain of trials that will expand ﬂexible work and

improve the way we recruit factory associates.”

- 3. What isn’t working, and what are the problems we’re trying to solve?

This question forces you to shine a light on exactly what your company

is struggling with so that you can better imagine work conﬁgurations

that are uniquely suited to your needs. The more speciﬁc you can be in

identifying your concerns and problems, the better.

Consider how Transport for NSW addressed this question. Based in

Sydney, Australia, the company manages the daily travel of millions

of people across roads, rail, ferries, and light railways. “As we moved

into the pandemic,” says Tracey Taylor, the company’s chief people

oﬃcer, “inevitably we encountered questions and problems along the

way. We wanted to bring ﬂexibility to everyone. But how does that work

with drivers and others tethered to their jobs? How do we ensure that

the investment in infrastructure we have made in Sydney does not

dominate, and we serve the entire NSW community? How do we align

cross-functional teams in a hybrid working model?”

To confront those questions, the

company’s top 100 leaders met quarterly in

all-day face-to-face forums. They also held

90-minute virtual sessions ﬁve times a

year; established informal, self-led peer-

connect groups; and hosted livestream

# events for employees.

To understand as fully as possible

# Skizzomat

the nature of the problems they were

discussing, they conducted a series of

# investigations. In one case the company

asked teams to complete detailed “ways of working” surveys: Each

week for two months 900 employees answered questions about work

demands, work/life balance, well-being needs, culture and belonging,

and ideal ﬂexible working arrangements. The surveys exposed some

primary concerns that leaders were encouraged to address, such as

which tasks could be performed virtually, how to create “doing nothing”

time in the oﬃce to enable informal connections, and where best to

bring teams from multiple locations together.

- 4. What experiments have we tried that we can share with others, and

what are other companies doing that we can learn from? This question

forces leaders to think about collective learning both inside and outside

# the company.

Years before the pandemic, Accenture began piloting metaverse-related

technologies—including extended, virtual, and augmented reality—to

## create immersive learning and collaboration programs for its own

people and its clients. The pandemic induced its leaders to reimagine

how to onboard new hires (it onboarded 150,000 Accenture employees

in its metaverse in 2022), how to train them (for example, by creating

realistic simulations with ﬁctitious clients), and how to connect its

workforce in ways it could never achieve in the real world at a

global scale. “When you hear colleagues’ voices right next to you,

and you walk the virtual halls together, it’s much more intimate,

energizing, and memorable than hours of video calls,” says Ginny

Ziegler, the chief marketing and communications oﬃcer at Accenture

North America. “It is a powerful way for a geographically dispersed

workforce to collaborate, learn, build communities, and even socialize.

The metaverse is also an equalizer of sorts, because it helps us create

# more-inclusive realities.”

Companies can learn from the outside as well. That’s what Phil Thomas

and his team at Ascential Futures have done. Thomas began by asking

various executives of other companies what challenges the move to

hybrid work had presented for them and what principles they had

adopted to guide them through the move. He then chose six of them, from companies that had adopted very diﬀerent approaches, and

interviewed them in depth. Using what he learned in those interviews,

he created a 30-minute ﬁlm that he used to launch a very speciﬁc

conversation about hybrid work with his own leadership team. “What

resonates with us?” he asked his colleagues after they had watched the

ﬁlm. “What do we want, and what do we absolutely not want?”

Each company will have diﬀerent answers to such questions, of course.

But the approach that Thomas and his team adopted—collective,

methodical, thoughtful, and drawing on the experience of others—is

one that organizations should consider as they think about their long-

# term hybrid future.

# Next Steps

There’s a great deal we still don’t know about the transition to

hybrid work. But to manage that transition successfully, almost every

organization will need to take two important steps.

Give more support to teams and their managers. In the early stages of

the pandemic, companies focused— properly and understandably—on

the well-being and productivity of individual employees. But since then

it has become clear that focusing on individuals is not enough. Leaders

must also consider the well-being and productivity of teams and their

managers, because it’s there, in the relationships among people, where

many connections fray under the novel strains of hybrid work.

Leaders will need to be intentional about this—as they have been at

the Sage Group, a UK enterprise-software company. Recognizing the

need to educate and support their teams, Sage’s executives launched

a learning program devoted exclusively to that goal. “Our internal

colleague data showed that managers were really struggling to lead in a hybrid environment,” says Aoife Fitzmaurice, the chief of staﬀ and VP

for organization design and workplace futures, who led the initiative.

“So we developed a series of ‘e-learns’ to help upskill our managers

in how to manage team agreements, navigate time and place, manage boundaries, and establish eﬀective communication ﬂows. It is still early

stages, but the response has been positive. We are now creating a

real-time problem-solving community for our managers to support one

# another.”

Use data as your guide. Now that we know the transition to hybrid work

will require a long period of constant experimentation and learning,

companies should gather and analyze high-quality data if they want to

understand what they’re learning, how work is getting done, and how

employees are feeling.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Redesigning How We Work

Karen Kocher, who manages Microsoft’s Workforce of the Future team,

reﬂects, “A lead indicator is data from the daily employee polls with

two questions: How are we doing with our ﬂexibility hybrid pledge? and

How are managers doing? That has created important insights that have

steered actions—around, for example, the importance of one-on-one

## conversations between managers and team members, and the need for

managers to have conﬁdence and clarity about hybrid work.”

Similarly, when executives at Tata Consultancy Services studied

internal data on productivity, meeting frequency, engagement scores,

and attrition, they found that ﬂexibility provides incontrovertible

## beneﬁts. For instance, the learning hours of employees with hybrid

work arrangements rose by more than 35%. The executive team used the

ﬁndings to illustrate speciﬁc actions that managers working in a hybrid

environment could take to support sustainable productivity.

. . .

We’ve known for a long time that the pandemic would have a lasting

impact on the way we work and how we think about work. Leaders

are starting to see this for what it is: a period of learning and

experimentation. Early on they found that employees often prefer

working in a hybrid way and that doing so can build engagement and agility. But now they’re also seeing the negative eﬀects that hybrid work

can have—on networks, on innovation—and they recognize that such

problems must be acknowledged and addressed. The leadership teams

best equipped to meet those challenges deeply understand the DNA of

their companies, are open to learning from within and outside their

organizations, and take a positive view of experimenting with new ways

of working.
