Business leaders today know they can’t ignore public controversies and

crises. Comfortably objective, amoral stances don’t ﬂy when customers

and employees care deeply about issues or when they feel under siege.

And yet, when controversy strikes and crises ﬂare up, companies often

struggle to respond. When, how, and on which issues should they stake

# out positions?

Proactivity is key. Instead of simply reacting to events, leaders must

clarify the values and shape the character of their organizations before

those challenges arise, creating what sociologists have called moral

# communities.

We see many communities, such as faith groups and nation-states, held

## together by, in the words of the sociologist Emile Durkheim, a “uniﬁed

system of beliefs and practices relative to sacred things” as well as

a “common moral goal.” Companies can become moral communities

when stakeholders embrace goals, beliefs, and behaviors infused with

a common moral perspective. A great deal of research outlines the

economic rationale for doing so: businesses built around an economic

and also morally resonant purpose or mission outperform those that

aren’t because they build trusting, loyal relationships with partners and

customers and inspire employees to innovate and deliver their best.

A clear purpose linked to the organization’s identity as a moral

community can also help leaders know when to speak up on issues —

and when not to. It can serve as a point of orientation for engaging with

the world. For this to work, however, leaders must express not only a

## big, long-term strategic goal for the organization but also an ambition

that has moral content, implies an elevated sense of duty, and appeals

to a broad base of stakeholders. Such an ambition might alienate some

with conﬂicting moral sensibilities. But it will inspire the majority who

remain, generating a sense of loyalty and cohesiveness that reﬂects

commitment to an ideal and thus goes well beyond economic self-

# interest.

My work with dozens of leaders has revealed three key strategies for

building moral community around purpose to drive high performance.

# Tell a Big Story

## Religious groups the world over tell memorable, emotionally resonant

stories to convey moral messages. Corporate leaders who create moral

communities also tend to be compelling storytellers, evoking lofty

goals, inspiring stakeholders to surmount diﬃcult, short-term obstacles

to attain them, and often inserting themselves and their own moral

## sensibilities. During the 2000s and 2010s, former Pepsi CEO Indra

Nooyi did precisely this while communicating a morally infused

strategy called “Performance with Purpose.” She told of her life growing

up in modest circumstances in India and shared how that shaped

her sense of a company’s obligations. As one executive recalls, her

message was so compelling that “PwP” became a mantra for employees.

They united around helping customers live healthier lives while also

delivering great returns for Pepsi.

To maximize its impact as a means of creating moral community, a big

story must clearly articulate the moral principles and values a company

supports, and it must be framed in a way that seems broadly relevant

to the lives of stakeholders. Here Nooyi, an early corporate advocate

of purpose, might have come up short. Performance with Purpose

was perhaps overly narrow in its deﬁnition of purpose; one annual

report described it as “delivering sustainable growth by investing in a

## healthier future for people and our planet.” Although helpful in areas

like sustainability and product quality and safety, this language didn’t

necessarily evoke a broader moral basis for taking stands that deﬁned

Pepsi’s place in society. It is hardly surprising that the company seemed

to struggle at times to respond to the Black Lives Matters protests that

broke out in the United States during the late 2010s.

# Treat Purpose as an Organizing Principle

For the leaders I studied, purpose became a comprehensive principle for

organizing, giving rise to strategy, processes, systems, cultural norms,

## behaviors, and performance metrics at all levels. Many companies

translate their one-line purpose statement into a more concrete set of

actionable principles for their organization. For example, in the 2010s,

when the Indian industrial conglomerate Mahindra updated its purpose

to the one-word shorthand “Rise” to orient the company around not

just growing its businesses but also improving life in local communities,

chairman Anand Mahindra ensured that talent practices — including

HR, recruiting, and training — followed. “My job,” he explained, “is

to make sure that people understand Rise and are in line with its

# philosophy.”

Since then, Rise has become, in current CEO Anish Shah’s words, the

“North Star” that helps it navigate unexpected public controversies and

## crises. “For example, in the automotive industry, where product recalls

can be a challenging issue, Rise helps us prioritize consumer safety and

well-being. It directs our response, ensuring immediate action, recalls

## when necessary, and transparent communication.” Similarly, in 2020

team members at Mahindra’s agricultural equipment business were

inspired by Rise to help local farmers in India locate equipment to deal

with an acute labor crisis. Thanks to their swift action, farmers could

# successfully harvest their crops.

# Live the Purpose Courageously

Leaders know they set the tone for their organizations, and, in purpose-

driven businesses, most work to communicate about mission and values

well and often. In moral communities, however, what leaders do matters

more than what they say, especially in times of crisis. Individuals

making speciﬁc choices in service to the purpose will often need

courage to stand strong in the face of those who might vehemently

disagree. But a willingness to take risks and make personal sacriﬁces

on behalf of the sacred goal gives them moral weight in the eyes of followers, inspiring aﬀection, trust, and in extreme cases even a sense of

awe. It also encourages stakeholders to put their own self-interest aside

# and work for the higher purpose, too.

## As Dr. Robert Hart, chief physician executive and president of

## Ochsner Medical Center in New Orleans, Louisiana, notes, the

company’s mission of “serve, heal, lead, educate and innovate”

translated during COVID into helping the local population get through

the pandemic as safely as possible. Across the organization, “this

existential crisis brought out clarity to our mission,” with employees

feeling inspired to work extra shifts to accommodate surges of sick

patients and help one another cope. It helped that Hart and other

administrators took personal risks at the height of the Covid-19

pandemic, rolling up their sleeves and treating sick patients alongside

front-line caregivers. Their dedication demonstrated the importance

of public service and healing to these leaders personally and to the

organization, serving as a model for others to follow.

In turbulent times, you need a reliable anchor to keep you tethered,

and so do the stakeholders who follow you. Moral communities,

underpinned by purpose, provide that stability as well as a reassuring

sense of hope, solidarity, agency, and meaning. They help you

determine when and how to speak out, and just as importantly, when

to stay silent.
