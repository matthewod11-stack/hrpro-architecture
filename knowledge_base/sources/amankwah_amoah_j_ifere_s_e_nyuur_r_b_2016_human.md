# Human capital and strategic persistence: An examination of underperforming workers

in two emerging economies

1

# ABSTRACT

Despite the considerable research on strategic persistence, there remains a lack of

understanding as to why companies persist with underperforming workers. Our study seeks to

fill this gap in the literature by integrating the concepts of the paradox of success, external

legitimacy, nepotism and the escalation of commitment perspectives to develop an integrated

explanation for persistence with underperforming workers. Drawing on insights from two

emerging economies in Africa: Ghana and Nigeria, we uncovered that persistence with

underperforming workers stem from information hoarding, favouritism through tribalism and

externally imposed constraints. Our study also articulates the underlying processes inherent in

such persistence. The wider implications for theory and public policy are examined.

# Introduction

Over the past three decades, multiple streams of research have examined the productivity of

workers and strategies to achieve better employee performance (Al Ariss, Cascio & Paauwe,

2014; Yi, Nataraajan & Gong, 2011). One stream of research has focused on human capital

development and skills upgrading as effective mechanisms for ensuring efficient utilisation of

# employees (Barnes, Ponder & Hopkins, 2015; Hayek, Thomas, Novicevic & Montalvo, 2016;

Mellahi & Collings, 2010). Today’s highly competitive global environment has made

competition for top talent a priority for many multinationals and small businesses in both

developed and developing economies,

thereby creating a hostile environment for

# underperformance (Amankwah-Amoah, Nyuur & Ifere, 2016; Collings & Mellahi, 2009).

Many firms have utilised incentives such as higher salary and bonuses to attract and retain

top talents as well as encourage superior job performance (Henagan & Bedeian, 2009).

At the same time, some firms persist with underperforming workers and even refrain

from taking steps to weed out underperforming workers (Mmieh et al., 2011; Shein, 2011;

Taylor, 1998). Although the labour market in many advanced economies such as the US and

Canada are associated with a “pay-for-performance” culture to motivate employees to

achieve optimum outcome (Bloom & Van Reenen, 2011), in many emerging economies

“underperforming employees are typically left in post for several months or even years before

any action is taken to address them” (Bloom & Van Reenen, 2011, p. 1705). Despite decades

of research by international business and strategy scholars on emerging economies, the

existing literature has remained relatively silent as to why firms and managers persist with

underperforming employees even under threat of worsening performance. The largely

unexplored nature of this issue in emerging market context is puzzling given that the

existence of underperforming workers can undermine the contribution levels of fellow

workers (Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2007). More importantly, star performers can become targets

3

of underperformers, who can engage in acts to undermine their progress and success (see

Henagan & Bedeian, 2009; Fiske, 2011). Our purpose in this study is to examine why firms

persist with underperforming workers in emerging economies. We focus specifically on two

emerging economies in Africa: Ghana and Nigeria, to shed light on the subject. The two

countries are often regarded as the gateways to West Africa.

This paper makes three main contributions to strategic human resources, international

business and strategy research. First, although past studies have examined skill formation

(Mellahi & Collings, 2010), they have failed to offer any robust explanations as to why firms

persist with underperforming employees. In this direction, we integrate the concept of the

paradox of success (Audia et al., 2000), legitimacy literature (Baum & Oliver, 1991;

Suchman, 1995) and “too much invested to quit” perspective (Teger, 1980) to develop a

## unified explanation for strategic persistence with underperforming workers.

Another contribution is that we integrate insights on the effects of institutional and

social pressures on human resource practices (See Chiang & Birtch, 2010; Hayek et al., 2016;

Thomas & Inkson, 2007) with firm-level factors to develop an integrated framework of

factors to explain persistence with underperforming workers. In addition, although firms that

operate in high relational contexts are affected by different institutional factors (Peng, 2014),

to date, studies have not incorporated these into our understanding of underperformance.

Exploring this issue would help to not only enrich our cross-cultural understanding, but shed

light on the more intricate processes through which strategic persistence occurs. In so doing,

we capture the various factors that help to explain persistence with underperforming workers.

The remainder of the paper is structured as follows. First, we present a review of the

literature on the paradox of success, “too much invested to quit” perspective, nepotism and

legitimacy. The research context and method are then examined. We then set out our findings

4

on underperforming workers. The final section outlines the implications for managers and

# international business research.

## Explanations for persistence with underperforming workers: a unified perspective

For analytical clarity, underperforming workers are employees who have consistently

performed below targets or previously agreed benchmarks over a period of time in their

organisation (Shein, 2011). The underperformance has often been documented through a

series of reviews by his or her line manager (Shein, 2011; Taylor, 1998). Some of the

characteristics of such employees include lack of up-to-date communication skills, and lack

of knowledge and expertise to perform in the current role (Taylor, 1998). Underperforming

workers have been referred to as underperforming human resources or incompetent workers

(Shein, 2011; Taylor, 1998).

Four important streams of research are utilised to provide the foundation towards a

better understanding of persistence with underperforming workers. First, we adopt the

concept of the paradox of success (Audia et al., 2000; Miller, 1990) to develop a novel

perspective on persistence with underperforming workers. The paradox of success is rooted

in the “belief that a previously winning course of action will succeed in the future” (Audia et

al., 2000, p. 850). A key tenet is that the workers develop what can be referred to as

# “idiosyncrasy credit” (Hollander, 1958) through their past performances, support and

contributions to the past successes of the firm. Over time, this enables them to gain

# favourable or less severe consequences for persistent underperformance within the firm. The

managers’ confidence in employees’ ability to replicate past successful performance leads to

persistence with such workers. Another key premise of this line of research is that during

their period of employment, underperforming workers build networks of relations and ties

which enable them to form an emotional and psychological bond with the decision-maker.

Over time, it becomes difficult to disentangle the links with their line managers in the wake

5

of persistent underperformance (see Amason & Mooney, 2008). By cultivating personal and

workplace ties with powerful political actors, such workers are able to influence or curtail the

consequence of their actions when dealing with underperformance (Forstenlechner &

# Mellahi, 2011).

Related to this is the literature on nepotism/cronyism. Past studies have demonstrated

that in many societies in emerging economies, nepotism and cronyism remain key features of

# employment relations, which ultimately

# influences managerial decisions and firm

## performances (Kamoche, 2000; Mekonan & Mamman, 2003; Ovadje & Ankomah, 2001). A

body of research has suggested that hiring employees’ relatives instead of more qualified and

unrelated applicants is prevalent and often justified on the basis that it helps to strengthen

employees’ loyalty (Ovadje & Ankomah, 2001; Peng, 2014). Indeed, cronies have been

shown to be “unreservedly loyal” and fully committed to the agenda of their sponsor (Ovadje

& Ankomah, 2001). Studies have indicated that the existence of nepotism/cronyism can

curtail organisational decision-makers’ actions and therefore their ability to act in the wake of

## underperformance (Mamman, Baydoun & Adeoye, 2009; Ovadje & Ankomah, 2001). A

growing body of research suggests family businesses tendency to recruit relatives often

deprive them of the opportunity to hire top talents (Bertrand & Schoar, 2006). The close

family ties then create barrier to weeding out underperforming relatives (Bertrand & Schoar,

2006).

# Nevertheless, favouritism, tribalism, and racial and ethnic discrimination inherent in

many developing countries have often provided a basis for leaders and managers to curtail

# their actions and persist with underperformance (Beugré, 2002; Beugré & Offodile, 2001).

Another line of research suggests that informal and formal institutional factors such as local

traditions, culture, law and norms would moderate or curtail the actions of managers when

operating in emerging economies (see Beugré & Offodile, 2001; Peng, 2014). Accordingly,

6

nepotism can lead to misallocation of the firm’s limited resources and “unfair” decisions

(Ovadje & Ankomah, 2001). Besides the benefits of forging strong ethnic ties in the

workplace, tribalism and nepotism create conditions which make it difficult to “maintain

principles of objectivity and meritocracy” (Ovadje & Ankomah, 2001, p. 184).

Another interesting line of research rooted in legitimacy literature (Baum & Oliver,

1991; Suchman, 1995) has uncovered that firms may persist with underperforming employees

or even hire local workers at a premium as a mere attempt to gain legitimacy in the local

market (Forstenlechner & Mellahi, 2011; Sidani & Al Ariss, 2014). Such hiring of local

workers enables multinationals to appear “local” and in attuned with local traditions and

culture. Forstenlechner and Mellahi (2011) uncovered that multinationals in sectors where the

employment level of nationals is low, hiring or persisting with local workers equipped

multinationals to be able to extract concessions from the national government. As Baum and

Oliver (1991: 187) pointed out so eloquently, “External legitimacy elevates the organisation’s

status in the community, facilitates resource acquisition, and deflects questions about an

organisation’s rights and competence to provide specific products or services.” Therefore,

such external forces from the government can encourage firms to persist with the status quo.

Research has also shown that trade unions have also used their collective bargaining

powers to extract a wage premium for their members as well as protect underperforming

workers from being fired (Atanassov & Kim, 2009; see also The Economist, 2011). Such

external organisations are able to exert pressures which restrict managers’ ability to terminate

employment of workers (Atanassov & Kim, 2009). Indeed, research has also demonstrated

that poorly performing workers are less likely to be fired in an environment where there are

strong union laws in tandem with weak investor protection (Atanassov & Kim, 2009; see also

## Shein, 2011). As Atanassov and Kim (2009, 342–343) put it, “Underperforming top

7

managers in low investor protection countries are more likely to retain their jobs as union

# power increases.”

## The “escalation of commitment” (Brockner, 1992; Staw, 1981) and the “too much

invested to quit” perspective (Schwenk & Tang, 1989; Teger, 1980) also offer a theoretical

lens to view how and why firms persist with underperformance. This line of research argues

that “cost of strategic change”, i.e. firing underperforming workers, may simply be too high

for some firms, forcing them to engage in strategic persistence (Amankwah-Amoah, 2014;

Shein, 2011). This entails financial and non-financial costs such as training new employees,

hiring costs, risks associated with new employees, risk of former employees filing lawsuits,

compensation and redundancy pay as a result of strategic change (Shein, 2011). Related to

the above is a stream of research which argued that persistence may stem from mere

inefficiencies, poor information and poor communication flow within the focal firm (see

# Schwenk & Tang, 1989).

Another relevant stream of research is the pay-for-performance literature. Past studies

have demonstrated that pay-for-performance is strongly associated with superior individual

and organisational performances (see Sturman, Trevor, Boudreau & Gerhart, 2003). One line

of research has suggested that highly productive employees are more likely to opt for pay-for-

performance compensation, whereas, less productive workers often prefer fixed-salary

compensation (Jensen, 2003). Accordingly, failure or inability to reward workers for their

performance creates conditions, which discourage

# future performance

leading

underperformance (see Wagner-Tsukamoto, 2007). Table 1 summaries the key features of the

perspectives. Although firms persist with such workers, our understanding remains limited.

Much of the existing literature has failed to offer a comprehensive explanation as to why

companies persist with underperforming workers. Therefore, there is a need for a better

## understanding of underperforming workers.

# Research method and analysis

# Research context

In this section, we provide brief background information on Ghana and Nigeria as context

and in help positioning the findings. Since gaining independences in the last century, both

countries have emerged as leading forces in West African economic and political

development (Jackson, 2004; Serkin, 2015). They have a flourishing private sector,

experiencing economic growth. More importantly, they have been recognised as amongst the

most promising emerging markets of this century (Serkin, 2015). Over the past two decades,

African countries have recorded an unprecedented and sustained economic growth of 4.5

percent annual average. Beegle et al. (2016) referred to these growths as “remarkably robust”

especially when compared with the declining periods of the 1970s and 1980s when the

continent was perceived as deeply entrenched in poverty and endemic in wars and famine

(Beegle et al., 2016). This performance is stimulated by the institutionalisation of democratic

dispensations, liberalisations, and efforts at good governance which together have culminated

to the current focus on the continent as “Africa rising” (Amankwah-Amoah et al., 2016;

Beegle et al., 2016). Both countries have been among the favourite destination of substantial

FDI inflows into the sub-West African region over the years (Nyuur & Debrah, 2014).

Ghana and Nigeria gained independence in 1957 and 1960 respectively from the

British government. Shortly after this, these two countries recorded good economic growth

up until the late 1960s. However, spates of political upheavals in the form of coup d’état

contributed to the dwindling economic fortunes of these countries in the 1970s and 1980s

(Moja, 2000). Ghana’s GDP has been hovering around 7% per annum since the early 2000s,

only dipping to o 4% and 3.4% in 2014 and 2015 respectively, it is projected to recover and

record a stronger growth rate of 8.2% in 2017 and 2018 (Beegle et al., 2016). Nigeria is

9

projected to maintain a 5.3 % GDP growth in 2017 and 2018 despite a dip to 3.3% GDP in

2015 (Beegle et al., 2016). Ghana like other African countries is endowed with valuable

minerals, such as gold and diamonds and its economy has been reliant on cocoa, gold,

diamond and to some extent the recent discovery of oil in 2007 (Nyame & Grant, 2014).

Nigeria on the other hand is the world’s eighth largest oil producer and the economy has been

reliant on its huge oil wealth which still account for over 95% of the country’s foreign

# exchange earnings (Agbiboa, 2012).

Moreover, Nigeria has a population of 182 million people which positions it as the

fifth most populated country in the world, and is projected to have 397 million people by

2050 as the third most populated country after India, China, and the USA (Population

Reference Bureau, 2015). Ghana’s population of 27.7 million people in 2015 also is projected

to reach 37.7 million and 52.6 million people by 2030 and 2050 respectively (Population

Reference Bureau, 2015). Majority of the current population in both countries are under 25

years old and are therefore projected to constitute the economic workforce in the next decade.

These demographics in both countries present an attractive environment for businesses in

terms of a good source of labour force and an effective market for consumers. In the 2015

World Banking ranking of 189 economies on the ease of doing business, Ghana and Nigeria

## occupied 114 and 169 positions respectively (World Bank, 2016).

One of the key parameters in the rankings is the flexibility of the countries’ labour

market regulatory frameworks relating to hiring, work scheduling and firing. These

regulatory frameworks influence employers in decision making regarding dismissals,

promotion, retraining, and reassigning employees (World Bank, 2016). The ranking of these

two countries on this index suggests that there are some bottlenecks to smooth business

# operations and flexible labour regulatory framework in both countries particularly Nigeria

and more efforts are required to enhance the situation. In 2015 Corruption Perceptions Index

10

by Transparency international, Ghana and Nigeria were ranked 56th and 136th respectively

out of 167 countries around the world (Transparency International, 2015). Notwithstanding

the gains chalked by these countries, corruption is identified as one of the main issues holding

Nigeria back from its potential and contributing to the high poverty level of about 70%

people living on less than $1 a day (Agbiboa, 2012).

# Method

Given that the issue of underperforming workers and why firms persist with them remains

largely unexplored within the international business, strategy and human resource literature,

we adopted a qualitative approach to provide the depth of understanding (Birkinshaw,

Brannen & Tung, 2011; Eisenhardt, 1989; Miles & Huberman, 1994; Siggelkow, 2007). Our

work sought to generate theory rather than test theory. We adopted semi-structured

# interviews with human resource professionals, managers and decision-makers in both the

public and private sectors. In line with recommendations of such studies in a high relational

context of emerging economies, we utilised personal networks and the snowballing approach

to help identify and trace managers and employees across multiple organisations (Acquaah,

2007). The study also utilised networks within two African universities to help identify

informants. Over an extended period, the authors interviewed business owners, managers,

consultants, executives and investment bankers who are responsible for hiring, firing,

managing and overseeing the work of employees. We also elicited views from professionals

in sectors such as sales and marketing, financial services, warehousing, public sector

organisations and operations management. Most of the informants are employees of global,

# regional and indigenous multinationals.

We developed semi-structured interview questions to elicit the views of these

professionals. To narrow down the scope of the study, the interviews covered the following

broad areas. In the first set of questions, we focused on the informants’ employers, incentive

11

and rewards system, and decision-making processes. The questions also focused on the key

challenges in the workplace, hiring and firing. We also asked the informants whether they

managed or worked with any employee who had consistently underperformed over a long

period of time. The final set of questions revolved around causes of underperformance,

processes in dealing with underperformance, options in dealing with underperforming

workers, why firms hung on to them, and their experiences and views. They were also asked

about the difficulties in dealing with and managing underperforming workers including how

the firm deals with early-warning signals of performance decline by employees. Some of the

authors conducted the interviews from early 2014 to early 2015. On average, the interviews

lasted around 60 minutes. Given the focus on two countries, we sought to ensure a greater

level of consistency as well as a degree of flexibility to allow new insights to emerge

(Robson, 2002).

# Data collection and analysis

Given the sensitive nature of discussion of the status of co-workers and subordinates, many

of the informants requested that we limit ourselves to note taking. This meant that extensive

field notes were taken, transcribed verbatim and cross-checked with the informants to ensure

accuracy. Following the “24-hour rule” (Eisenhardt, 1989), text and field notes were

transcribed verbatim within 24 hours of each interview. This helped to establish a clear

chronology of events and capitalise on the immediacy of our data (Gioia & Thomas, 1996;

Whyte, 1994). Interview data were transcript coded into common themes and issues. In all,

we conducted 61 interviews in both countries.

To analyse our data, we employ a narrative strategy (Langley, 1999) by writing a

detailed field note and summary for each informant covering the issues noted above. We

developed a chronology and narrative accounts. We then looked for patterns and similarities

in their responses, and then organised the data to allow meanings to be deduced. As observed

12

by Eisenhardt (1989, p. 541), “the juxtaposition of seemingly similar cases by a researcher

looking for differences can break simplistic frames”. The data analysis replicated the

inductive grounded theory development process (Glaser & Strauss, 1967; Sutton, 1991)

which “requires that data and theory be constantly compared and contrasted throughout the

data collection and analysis process” (Isabella, 1990, p. 12).The process led to classifications

of responses into sections such as causes of underperformance, firms’ responses and

persistence with underperformance. The interview data were supported with secondary data

gleaned from sources such as press releases, internal documents, company websites,

newspapers and additional materials provided by the informants. In presenting the findings,

we used letter N to denote informants from Nigeria and letter G to denote informants from

Ghana. Table 2 provides an overview of our times of data collection and data sources.

------------------------------ Insert Table 2 about here ------------------------------

# Findings and analysis

Before we tease out why firms persist with such workers, we first provide a brief overview of

some of the early-warning signals. Our study uncovered a number of early-warning signals

leading to the identification of an underperforming worker. These include declining

performance, lack of motivation and low productivity. An informant noted:

“When they are unable to meet the agreed targets … At the beginning of every quarter,

employees are assigned their task for the period.” (G11)

Another informant elaborated:

“I think inability to deliver results accurately and timely is the key indicator.” (N2)

# Favouritism through tribalism

The field work revealed that workers’ upward movements, demotion and dismissal of

underperforming workers appeared to be moderated by favouritism through tribalism and

13

corruption. The data suggest that virtually all the informants in public sector organisations

emphasised that the most significant factor for the retention of underperforming employees in

the public sector in Nigeria and Ghana is tribalism. By tribalism, we are referring to the

tendency of managers and line managers to favour other employees from their tribe with

regard to work practices such as firing, hiring and promotion (see Beugré & Offodile, 2001).

This implies that superior officers or heads of establishments overlook the inefficiency of

their subordinates if they belong to the same tribe. For instance, Nigeria is a traditional

society in which the tribal units struggle for dividends of the country’s resources. An

informant (N38), who has worked for a private sector organisation and is now in the public

sector, stated that the pressure for conformance to tribal sentiment is higher in the public

sector due to low requirements for leadership accountability. One informant in Ghana

explained:

“We have so many incompetent workers that you will not believe it … when you visit

government department, you see blatant tribalism and favouritism everywhere … the Ewes

protect Ewes, Asantes protect Asantes and Gas protect Gas (local tribes)… superiors of each

protect their own kind and look the other way.” (G19)

Our field work indicates that persistence with poor performance, corruption and

governance is partly entrenched in tribalism. The informants observed that the slogan in the

workplace environment in government agencies is “tribal politics remains alive and well”

which corrupts decision making processes to the detriment of competent employees. In the

setting of publicly-owned organisations, it has been suggested that departments often

resemble the family and ethnic character of the senior official or minister (see also Ovadje &

Ankomah, 2001). Tribe has been rendered more potent in both societies largely due to the

fact that people have historically blamed other tribes for unemployment and poor education

in another tribe. Some tribes are considered to be “lazy” and “shy away from work” which

then provides the ammunition for some managers to seek to protect and preserve the job of

14

their fellow tribal members. There are often complex “tribe alliances” and mini groups who

protect their kind. Many of the decision-makers are seen as “tribal champions” who advanced

the interest of their kind often irrespective of competence. Another noted,

“The government official said they have policy to have people from his ethic group so

we cannot fire him.”

An informant summarised the effects of tribalism by noting that, “It is sad that this

society remains tribal … our agency hire people based on their tribe and when they do not

perform we still keep them.” (G18)

“It’s the T-word … tribalism is the root of this problem in the public sector.” (G17)

Some of the informants attributed persistence to favouritism. As some informants noted:

“I think it stems from both favouritism and tribalism. My co-worker has benefited from this.”

(N10)

“Most often the employees are a family relation to the owner of the company or he or she is

## in the ‘good books’ of his supervisor.” (G3)

Our analysis suggests that cultural traditions and relational ties also perpetuate

persistence with underperforming workers. Many of the managers had developed and forged

closer relationships with their subordinates which then become a barrier to terminating their

relations and the employment of the close friend. Some of the informants and key decision-

makers appeared to be particularly more concerned about maintaining personal ties and

relationships rather than maintaining organisational success and survival. One informant puts

# it this way:

“My job is to ensure that the company keeps a very good book. I also ensure that every naira

spent is accounted for in the company ... Employees who were recruited through connection

are always difficult to sack … Yes! We have reduced the salaries of those employees and kept

them on.” (N22)

15

“It may be sentiment as a result of emotional attachments that have grown over the years. It

may also be that they are the connection to major customers/contributors.” (N2)

Based on the above analysis of favouritism and tribalism, we offer the following

# propositions:

Proposition 1a: Tribalism is more likely to create conditions for underperformance to

ferment in developing economies with different tribes.

Proposition 1b: Tribalism influences management decisions to persist with

underperforming employees in public sector organisations in developing economies

# with different tribes.

# Relationship and personal ties

Our findings further suggest that indigenous managers are often unwilling to sever workplace

and family ties. Such ties are seen to offer institutional support and security beyond the

workplace. For many of the informants, terminating the employment of underperforming

workers is seen as severing ties with the person. Therefore, the emotional burdens that can

befall the person lead to persistence with the employee in the face of the evidence. Some of

the informants noted that they have often sidestepped the decision to weed out such workers

to maintain their personal and family relationships. We further observed that Ghanaian and

Nigerian societies are collectivist in nature and as such workers or employees tend to develop

“strongly knitted social ties and feel a sense of obligation to their kith and kin” (Mmieh et al.,

2011, p. 424; Jackson, 2004). These networks of ties in relationships then influence firm

behaviour and managers’ freedom to act.

“I also think personal relationships make it difficult to fire incompetent employees.” (N33)

The analysis of interview data suggests that the paternal culture by which employers

treat employees as their children was highlighted by a number of the respondents as a key

factor that led to retention of underperforming employees in the Nigerian environment. The

16

pull towards personal wellbeing, which typifies the paternal culture, overrides corporate

interest and objectives. Informants who work for entrepreneurial organisations were

unanimous in pointing to family ties between owners and some employees as the cause of

retention of underperforming employees. An informant who owns a travel agency (N41) said

she retains underperforming employees who are family members because she would still

meet their financial needs if they were sacked, stressing that “in Nigeria, you are your

brother’s keeper”. She also pointed to honesty and loyalty as trade-off for job performance in

her organisation. As another informant elaborated:

“Every time we tried to sack him (elderly worker) he brought up stories of his family. In the

end, we kept him with new duties.” (G17)

As Mmieh et al. (2011, p. 424) put it,

“The Ghanaian worker extends the institutional cultural traits of high esteem to authority,

hierarchy, acceptance of status differentials, and respect for elders and positions in the

workplace … managers/elders in position are expected to exercise constraint in reprimanding

and/or weeding out underperforming workers in the workplace.”

One of the informants specifically emphasised the effect of the drive to maintain relationships

which has resulted in retaining an ineffective sick employee for over two years in his

organisation. He said:

“This employee is being retained despite the fact that the period specified in the extant

employment rules for light duties has been exceeded and he is supposed to be retired.”(N40).

The complexities characterising this issue in many Sub-Saharan African countries is

also captured by Ovadje and Ankomah (2001, p. 184) who noted that often an employee

facing disciplinary action could direct a delegation of elders encompassing cultural and local

potentates to the home of the line manager or supervisor to plead on behalf of the ‘victim’ as

well as remind him or her of the potential “economic and social damage the impending

17

disciplinary action will do to the person’s family (both immediate and extended), kinsmen,

# village or even entire ethnic group”.

Another respondent observed that in his organisation, employees who are relations of

the managing directors do not face any consequence for persistent underperformance.

Rewards such as promotions are based on informal relationships rather than job performance.

An informant (N40) who works for a multinational oil company revealed that some of his

colleagues who underperform rely on the worker’s union leaders for protection from being

sacked. They also rely on collective bargaining where uniform wage increases negotiated by

the employees’ union on behalf of their members reward low and high performers equally as

they can hardly achieve reasonable performance-based compensation. These inequities

impact negatively on productivity as high performers are discouraged and could lead to a

vicious cycle of persistent underperformance of employees. Based on the above analysis, we

offer the following propositions:

Proposition 2a: Relational and social ties are more likely to curtail managerial

actions when dealing with underperforming workers.

Proposition 2b: Older underperforming employees are less likely to be actioned by

## younger managers than younger underperforming employees.

# Non-profit motives of the employer

Another important aspect of our findings relates to the role of government and state-owned

agencies. We uncovered that, largely due to non-profit motives of some organisations,

persistence with underperforming workers was not frowned upon. Most of the informants

noted that the government agencies and non-governmental sector have become a sanctuary

for many incompetent workers. Another informant in Nigeria (N36), who is a head of

department in a government establishment, argued that the main objective of government

involvement in economic activities is creation of employment and provision of goods and

18

# services

# to

## the citizenry at affordable prices. His organisation

# therefore retains

underperforming employees in line with the deliberate policy of government to keep citizens

in employment as a means of meeting individuals’ needs and avoiding social unrest. Over the

years, government agencies in both countries have also become a sanctuary for incompetence

and underperforming workers. Many employees have secured their jobs on the basis of

political connections. Consequently, “jobs for life” and allotment of management posts on the

basis of political affiliation has become very common. As one informant in Ghana explained:

“Yes! We have some workers who do not have the right skills or educational qualification, so

they can’t be fired … they are also not good at the job. They were placed here by the ‘boss’

# (senior politician).” (G20)

Another Nigerian concurred by noting that:

“There is really no incompetent employee here (current firm) … a few months ago, I visited a

government agency and found three of the people we fired earlier in the year there. They said

they had no pressure to perform or even carry out their duties.” (N8)

One of them who works for a public organisation in Lagos (N39) asserted:

“There is no motivation for performance improvement as rewards are not based on

# performance but patronage.”

One explanation for this is that so long as their political masters remain in power, job

security is assured, irrespective of their performance on the job. This has created an

atmosphere where such workers’ performances bear no relation to their level of rewards.

Another informant from the private sector noted:

“I will always fire an incompetent worker because he/she has nothing to offer. One bad seed

can destroy the business … We have fired plenty employees who could not meet their targets.

Those former employees responded by looking for less strict jobs in government.” (N23)

19

Government agencies have also provided avenues for such workers to be transferred

to on cases where the incompetence becomes so disruptive for the department. An employer

(N37) who described herself as a social entrepreneur said she simultaneously pursues both

economic profit and social objectives. She sees some of her underperforming employees as

being from poor or disadvantaged backgrounds who should be kept in employment and

developed through training and mentoring. Based on the above analysis, we offer the

following proposition:

Proposition 3: Firms focusing on non-profit objectives are more likely to create

## conditions for persistence with underperforming workers.

# Information hoarding

Our findings suggested that some regional managers deliberately desist from sharing

information about underperformance in an attempt to conceal their contributions and thereby

creating conditions for strategic persistence to occur. Many of the informants attributed

managers’ ability to keep underperforming workers in their places of employment to

“information hoarding”, where they decide not to communicate or withhold information

about a subordinate’s persistent underperformance to the superiors. By being able to hoard

such information or failure to volunteer performance information, line managers contribute to

keeping underperforming workers in their jobs. As one head of government agency asserted:

“I cannot act in the vacuum … if people send me information (incorrect) that everyone is

doing well then I cannot sanction anyone. This is the root of the problem.” (G16)

As another informant noted:

“Sometimes we have to wait a long time before getting a report (on job performance) from

our branches … we can only act quickly if the information arrives on time.” (G18)

Government bureaucracies in both countries were also identified as a major factor in

restricting flow of knowledge about underperformance from local branches to headquarters.

20

Such intentional practices create conditions for persistence with underperformance to occur.

The information asserted that efficient organisation of their firms relies heavily on diffusion

of information from the branches to headquarters. Lack of effective flow not only affects

quality decision making but also creates conditions to maintain the current course of action.

Thus, we propose:

Proposition 4: Information hoarding is more likely to lead to poor attributions of

## underperformance and persistence with underperforming workers.

# External forces

Our data indicate that across the two countries, some firms have kept underperforming

workers as a “bridging strategy” to build bridges with local communities. By originating from

a particular ethnic group, such individuals are seen to bring a degree of legitimacy to their

firms. For firms desperately seeking legitimacy in the community, keeping such workers

provides a means of demonstrating their engagement to the local community. Such

individuals also act as joints and protect their firms from accusations of exploiting the local

community. Some workers in this category represented symbolic tokens to convince locals

that the firm represented their values and traditions. As one foreign-owned business co-owner

noted:

“When we moved the business here, some of the locals did not like us and even threatened

our business … so we have two workers that can be seen as ‘underperforming’ but they have

strong links in the community – that is why we have kept them … they are helping us to

reduce the tension.” (G15)

Another informant concurred:

“Yes! A decade ago … his incompetence caused the company a fortune including the cost of

his retraining and coaching. The other staff were not pleased with the decision … he was a

native of the area and we kept him in the business.”(G6)

21

# Other external factors

Our findings also suggest that managers/owners of firms with poorly performing individuals

often have a desire to improve efficiency by firing such individuals. However, they have been

unable to do so particularly due to the strong potential influence from government officials.

Although the contributions of such workers are often non-existent within the firm, any

attempt to terminate their employment could lead to sudden changes in government policy or

contracts of which the firm is a beneficiary. One informant noted:

“As soon as we issued him a notice (letter) that his contract was under threat due to poor

performance, his ‘contact’ in government informed us that our contract with them was under

review … after three weeks it became clear to us so we decided to withdraw the notice … It

then came as no surprise when a government official contacted us to say that it was a false

# alarm.” (G14)

This informant also noted that the employee has been kept for more than a year, not

because of his contribution to the business, but because of his contacts which helped them to

maintain the government contract. In this informant’s experience, the worker came to be

designated as part of the “protected group” of workers, who in theory could not be fired

because of the risk of losing contracts and connections with government officials to the

business. To some co-workers, the continuous employment of such individuals is shrouded in

mystery into which they have limited insight.

By the same token, the data from Nigeria also suggest that many of those interviewed

pointed to corruption as one of the main reasons why organisations persist with

underperforming employees in Nigeria. Many pointed out that underperforming employees

are not only retained in employment, but promoted because of their loyalty in paying

“homage” and presenting gifts as bribes to those in leadership positions. When the

interviewer told them that corruption existed in all parts of the world, virtually all the

informants retorted that it is a norm rather than an exception in Nigeria.

22

Another aspect of our findings indicates that some of the workers were recruited by

the new executive teams and portrayed as the up-and-coming star performers. Over time such

workers failed to deliver and eventually came to be seen as underperforming. However, some

of the top management often fail to admit defeat and worry that firing such workers could

damage their reputation and judgement. Consequently, the executive persist with such

workers to protect their reputation. As one informant noted:

“They just want to save face … XXX employed him two years ago but we haven’t seen

anything yet … XXX won’t fire him.” (G14)

A director of a major automobile marketing company in Lagos (N39) referred to some

aspects of organisational culture as being responsible for the persistence of underperforming

employees in his organisation. He said the fear of diffusion of business secrets, especially by

senior managers, has led to keeping them as employees even when they have begun to

underperform. Table 3 provides a summary of how underperforming workers have come to

be viewed as “imposed workers” and possessing “unfulfilled potentials”. As illustrated in the

table, persistence with underperforming workers can stem from their imposition from an

external force over which management have limited or no control. In some of the case of the

oil multinationals, persistence were at time attributed to governmental contracts requiring

foreign firms to have a quota of local employees. As one government official (N36) in

Nigeria with several years of experiences noted,

“We make it clear to them (Western multinationals) that they have to hire more local workers

not only labourers, but also as senior managers, if they want to succeed here”.

This guideline was noted to have influenced demand for executive-level and blue-collar

# employees but more

importantly created some kind of “protection”

# for some

underperforming senior managers given the competition for such talent.

------------------------------ Insert Table 3 about here ------------------------------

23

Our findings here lead us to the following summary proposition:

Proposition 5: Employees who enjoy special status are more likely to be retained

# after persistent underperformance.

# Cost of training

Our analysis also indicates that the costs of training and relational ties are some of the reasons

why firms persist with such workers. For many small businesses, the high costs of training

and recruiting well-educated workers have forced them to keep some underperforming

workers, as illustrated in Table 4.

------------------------------ Insert Table 4 about here ------------------------------

The study suggests that, cumulatively, persistence with underperforming workers stems not

only from external forces but also internal factors such as relational ties and idiosyncrasy

credits, as depicted in Figure 1.

# Discussion and implications

The primary question that we have addressed in this study is why firms persist with

underperforming workers. Drawing on insights from two emerging economies in Africa:

Ghana and Nigeria, we uncovered that persistence with underperforming workers stems from

factors such as information hoarding, favouritism through tribalism, “idiosyncrasy credit”,

externally imposed constraints and escalation of commitment. Interestingly, we have

uncovered evidence to advance the notion that ethnic ties and tribalism play an influential

role in the decision by managers to persist with underperforming workers. Another broad

category of sources of persistence stems from the emotional bond created between

supervisors and subordinates. The existence of such ties constrained managers’ ability to act

in the face of persistent poor performance. It also stems from firms’ attempt to gain and retain

24

political ties and “special privileges”. In addition, we uncovered that outside the work

environment, some of such workers are utilised as a means of gaining legitimacy and

cultivating trust with the local politicians.

# Contributions to theory and practice

Regarding theoretical implications, although strategic persistence has attracted a body of

research (Audia et al., 2000; Schwenk & Tang, 1989), there remains a lack of understanding

as to why companies persist with such workers. Our study seeks to fill this gap in the

literature by integrating theoretical concepts (i.e. the paradox of success, external legitimacy,

nepotism/cronyism and the “escalation of commitment” (Staw, 1981) in helping to offer a

more robust explanation of the subject. The integrated nature of the study accentuates the

robustness of examining issues in this research domain using multiple and integrative

approaches, instead of the narrow theoretical focus usually adopted in this research. This

approach adds to and extends previous research that examined these theoretical perspectives

separately. Second, the study proposed an enhanced unified framework of impelling forces

driving the incidence of persistence with underperforming employees in organisations. The

proposed unified framework in this study also provides a basis for scholars to further evolve

and develop an even more integrative perspective of the issues.

Another potential implication of our findings is that “laws in many developing

countries favour employees as they are seen as the 'weaker' party in the organization-

employee relationship” and therefore they have weak bargaining power and ability to

influence employers. In light of increasing global competition and needs to improve

government efficiency, government laws might have indirectly created conditions for

persistence with such workers. Finally, the finding that public sector institutions and non-

profit organisations are more likely to persevere with underperforming employees in this

high-relational context is novel and adds to the literature.

25

From a managerial standpoint, our analysis indicates that the ability to identify early

warning signals of seriously underperforming workers can help reduce later resources

required to undo or repair the damage to the business. There is a need to create an effective

mechanism to upgrade the expertise and knowledge of seriously underperforming and

“difficult to fire” employees to help reduce potential losses to the business. In addition,

weeding out underperforming workers can boost confidence of co-workers which would

impact on overall firm performance. This is also consistent with the assertion that weeding

out underperforming workers can equip firms to mitigate prolonged poor performance. More

importantly, weeding out such workers boosts confidence of co-workers. For firms in such

high-relational contexts, there is a need to identify an effective mechanism for dealing with

underperforming workers without imposing an additional burden on the decision-maker such

as the possibility of severing all ties with the individual.

## Limitations and directions for future research

The study has some limitations worth noting. First, we focus on just two countries with a

small number of informants. This means that the findings might not be generalised to other

emerging market contexts or other African settings. This limitation opens an avenue for

future study to seek a much larger sample from multiple countries. Second, our study focused

mainly on underperforming workers which some firms might construe in a different way.

Such analysis would help to test the limit of our findings. Another area worthy of further

scholarly works is the need to examine the relationship between underperforming workers

and underperforming companies. It may be that a lack of decisiveness in dealing with

underperforming workers breeds mistrust and causes co-workers to underperform, thereby

undermining the business and precipitating failure. Such analysis would not only shed light

on human capital development strategies but also help to offer a more robust explanation of

the processes leading to business failure in emerging economies (Amankwah-Amoah, 2016).

It is also worth noting that local employment, labour and contract law also play a pivotal role

26

in curtailing managerial actions. In this paper, we largely steer away from such explanations.

It is also worth noting that shortage of top talent in developing countries also forces firms to

retain such workers even in the face of underperformance (Tosi, Werner, Katz & Gomez-

Mejia, 2000). Future research might seek to conduct a comparative study of such laws in the

two countries and beyond to help develop our understanding of the subject.

# Another fruitful

line of research would be

to examine

# the responses of

outperformers/top stars to persistence with underperforming workers. Such analysis would

help to enrich our understanding of whether outperformers become demotivated and alter

their routines and contributions in such high-relational contexts. Such analysis might also

# yield other possible explanations for persistence with such workers beyond the findings

presented here. There is also a need for future studies to examine the effects of industry and

organizational size on our findings. We hope that this study fosters further lines of research in

# this area.

“Some of our colleagues here call them the ‘untouchables’. They have no idea how the business operates and yet they are protected from being fired by ‘outside forces’.” (G14)

“Some incompetent employees in the bank have big contacts who bring very large deposits, as a result of that the bank might retain them despite her weaknesses.” (N23)

“Incompetent employees should be sacked because they are counter-productive to the organisation … but someone protects them here.” (N12)
