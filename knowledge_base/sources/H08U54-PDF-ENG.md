“Can you write a letter of recommendation for me? I’m applying to a

# doctoral program at your alma mater.”

This was the email Ruth received from someone within her network

whom she knew of, but didn’t really know personally. What made

matters worse, this came from someone who was always asking for

favors, but never reciprocated.

As you rise professionally, your visibility increases—and so do the

requests. Suddenly, people you haven’t heard from in years are reaching

out. These requests are often disguised as opportunities but can drain

# time, energy, and social capital.

Ruth studies and speaks on extreme high achievers, including Nobel

Prize winners, astronauts, and NBA champions. Dorie is an author

and speaker who has written about long-term strategy—including

## strategic networking—in her most recent book, The Long Game. And

yet, in between polite outreach from lovely people, both of us have

also experienced networking requests that violate basic precepts of

# professionalism.

Indeed, the asks come fast and furious: several years ago, Dorie spent a

month tallying her inbound emails and discovered that she received an

average of 69 requests—for introductions, letters of recommendation,

“pick your brain” calls, and more—every single week. It’s relatively

easy to say no to strangers who approach with onerous asks (like the

person who emailed Ruth). But it’s harder to resist when the requests

are coming from people with whom you have ongoing relationships.

We’ve identiﬁed four red ﬂags that people in your network may be taking advantage of you—and if so, knowing how to respond

strategically and gracefully is a critical skill to master.

- 1. Always an ask

We all have people in our network who only reach out when they

want something, ranging from intros to blurbs to time-consuming,

last-minute favors. If you’re being approached repeatedly by someone,

it’s useful to create a “generosity ﬁlter” in order to honestly evaluate

whether they’re consistently a “taker.” You can ask yourself questions

# like:

- When was the last time this person engaged without an ask?

- Do I feel drained or diminished after interacting with them?

- Do they seem more interested in my resources or connections than in

# me as a person?

- Do they make vague promises about helping in the future, but never

seem to get around to it?

Cutting oﬀ favors to these individuals—and maybe even limiting

contact overall—isn’t being selﬁsh, but is instead a way to protect your

# time and energy.

- 2. Insincere praise

It’s nice to be told we’re brilliant or insightful or thoughtful—but not

when it becomes clear, moments later, that the compliment is merely

the prelude to an ask. This is a form of manipulation—a misuse of the

reciprocity principle that psychologist and author Robert Cialdini has

identiﬁed as a lever of inﬂuence (“They were nice to me, so I should be

nice to them in return by doing them this favor”).

Try to resist this very human reﬂex, as it will likely only lead to future

requests. Thank them for the kind words, but feel free to decline. You

don’t owe them anything as a result of their compliment. “I’m focused on

other priorities right now,” you could say, or “Thank you, but this doesn’t

align with my goals.”

- 3. Lopsided requests to collaborate

Some people like to propose “collaborations”—to coauthor an

article, jointly present at a conference, or co-host a workshop, for

instance. Yet if you dig beneath the surface, sometimes the oﬀer is

## clearly one-sided, with far greater beneﬁts accruing to them than to you.

In these instances, your prospective “collaborator” may primarily seek

to attach their name to yours, hoping there will be a spillover eﬀect and

that some of your brand repute or network will cascade over to them.

It’s important to recognize that true collaborations mean that each

person should bring something unique and valuable to the process, and

that working together will make the end product better than if each

person worked on it separately. You can use a collaboration litmus test

and ask yourself:

- Will I beneﬁt equally from this collaboration?

- Does this align with my strategic direction and goals right now?

- Is the success of the project disproportionately dependent on me (my

# expertise, network, or audience)?

It’s always OK to decline the oﬀer, and real friends will understand if it’s

# not a ﬁt for you.

- 4. Name-dropping

Some people may feel that the association to you will increase their

credibility. They start to name-drop you in meetings or online, and do

so without your consent or actual involvement. Dorie once received

multiple inquiries from colleagues asking about her experience working

with a particular vendor—which was confusing, because she’d never

employed him. She realized that he’d used a quote she’d given

complimenting his podcast on a page labeled “testimonials,” implying

they’d done business

You can set ﬁrm and non-negotiable boundaries protecting your brand

equity by addressing these issues directly. You could say something like,

“I saw my name mentioned and I believe others may be confused about

the nature of our work together. I’d prefer for this to be taken down.” Or,

depending on the circumstance, you might say, “If you want to mention

me, I’d prefer to be consulted before being included going forward.” It

can be useful to create a Google alert with your name so you’re aware

when others are citing you

The more successful you become, the more you attract both attention

and unsolicited requests to connect. By spotting these warning signs,

you can maintain the integrity and trust of your network, protect

your time, and preserve your most important relationships. Healthy

networks are reciprocal, not extractive.
