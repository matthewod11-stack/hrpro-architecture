Decades ago, as women entered the workforce in large numbers,

childcare became a growing challenge for employees, men and women

alike. Today oﬀering childcare support is integral to any smart

organization’s talent strategy. But a new caregiving challenge has

emerged for many workers, and it’s time for companies to get serious

about helping them address it. That challenge is eldercare.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Your Company Needs an Eldercare Policy

Consider this remarkable fact: For the ﬁrst time in U.S. history, the

number of working adults providing care to an older adult (nearly 23

million) has surpassed the number providing care to preschool children

(21 million). Elder caregivers currently make up 14% of the workforce,

and that number is only going to increase, because Americans aged 65

and older are the fastest-growing segment of the population. By 2050

their numbers are projected to have increased by 30%, from 63 million

to 82 million, accounting for nearly one-quarter of the total population.

Growing even faster are the “oldest old” (aged 85+), whose numbers are

projected to increase nearly 150% during that period, from 7 million to

17 million. Similar trends prevail in nearly all developed countries and

many developing ones around the world.

Unfortunately, “health spans” (the time people can expect to live free of

disability) are not keeping pace with longer lifespans. Life expectancy

in the United States is around 78 years, but older adults on average now

spend the ﬁnal dozen years of their lives coping with poor health, a

number that has also grown in recent years. As we describe in our recent

## study “Meeting the Growing Demand for Age-Friendly Care: Health

Care at the Crossroads,” more older adults than ever will need a complex

spectrum of care and support in the decades ahead, and they’ll need it

# for longer.

The supply of family caregivers—who provide the preponderance of

eldercare—is also not keeping pace with growing lifespans. Families

have gotten smaller, which means fewer children are available to care

for their parents or other relatives. They’re also more geographically

dispersed, which means fewer members live close enough to provide

everyday care. A rough gauge of the shrinking supply is the U.S. Census

Bureau’s “caregiver support ratio,” which compares the population most

likely to provide care (those aged 45 to 64) with the population most

likely to need care (those 80 and older). In 2010 the ratio was 7:1; in 2030

it will be 4:1; in 2050 it will be 3:1. This trend, too, prevails in developed

and developing countries around the world.

Paid caregiving won’t ﬁll the supply gap, for two reasons. First, for the

majority of American families, it’s unaﬀordable: Annual long-term-care

costs, which Medicare generally doesn’t cover, average $104,000 for

in-facility care and $69,000 for in-home situations. Second, to keep

up with demand, the long-term-care workforce would need to grow by

more than a million people over the coming 10 years. That’s not likely to

# happen.

Expanding Medicare to cover long-term care would oﬀer enormous

relief to people shouldering the cost and eﬀort of eldercare. And that

idea is very popular: Recent research by Age Wave and the John A.

Hartford Foundation found that 80% of all Americans are in favor of

integrating long-term care into a new age-friendly healthcare system.

Most U.S. workers will need to provide eldercare at some point

during their careers. Even if expanding Medicare were politically

and economically viable, however, many employees would still be

responsible for coordinating care and other responsibilities. Eldercare

would remain a part-time job for much of the workforce. To help

employees meet the challenge, employers need to step up, just as the

majority have done for childcare, and provide more support in the form

## of new and expanded policies, programs, and beneﬁts. The business

case for doing so is straightforward. According to Care.com, supporting

family caregivers improves productivity, retention, recruitment, and

diversity, and according to the Rutgers Center for Women in Business,

the work of caregiving itself leads to growth: Caregivers have been

shown to bring enriched capabilities to the workplace, among them empathy, eﬃciency, and persistence.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Your Company Needs an Eldercare Policy

The factors driving the need for eldercare support vary greatly

around the world, and international organizations adjust their beneﬁts

oﬀerings to local laws and circumstances. That’s because although

the demographics of population aging are common across developed

countries, many countries have longer health spans and better public-

health outcomes than the United States does, in part because of more-

## comprehensive public healthcare systems and more provisions for

long-term care. Japan, for example, makes long-term-care insurance

mandatory for citizens aged 40 and over, and the Netherlands has

included long-term care in its national healthcare system since 1968.

Compared with most developed countries, the United States faces more

eldercare support needs, which employers can help ﬁll. But much

of what employee caregivers need—education, navigational guidance,

## personal support, workplace ﬂexibility, and time for caregiving—is

# consistent across the world.

We’ve been researching, working with, and writing about the aging

workforce for decades, and recently we’ve devoted considerable

attention to the growing demand for eldercare support and how it can

be met. In this article, we’ll oﬀer practical guidance to leaders who want

to prepare their organizations for this unprecedented challenge.

# Who Provides Eldercare?

According to the U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, nearly half (45%) of

all elder caregivers are between the ages of 45 and 64, which means

many are at the height of their earning power and organizational

responsibility. They and their employers therefore have a great deal at

stake in avoiding disruptions to their employment.

As with childcare, women who provide eldercare are those most in

need of support. They make up the majority (59%) of providers and

spend more time in their caregiving roles than men do. As a result,

by our estimate, they are responsible for providing at least two-thirds

of eldercare in the United States. Many elder caregivers (21%) have

children under 18, which means they’re sandwiched between the

generations and have a great need for ﬂexible support on the job.

The work that elder caregivers do is varied,

and the mix often changes over time. But

here’s a representative sampling: They

provide emotional and social support,

including companionship, conversation,

and meaningful activities. They provide

household support, including cooking,

# cleaning, shopping, and transportation.

They provide medical care, including

managing medications and appointments,

monitoring health conditions, and

performing basic nursing procedures. They

provide hands-on care, including for such

personal needs as eating, bathing, dressing, toileting, and mobility.

They provide ﬁnancial care, including the management of household

expenses and larger ﬁnancial matters, and even make their own direct

contributions. And they provide the coordination of care, organizing the

activities of other caregivers and overseeing the overall caregiving

# process.

## Whether it’s eldercare, childcare, or both, the demands of caregiving can

be overwhelming. A 2024 survey from AARP and S&P Global found that

half of working caregivers have to make changes to their work schedules

because of caregiving responsibilities. Many also have to make drastic

adjustments, such as taking a leave of absence (32%), reducing hours

or shifting from full-time to part-time (27%), turning down a promotion

(16%), or not working for a period (16%). One in six retirees today cite

family caregiving responsibilities as a key motivation for retiring earlier

Those who don’t take such measures often struggle to meet their

work commitments and maintain work-life balance. The majority

report being distracted at work or being unable to do their best. This

disruption takes a toll on employers in terms of lost productivity

and lower operational performance. Caregiving also takes a toll on

## caregivers’ health: The Employee Beneﬁt Research Institute has found

that working caregivers report lower physical, mental, and ﬁnancial

## well-being than non-caregivers; the U.S. Centers for Disease Control

and Prevention has found that caregivers are more likely to experience

## frequent mental distress and depression; and the Rosalynn Carter

Institute has found that the biggest challenge for caregivers who work

full-time is the emotional stress of handling both job and caregiving

# responsibilities.

All told, according to estimates from the Blue Cross Blue Shield

Association, if you factor in lost employment, higher absenteeism,

and compromised employee health, family caregiving costs the U.S.

# economy $264 billion annually.

# Means of Support

Our recent study surveyed 800 employed adults who serve as elder

caregivers, and 92% said they wished they had more support. Their

needs varied with individual and family circumstances, but some of the

most common elements on their wish lists were:

Driven by the exigencies of the Covid-19 pandemic, in 2020 many

companies began to help employees meet at least some of those

needs, oﬀering them more work-from-home and ﬂexible-scheduling

options and responding to their need to care for family members

recovering from Covid. Those were steps in the right direction, and

there are signs that organizations today are placing a higher priority on

eldercare beneﬁts than in the past. Half of the HR leaders surveyed by

Care.com, for example, reported that their organizations are doing so.

But in practice we have a long way to go: According to the AARP and

S&P Global survey mentioned earlier, only 25% of organizations oﬀer

paid family leave for elder caregiving, and only 19% oﬀer subsidized

Employers should be aware of common disconnects. Companies tend

to underestimate the number of employee caregivers, in part because

employees themselves often see themselves not as caregivers but as

responsible family members. Employees’ responsibilities as caregivers

may accumulate gradually, so they may be slow to voice a need for

support. Employees are also often unaware of the beneﬁts available

to them, and the gap between beneﬁts oﬀered and beneﬁts utilized

can be large. This is particularly true of new beneﬁts. It’s not enough

for employers just to oﬀer eldercare support; they also have to

commit themselves to educating employees and enabling them to take

## advantage of available beneﬁts and services.

# Promising Models

As part of our investigation into the eldercare challenge, we’ve

examined several companies that are leading the way, either by

redesigning their approach to caregiving beneﬁts or by oﬀering new

## beneﬁts speciﬁcally for elder caregivers.

Bank of America, for instance, provides beneﬁts to support employees

across all stages of life, with the goal of enabling productivity, increasing

engagement, and encouraging lengthy careers. The company’s support

for eldercare has been evolving since 2010, and today its eldercare

beneﬁts include information resources and referrals, such as access

## to senior-care specialists who can research care options and issues on

employees’ behalf; care managers who visit caregivers and recipients,

at home or in-facility, to assess their needs; backup eldercare for up

to 50 days a year, with a modest employee co-pay; and legal services

related to eldercare. For caregivers’ emotional wellness, the company

has created an employee assistance program, which oﬀers workers

## and their household members a dozen counseling sessions per issue

(for example, relationships, grief or loss, anxiety, and caregiving) per

year. To help employees ﬁnd information and share experiences, it

hosts a global forum called the Parent and Caregiver Network. “Adult

caregiving requires thoughtful planning and ﬁnesse,” we were told by

## Anne Oxrider, a Bank of America senior vice president and beneﬁts

executive. She listed several key elements of the company’s approach:

“Getting the right support to teammates at the right times in their lives.

access. And helping teammates anticipate their needs, including facets

of caregiving they haven’t considered yet.”

# Karsten Thormaehlen

During the past ﬁve years, the biopharmaceutical company AbbVie has

expanded its health, well-being, and leave beneﬁts to oﬀer holistic

## support to all types of caregivers, both in and outside of work.

According to Demetris Crum, a vice president at the company who

oversees this eﬀort, the logic behind it is simple and unassailable.

“Almost everyone will have caregiving responsibilities at some point

in their professional life,” he says. “When their family’s needs are

met, employees can perform at their best.” AbbVie’s oﬀerings include

support for ﬁnding caregivers and backup care, help navigating elder

healthcare and legal matters, ﬂexible work arrangements, paid and

unpaid leaves, at-work concierge services, and access to mental and

## emotional support for employees and their families. The company

has also created an employee resource group to provide a community

for caregivers and is working to hone its communications to make

caregiving beneﬁts easier to ﬁnd, understand, and use.

The personal impact can be profound. As an AbbVie employee relates,

“I found myself unexpectedly thrust into the role of caregiver. My

services and information resources designed speciﬁcally to support

elder caregivers. These services and programs help caregivers ﬁnd,

plan, and utilize tailored options for care in assisted-living and hospice

facilities or at home, and some are designed speciﬁcally for patients

with dementia or Alzheimer’s. Microsoft has launched a support group

for elder caregivers and encourages eligible employees to apply for

family caregiver leave. It also oﬀers employees in the United States and

members of their extended families access to a program that provides

## conﬁdential expert advice and advocacy for anyone facing important

# medical decisions or healthcare crises.

There’s no one-size-ﬁts-all approach to providing eldercare support. But

as a general rule, companies that hope to institute an eﬀective practices-

## and-beneﬁts program should at least oﬀer these basics:

- education to help employees anticipate and prepare for caregiving

responsibilities, and to learn as they go as their responsibilities

# increase over time

- assessments of recipients’ and caregivers’ situations and support

# needs

- navigation support, through guidance and referrals, across the many

decisions related to care arrangements, care coordination, and

# associated legal matters

- time for caregiving, starting with ﬂexible work schedules, remote work

## options, and time oﬀ or leaves of absence

- ﬁnancial support, typically subsidies for paid care, although some

employees may be eligible to utilize Dependent Care Assistance Plans

or Flexible Spending Accounts for caregiving

- training for managers, supervisors, and HR counselors to help them

understand caregivers’ situations and encourage and enable them to

# make use of services

Companies don’t have to do all of this themselves. They can avail

themselves of third-party providers of eldercare education, assessment,

and navigation, oﬀered by such organizations as Bright Horizons Family

## Solutions, Care.com, Cariloop, Family First, Homethrive, and Wellthy.

To understand how one third-party provider aligns its oﬀerings with

the beneﬁts programs of its employer clients, we looked at Bright

Horizons. Nearly two decades ago, it began to oﬀer eldercare support

as an extension of childcare services, and it now provides that support

# to more than 1,000 employer clients.

## Today Bright Horizons oﬀers three main eldercare services to

## employees of client companies: direct caregiving when employers

oﬀer subsidized beneﬁts; coaching and planning to help caregiver

families navigate the challenges and ongoing coordination of care; and

assessments to connect the right caregiver to the needs of the recipient,

focused on the instrumental activities of daily living and how people

can age in place as long as possible. The company ﬂexibly bundles

its services in ways that enable employers to oﬀer holistic beneﬁts

packages and that allow employees to use the services easily.

# Lessons for Leaders

We’ll close with three lessons for organizations that want to support

employees who have eldercare responsibilities.

Recognize the enormous variety of employee needs. Beneﬁts must be

comprehensive, to cover a full range of possible employee situations.

Beneﬁts must also be adaptable—individual needs should drive

assessment and navigation services. The means of delivery must

be adaptable, too, so that employees can not only get institutional

guidance and support but also learn how to take action on their own.

And beneﬁts must be packaged for ease of understanding and use. The

variety of needs and beneﬁts makes this a challenge, but employees

should be well briefed on available support and able to easily navigate

# the beneﬁts landscape.

Enlist everyone in supporting elder caregivers. Managers should be

equipped to work eﬀectively and empathetically with employees who

are balancing caregiving and their everyday work tasks. Employees

should be encouraged to seek out coworkers with personal experience

they can draw upon. There are also many beneﬁts to forming an

## employee resource group speciﬁcally for eldercare or for family

caregiving and family matters generally. Employees appreciate peer

# experience and support.

Lead by example. If you’ve provided eldercare yourself, consider

sharing your experiences. Join the employee resource group. In

whatever ways you can, publicly support the development of eldercare

beneﬁts and help make clear that at some point, everyone needs a little

# extra support.

. . .

Childcare support has become essential to employee productivity,

retention, engagement, and well-being. The massive demographic shift

that we are now living through makes eldercare support just as essential

to talent strategy and organizational performance. Providing it is the

right thing to do not only for companies but also for employees of

## all ages and responsibilities, especially those in midcareer whose work

contributions are growing as rapidly as their caregiving responsibilities.
