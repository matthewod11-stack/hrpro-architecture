250 trees crowns the building, providing employees with a natural

escape from the oﬃces and urban environment below. On the other

side of the Atlantic, retailer L.L. Bean cut out the middle of one of their

warehouses and turned the space into a courtyard, so that everyone at

their new home oﬃce would have views of nature while working. These

real-world examples of incorporating nature into commercial spaces

are part of a growing trend to design places where employees can be

immersed in nature during their workdays.

Increasing nature in the work environment certainly aligns with many

companies’ sustainability initiatives. However, the motive also stems from nature’s eﬀect on humans — it is well established that nature

makes us feel better. Our emotions, our thinking, our connection to

others, and our physical well-being are all enhanced by being in and

# around nature.

Despite the connection between contact with nature and our well-being,

large investments in bringing nature into the workplace raise some

thorny issues. First, in a time of economic headwinds and cost-cutting,

is there a business case for incorporating nature into employees’

surroundings? Second, what about those workplaces where it is not

feasible or sensible to incorporate a green spine or a rooftop garden?

Answering these questions requires ﬁrst understanding whether nature has eﬀects on metrics that matter to organizations’ bottom lines (e.g.,

## employee satisfaction and performance) and if so whether less-extreme

doses of nature are meaningful enough to elicit these gains. Thus, we set out to test the eﬀects (if any) of what we call micro-nature — small, aﬀordable, seemingly innocuous ways of incorporating nature into the

workplace — on how employees feel at work, and how they perform.

# The Research

We measured or manipulated contact with nature at work in diﬀerent

ways across multiple studies, with workers in the U.S., Canada, China,

New Zealand, and Indonesia. In experiments, working adults were simply shown images of workplaces suﬀused with natural elements

or matching images without nature. We then asked them to imagine

they worked in these spaces and report how it would make them feel

and perform. We also conducted more complex studies in real-world

work settings. For instance, we assessed employees’ actual contact

with nature during a week at work (e.g., working near plants, natural

views, or the sound of running water), and then measured their feelings

and objective job performance. Finally, in a ﬁeld experiment in an

accounting ﬁrm, we went into the oﬃces at night and placed potted

plants at some employees’ desks and similar pots, only ﬁlled with

oﬃce supplies, at other desks. We then measured the attitudes and job

performance of the two groups and compared them.

The results were largely consistent across these studies: Experiencing

even small doses of nature at work improved the way employees felt

in ways that fueled higher task performance, increased helping, and

enhanced creativity. These ﬁndings indicate that incorporating micro-

nature into work settings can contribute to worker well-being and

# performance in a meaningful way.

We also looked into whether there were diﬀerences between employees that shaped how nature aﬀected them at work — factors such as how

## much individuals appreciate nature in general, and the extent to which

they are drawn to novel experiences. Our ﬁndings showed that some

people are especially prone to experiencing the beneﬁts of nature.

However, we found no evidence that any employees were negatively

impacted by nature exposure at work; thus, micro-nature seems to hold

## considerable promise for employees with little downsides.

Bearing these ﬁndings in mind, we believe that nature should be

## accessible to as many employees as possible, not just those lucky

enough to work below a green roof or alongside a park. Companies

should provide employees with micro-nature experiences. Below, we oﬀer suggestions for incorporating micro-nature into the workplace,

while also encouraging managers to take liberties and get creative in

# their speciﬁc organization.

Capitalizing on Micro-Nature

Real is best, but artiﬁcial works too. Giving employees opportunities

to access “the real thing” is ideal when it comes to nature: indoor water

features, windows with views of nature or that open to let in natural

sounds like birdsong. But just because it’s not the real thing does not

mean that employees will not beneﬁt from nature. Research shows that

even depictions of nature, such as murals and artiﬁcial ﬂowers, can give

# employees a natural boost.

Think beyond the ofﬁce… It goes without saying that it is not just

oﬃce workers who beneﬁt from nature. Employees in settings where

the work environment feels especially removed from nature — think

warehousing or manufacturing — are especially likely to notice a dash

of the outdoors brought inside and be positively impacted by it because of how diﬀerent it is from their status quo.

…and beyond the workplace. The beneﬁts of nature extend beyond

employees’ work lives. Some of our research looked at the work-related

## beneﬁts of spending time outdoors in the evening, after the workday.

We found that employees were more productive the next day when they

spent time outdoors the prior evening. Especially for hybrid and remote

workers, the implications are clear: The beneﬁts of being around nature

at home carry over into work. So even incentivizing employees to take

an evening walk can help them be more productive the next day.

Utilize unused or underused spaces. By deﬁnition, micro-nature is

small, and can be as simple as painting a wall with natural tones, adding

ﬂowers to the break room, or landscaping the area outside employees’

windows. We encourage managers to keep an eye out for the unused or

underused spaces around their workplace that can be easily and cheaply

turned into natural features. For instance, adding more landscaping to

an overly industrial parking lot may boost employees’ morale.

. . .

Overall, our ﬁndings indicate that the beneﬁts of connecting employees

to nature at work extend beyond sustainability, and include positive eﬀects on employees’ well-being and how they perform their jobs. As

such, we view contact with nature as a valuable supplement to well-

designed jobs that already include meaningful work, fair compensation,

and respectful treatment. For ﬁrms that provide these things and are

looking for more ways to enhance the environment in which their employees work, micro-nature oﬀers considerable promise.
