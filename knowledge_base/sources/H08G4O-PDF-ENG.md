## With his recent essay on “Founder Mode,” Paul Graham, the co-founder

of Y Combinator, has ignited a conversation on the diﬀerences between

founder-led companies and those led by professional managers.

“In eﬀect there are two diﬀerent ways to run a company: founder mode

and manager mode,” Graham wrote. “Till now most people even in

Silicon Valley have implicitly assumed that scaling a startup meant

switching to manager mode. But we can infer the existence of another

mode from the dismay of founders who’ve tried it, and the success of

their attempts to escape from it.” He continued:

There are as far as I know no books speciﬁcally about founder mode.

Business schools don’t know it exists. All we have so far are the

experiments of individual founders who’ve been ﬁguring it out for

themselves. But now that we know what we’re looking for, we can

search for it. I hope in a few years founder mode will be as well

understood as manager mode. We can already guess at some of the

ways it will differ.

It’s clear that founders are not your typical executives. They’re the

alchemists of the business world who turn a spark of an idea into a

living, breathing business. But the same entrepreneurial instinct that

breeds success can make them less straightforward partners, especially

when professional investors enter the picture to scale the business to

# the next level.

The desire to understand what makes founders tick — and how to

harness their special sauce to outperform — is one we’ve heard over

## and over from investors and board members in recent years.

To deepen our own insights and advise clients, we embarked on a

comprehensive study of what we call the “founder DNA.” We analyzed

## more than 1,400 data points from deep assessments of 50 successful

founder CEOs and 58 non-founder CEOs in private equity–backed

companies. We also conducted qualitative interviews with dozens of

## founders, investors, CEO successors, and portfolio talent leaders.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Strengths and Weaknesses that Set Founders Apart

Our research revealed that while no founder CEO is the same, they

do exhibit distinctive characteristics as a collective. Founder CEOs are

“spikier” than their professional counterparts. Their strengths are more

pronounced, but so are their weaknesses. For example, founders often

possess extraordinary creativity, vision, and persistence. These traits are

not just slightly better than average — they can be exceptional.

On the ﬂip side, their weaknesses are often just as extreme. For instance,

their hiring mistakes might be more than just occasional missteps,

veering into systemic issues that permeate the organization.

# A Founder’s Psychological Blueprint

Our analysis revealed three key areas where successful founders diverge

# from typical executives:

- 1. Cognitive Patterns: Founders think in more divergent, non-linear

ways. This fuels their creativity but can also lead to challenges in

# systematic planning.

- 2. Motivational Drivers: Founders’ sense of purpose and persistence

are deeply ingrained (often stemming from childhood), driving them

to push boundaries that others consider impossible.

- 3. Relational Styles: Founders tend to remain closely connected with

their trusted inner circles, showing more skepticism toward outsiders,

which can inspire ﬁerce loyalty while simultaneously leading to diﬃculties in professional detachment.

Founder CEOs and non-founder CEOs also showed diﬀerences in skill

development. The performance of founder CEOs is often tied to innate

traits — deep-seated characteristics, such as resilience and self-reliance,

that are hard to teach or change — or what we might call their

“psychological DNA.” Non-founder CEOs’ success often comes from

learned behaviors, acquired skills, and patterns recognized over their

# career.

# Founder CEO Superpowers

## The passion, creativity, and deep expertise at the core of a founder’s

## spark drive innovation in ways that professional managers often cannot

replicate. While no two founders are the same, our research identiﬁed

## ﬁve statistically signiﬁcant strengths that distinguish founder CEOs

# from their non-founder counterparts.

- 1. They are often creative, innovative thinkers who can articulate a compelling vision. This quality, found among 36% of founder CEOs in our dataset, is

perhaps the most powerful. Founders stand out as particularly strong

innovators, seeing possibilities where others see roadblocks. “There’s a

diﬀerence between an artist and a critic…the founder is the artist who

knows how to build from scratch,” explained Peter Bauer, co-founder

and former CEO of Mimecast. “They’re not just thinking outside the

box; they’re creating entirely new boxes.”

In contrast, our research found that a quarter of non-founder CEOs

faced challenges originating new ideas, relying more on execution and

# past experiences.

- 2. Most founders embody the company’s culture, fostering a deep sense of duty and followership. The founder’s vision beats at the heart of any successful founder-led

company. Eighty-six percent of founders we studied possessed an

ability to inspire through passion, charisma, and loyalty. They can

coalesce a diverse group of individuals behind a shared goal, or as

Daniel Brenhouse, partner at Permira, articulated, “Founders can carry

the entire organization on their shoulders in a unique way.”

Conversely, more than two-thirds of non-founder CEOs struggled to

gain broader followership, often due to overextending their teams,

pushing too hard too fast.

- 3. Many lead with “customer obsession.”

Three-quarters of the founder CEOs studied demonstrated a strong

aptitude for understanding and building products around their

customers, especially given their deep domain and industry expertise.

One investor noted, “Founder CEOs have an innate ability to ﬁnd

product-market ﬁt, even in uncharted territories. They have a strong

sense of the product and know what the customer wants.”

In contrast, 90% of non-founder CEOs relied on a generalist GM

playbook. Deep specialization appeared as a gap for more than a third of

# them.

- 4. They live and breathe the business, bringing drive and resilience.

Seventy-six percent of founder CEOs in our dataset exhibited a level

of drive and resilience that goes beyond simply working hard. One

board member shared, “The beneﬁt of founders is that they are

entrepreneurial — they care deeply. They act like owners and work

super hard. That’s what they’ve had to do to succeed.”

For non-founder CEOs, their hard-charging desire to deliver, a strength

shared among 60% of those in the dataset, stemmed from a history

of consistently demonstrating credibility through action-oriented

# execution.

- 5. They show raw horsepower and agility, learning through trial and error. More than half of the founder CEOs in our dataset showcased an

exceptional ability to pivot their companies and products as the context

shifted, constantly adapting by problem-solving or innovating concepts,

technologies, and practices. This ability to pivot the company and

product is hard to teach and often propels its growth engine.

Non-founder CEOs, on the other hand, demonstrated less adaptability

amidst ambiguity, with 47% overly relying on past playbooks.

# Founder CEO Blind Spots

Founders aren’t just running a company — they’re emotionally invested

in every decision, every product, and every person. This passion is

## both their greatest asset and a potential Achilles’ heel, especially

when confronted with a new set of expectations from board members

or investors. Our research also found ﬁve statistically signiﬁcant

## weaknesses that distinguish founder CEOs.

- 1. Many seek high levels of autonomy and control, showing sensitivity to criticism and ﬁnding it hard to delegate. Given that founder CEOs often view the business as an extension of

themselves, it can be challenging to release the reins. Many founders

in our dataset struggled to delegate, with 58% ﬁnding it challenging

to release control. This attachment can manifest as volatility under

pressure, creating tension with investors and board members who

expect a more measured approach.

“Founders are used to being in control and doing everything

themselves…they’ve known the business since the beginning and have

played many roles and worn multiple hats. That’s not scalable,” one

investor shared. “[Non-founder] CEOs have much more emotional

distance from the business. It’s hard for the founder to take a step back

and trust others will apply the same level of care.”

- 2. Some founders underinvest in operational governance to scale.

Founders prefer to chase new ideas rather than optimize existing ones,

which means the very scrappiness that gets a startup oﬀ the ground can

hinder its growth. Systems and processes may come less naturally (and

be less enjoyable) to founder CEOs.

In contrast, 60% of non-founder CEOs excelled at operational

excellence, instilling metrics-driven cultures. Jeﬀ Hastings, founder

and CEO-turned-CTO of BrightSign, admitted: “I’ve taken many

companies to around $100 million in revenue. After doing startups for

a while, I know that at this threshold, I am not as eﬀective…on ﬁguring

out where the company should go next. We needed a new CEO who

could scale the business.”

- 3. Many delay upgrading talent and removing underperformers.

Loyalty can be a liability. We found that more than half of the founder

CEOs in our study hesitated when dealing with underperformers, often

holding onto early employees longer than they should have.

“These are the people who got you from nothing to where you are,”

Hastings acknowledged. “You spend so much time with them —

more time than you do with your spouse. They are very personal

relationships. Whenever I’ve let someone go, I’ve never later wished I’d

kept them. I always ask myself, ‘Why didn’t I do this sooner?’”

- 4. They can be inconsistent in communicating with and aligning key stakeholders. More than half of the founders we analyzed were weaker at engaging

## investors and boards; by comparison more than a third of non-founders

excelled in this area. “Some founders only tell you about their week and

forget about the long-term plan,” one board member shared. “Others

only talk about the long-term things and give you tactical progress

# updates.”

- 5. They are overly optimistic and may underestimate risk based on prior success. The optimism that fuels a founder’s vision can blind them to potential

pitfalls. Forty-two percent of founders in our study displayed an

overly optimistic outlook, potentially underestimating risks based on

past successes. On the other hand, 62% of non-founder CEOs studied

brought a more pragmatic, risk-conscious approach to planning and

# execution.

One investor shared, “By deﬁnition, founder CEOs have built something

from nothing and have been successful at it. This can create positive

bias. As a result, they frequently overestimate what is feasible. Other

CEOs may not think big enough; they see budgets as way too aggressive,

while the founder CEO will say, ‘We can do much more than that.’”

# Bridging Founder and Manager Modes

The key to unlocking a company’s full potential lies not in replacing

“founder mode” with “manager mode” but in creating synergies

between the two. This hybrid approach combines the founder’s special

## sauce with the operational rigor of professional management.

In the end, the founder’s “spikiness” is likely to be core to a startup’s

success. By understanding and embracing the founder’s unique traits

and challenges, everyone in the ecosystem — investors, board members,

team members, and even the founders themselves — can create

## an environment where visionary thinking and operational excellence

# coexist.
