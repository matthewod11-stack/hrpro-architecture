Established companies know they must innovate to ﬁnd growth in the

digital era. So, in recent years, large companies have set up innovation

labs, accelerators, hackathons, and open innovation programs to look

beyond their core, pursue disruptive ideas, iterate, and experiment.

Yet, most of these eﬀorts produce little in the way of results. Corporate

teams are outrun by startups. Innovation labs are shut down after failing

to deliver growth at a scale that matters to the business.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Missing Link Between Strategy and Innovation

Why does this keep happening? And what can be done? In 20 years

of researching digital strategy and advising dozens of Fortune 500

companies, I’ve repeatedly seen that the root cause of this failure is the

missing link between strategy and innovation.

Corporate innovation cannot begin with blue-sky thinking and proceed

with the independence of a startup. Instead, companies must learn

to link every innovation eﬀort to two pillars of strategy: a clear

## set of growth priorities, and an understanding of the ﬁrm’s unique

# advantages.

By linking innovation to strategy at every step along the way, from

greenlighting to scaling up, established businesses can leverage their

strengths to deliver innovation that drives bottom-line growth.

# Define Your Strategic Priorities

The ﬁrst strategy question that must be central to any corporate

innovation eﬀort is: What are the strategic priorities that matter most

to our business? In my book, The Digital Transformation Roadmap,

I suggest two lenses for deﬁning strategic priorities: problems and

# opportunities.

The problem lens draws from the common wisdom of Silicon Valley

entrepreneurs to “fall in love with the problem” you are seeking to

solve, and not the solution you expect will solve it. This could be a problem to solve for the customer (e.g., diﬃculty in placing an order or

in personalizing a product). Or it could be a problem to solve for the business (e.g., high customer attrition, diﬃculty forecasting demand, or

inaccuracy in packing orders).

One company I’ve seen take this approach is Walmart. I’ve interviewed

## senior executives over several years about their strategy, innovation

process, and transformation of the business. The company has decided

that a key customer problem to solve is online ordering of groceries — a

category that is important to Walmart’s business, and where the existing

customer experience has left much to be desired.

The opportunity lens is another way to deﬁne a strategic growth

priority. This could be an opportunity for the business to expand

into a new market or sector (such as Amazon’s decision to explore

cloud computing, which ultimately led to the launch of Amazon Web

Services). Or it could be an opportunity to delight the customer with an

# unexpected beneﬁt or reward.

Walmart, for example, deﬁned an opportunity to let customers shop by

texting a virtual assistant (who would help research products, propose

options, and then place the order for the best product). The goal was to

delight the customer and shift their habits away from Amazon Prime.

Any problem or opportunity, if suﬃciently important to your business,

may be deﬁned as a strategic priority for growth. The point is to pick

## the problems and opportunities that matter most to your particular

# business and to your customers.

# Define Your Unique Advantages

The second strategy question that should be central to any corporate

innovation eﬀort is: What unique advantages does our business hold

over competitors? These could be physical assets, data, network

## eﬀects, intellectual property, brand reputation, or other strengths that

distinguish your business, add value to your products, and give you a

competitive edge. Disney, for example, has a unique advantage from

its iconic stories and characters, which it exploits in various business

models — from ﬁlm to streaming, theme parks, and merchandise.

Leveraging preexisting strengths will help you build competitive moats

around new ventures and give you a “right to win” against others who

bring similar innovations to the market. To truly matter, each advantage

must be both distinctive (objectively superior to most peer companies)

and strategic (providing a clear beneﬁt when competing with others).

One of Walmart’s unique advantages is the proximity of its retail stores

to end consumers: 90% of the U.S. population lives within 10 miles

of a Walmart. The company is exploring digital business models that

## leverage this physical footprint — from mini fulﬁllment centers that

support its ecommerce division, to a digital advertising network linked

# to in-store displays.

Knowing your unique advantages is especially critical when an

established business looks to innovate beyond its core. How did Alibaba,

as an online retail business, decide to move into digital payments? As

a senior executive at their ﬁnance division explained to me, it started

with a customer problem to solve: Its own customers needed ways to pay

each other on its marketplace. But Alibaba also had a unique ability to

solve this problem thanks to its large existing customer base and its rich

# user data.

## Embedding Strategy into the Innovation Process

The key to linking strategy and innovation is to embed these two

## strategic principles into every step of your corporate innovation eﬀorts.

That includes innovation labs, accelerators, and hackathons, as well as

innovation projects within the core business itself. Making this linkage

work requires rethinking corporate innovation across ﬁve steps:

- 1. Set strategy at different levels.

The ﬁrst step is to assemble a multi-functional team at the C-suite level,

with representatives from various departments. They should carefully

assess the unique advantages of your business. Then, they should deﬁne

a set of strategic priorities for the next one to three years, based on

## the ﬁrm’s advantages, its competitive landscape, and deep insights into

# customer needs.

Once strategy is set at the enterprise level, the leadership of each

## business unit and each function (marketing, supply chain, etc.) should

## translate this into a strategy for their own level of the business.

Strategy should be regularly revisited (I suggest a brief quarterly review,

and deeper annual review) to update priorities or adjust to changes in

# competitive advantage.

- 2. Share your strategy with all employees.

The next step is to share this strategy with employees throughout the

## organization — both those in dedicated innovation roles and those

pursuing innovation within the regular work of their function or line

## of business. Virtual forums, strategy workshops, and every means

of communication should be used to ensure everyone knows what

problems the business is looking to solve and what unique advantages it

is hoping to leverage.

- 3. Greenlight projects based on strategic ﬁt.

Whenever an innovation idea is proposed — whether in a startup

accelerator or a regional marketing team — it must include a clear

problem statement: “What problem are we solving, and for whom?”

Each proposed innovation should then be evaluated for strategic ﬁt.

It’s not enough that your lab proposes “a great idea” for a “disruptive”

innovation where “we see a huge TAM (total addressable market).”

Instead, every proposed new venture must answer two questions: Does

it relate to a strategic priority? And would it potentially leverage one

of our unique advantages? Only innovations that match your strategy

agenda should be greenlit — i.e., given an initial round of funding or

added to a backlog of ventures to try next.

- 4. Rapidly validate through experimentation.

For greenlit ideas, your next step is to deﬁne the key business model

hypotheses and conduct quick, low-cost experiments to validate them.

Who is the optimal customer? How do they experience the problem you

are solving for? Does your solution drive adoption? Can you deliver it at

scale? Do you have any competitive advantage? Can you capture value

and turn a proﬁt?

When Walmart began to focus on online groceries, it launched pilots

for a variety of diﬀerent approaches to the same problem. It learned

that some delivery models scaled better than others. It also found that

customers preferred an annual fee to a charge per delivery, and that

price was critical to customer adoption.

- 5. Scale up the few that work and quickly shutter the majority that don’t. Funding of new innovations must be iterative as well. Every team whose

idea is approved should be required to return in 90 days with market

# data and a request for more funding.

Walmart’s innovation that let customers shop by text, dubbed

“Jet black,” showed early product-market ﬁt. Customers loved the

experience and started to switch from ordering on Amazon. But with

further testing, Walmart found no path to deliver a scalable, proﬁtable

oﬀering. The innovation was shut down and learning shared within the

# organization.

In Walmart’s grocery eﬀorts, many pilots were shut down as well. But a

few proved highly successful in the marketplace, eventually launching

## as a subscription service (Walmart+) and a buy-online-pickup-at-store

oﬀering (Pickup Today). Walmart continues to experiment with new

approaches to reinvent the online grocery experience (such as Walmart

InHome) to match evolving customer needs.

# Innovation that Delivers Results

There are no crystal balls in innovation. Just like a VC ﬁrm investing in

startups, you won’t know in advance which new ventures will work. This

is why innovation depends on portfolio investing, experimentation,

and iterative funding. But for corporate innovation, one more thing is

essential: Every venture must start from an idea that ﬁts the strengths

# and strategy of the corporate parent.

In too many companies, we see an innovation team allowed to pursue

its own agenda and imagine itself to be a separate island from the rest

of the company. The results are always disappointing: a lot of creative

ideas, but a failure to deliver meaningful growth. The root problem is

## the disconnect between strategy and innovation.

To succeed, corporate innovation needs to be bounded by a clear set

of strategic priorities that matter to the business. And it needs to play

## to the strengths of the ﬁrm — whether data, customer relationships, or

supply chains — that will enable it to outcompete others attempting the

# same idea.

The ﬁve-step approach we have seen can be used by any business

to link its strategy process to its innovation process — from

greenlighting to innovation metrics and resource allocation. By doing

so, every established business can leverage its own strengths to deliver

# meaningful growth at scale.
