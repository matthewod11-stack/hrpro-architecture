In December 2000, when Dr. Tadataka Yamada became the new

chairman of research and development at Glaxo SmithKline, he was

horriﬁed to learn that his company was a complainant in a lawsuit

over access to drug therapies for HIV/AIDS patients. GSK was one

of 39 pharmaceutical companies charging Nelson Mandela and the

government of South Africa with violating price protections and

intellectual property rights in their eﬀorts to access lower priced

antiretroviral drugs. Close to 25 percent of black South Africans were

living with HIV/AIDS and at the time, antiretroviral therapies cost

## approximately $1000 per month—more than a third of the average

South African’s annual salary, putting treatment out of reach for most

# patients.

Yamada held discussions with his research staﬀ and quickly learned

that he was not alone in his opposition to the lawsuit. The team wanted

to be a part of the solution to global health issues, not party to a lawsuit

preventing such drugs from reaching those in dire need, but they felt

they lacked the power to change the company’s direction. Yamada felt

## diﬀerently. In one-on-one meetings with individual board members of

GSK, he stressed the company’s moral responsibility to alleviate human

suﬀering and tied it to the long-term success of the company. He stated

that GSK can’t make medicines that save lives and then not allow people

access to them. He noted the public relations disaster associated with

the lawsuit, and set forth a vision, co-created by his team, for how GSK

could also become a leader in the ﬁght against TB and malaria, diseases

that also were disproportionately impacting third-world populations.

The external pressure did not abate, with protests against many drug

# companies around the world.

In April, 2001, all 39 companies dropped the lawsuit against Nelson

Mandela; GSK and others reduced the prices of antiretroviral drugs by

90% or more. Furthermore, under Yamada’s direction, one of GSK’s

major laboratories in Tres Cantos, Spain, was converted into a proﬁt-

exempt laboratory that focused only on diseases in the developing

world, including malaria and tuberculosis. Using his inﬂuence, Dr.

Yamada also spurred GSK into allocating resources for aﬀordable access

## to medications and development of future therapies. Subsequently top

executives at GSK became leaders in global health issues. Andrew Witty

assumed the CEO position at GlaxoSmithKline in 2008 and became one

## of the leading spokespersons for global health in the pharmaceutical

industry. Chris Viehbacher, corporate executive team member at GSK,

subsequently became the CEO of Sanoﬁ, and a champion of global

health. Both have since partnered with the Gates Foundation on global

# health initiatives.

Most people would love to be a part of such an amazing turn of events,

yet this kind of transformation doesn’t happen very often. While many

helped with these eﬀorts, what made it possible for Dr. Yamada to step

forward with a steady voice and a sound vision? In several interviews

with Dr. Yamada we identiﬁed four key mindsets that helped him

# catalyze this transformation.

# The power of one.

A single person with a clarity of conscience and a willingness to speak

up can make a diﬀerence. Contributing to the greater good is a deep

and fundamental human need. When a leader, even a mid-level or

lower level leader, skillfully brings a voice and a vision, others will

follow and surprising things can happen—even culture change on a

large scale. While Yamada did not set out to change a culture, his

actions were catalytic and galvanized the organization. As news of the

new “not for proﬁt” focus of Tres Cantos spread, many of GSK’s top

scientists volunteered to work there. Yamada’s voice spoke for many

others, oﬀering a clear path and a vision for a more positive future for

# all.

# The power of sequential skill building.

Prior to GSK, Yamada had a lot of practice with smaller challenges,

from caring for the most complex patients in the intensive care unit, to

becoming a department head and national leader in his ﬁeld. Along the

way he also led other eﬀorts to change the status quo by actively helping

more African Americans and women to join the gastroenterology faculty

at the University of Michigan. The lesson is not to underestimate any

chance you have, even if small, to hone your skills of challenging the

status quo for the greater good. Train your “courage for challenging

convention” muscle consistently, so that it’s ready when needed. At

GSK, he ﬁrst invited the input of his team, ultimately resulting in the

plan to convert the Tres Cantos laboratory to a “not for proﬁt” disease

focus. He did not wait for someone else to speak out ﬁrst, or for a

committee to be formed to study the issue. He had built the skills to

quickly recognize the problem, and also to advocate for a better way—a

way GSK could become a leader in the ﬁght against diseases that might

not be proﬁtable but would help countless individuals in dire need.

## The power of sustained focus and determination.

It’s easy to say, “This will take some doing; I’ll think about it later.”

Combined with an unconscious “This could be dangerous for my

career,” it can be easy for tough challenges to gradually slip from focus.

Over time the unacceptable can become the norm, and the energy

for change dissipates. But Yamada didn’t accept the unacceptable; his

focus and determination were well honed. He emigrated from Japan

as a teenager and entered the demanding ﬁeld of medicine. Along

the way he took up marathon running and edited a seminal 3440-

## page textbook of Gastroenterology, among many other achievements.

Attacking challenges was not just an occasional adventure—it’s been a

way of being, as well as a highly successful career path. Assuring success

of the Tres Cantos lab was not accomplished with a simple signature

on a document. The laboratory was initially funded by GSK with the

expectation that the researchers would soon obtain external grants so

the output from the lab would not have expectations of making a proﬁt

for GSK. Partnerships with many organizations and universities were

also initiated and sustained to help support this work.

The power of using privilege to support people with less privilege.

While such a mindset is not required for transformation to occur,

most would agree that it’s even better, and more rewarding, when

transformation also helps those with less privilege. Dr. Yamada, trained

over many years in the “patient ﬁrst” culture of medicine, had a well-

honed awareness of the larger change he could bring because of his

voice, and a vision for the positive impact GSK could bring to South

## Africa—and other countries in dire need of low cost, life-saving drugs

to treat HIV, TB, and malaria. His team, and ultimately many others

at GSK, shared a desire to help those less fortunate. The work done by

the Tres Cantos lab continues to impact countless people in poverty

suﬀering from TB, malaria, and many other diseases.

Speaking of the lawsuit that sparked his transformational leadership,

Yamada said: “It was obvious we could reduce the price, but beyond that

I felt it was really important for the company to make a commitment

to making medicines for people where we might not make proﬁt, but

where we could have huge medical impact.”

With the support and eﬀorts of many at GSK, this positive vision and

pathway for action reverberated across the organization and helped

energize a culture shift. The changes catalyzed by Yamada continued

after he left GSK in 2006 to become President of the Global Health

Program at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. Today GSK is one

## of the top pharmaceutical companies for global drug access and global

health initiatives. In just the past 3 years Tres Cantos researchers have

## co-authored over 100 scholarly research publications. The laboratory

continues to provide independent researchers access to GSK facilities,

expertise and resources to advance the understanding of diseases of the

developing world.

Yamada was one of dozens of executives we spoke to over the last

several years to learn how one can succeed in making positive change in

large organizations. In these interviews, we heard accounts that reﬂect

the mindsets Yamada described. In nearly every case we saw the power

of one. In one example, a woman in a Fortune 50 company shared her

experience in transforming her unit in Brazil. After being promoted to

a senior position at headquarters, she saw the need for change, but

the politics were more intense, and her previous experience seemed

irrelevant. With unwavering focus, she pressed forward and succeeded.

In reﬂecting on her success, she noted that challenging the status quo

is a skill that one can develop, and it applies at every level. In another

case, a woman in a Fortune 500 company was promoted to oversee a

large but failing business line. The eight people who preceded her were

all ﬁred. She spent months examining the organization and formulated

a strategic plan. It required serious work at the top. Her boss said no.

Using all her acquired skills and courage, she led her boss until he was

ready to change. The organization turned around.

These stories remind us that while corporate transformations are

almost universally assumed to be top-down processes, in reality, middle

managers, and ﬁrst-line supervisors can make signiﬁcant change when

they have the right mindset.
