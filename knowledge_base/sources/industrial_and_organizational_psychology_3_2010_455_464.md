JEREL E. SLAUGHTER UniversityofArizona Abstract We are gratiﬁed by the large number of commentaries to our focal article (Dalal, Bonaccio, et al., 2010) that advocated greater integration of industrial–organizational psychology and organizational behavior (IOOB) with the ﬁeld of judgment and decision making (JDM). The commentaries were uniformly constructive and civil. Our disagreements with the commentaries are mild and are limited primarily to the roles of external validity, internal validity, and laboratory experiments in IOOB. For the majority of our response, we attempt to build on the views expressed in the commentaries and to articulate some thoughts regarding the future. We structure our response according to the following themes: barriers to cross-fertilization between IOOB and JDM, areas of existing and potential JDM-to-IOOB cross-fertilization, areas of potential IOOB-to-JDM cross-fertilization, and ways to increase (and ideally institutionalize) cross-fertilization. We hope our focal article and our response to the commentaries will help to ignite exciting basic research and important practical applications associated with decision making in the workplace.

When we began working on our focal article (Dalal, Bonaccio, et al., 2010), one of our primary goals was to engage the industrial–organizational psychology and organizational behavior (IOOB) community in an open and frank discussion of how our ﬁeld and the ﬁeld of judgment and decision making (JDM) could enrich each other. We hoped that our IOOB colleagues wouldagree that this wasadiscussionworth having. If the large number of published commentaries (let alone the considerably larger number of submitted commentaries)

is any indicator, the IOOB community did agree. We are gratiﬁed by the interest and grateful to the commentators.

A few of the commentaries disagreed to some degree with us regarding (a) whether there had already been a great extent of cross-fertilization and (b) whether cross- fertilization is beneﬁcial to the two ﬁelds. Hayes and Wooldridge (2010) argue that there has already been substantial overlap between these two areas. We agree—and are obviously pleased—that there have been some instances of extant cross- fertilization (indeed, we mentioned some in our focal article). However, from our perspective (see also the metrics we presented in our focal article, such as the representation in each other’s journals and conferences), those instances are too few and far between.

Whyte (2010) appears to be slightly more optimistic than us regarding the amount of cross-fertilization that has already taken the glass place. Regardless of whether is viewed as half (Whyte, 2010) or full nearly empty (us), there does not appear to be much substantive difference between Whyte’s views and our own. In the case of goal setting, there has IOOB research and some been a lot of JDM research. However, as Whyte indi- IOOB researchers have typically cates, taken little notice of the JDM research on goal setting—and, on the rare occa- sions that they have (e.g., Locke & Latham, 2009), the reaction has been less than positive. Whyte notes that his view ‘‘is not inconsistent with the view that there in leverag- remains untapped potential ing JDM to elucidate phenomena that have traditionally captured the attention of IOOB researchers and practitioners.’’ Quite so.

for example,

Connolly (2010) notes, as we did in our focal article, that recent exhortations for IOOB–JDM integration appear to have had limited success. However, Connolly then goes on to imply that such exhortations, per se, may be of limited utility (a sentiment echoed by Staw, 2010). Here, in contrast, we ﬁnd ourselves in the ‘‘glass half full’’

# S.Bonaccioetal.

camp: We agree with Connolly that the obstacles to cross-fertilization (discussed subsequently) are formidable, but we also believe that the beneﬁts of cross-fertilization to make it worth our while to attempt surmount these obstacles.

Finally, Staw (2010) argues against a full integration of IOOB and JDM because ‘‘JDM research often misses (or willfully avoids) many of the most crucial elements of work behavior.’’ As discussed further in a subsequent section, we do not disagree with the need for generalizability. In addition, Staw does appear to be in favor of a moderate amount of cross- fertilization. Given the current low level of cross-fertilization, we do not believe that his position is implacably opposed to ours.

On the other hand, many commenta- tors share our hopefulness that this ongo- ing exchange will be fruitful. To take just two examples, Reb (2010) maintains that ‘‘bridging the two [ﬁelds] is intellectually rewarding’’ and that the early difﬁculties incurred in research at the intersection of these two ﬁelds will fade away in time, whereas Rosen, Shufﬂer, and Salas (2010) are kind enough to say that our focal arti- cle ‘‘identiﬁed a potentially monumental opportunity’’ for interdisciplinary discus- sion and collaboration.

We found both the disagreements and the agreements helpful in further clarifying our thinking regarding the beneﬁts of, obsta- cles to, and ways of achieving integration between IOOB and JDM. In the rest of this article, we group the commentaries and our responses (including our thoughts about the future) according to some of the themes we had identiﬁed in our focal article (see Table 1 in focal article).

# Barriers to Integration

## BarriersAttributabletoDifferences inPhilosophicalTradition

In our focal article, we argued that JDM typically follows a normative, paradigmatic approach involving formal models; in con- trast, IOOB typically focuses on outcomes

# Takingworkplacedecisionsseriously

and selects models based on what appears most useful in each case. The former approach facilitates the accumulation of knowledge (e.g., Pfeffer, 1993), whereas the latter facilitates the examination of a broader set of problems. We also main- tained that, the two philo- sophical approaches should be viewed as complementary rather than immiscible.

in our view,

The commentaries advance this dis- cussion on two fronts. First, Hayes and Wooldridge (2010) observe that the dis- organized state of the JDM literature is a major challenge to integrating its ﬁndings into IOOB. Indeed, they liken the state of JDM to the pre-Big Five state of the per- sonality literature. A related issue is that, as Sumner, Bragger, Om, and Malandruccolo (2010) note, the JDM literature is spread across many academic disciplines, which hampers summarization. We would like to see decision-making researchers make more of an effort to integrate that ﬁeld via broad-level reviews, perhaps structured around fundamental questions (e.g., what constitutes a good decision?). Nonetheless, as we discussed in our focal article, JDM researchers have already identiﬁed several useful mid-level normative (and descrip- tive) models—and we argued that IOOB would beneﬁt from a greater focus on nor- mative models. Second, commentators note that more attention needs to be paid by JDM researchers to individual differences as ‘‘valid variance rather than error vari- ance’’ (Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010; see also Goodwin, 2010). We agree completely (as we noted in our focal article), and we point readers to a recent paper on this topic by one of us (Mohammed & Schwall, 2009). However, as Weiss and Adler (1984) have noted, the laboratory may well constitute a ‘‘strong’’ situation in which the impact of individual differences is muted (see also Meyer, Dalal, & Hermida, 2010). Thus, the study of individual differences in decision making may be more proﬁtable in ﬁeld sit- uations or indeed in laboratory situations deliberately designed to be ‘‘weaker’’ than usual.

## BarriersAttributabletoDifferencesin MethodologicalTradition

In our focal article, we had discussed several methodological barriers to integra- tion between IOOB and JDM. We had argued that the ﬁelds’ two methodological approaches should be viewed as comple- mentary and that IOOB should be much more open to laboratory research. The com- mentators responded to our contentions, focusing primarily on external validity and attendant issues.

The various comments can be summa- rized by Rosen et al.’s (2010) observation that JDM researchers sometimes ‘‘control the reality out of the research’’ and Staw’s ‘‘[a]lthough JDM (2010) contention that tries to control away the context, organi- zational researchers savor it.’’ The chief concerns focus on the lack of mundane realism in JDM experiments: The commen- tators take issue with the tasks used to study phenomena, the samples employed, and the focus on a speciﬁc time point in the decision-making process. Speciﬁ- cally, the commentators contend that the laboratory-based simple tasks employed by JDM researchers do not approximate the complexity of organizational life. As such, the ﬁndings derived from these research paradigms are, in their view, of little rele- vance to IOOB, where a contingency per- spective is needed to fully understand the phenomena in question (see, e.g., Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010; Rosen et al., 2010; Staw, 2010). In addition, the student—or, more generally, nonexpert—samples rou- tinely used in JDM research gave pause to some of our commentators (Rosen et al., 2010; Staw, 2010). Finally, Rosen et al. note that although JDM research tends to focus on the ultimate decision, the process that leadsuptothis decisionisequally important and should not be overlooked.

We respond in two ways. First, we call for a more nuanced and less ‘‘black or white’’ discussion of external validity (gen- eralizability). Second, we remind readers that a lack of internal validity is as harmful

# 457

# 458

as a lack of external validity. Each of these issues is discussed in more detail below.

External validity. We agree with portions the critiques expressed by the com- of mentators, but we maintain that a more nuanced discussion on external validity is needed. JDM research would certainly gain by diversifying its samples and set- tings (and indeed its stimuli and criteria; Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010). For example, we believe that JDM would beneﬁt a great deal—both per se and in terms of its exportability to other ﬁelds such as IOOB—from the development of a com- prehensive and well-accepted taxonomy of judgment and decision-making tasks (see also Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010). More- over, in a subsequent section of this article, we discuss alternatives to, and variations on, traditional laboratory experiments.

These agreements notwithstanding, we reiterate that it is the theory (not the sample or setting) that does or does not generalize (Highhouse, 2009; Highhouse & Gillespie, 2009) and that any sample and setting to which the theory is expected to generalize is ‘‘fair game’’ for research. Many JDM theories are at least intended to apply to all human beings across a variety of contexts (as Staw, 2010, notes). In other words, these theories are intended to generalize to both laboratory and ﬁeld settings and to both basic research and applied issues. In our view, therefore, it would therefore be shortsighted to write JDM research off solely because of its settings and samples.

We do agree that, if researchers are inter- ested in the study of decisions in workplace settings, it would be a good idea to assess whether the predictions from these theories really do apply equally to all employ- ees in all work settings. Given that JDM researchers have unfortunately not thus far been particularly interested in work- place decision making, IOOB researchers could pick up the research baton. Rather than dismissing the JDM theories out of hand because of the samples and set- tings used by JDM researchers, such an approach would emphasize the potential

# S.Bonaccioetal.

importance of these theories to IOOB and would then go about testing these theories in workplace contexts. These demonstra- tions of the generalizability of JDM theories to IOOB contexts can be quite informative (Hodgkinson & Healey, 2008; Reb, 2010) and represent a good starting point for cross-fertilization. As Reb notes, however, they should ultimately evolve into a bidi- rectional emphasis on improving theory. For example, with regard to the cogni- tive heuristics and biases identiﬁed by JDM researchers, a focus on individual differ- ences and workplace contexts could be beneﬁcial in studying (at least) two related issues: (a) the relative importance of indi- vidual differences and workplace contexts versus heuristics and biases (see Goodwin, 2010) and (b) individual differences and workplace contexts as moderators of the effects of heuristics and biases. Thus, IOOB could build on JDM theories and thereby contribute to JDM.

Internal validity. It seems fair to say that JDM has privileged internal validity over external validity, but it seems equally fair to say that IOOB has privileged external validity over internal validity. The example IOOB—namely, of the relationship between job satisfaction and job performance—should sufﬁce to demonstrate the deleterious consequences of neglecting internal validity. As Judge, Thoresen, Bono, and Patton (2001) power- fully illustrate, despite a staggering amount of research (more than 300 studies, com- posed of more than 50,000 employees, and conducted over more than 70 years), it is far from clear whether (a) satisfac- tion causes performance, (b) performance causes satisfaction, (c) satisfaction and per- formance are reciprocally related, or (d) the relationship is spurious. Indeed, plausible theoretical rationales exist for each of these four possibilities.

# the ‘‘holy grail’’ of

Unfortunately, a neglect of internal valid- ity is not limited to the above case but instead seems fairly pervasive in IOOB. We submit that internal validity is neces- sary not only for science but also—because

# Takingworkplacedecisionsseriously

causation is a much higher evidentiary standard than correlation—for evidence- based practice. We therefore urge IOOB to pay more attention to internal valid- (cer- ity and to use research designs tainly including laboratory experiments) conducive to demonstrations of internal validity. As Hodgkinson and Healey (2008) put it, ‘‘[a] blanket call for more ﬁeld and fewer laboratory studies is ... unwarranted’’ (p. 405).

Summary. The issue of which method- ological tradition to adopt should not be one of instead one of ‘‘both/and.’’ The proper study of decisions in the workplace requires the best of both the IOOB and the JDM methodological tra- ditions. We need both ﬁeld and laboratory research and both external and internal validity. We should, however, recognize that external validity involves the general- izability of the theory. Moreover, IOOB’s neglect of internal validity and its seem- ing distrust of laboratory experiments are, in our view, counterproductive. Although this has been said before (Ilgen, 1985), it bears repeating: Laboratory research in IOOB should be a question of when, not if.

# ‘‘either/or’’ but

# OtherBarriers

The commentaries discuss three additional barriers to cross-fertilization. First, as Staw (2010) astutely observes, the handoff of the research baton from JDM to IOOB—or vice versa—will not necessarily be seamless or even pleasant. For example, as we alluded to in a previous section (see also Whyte, 2010), the JDM perspective on goal- setting appears to have been somewhat unsettling to IOOB researchers. Each ﬁeld must be prepared to make concessions and must remain open to the possibility of inconvenient truths emanating from the other ﬁeld. It is worth remembering that, as Reb (2010) puts it in his commentary, ‘‘[d]ifferences, rather than similarities, open up opportunities for value creation.’’

## lack of knowledge, among IOOB researchers and

# A second barrier

is

# the

practitioners, of JDM theories and methods. Sumneret al.(2010) present convincing evi- dence that JDM is greatly underrepresented in traditional IOOB graduate training cur- ricula. As they say, ‘‘If there is no training, then there can be very little integration of the two ﬁelds.’’ Sumner et al. therefore argue that, ‘‘because JDM is so important for truly understanding organizational behavior andindividual behaviorinorganizations, all [IOOB graduate] programs should involve at least basic training in its methods, mod- they els, and applications.’’ provide several concrete recommendations to achieve this. The reader may not be sur- prised to learn that we concur completely. We heartily endorse Sumner et al.’s rec- ommendations, and we add that several teaching resources of potential use to IOOB are provided by the Society for Judgment and Decision Making at http://sjdm.org/ syllabi.

Importantly,

The ﬁnal barrier discussed at some length in the commentaries is a set of institutional and personal factors that facilitate inertia. For example, Reb (2010) rightly notes that being well versed in two ﬁelds is a difﬁcult endeavor and that breadth of knowledge can come at the cost of depth of knowledge. In a related vein, Connolly (2010) remarks that deviating from one’s research agenda to pursue interdisciplinary work may be a less-than-appealing proposition for many researchers whose time is already a scarce commodity.

It was not our intention to discount the power of these ‘‘mundane incentives’’ (as Connolly, 2010, calls them)—they are a the potentially serious impediment. Yet, integration we propose need not imme- diately involve dramatic paradigm shifts but instead could begin with incremental steps toward common ground. Moreover, we believe that the gains to science- and evidence-based practice from cross- fertilization are sufﬁciently substantial as to warrant an active attempt to reorient these mundane incentives such that they aid, or at least do not actively obstruct, interdisci- plinary research.

Areas Where JDM Has Already Enriched, or Has the Potential to Enrich, IOOB

In our focal article, we discussed sev- eral substantive and methodological areas where JDM can inform IOOB or had already done so. As evidenced by the paragraphs below, several commentaries expanded on these areas and provided additional examples. We believe the examples identi- ﬁed in the commentaries are an indication of the high quality of work that is likely to be the outcome of increased collaboration between these two areas.

First, D. K. Dalal (no relation to R. S. Dalal, an author on the focal article and this response) and his colleagues (Dalal, Diab, Balzer, & Doherty, 2010) identiﬁed several ways in which the lens model and the research designs with which it is associated the (e.g., policy capturing) can beneﬁt practice of IOOB. The applied focus of this commentary reminds the reader that IOOB practitioners, too, would beneﬁt from Importantly, cross-fertilization with JDM. the emphasis on sampling situations and stimuli in the Brunswikian tradition of judgment research (within which the lens model is based) is likely to be particularly attractive to IOOB.

Second, Bottom andKong (2010; seealso Goodwin, 2010; Kuhn, 2010) discuss the complexities engendered by the contextual inher- factors (such as interdependence) ent in decision making in organizations. They argue that this complexity reduces the appropriateness of expected utility theory as a benchmark for the study of deci- sions in organizations. We agree with the importance of studying context: Although theories based on the principles of expected utility have been employed proﬁtably in the domains of to IOOB—for interest example, motivation (Naylor, Pritchard, & Ilgen, 1980; Vroom, 1964), attitudes (Ajzen, 1991), and employee selection (Brogden, these theories 1949)—the complexity of has proliferated over time in response to the need to model contextual factors. (non-utility-based) mid-level Additional

normative and descriptive theories can and should be employed in IOOB research.

Finally, Rosen et al. (2010) make a strong case for the utility of naturalistic deci- sion making (NDM) vis-`a-vis understand- ing organizational processes as studied by IOOB, especially in terms of improving decision-making performance. We agree, though we are also in agreement with their comment to the effect that NDM needs to improve the overly context-speciﬁc nature of its models and tests thereof. To be clear, we do believe that NDM, despite being a very young discipline, is likely to be of inter- est to IOOB researchers and practitioners. We also agree that JDM has been overly focused on the choice component of the decision process and that NDM has a role in other components of the process, such as problem detection and situation awareness.

## Areas Where IOOB Has the Potential to Enrich JDM

In our focal article, we concentrated primarily on what IOOB had to gain by incorporating JDM theories. However, we indicated that cross-fertilization could just as easily ﬂow in the opposite direction, from IOOB to JDM, and we provided some examples in this regard. The commentators provide many additional examples.

Of relevance to the previous discussion of external validity, several commentators (Bottom & Kong, 2010; Goodwin, 2010; Kuhn, 2010; see also Staw, 2010) argue that organizations are complex and that decision making in organizations involves multiple—and often incompatible—goals, of which decision accuracy is only one. Pol- itics, impression management, uncertainty, social cohesion, and so forth are also impor- tant considerations for managers, but these considerations, the authors argue, are not typically studied in JDM research. It is in this context that Goodwin argues that although research on managerial forecasting has thus far been dominated by the JDM approach, the IOOB approach has much to offer.

These are good points. We did not mean to imply that accuracy is the only

# Takingworkplacedecisionsseriously

important or even necessarily the most motive associated with workplace deci- sions. Non-accuracy factors associated with workplace decisions deﬁnitely need to the presence of be studied. However, these non-accuracy factors does not negate the necessity of studying decision accu- racy—as the commentators would surely agree. For example, Goodwin (2010) pro- vides some compelling examples that illus- trate the need to study how non-accuracy factors inﬂuence the importance of accu- racy to decision makers in organizations, whereas Kuhn (2010) correctly notes that JDM research on advice taking could ben- eﬁt by studying how nonaccuracy factors inﬂuence the accuracy of advisors’ recom- mendations and decision makers’ choices. As another example of how IOOB can contribute to JDM, Kuhn (2010; see also Rosen et al., 2010) focuses on the difﬁcul- ties of training managers to make better decisions. Once again, we are pleased to note the practitioner-oriented angle of this commentary. Of particular interest to us wasKuhn’s contentionthat training employ- ees to avoid decision biases may be less useful than implementing carefully consid- ered structural solutions. We agree with the importance of structural solutions (though here too we feel that a ‘‘both/and’’ approach is preferable to an ‘‘either/or’’ approach), and we point the reader to several creative examples ofstructural solutionsdiscussedin the popular bookNudge(Thaler &Sunstein, 2008). In our view, the focus on context by IOOB researchers provides an invaluable opportunity to study such structural solu- tions and, ultimately, to implement them proﬁtably in organizations.

Finally, Reiter-Palmon and Hullsiek (2010) also argue for a focus on outcomes other than decision accuracy. They con- tend, and we agree, JDM research can be improved by expanding its crite- rion space in a manner similar to creativ- just ity research (which emphasizes not the accuracy or quality of solutions but also their quantity, novelty, and so forth) and by following creativity research in studying individual differences and using

# that

more complex tasks (see also Hayes & Wooldridge, 2010). Moreover, as research on creativity and NDM (Rosen et al., 2010) have begun to do, JDM could focus more on stages of the decision process both prior and subsequent to choice (see Mohammed & Schwall, 2009).

## Increasing Integration: Suggestions for Moving Forward

In our focal article, we noted that the journal Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes is an ongoing attempt at cross-fertilization. We suggested several additional strategies to increase cross-fertilization, some research based and others more structural. A forthcoming SIOP Frontiers series book (edited by Highhouse, Dalal, and Salas) will adopt JDM and NDM perspectives on IOOB topics and should also prove helpful to cross-fertilization. We are additionally pleased to see sev- eral excellent thoughts on cross-fertilization emanating from the commentaries.

First, the comments include ideas stem- ming from paradigmatic considerations. For example, Reb (2010) discusses the role of theory-driven, process-oriented research as a way to bridge the gap and to inform a vari- ety of decisions from the perspective of the employee (e.g., job choice and voluntary turnover) as well as that of the organization (e.g., employee selection and involuntary turnover). Yet, Reb argues that the appli- cability of a decision process model to job performance per se is less straight- is nonetheless pos- it forward—but sible when ‘‘performance [is] considered as the aggregation of decision outcomes over a certain period and certain perfor- mance dimensions.’’ In other words, Reb contends that ‘‘a decision and its outcomes can be roughly equated with a performance episode.’’ We concur, and we add that such a view—which is very different from the way job performance has traditionally been viewed in IOOB—is likely to prove particularly useful in studying momentary (i.e., state) performance and distinguishing

# that

# 461

# 462

it fromcharacteristic (i.e., trait) performance (see also Dalal & Hulin, 2008).

Second, the commentaries include some important concrete recommendations. For example, Byham (2010) proposes assess- ment centers (e.g., ‘‘in-basket/box’’ and problem analysis exercises; see also Staw, 2010) as a way to increase collaboration between IOOB and JDM. As discussed in a previous section, we believe that there is a strong case for the use of traditional laboratory experiments in IOOB; yet, we deﬁnitely agree with Byham’s assertion that ‘‘[a]ssessment centers are an excellent way of studying decision making.’’ Assessment centers have the potential to provide not only a good balance of internal and external validity (including, as they do, what Staw, 2010, refers to as ‘‘organization like’’ sam- ples and settings) but also a good source of information into decision-making processes and outcomes. As Byham recommends, researchers should attempt to partner with organizations to obtain existing archival assessment center data or, better yet, to jointly develop new assessment center tasks that allow for the testing of speciﬁc hypothe- ses of interest.

suggests that researchers use assessment-center-type work simulation tasks in the laboratory, using undergraduate students. In a related vein, Staw (2010) discusses the issue of lab- oratory researchersconstructing their exper- imental tasks ‘‘in ways that more accurately capture the organizational experience’’ (see alsoHayes &Wooldridge, 2010) andargues for qualitative approaches such as observa- tions and unstructured interviews as useful domain-entry techniques that will allow researchers to construct laboratory tasks ‘‘that mimic the tugs of’’ organizational the reader to several settings. We point papers by James Terborg (e.g., Terborg, Cas- tore, & DeNinno, 1976; Terborg & Davis, 1982; Terborg & Miller, 1978) as excellent examples of various types of work simula- tions involving students.

the commentaries provide sev- eral ‘‘institutional’’ recommendations. For example, Sumner et al. (2010) provide a

thoughtful approach to integrating JDM materials into an IOOB-focused graduate- level seminar. In addition, Reb (2010) suggests that interdisciplinary collaboration could help overcome the signiﬁcant bar- rier of having to be an expert in several disciplines. He notes that academic and other research institutions typically tout the importance of interdisciplinary research but do little to actually facilitate such research. We agree wholeheartedly. In fact, some of the authors of this article have observed that, although interdisciplinary work is ofﬁ- cially encouraged at their academic insti- tutions, the administration of expenses and revenues, and the way these moneys are shared across departments, has hindered the institutionalization of interdisciplinary research groups. At the level of the two disciplines of IOOB and JDM, opportuni- ties for institutionalizing cross-fertilization to implement. The are perhaps easier ideas in the commentaries included spe- cial issues in journals, special sessions at conferences, special funding for interdisci- plinary work focused on practical problems, and other interdisciplinary endeavors (Con- nolly, 2010; Reb, 2010).

Finally, Connolly (2010) suggests that it is important to systematically examine the ‘‘mundane factors’’ that steer researchers toward ‘‘conservative persistence’’ within a particular academic discipline despite evidence of the ‘‘intellectual and practical importance’’ of cross-fertilization. Ideally, the outcome of such an examination would be additional ideas to incentivize, or at least avoid disincentivizing, cross-fertilization.

these excellent sug- gestions, if embraced by those within the IOOB and JDM communities, will surely spur more interdisciplinary work and begin the institutionalizationof cross-fertilization. As Whyte (2010) notes, it would be ‘‘unfor- tunate ... if young IOOB researchers were to ignore the opportunities presented by JDM to push IOOB in a direction that it might not otherwise go and to unlock important insights that might otherwise remain hidden.’’ IOOB, likewise, has much to contribute to JDM. Sustained openness

We believe that

and effort will be required to bridge the philosophical and methodological tradi- tions of both ﬁelds, but we are gratiﬁed by the response to our focal article, and we feel that the conversation we initiated has been fruitful. Let the conversation continue!
