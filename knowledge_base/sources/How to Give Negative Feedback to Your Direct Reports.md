That’s why it’s soimportant to step up to the challenge and initiate difficultfeedback conversations.Here are some tips to get you through the process.

In your head, it might be easier to postpone giving hard feedbackuntil a performance review, or until your employee is put on aperformance improvement plan (PIP). But waiting to givefeedback only means it will take your employee longer to improve— they can’t make changes if they’re unaware of what they’redoing wrong. Further, waiting to integrate negative feedback intoa PIP likely won’t give your employee enough time to process theinformation and change before they’re let go.

start doubting themselves as a result and wonderwhat else they’re not aware of. They may even wonder whatothers are thinking behind closed doors, or question if they’rereally good at anything.

So, when exactly should you give constructive feedback, and howdo you do it? The key is to be consistent and provide feedback in away that honors the person in front of you. The following stepscan make these discussions feel easier for you, too.

Instead of waiting to give feedback, build a system that will helpyou provide critical feedback on time. One-on-one conversationsare the ideal time to give feedback.Make sure to schedule regular meetings with your direct reports(weekly or biweekly) and make feedback a consistent part of yourdiscussions. If it’s always on the agenda, you’ll both know toexpect and prepare for it. You can also keep a running list of bothpositive and negative feedback you’ve received from others aboutyour direct report and add it to the conversation. Remember toprovide constructive feedback always in a private setting, never ina public one.

Even if you see yourself as a courageous person, difficultconversations require a different type of courage — the courage ofwords. If being direct and honest isn’t easy for you, experimentfirst with some lower stake situations to increase your courage.Try giving feedback to a peer that you trust and know willappreciate the input. Or you could practice giving feedback to a

friend or family member. You could even disclose to them thatyou’re working to improve in this area and ask how the feedbackfelt on their end. In most cases, you’ll find that the person andsituation benefited from you sharing how things can be donebetter. This will help you build courage to have those criticalconversations with your direct reports.

Feedback is focused on past actions and things that went wrong.The past is in the past and cannot be changed. “Feedforward” isan evolution of traditional feedback that is focused on what canbe done in the future. During your conversation, try to focus asmuch as possible on “feedforward” — discuss the possibility forchange and better outcomes moving forward. Since“feedforward” addresses things that haven’t happened yet, it canbe perceived as more objective and impersonal.For example, feedback might sound like, “I want to talk aboutyour presentation this morning. It missed data visuals and it alsolacked strong positioning.” Feedforward on the other hand mightsound like, “Based on your presentation this morning, I wanted totalk with you about a few ways your slide deck could make aneven bigger impact next time. Why don’t you try adding morevisual data and taking a stronger position throughout?” Note thatfeedback relies more heavily on negative words (“missed,”“lacked”) while feedforward focuses more on the positiveoutcomes of making a change.

reports to really hear you, you must help them feel safe bydelivering your feedback with care.To do so, always start the conversation by explaining why you’dlike to give this person feedback. Reiterate that you’re eager tohelp them grow, and that you’re on their side. Then, share a pieceof positive feedback — what actions would you like them toreplicate in the future? Next, share the feedforward and expresswhat they could do better next time. Finish the conversation byasking them what they would do differently and offer your help.Having a script for exactly what you’d like to say can makeapproaching the conversation a little easier for you, and yourdirect report. Here’s an example of what you might say:Hi Adam,Thank you for making time to talk through the client meeting wehad this morning. It was important to me that we made time to talkbecause I want you to succeed, and I want to enable you to do yourbest work.You did an excellent job establishing a fast connection with theclient — your ability to build strong relationships quickly makesyou such an asset to this team.Next time, it would be great if you sent out an agenda ahead of time.That would help us all to stay on track and have a productivemeeting. You should also aim to collect more backgroundinformation about the client’s industry and challenges before themeeting so we can properly discuss.What other ideas do you have for our next client meeting, and howcan I support you?

Make sure to practice the conversation out loud and makechanges until it feels both clear and caring.

As you go through this process, it’s important to remember thatgiving feedback is not about you. It should always be about theother person. You can fundamentally change a person’sprofessional (and maybe personal) life if you’re honest with themat the right time.One of my clients finally mustered the courage to give difficultfeedback. While it was hard to give and hard to hear, after somereflection, the person receiving it said, “I wish somebody wouldhave told me that 10 years ago.” You have the power to be theperson who does good in the world today, not 10 years from now.
