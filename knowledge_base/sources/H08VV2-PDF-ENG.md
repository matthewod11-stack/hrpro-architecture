Morale is terrible. Everything feels tense. And people keep leaving—

whether by choice or “mutual agreement,” it’s hard to tell. When the

climate at work is borderline toxic, you need to work extra hard to keep

your team stable. Shield them from the dysfunction, and you have a

chance to hold onto the people you can’t aﬀord to lose.

So, what are the best ways to counter the negativity? How can you be

realistic but also constructive about company problems? And how can

you set boundaries between your team and the company’s turmoil?

# What the Experts Say

Leading a team in an organization where communication and trust have

broken down can leave you feeling powerless. The bad energy has a

way of seeping into everything, threatening to contaminate your people

too. But as a team leader, “you have more control and inﬂuence than

you think,” according to Jennifer Chatman, dean of the Haas School of

Business at the University of California, Berkeley. “In organizations that

are slightly to very toxic, being siloed can actually be an advantage,”

she says. “The opportunity for leaders is to focus on creating a pocket

of excellence: a culture that helps buﬀer your team from the rest of the

# business.”

Don’t pretend everything is ﬁne, says Natasha Kehimkar, CEO of Malida

Advisors, a consulting ﬁrm focused on organizational eﬀectiveness. It’s

clear to everyone that it’s not. “Acknowledge the reality, and instead

of trying to hide from what’s happening, focus on empowering your

team and keeping your connection strong,” she says. “Focus on building

something positive together and giving your team the tools and support

they need to thrive despite the chaos.” Here are seven ways to do that.

Set your own standards.

First things ﬁrst: You don’t need to passively accept a dysfunctional

workplace. You can build something better. The key is being deliberate

about your team’s culture and getting everyone involved in creating it,

says Chatman. “Envision what the ideal culture looks like and work with

your team to identify the practices that get you there,” she advises. Set

rules for how you treat each other. Decide how you’ll work with clients.

And talk about how the team should handle conﬂict. “Chances are, if

you’re seeing the opportunity to deviate from a toxic culture, others are

too,” she says.

The goal is to give your team members more say so they feel more in

control. Kehimkar recommends asking your team: What do we want

our reputation to be? What should we be known for? What makes us

diﬀerent? “Shape your team’s culture around that,” she says. “You’re

not trying to prove you’re better than everyone else, but to create an

intentional culture that stands apart.”

# Reinforce good habits.

Once your team has agreed on how you’ll work together, you need

to reinforce it in the day to day. “When people feel threatened

about their future, your job is to dispel that anxiety and restore the

conﬁdence they need to perform,” says Chatman. She suggests “creating

socialization opportunities and curating success stories that model

the new behaviors you want to see.” If you want more collaboration,

for example, share examples of team members that solved problems

together and explain why it worked.

Celebrate teamwork, not just individual achievements. “People tend to

resist change not because they don’t want it, but because they don’t

understand what you’re really asking of them,” she adds. “The more

vividly you can create clarity, the more likely it is people will take a risk

and try new behaviors.”

Make sure you’re not part of the problem.

Your team is watching to see if you genuinely want to do things

diﬀerently or if you’re going to fall into the same patterns. “How you

behave as a leader seems obvious, but it’s not,” says Chatman. “Leaders

have to be extremely tuned in and not just say they want certain

changes but also model them and call out that they’re modeling them.”

For example, if you say you want people’s voices to be heard but then

dominate every conversation, you’re undermining yourself from the

# start.

Small moments reveal your intentions. When asking important

questions on, say, strategy or priorities, Kehimkar advises saying: “I

have a perspective on this, and I’d like to hear from you ﬁrst.” This

demonstrates that you care about their ideas, and you’re not just

pushing your own agenda.

Be the lightning rod.

Think carefully about what you expose your team to. “As the leader,

you need to be the point person for all cross-team communication

and shield people from the toxicity,” says Chatman. Put simply: You

get to decide how much of the organizational drama reaches them,

absorbing the criticism and tension yourself to spare the team. “This is

a sacriﬁcial act,” Chatman says. You’re not blocking information; rather,

you’re ﬁltering and framing it to preserve your team’s energy and keep

people moving forward.

Big challenges like layoﬀs and rising competition are obvious, but

there’s no need for a gloom-and-doom update that has no eﬀect on their

day-to-day work, adds Kehimkar. “Keep people in the loop and don’t

sugarcoat, but help them focus on the sphere they can control.”

# Make impact front and center.

Your team always needs to see how its contributions matter and advance

the mission, but in an unhealthy culture, you need to make that

connection crystal clear, says Chatman. She recommends helping your

team members see the bigger picture on multiple levels, showing how

## their work drives team goals, division goals, and company-wide results.

“All jobs can be meaningful, but leaders need to identify that meaning

and make it salient,” she says.

If the organization won’t recognize your team, make your own proof

points. At one biotech ﬁrm, a team renamed their metric from “number

of vials sold” to “number of patients helped” and started meetings with

a patient testimonial. “People need concrete evidence of their impact,

especially when the broader culture doesn’t provide that validation.”

Build community to ﬁll the void.

There’s a psychological toll to having cynicism and dysfunction

dominate your workday. You and your team need something to oﬀset

the constant negativity, says Chatman. This means building genuine

relationships that help people see each other as more than just

colleagues enduring the same mess. Team-building activities are a good

start. “We dismiss this as ‘soft stuﬀ,’ but it’s actually foundational,” she

says. “You can’t build a strong team culture without it.”

Kehimkar suggests doing community service with your team if that’s a

possibility. “When the organization is spiraling, doing volunteer work

together outside the company builds resilience,” she says. “You see what

your team is capable of when you’re all in service of something bigger

# than yourselves.”

# Don’t wait for exit interviews.

People in hostile workplaces constantly ask themselves, “Why am I

still here?” It often comes down to the relationship with their boss,

says Kehimkar. “When you feel like you matter, that’s an anchor.” She

recommends holding periodic, informal stay interviews to “re-recruit

your team members.” Ask: What drew you here? What did you hope for

on this team, and what’s actually happening? What strengths are we

not tapping into? What are your frustrations? “If you hear real concerns,

address them,” she says.

Learning opportunities are another consideration. “Development makes

people feel valued,” she says. “Show them what their future could look

like.” When there’s no budget for training, work with your team to

ﬁnd alternative ways to build skills and experience. “One of the things

leaders say is ‘I’m too busy.’ But if you know that things are going

downhill, make time for these conversations. You don’t retain people

# by accident.”

# Principles to Remember

# Do

- Involve everyone in creating the practices that shape the culture you

want, including how you interact with each other, work with clients,

and handle conﬂict.

- Provide meaning for your team on multiple levels, and show people

## how their work impacts team goals, division goals, and organizational

# objectives.

- Oﬀset negativity by creating opportunities, including team-building

## activities or community service projects, that strengthen trust and

# connection.

# Don’t

- Just talk about change or be performative. Your team is watching to

see if you fall into old patterns, so model the behaviors you expect and

call out when you’re doing it.

- Pass along every gloom-and-doom update from leadership. Keep

people informed, but ﬁlter information strategically to help your team

# focus on areas within their control.

- Wait until it’s too late. Hold stay interviews to re-recruit your team

with questions like: Why did you join? What’s working? What’s not?

Then follow through on what you hear.
