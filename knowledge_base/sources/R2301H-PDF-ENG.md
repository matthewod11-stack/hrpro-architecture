Ask leaders how they will respond to a crisis or a massive new

opportunity, and they often will tell you they already know what

to do. This is surprising because most crises and opportunities have

unexpected elements. A high-powered executive whom we coach once

told us, “In any crisis, I come out of the gate fast and take action. I go

over, under, or through any wall in my way. With my people, I lead from

the front.” To be sure, that approach has the beneﬁt of decisiveness,

but it oﬀers a narrow path, especially in high-stakes situations. What

happens when such leaders run into obstacles they can’t muscle their

# way through?

Another leader we coached had a diﬀerent approach. He was an

incredible delegator with legendary calm. This worked well until a

crisis surfaced and his team started feeling lost and overwhelmed. He

stayed steady, conﬁdent in his default style, telling people, “Don’t worry,

I have conﬁdence that you’ll ﬁgure it out.” They didn’t ﬁgure it out,

team members began ﬁghting with one another, and within months the

company lost its market-leading position.

In our work coaching and advising senior leaders, we have found that

when faced with unfamiliar or risky situations, leaders often rely on

their familiar playbook. They act instinctively, falling back on behavior

and postures that worked for them before. But should their operating

environment experience a discontinuity, reﬂexes—which may still be

right at times—can no longer be counted on. To be eﬀective, leaders

need to rise above their default reactions and generate more options for

how to act in the very moments when they are needed most.

Few leadership roles come with a treasure map showing a direct line

to where X marks the spot. That’s why the ability to generate multiple

pathways to a desired destination is crucial to success. Whether it’s

chasing a strategy that could drive 10x growth in a business, facing a

potentially catastrophic threat, or guiding a team through uncharted

territory, great leaders generate options so that when an opportunity

arises or a crisis hits, they can pivot in real time and make the optimal

# move.

Our experience shows that leaders’ success depends on their ability to

MOVE—that is, to be mindfully alert to priorities, to generate options

so that they always have several ways to win, to validate their own

vantage point, and to engage with stakeholders to ensure that they are

along for the ride. (We lay out this framework in our book, Real-Time

Leadership. To gauge your ability to MOVE, take our self-assessment

at RealTimeLeadershipInstitute.com.) In this article, we examine the

crucial second step of our model. Speciﬁcally, we look at four common

leadership approaches and the scenarios in which each can be most

helpful, and we introduce a process for navigating the options in real

# time.

# The Four Stances

Dozens of research studies spearheaded by American psychologists

Charles “Rick” Snyder and Shane J. Lopez demonstrate how people’s

capacity to reach their desired goals can be increased by conceiving

multiple possible pathways. Most people assume that success at a task

is a question of perseverance or willpower. But Snyder and Lopez show

that willpower must be coupled with “way power” to drive successful

outcomes. Their research suggests that ideally you will have four or

more options or pathways for achieving your goals (external priorities).

It also demonstrates the importance of determining who you want

to be as a leader in terms of your character strengths and values

(internal priorities) and how you can best relate to others (interpersonal

# priorities).

Building on this work, we have developed an approach, called the

“four stances,” to help leaders generate options for interpersonal

communication. Think how tennis players nearly instantly shift their

stance to make an optimal response to a ball hurtling over the net. The

core concept for our approach is rooted in evolutionary psychology and

how our basic reﬂexes (ﬁght, ﬂight, and so on) automatically deploy

under dangerous or novel circumstances. In the more evolved world

of leadership, the four stances help leaders identify and access more

interpersonal options. The stances are:

- Lean In. Take an active stance on resolving an issue. Actions in

this stance include deciding, directing, guiding, challenging, and

# confronting.

- Lean Back. Take an analytical stance to observe, collect, and

understand data. Actions include analyzing, asking questions, and

possibly delaying decisions.

- Lean With. Take a collaborative stance, focusing on caring and

connecting. Actions include empathizing, encouraging, and coaching.

- Don’t Lean. Whereas a Lean Back posture involves observing and

analyzing, Don’t Lean is about being still and disciplining yourself to

create space for a new solution to bubble up from your subconscious.

This stance also serves to calm you if your emotions have been

triggered. Actions include contemplating, visualizing, and settling

# through diaphragmatic breathing.

To win in any leadership moment, great leaders need to develop and

be able to access all four stances. To illustrate, let’s consider one of our

clients, Isobel, a newly appointed president of a major business line at a

# tech company.

Isobel was in trouble and called us in. She was at loggerheads with

the ﬁrm’s mercurial CEO, who had a tendency to be unreliable—

contradicting himself, changing positions, and often making promises

# the company couldn’t deliver on.

“I’m getting a bad reputation for being aggressive at board meetings,”

she told us at our ﬁrst two-on-one coaching session. “I just tell the truth

—someone needs to—but I’m the one getting dinged.”

Berlin-based photographer Matthias Heiderich is interested in architectural patterns and colors he finds in the city, especially in overlooked functional spaces and in the multitude of ways that inhabitants design and shape their surroundings.

As we talked, we identiﬁed a clear gap between her own and others’

perceptions. Leaning In—way in—was her default stance. As a former

lawyer, she was a world-class debater, and her impact was far more

powerful than she realized. It was clear she needed to overcome her

reﬂexive behavior and ﬁnd other viable ways to win. We described

the four stances and asked her to consider alternatives to her default

# approach.

“But I need to be authentic,” she countered.

“Of course,” we responded, “but you can use other stances while still

being true to yourself.”

We went through the stances one by one. In situations in which Lean

In was the best choice, she saw that she could be more skillful by

better calibrating the intensity of her remarks. If she could learn to

Lean Back and not rush into conﬂict, she could slow down her reactions

and be more strategic about when she would engage. If she applied

Don’t Lean, she could take a moment to breathe, which could help her

neutralize her activation by the CEO and keep a clear head. We were all

surprised that asking about Lean With was what pivoted Isobel into a

new way of operating. Drawing on Harvard Business School professor

Amy Edmondson’s groundbreaking work on psychological safety, we

asked, “What if your job at the board meeting was to make the CEO and

directors feel safe?”

Isobel immediately embraced that approach, which appealed to

her protective side. She spontaneously started thinking through the

implications. Supporting the CEO would probably help him calm down

and make the meetings less painful for everyone. In the Lean With

stance, she could also tolerate his contradictions by understanding

that his ﬁrst reaction wasn’t always his ﬁnal word. She decided that

she would enthusiastically support his comments when they were

in alignment with the executive committee’s assessment and refrain

from reﬂexively challenging him when he veered oﬀ course, unless

the board was close to a vote on that recommendation. After adopting

this approach, her reputation with the board skyrocketed. She became

known as a leader who made peace rather than war.

# Putting the Process to Work

How can you adapt the four stances without an executive coach? We

recommend a ﬁve-step process for addressing major opportunities and

crises, whether they play out in the moment or over the long term. It will

enable you to choose your way forward rather than being propelled by

# reﬂex.

Identify your default stance. Rank how comfortable you are working

with others in each stance. This simple exercise is often all our clients

need to identify their default stance, but if there’s any doubt, reﬂect on

feedback you’ve been given, such as a 360-degree review. You may think

of yourself as a Lean With leader because you favor decisions based

on consensus—but is that accurate? When you have power as a leader,

people rarely tell you the truth about how you come across. Be honest

# with yourself.

Reﬂect on high-stakes situations. Is the stance you take under stress

diﬀerent from your default stance? Think back to instances when you

were able to pivot in the moment if your default stance wasn’t leading

to the desired result and compare those moments with times when you

stubbornly stuck with a failing approach. What held you back from

moving to a diﬀerent option? Habit? Panic? How can you build on

experiences when you’ve done well while avoiding mistakes?

Determine the optimal stance on the basis of whom you are interacting

with. Most leaders we work with are familiar with the Golden Rule of

treating others as you would like to be treated. But the best leaders we

have worked with employ the Platinum Rule—treating others as they

would like to be treated, which may be diﬀerent from what the leader

would want in their shoes. Imagine an introvert suddenly interrupted

by an extrovert who means to be helpful by oﬀering a pep talk. Or,

conversely, an extrovert in need of encouragement who ends up feeling

ignored by an introvert whose intention is to oﬀer the gift of space and

time to think. To live by the Platinum Rule, become a keen observer

of other people and yourself. Notice body language, tone of voice, eye

contact, and reactions to what you do and how you move.

Make a plan. When an interpersonal issue arises, make space in real

time to ﬁgure out how to handle it. This beat in time may last only

a matter of seconds, but the point is to pause and get clarity on your

intention so that you can be deliberate in your reaction. How do you

want to relate, right now? Recognize that your default stance will be

pulling at you—but remember that you have the option to choose a

diﬀerent one. We all need to dial back on some stances and develop

# others.

Even if you aren’t in a situation where you must think on your feet, you

can use the four stances to unlock options and create a plan in advance.

Suppose you need to communicate a change in strategic direction to

## your team, such as a shift from a major cost-transformation eﬀort

toward a growth strategy. First, Lean In and come up with a list of

options for how you might best get people on board. When you think

you are ﬁnished, Lean Back and be even more objective. Ask yourself,

“What else would align the team?” Then Lean With by consulting others

about what they think the options are for you to create a trusting and

positive climate in which the change will be best received. And then

Don’t Lean and see if anything else pops into your mind. Put the issue

on the back burner for a moment and let your subconscious go to work.

Look for signs that it’s time to pivot. To create the impact you want,

you need to be aware of any negative eﬀects that a given stance is

having on the people around you. This will be your signal that it’s

time to adopt a new one. If Lean In is your default (as it is for many

leaders), recognize that doing so too often—or too hard—can shut

others down, especially when you are in a position of authority. In

meetings, pay attention to how much you’re speaking compared with

others. Automated transcription software can provide data showing

whether your voice is (or is not) the dominant one in the room. Most

leaders are surprised by how much they need to switch to Leaning Back

or Leaning With. Focus on listening with the goal of understanding.

Consciously catch yourself not only when you’re jumping into the

conversation but also when you stop listening carefully and start

thinking about your response. After someone has ﬁnished speaking,

take three breaths before you reply.

If Lean Back is your default, observe how your team is reacting: Are your

people engaged with bright and alert eyes? Are they drowning in data?

You may win minds with analysis, but being overly objective may cause

you to lose hearts. People won’t be eager to work through the night to hit

a deadline, but they will for an inspiring, caring leader. You must also

observe yourself: Are you holding back when you should be speaking up

to help your team?

When your default instinct is to Lean With, be wary of using the stance

to avoid tough conversations or to accept poor performance because you

“care.” As a leader you may ﬁnd it diﬃcult to watch someone struggle,

but support is diﬀerent from protection. Look back over a week or a

month and ask yourself how many times you ignored a performance

issue fearing that speaking up would hurt the other person’s feelings.

Did you praise team members when you should have been pushing for

better results because you were worried about how they might react?

Remember, when a baby chick tries desperately to break open its shell,

you shouldn’t help it. If you do, it may die. The thrashing around is how

it strengthens its muscles so that it can survive in the world.

It’s not common for Don’t Lean to be a default stance, but people often

overrely on it in high-stakes situations, sometimes shutting down under

threat. That leads to errors of omission. Look back at your calendar and

ask if there were times when you did not respond to others or rejected

their concerns because it might have raised your stress level. Have you actively avoided a situation, such as a diﬃcult team dynamic, hoping

that the problem would somehow solve itself or that others would solve

it without your participation? If you are susceptible to this type of

behavior, work hard to recognize when it’s happening, notice what it

feels like, and consider other stances you might take.

As a general rule, it is best to Lean In when your team seems

directionless and needs help getting organized or galvanized. Lean

Back when more information will help ground you, your team, or

stakeholders. Lean With when people need support, encouragement, or

motivation. Don’t Lean when the team needs to work something out on

their own and your presence would impede their progress. At the same

time, inject calm and conﬁdence if they seem frenetic. (For a summary,

see the exhibit “A Guide to the Four Stances.”)

# A Guide to the Four Stances

This list of cues can help you determine when to use—and when to avoid—each

# stance.

# Actions

When to use it

When not to use it

# LEAN IN

Deciding, directing, guiding, challenging, confronting

- When people seem

rudderless and passive and need help organizing and focusing their efforts

- When people quiet down when you enter the room

- When people don’t offer counteropinions

- When you want to energize people without triggering fear

- When change is happening rapidly and chaotically

- When people need more support and time to think

- When your emotions have been triggered

- When the world has turned upside down and you need to stabilize the situation

# LEAN BACK

Collecting data, analyzing, asking questions, delaying decisions

- When people need more

# information

- When emotions are running high and more data will help ground the team

- When you are working

with introverts who respond better to data than to inspirational rhetoric

- When team discussion

has reached the point of diminishing returns

- When people seem

overwhelmed and more data is obfuscating rather than clarifying thinking

# LEAN WITH

Empathizing, coaching, collaborating, encouraging

- When morale is low

- When your people are

extroverts and connection is the currency of choice

- When you notice how a smile or an affirming remark energizes someone

- When you notice a team member needs space to think

- When a team is operating well on its own and doesn’t need support

- When people want to feel independent

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Power of Options

# Actions

When to use it

When not to use it

# DON’T LEAN

Contemplating, being still, visualizing, breathing

- When team members need to work something out on their own and your presence may be an intrusion or slow their progress

- When the team is frenetic and needs a break or a time-out to calm things down

- When the team needs to step into planning or action mode

- When a crisis hits and people are looking to you for guidance

Whatever stance you adopt, be aware that you can use it with varying

levels of intensity. For instance, a Lean In comment can be a directive

or a suggestion, and you can Lean Back with a deep dive on an issue

or a more surgical set of questions. Your choice of framing should

be dependent on what will work best for the other person given the

situation at hand. As you work to improve your ability to use each

stance, it’s best to calibrate your behavior according to your comfort

level. If Leaning In is uncomfortable, for instance, push yourself to

communicate one more thing than you might otherwise. If you don’t

Lean Back enough, try asking a question instead of making a statement.

# The Four Stances in Real Time

Mastery of the four stances is about being able to read each moment

and shift your stance quickly, under stressful circumstances. For the

highest-stakes interactions, you will need to draw on all four. Consider

a client of ours who, after considerable work mastering the four stances,

was able to put them all into action during a tense moment.

Nathan, the CFO of a public health-care company, received news that

its largest business unit had fallen short on its latest revenue forecast,

imperiling the ﬁrm’s earnings for the quarter. Nathan called an urgent

meeting with Ted, the new president of the business line. In Nathan’s oﬃce, Ted looked like he hadn’t slept in days and appeared tense as a

# coil.

Nathan wasn’t immediately clear on which stance was optimal to kick

oﬀ the meeting, so he chose Don’t Lean to see what surfaced. He took

a deep breath to calm himself. He noted that his reﬂex was to Lean

Back and grill Ted about the situation. He also realized that he was

feeling blindsided by the revenue shortfall, but since Ted would be held

accountable by the CEO, Nathan didn’t need to rake Ted over the coals

too. And he was angry with himself for having signed oﬀ on what had

turned out to be an unreasonable forecast.

Leaning With, Nathan said, “This is rough for all of us. How are you

doing?” Ted, who was braced for condemnation, was surprised. He

unfolded his arms and talked about the toll this was taking on his entire

team. Nathan said, “What’s done is done. Let’s unpack it together.” Ted

nodded.

Leaning Back, Nathan adjusted his instinct to launch a barrage of

questions, and opted for a more open-ended question to reduce Ted’s

defensiveness: “How should we approach this to get to the root causes?”

Ted suggested they could start by exploring how much of the shortfall

was a result of the operating environment, how much was execution

challenges, and how much was a ﬂaw in the forecasting model.

Together, they identiﬁed the source of the problem and developed a

plan to recoup some of the revenue gap.

“What else?” Nathan asked as the meeting came to its seeming

conclusion. His calm approach motivated Ted to speak directly. “You

and the CEO made a top-down decision to increase our targets just as

the macro outlook was getting wobbly. We didn’t want to disappoint

you, so we ended up overreaching. If you’d consulted me at the time,

I would have told you that we had less than a 20% chance of getting

# there.”

Nathan found this painful to hear, but he also knew it was the heart of

the matter. Leaning In and Leaning With, he said, “Ted, you and I are

still getting to know each other. I was aware that we were stretching, but

I put the odds at 60% in our favor. If I’d known what you just told me, I

might have shaded back the earnings guidance.”

“You didn’t seem very open to input,” Ted replied.

Absorbing the comment, Nathan used Lean With again. “I don’t want

you to feel that way. It’s OK to have strong points of view. Going forward,

I want you to know that the CEO and I both want real debate, so don’t

hold back.”

Continuing to Lean In, Nathan added, “We may still make a call you

don’t like, but we need to have a rigorous dialogue to come up with

a better decision for the ﬁrm.” Ted appreciated Nathan’s candor and

was receptive to the new guidelines. That wasn’t the last time Ted’s

business unit presented a challenge to Nathan, but thanks to Nathan’s

agile response, it was the last time the cause was lack of communication

# and honest feedback.
