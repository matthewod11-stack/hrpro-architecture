Whether you’re a recent graduate, a mid-career professional seeking

a change, or an executive looking to enhance leadership skills, a career

coach can be an invaluable resource. A 2021 Harris Poll survey of 1,535

adults showed that while only 12% of working adults were currently

utilizing a career counselor, nearly two-thirds agreed that it would be

helpful to talk to a professional regarding future career moves. This gap

may be explained by the fact that traditional career coaching can be

## expensive and time-consuming—the average hourly rate for a career

coach in 2023 was $272.

With the emergence of generative AI platforms such as ChatGPT,

Perplexity, DeepSeek, and Claude, many job seekers are turning to AI

as an accessible, eﬃcient, and personalized alternative to traditional

career coaches, even if they are already lucky enough to have a great

human career coach. Quantifying the exact degree to which people are

now using gen AI for career coaching is diﬃcult. However, some surveys

suggest that as many as 65% of job seekers are using AI for help at some

# point in their job application process.

In this article, I hope to show you how you can use gen AI tools as your

own personalized career coach, with practical prompts and strategies to

maximize your experience, learnings, and success.

# 7 Ways to Use AI as a Career Coach

The potential uses of gen AI for career coaching (and beyond) are only

limited by our imaginations. With that said, here’s what my research

suggests are some of the most common “use cases,” or applications

of these platforms that can help to improve your understanding and

## decision-making in relation to jobs, work, and careers.

- 1. Gaining Career Clarity & Direction

Where should you take your career? Where could you and should you go

from where you are right now? What are the best available options for

# you?

Before embarking on a job search or career transition, it’s crucial to

understand your strengths, interests, and values. Gen AI can help guide

## you through self-reﬂection exercises and career exploration.

## HBR / Digital Article / Want to Use AI as a Career Coach? Use These Prompts.

# Sample Prompts:

- I’m unsure about my career path. Can you ask me some reﬂective

questions to help me identify my strengths and interests?

- Can you suggest career options that align with my skills in [list your

## skills] and my interest in [mention industries or ﬁelds]?

- I enjoy problem-solving, creativity, and working with people. What

career paths might ﬁt these interests?

# Personalization Tip:

Provide as much detail as possible about your experiences and

preferences. The more context you give, the more tailored gen AI’s

responses will be.

Consider uploading your resume or CV to gen AI. (Most platforms

enable you to attach Word or PDF ﬁles.) Let the tool review it and

give you feedback on your hard and soft skills, potential, and general

employability. A sample prompt might be: “If I upload my CV, can you

review it and give me an overall assessment of my hard and soft skills,

## and feedback on my potential and employability?”

While the accuracy of the results may be inferior to that of a highly

qualiﬁed human coach (armed with science-based assessments), it is

probably superior to a typical or average coach. In line, academic

reviews have long shown that a low barrier to entry, idiosyncratic

personal factors linked to the coach, and a general lack of training all contribute to making eﬀective, science-based coaching the outlier

# rather than the norm.

- 2. Resume & LinkedIn Optimization

A strong resume and LinkedIn proﬁle are critical to standing out

in a competitive job market. Gen AI can help you craft compelling

application materials, including optimizing your CV for speciﬁc jobs

or careers, and suggesting improvements to your LinkedIn proﬁle. The

goal is not to lie or deceive, but rather to help you ﬁnd the right

tone, style, and approach to maximize the impact of your proﬁle and

## achievements on relevant recruiters and hiring managers.

# Sample Prompts:

- Can you help me write a professional summary for my resume based

# on my experience in [industry/role]?

- Please review my LinkedIn proﬁle [you can paste the link/URL]

## summary and suggest improvements for better engagement.

- How can I quantify my achievements in my resume to make them

# more impactful?

# Personalization Tip:

## Feed gen AI bullet points of your work history and achievements. If

you’re targeting a speciﬁc job, include the job description so it can tailor

responses to the role. If you want gen AI to customize or curate the

messaging tone to reﬂect certain personality or character traits, you

can include that in your prompts, too: “Please re-write this in a tone

that expresses X personality trait [e.g., creativity, conscientiousness,

## curiosity, ambition, emotional intelligence, etc.]”

- 3. Job Search Strategy

A job search can be daunting, but gen AI can assist in making it

structured and strategic. For instance, you could ask AI to help you

identify groups or classes of jobs, or industries that are hiring and

growing, or to reﬁne the initial search of databases by preferences,

location, or ﬁt with your own background and skills.

## HBR / Digital Article / Want to Use AI as a Career Coach? Use These Prompts.

# Sample Prompts:

- What are the best job search strategies for someone in [industry/role]?

- What are the best job or career opportunities available in X area

[include city, country, region, etc.] for someone with my background

# and interests?

- Can you help me craft a personalized networking message to reach out

# to a recruiter on LinkedIn?

- What are some creative ways to ﬁnd job opportunities beyond

# traditional job boards?

# Personalization Tip:

If you have speciﬁc companies in mind, ask gen AI for networking

strategies tailored to them. Also, request advice on how to use LinkedIn,

industry events, and informational interviews to enhance your job

prospects. For example, gen AI can provide tips on how to ﬁnd relevant

contacts and connections; how to get more visibility on social media;

how to curate your LinkedIn feed to get real-time alerts on vacancies;

and how to craft a ﬁrst-time message to a potential employer or

# recruiter.

- 4. Interview Preparation & Salary Negotiation

Interviews can be nerve-wracking, but preparation is key. Gen AI can

simulate interview questions and provide feedback on your answers.

# Sample Prompts:

- Can you conduct a mock interview for a [role] position and provide

feedback on my answers? [Ask follow-up prompts that make gen

AI analyze your answers, suggest better answers, and tell you what

interviewers may make of your and other answers.]

## HBR / Digital Article / Want to Use AI as a Career Coach? Use These Prompts.

- How should I answer the question “Tell me about yourself” in a way

# that highlights my strengths?

- Can you help me craft a response to “What’s your expected salary?” for

# a negotiation?

- What are good questions to ask when interviewers oﬀer me a chance to

ask them questions?

- What are critical do’s and don’ts when it comes to basic interview

# behaviors/etiquette and so on?

# Personalization Tip:

Give gen AI the job description and company name so it can tailor

customized questions. If you have precise information about the

interviewers, feed this background to gen AI so it can make granular

recommendations. For salary negotiation, provide market research data

and your desired range to get more precise advice. If you don’t have this,

prompt gen AI to get this data.

- 5. Leadership & Career Growth

If you’re aiming for career advancement, gen AI can provide guidance

## on leadership skills, workplace visibility, and professional development.

## In most organizations, your career advancement will at some point

require you to manage or lead people and gen AI can give you advice

on how to emerge as a leader.

## HBR / Digital Article / Want to Use AI as a Career Coach? Use These Prompts.

# Sample Prompts:

- What are the key leadership skills I should develop to move into a

# managerial role?

- Can you help me draft an email to request a promotion discussion with

# my manager?

- How can I build executive presence in meetings and presentations?

- What behaviors should I avoid if I’m interested in being perceived as a

# leader?

- Where can I learn more about what it takes to be a good manager?

# Personalization Tip:

Describe your current challenges and workplace dynamics. Gen AI can oﬀer strategies speciﬁc to your industry, role, and corporate culture.

Be speciﬁc about where you think you need to improve vis-à-vis

management and leadership skills. For example, you might say you’re

navigating a fast-paced startup where you’re expected to lead without

formal authority, or that you’re in a legacy organization struggling

to gain traction for innovation. You could point to challenges like

inﬂuencing senior stakeholders, managing burnout on your team, or

developing conﬁdence in high-stakes decision-making settings.

- 6. Personal Branding & Thought Leadership

Establishing yourself as a thought leader can open doors to new

opportunities. Gen AI can assist in content creation, networking, and

brand positioning. In fact, precisely because gen AI can answer every

## possible and imaginable question about any topic better than most

humans, it is key to display some “social proof”, and persuade others

that you are a credible expert or source of knowledge in a given ﬁeld,

which will probably imply that you are also using gen AI, just better

# than most people.

Indeed, AI has redeﬁned the meaning of expertise, which used to be

about knowing the answer to lots of questions, and is now more about

asking the right questions of AI, knowing how to vet AI’s insights on

accuracy and utility (and detect when it is “hallucinating”), and coming

up with a creative story that combines both your own knowledge and

the wisdom you extract from AI. In simple terms, the more you know,

the more you know how to use AI to persuade others that you know!

# Sample Prompts:

- Can you suggest what I could share on social media to establish myself

# as a credible expert in X area?

- How can I structure a professional blog post/newsletter/Substack on

# [topic]?

- What are the best ways to increase my visibility and credibility in my

# industry?

- Help me write an [X number of words] article on [X topic] and provide

## references and sources to follow-up and cross-check.

Note that it is perfectly OK to report that you have prepared your

thoughts and ideas with the support of gen AI. Many people do so, but

few admit it. Second, it will show you are honest and have integrity.

Third, the real value will come not from what everybody else can

produce with gen AI, but from the human touch you provide by

injecting your expertise, experience, and creativity.

# Personalization Tip:

Share your unique insights, experiences, and writing style. For example,

you can record yourself talking about your career history, or write a one-

page summary of your skills and interests, and then get AI to upgrade

and reﬁne that into a compelling story. Gen AI can help reﬁne your

voice and structure your thoughts into compelling narratives. Don’t just

copy-paste what you get, but take the time to edit, reﬁne, curate, and

above all vet and check the info. Errors are common, and your ability to

spot them is itself a strong indicator of expertise.

- 7. Dealing with Everyday Work Problems

Workplaces can be full of challenges—diﬃcult colleagues, unclear

expectations, overwhelming workloads, or miscommunications. Gen AI can help you navigate these issues by oﬀering practical strategies, email

drafts, and structured responses to common workplace dilemmas.

# Sample Prompts:

- My manager constantly checks in on my work and doesn’t trust me

to make decisions. How can I professionally push back and gain more

# autonomy?

- A coworker keeps taking credit for my ideas in meetings. How can I

address this without coming across as confrontational?

- I have a colleague who frequently interrupts me and dismisses my

input. Can you help me craft a diplomatic but ﬁrm way to address this?

- My boss and team expect me to respond to emails late at night and on

weekends. How can I professionally set boundaries without damaging

# my reputation?

- I’m struggling to manage my workload because my manager keeps

piling on more tasks. Can you suggest a polite but eﬀective way to ask

for prioritization or push back?

- I just found out that a colleague with the same role and experience

as me is making more money. How should I bring this up with my

# manager?

- There are cliques and favoritism in my workplace, and I feel like I’m

being left out of important opportunities. How can I improve my

## visibility and position myself for growth?

# Personalization Tip:

When asking gen AI for advice, be speciﬁc about your role, company

culture, and what outcome you’re hoping for. If you need to send a

diﬃcult email, consider sharing a draft and asking for reﬁnements. For particularly tricky conversations, ask gen AI to generate diﬀerent

versions of a response, from assertive to diplomatic, so you can choose

# the best approach.

# Final Thoughts

Gen AI can be a powerful tool for career coaching, oﬀering personalized

advice and practical strategies. Whether you need resume help,

interview practice, or leadership coaching, gen AI can be your 24/7

career companion and thought partner. Try these prompts today and

take proactive steps toward your career goals.

Fundamentally, treat these prompts as simply a guide, and hopefully an

incentive to start practicing and experimenting, which will signiﬁcantly

improve gen AI’s utility and impact for you. They should not be

taken as deﬁnitive or proven solutions to your problems, but rather as

suggestions or tips to equip you with a broader range of alternatives and

# options.

Importantly, in a world in which most people are likely to use gen AI to optimize their career success, the key diﬀerence and advantage will

come not from what AI automates, but from your ability to interact with

AI better than your competitors. It is often said that you’re less likely to

lose your job to AI than to another human who uses AI, especially if you

don’t. This is probably true. Just like it’s true that your unique creativity,

expertise, and experience—not to mention your curiosity and the time

you invest experimenting with AI—will make you a better AI user than

# others.
