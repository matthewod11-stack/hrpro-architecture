Last fall, McKinsey’s “Women in the Workplace” report found that

women continue to face blockers in the transition from entry-level

positions to management roles. The problem — likened to a “broken

rung” on the career ladder — has stunted women’s advancement and

led to a persistent gender gap in senior leadership positions. The trend

is most dire for women of color, who this past year have seen previous

gains slip substantially.

## HBR / Digital Article / It’s Time to Redefine Our Gendered Idea of “Ambition”

As coaches and consultants who support global companies in their

eﬀorts to grow and retain female talent, we know why this is happening.

A male-centric blueprint for ambition pervades the workplace,

imposing a path and pace that are in tension with the multiplicity

of life-stage demands — among them child-rearing, elder care, and

domestic work — that fall disproportionately to women. Those who

are unable or unwilling to submit to this blueprint are disqualiﬁed.

That was the idea that Niraj Shah, the CEO of Wayfair, conveyed to his

employees this past December in a message encouraging them to work

harder and longer. In the now infamous “Wayfair memo,” he wrote, that

employees had to ﬁgure out how to balance hard work with their other

needs. “Everyone deserves to have a great personal life — everyone

manages that in their own way — ambitious people ﬁnd way to blend

and balance the two.”

When women decelerate to establish work-life balance, they are often

perceived as lacking ambition. A switch goes to “oﬀ” in the minds

of their supervisors, who stop including them in important projects,

meetings, and conversations. But those who follow the blueprint are

typically swamped by role overload: They face structural disadvantage

and burnout, struggling to manage their many professional and

personal responsibilities. The rise of “greedy work,” where earnings rise

disproportionately if you agree to work more hours with less ﬂexibility,

has intensiﬁed the dilemma.

It’s at this point, we ﬁnd, that many women take themselves out of

the running for senior leadership positions. As Claudia Goldin’s Nobel

Prize-winning research has shown, greedy work forces heterosexual

couples with children to choose between generating wealth — which

can happen if one member of the couple works long, inﬂexible hours —

and gender equity, where both people choose ﬂexible work.

Women typically make the sacriﬁce for the couple by reverting to

ﬂexible work to serve as primary caregivers for the family. If climbing

the career ladder comes at the expense of a healthy work-life balance,

many women ﬁgure leadership is not worth it. They remain ambitious,

but they can’t or won’t submit to the grind.

Whenever a woman leaves her company because her potential is

ignored, or because the culture only supports a one-size-ﬁts-all

approach to ambition, it’s a loss not only for them but the companies

they work for.

# Changing the Mindset

Until now, the best practice devised by companies that want to combat

this problem has been to oﬀer women ﬂexible hours. That helps, but

only to a degree: No matter when in a given day you work, that day still

only has 24 hours. Women remain bound by the collective expectation

that they will spend more time than men engaged in domestic labor.

What’s necessary to move beyond this impasse is a change in mindset.

What women need from their managers is a ﬂexible approach to growth,

not time. This would require managers to measure ambition diﬀerently.

Rather than interpreting a period of career deceleration as a rejection

of advancement, these intervals would be understood as inevitable and

sometimes desired pivots that allow women to manage a suite of life-

# stage demands.

We’ve observed managers promote a ﬂexible mindset about growth in

# the following ways:

They offer ﬂexibility in pace and path.

Rather than enforcing a binary point of view — you’re either climbing

up the ladder or stepping aside — skillful managers do not equate

pace with potential. They assume talent remains constant and worthy

of development, even when employees have to prioritize ﬂexibility in

the short term, as women so often have to do. In these companies,

opportunities to advance are not ultimatums.

For example, at one Fortune 100 company we support, a senior

executive remained at a middle-management level for eight years while

she was raising her children. Yet the experience she built over this

period gave her deep expertise, relationships, and conﬁdence that led

to rapid advancement when the time was right. Her acceleration came

when she was ready, but her pace did not cost her the opportunity to

grow. She now often tells others that her being able to ﬂex in this way

was critical for both her career and her family.

Rather than penalizing women for lacking stamina or drive, savvy

companies recognize how systemic barriers (such as gendered divisions

of labor at home) can overwhelm women at key moments in their

careers. These companies aﬀord women a sense of agency about when

to accelerate and don’t force them to drive at the same speeds as their

# male colleagues.

They offer development opportunities.

We coached a pregnant mid-level manager from a Fortune 100 company

who had a toddler at home. Her manager wanted to promote her, but

she was hesitant, which seemed to frustrate him. But then she made

clear to him that her hesitation was less about her ambition than her

life circumstances, and he started to understand. His own wife had

battled stereotypes while pregnant, and he didn’t want the same for this

# manager.

So, he came up with alternatives. “I know you can achieve a lot of

things,” he told her. “I don’t want this to be a barrier for you.” He

advised her to be strategic about projects she chose to work on and

encouraged her to turn down certain opportunities as she navigated the

later stages of pregnancy. At the same time, they began to have regular

career conversations, which reassured her that she would be able to

resume climbing the management ladder when she was ready.

They offer recognition.

Companies that nominate women for development programs and select

them for visible assignments with no strings attached can keep women

engaged, allow them to grow, and ensure they feel valued. These

companies do not make the pursuit of promotion a condition of

receiving power and inﬂuence.

At a game studio where leaders are working hard to repair the “broken

rung,” a talented client of ours who has two young children asked

to have her scope reduced. Her supervisor, aware of her value and

potential, agreed — but arranged to keep her on the studio’s leadership

team. A year later, the studio head invited her to be his chief of staﬀ, a

critical role that oﬀered her visible recognition and career growth while

accommodating her need for personal ﬂexibility.

They know one is not enough.

Companies with a smart approach to ﬂexible growth know that high

potential junior women don’t just need to see the women above

them succeeding at work. They also need to see them balancing life’s

gendered demands in a way that shows that it’s possible to manage

both work and family. Such women are role models, and they’re key for

inspiring and retaining women with high-career potential.

Unfortunately, there are few exemplars in this space. This is in part

because of what’s sometimes referred to as “maternal-wall bias,” where

women are perceived as less competent once they become pregnant,

take maternity leave, or ﬂex their schedules. Afraid of triggering this

bias, many women mask their maternal status at work — which

indirectly reinforces the male model of ambition.

A case in point: We coach a woman whose colleague recently told her,

“I realize you never talk about your kids, and that’s really cool.” The

comment hit our client like a ton of bricks. She realized that, in order

to succeed at work, she had calculated that it was easier to connect with

her colleagues if she didn’t talk about her children — a realization that

shocked her.

They offer high-quality feedback.

Women tend to receive less actionable feedback than men from their

supervisors. Less direction from managers means fewer opportunities

to learn, which can sap work of dynamic growth opportunities. As one

of our clients recently told us, “I see feedback as an investment in me,

because my manager sees the potential for me to grow. They’re giving

me feedback because they see that I can do something with it.” Robust

feedback allows women to grow within their roles, even if they have

temporarily stepped oﬀ the promotion track. It is a crucial retention

tool for managers who want to encourage high-performing women with

beneﬁts that are not only practical but psychological.

# Redefine Ambition

What does ambition look like? When we ask our clients about their

ambition, they say they strive to set and achieve challenging goals,

exceed their own and others’ expectations, and pursue leadership roles

that connect them to the power and resources to drive change. A black-

and-white approach to ambition, which measures it in terms of time

and intensity while ignoring women’s wider context, will simply fail to

# leverage key talent and potential.

Additionally, junior women who observe their senior colleagues succeed

by trading away a personal life will come to believe that they must make

the same transaction — and, more concerning, that if they fail to do so,

they’re simply not ambitious.

For far too long, women have had no choice but to submit to this

male blueprint. But smart companies and managers today recognize

that this blueprint thwarts the career advancement and development of

## many high-performing women who over the long term — if properly

supported by a ﬂexible growth mindset — have vital skills and

experience to oﬀer the organizations they serve. These women are

ambitious. They want to advance their careers along a ﬂexible and

sustainable path that takes into account the disproportionate demands that are made on them outside of the oﬃce. It’s time to make it possible

for them to do that.

That’s a change we’ll all beneﬁt from.
