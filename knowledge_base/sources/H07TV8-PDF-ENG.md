Addressing challenges like climate change and biodiversity loss will

require technical innovations. As such, a strong curiosity for unearthing

new approaches is key. But just as crucial is that we are willing, even

eager, to change our beliefs and behaviors accordingly.

# HBR / Digital Article / Businesses Need to Bring Younger Employees into Their Leaders…

Organizations are being hampered on both fronts by their leadership

structures, as those with the most power to drive change may not be

the most eager to do so — and vice versa. A seasoned leader may

favor short-term results over long-term beneﬁts that won’t manifest

during their tenure. Moreover, they may be reluctant to challenge the

mental models or organizational structures that have underpinned

their success. Conversely, younger professionals may be more open to

pursuing new paths leading to long-term payoﬀs, given their longer

career horizons. Yet, they are usually not in the position to eﬀect change

# within their organizations.

As societies around the world continue to age, there are calls for

ﬁrms to increase the age diversity in their workforces and improve

the inclusion of older, more experienced workers. While supporting

this aim, we argue that age diversity also needs to be enhanced

in a diﬀerent way: Aging leadership structures need to involve less

experienced talent in order to rebalance the tensions of experience vs. curiosity and of eﬃcient execution vs. bold exploration. Striving

towards intergenerational leadership can accelerate companies’ eﬀorts

to build a sustainable future—and unlock competitive advantages at the

# same time.

## The Search for New Experience — and New Experience Curves

Leadership in business is currently dominated by the most experienced:

The average age of CEOs of Fortune 500 or S&P 500 companies is 58 —

and rising, with data showing that the average hiring age of CEOs has

increased by around 20% (from 46 to 55 years old) since 2005.

Hiring leaders for their experience is sensible if the future environment

is expected to be similar to that of the past and if the ﬁrm’s main goal is to navigate this stable environment ever more eﬃciently. This

idea is enshrined in business strategy as the experience curve, which

states that costs decline logarithmically as a function of cumulative

# experience.

But in today’s volatile context, experience may be less valuable than

ever, as it becomes outdated quickly. In his book Leading Through

## Disruption, Andrew Liveris, former CEO of Dow Chemical, points out

that the advice he was given by other company leaders in the early

2000s is now mostly obsolete. “The business landscape today is so

foreign from that of two decades ago that ﬁguring out how to deploy

[lessons and skills from the past] needs to be reimagined and retaught,”

he writes.

When circumstances are changing, old paradigms not only become

obsolete — they can obstruct progress precisely when new ideas

and thinking are urgently required. Optimizing the current approach

becomes a path towards obsolescence. Thus, instead of trying to

descend further down their current experience curve, companies

increasingly need to develop an ability to jump to new ones — by

reimagining their businesses.

Research suggests that bringing less experienced people into leadership

roles can help unlock the requisite creativity and ﬂexibility. Age-

diverse leadership teams create cognitive tension that fosters learning.

The younger generation helps brings awareness to a new set of

## important topics, such as environmental and sustainability issues. The

involvement of younger leaders may also counterbalance the tendency

of more experienced ones to lean towards less risky strategies (e.g.,

engaging in fewer deals and investing less in R&D, which is reﬂected in

fewer patent ﬁlings by ﬁrms led by older CEOs). Finally, younger talent

is more (due to a lower aversion to changes in the status quo) and less

likely to be caught in the success trap (i.e., to becoming prisoners of the

assumptions underpinning their historical success).

These factors are reﬂected in ﬁrm-level outcomes: Corporate vitality —

a measure of a ﬁrm’s long-term growth potential, which depends on its

capacity to explore new options and renew its strategy — is negatively

correlated with CEO age (after controlling for ﬁrm age and size, see

below). Moreover, studies show that age-diverse leadership teams are

better positioned to drive the adoption of sustainable business models

and associated with better corporate social responsibility outcomes.

is an argument to be made for rebalancing curiosity and experience in

leadership, and to reverse the aging demographic of leadership at a time

# of tumultuous change.

How, then, can companies increase age diversity in their leadership

# structures?

# Scaling the Fast Track for Young Leaders

Many organizations are already active on this front: They have talent

fast tracks, young innovator awards, or mentoring programs to build up

a pool of potential future leaders. We suggest ﬁrms begin experimenting

## with greater boldness and urgency against this agenda. Below, we

outline a range of potential solutions and what we know about them

# so far.

# Consultation

The least disruptive approach involves more systematically consulting

the next generation in strategic direction-setting. This might take the

form of a shadow board or a young leaders’ council, in which a group

## of non-executive talent partners with senior executives on key strategic

# initiatives or major decisions.

This can help bring new ideas and perspectives to experienced

leaders and help bridge generational gaps. Companies from Gucci to

TotalEnergies have implemented shadow boards of younger employees

to consult on a variety of business topics — and their reports

are positive: For example, Mövenpick Hotels & Resorts had been

considering creating a booking app for their properties, but their

shadow board opposed the idea, stating that customers would balk

at having to download another app or remember another password.

Instead, they suggested developing a mobile-friendly web interface,

saving time and resources.

As Gucci’s CEO Mario Bizzarri puts it, a shadow board’s insights “serves

as a wakeup call for executives.” To make these initiatives successful,

it must be clear that they are a safe space for exploring new ideas.

At the same time, it is crucial that the suggestions are given serious

consideration by being embedded into organizational decision-making.

# Co-Leadership

Firms can also experiment with models in which seasoned and younger

## leaders share accountability and decision-making power. This could

manifest as a co-CEO model, which research shows can yield a positive

## impact on shareholder value — with success dependent on co-leaders

having complementary skills, well-deﬁned responsibilities, and a robust

# mutual commitment.

While formalized multi-generational leadership teams are relatively

rare, there are some noteworthy examples: In 2001, the co-founders

of Google (Larry Page and Sergey Brin, both 28 years old at the time),

convinced Eric Schmidt (then 48 years old), a seasoned technology

executive and former CEO of Novell, to join the ﬁrm. Schmidt became

CEO and chairman, providing what Page and Brin called “adult

supervision,” while the founders took on the roles of presidents

of products and technology, respectively, maintaining signiﬁcant

## decision-making power as key executives and majority owners. This

intergenerational triumvirate setup allowed the innovative prowess of

the co-founders to thrive under the guidance of Schmidt’s experience.

# Vertical Separation

Another route to strengthening the voice of the next generation

involves vertically separating decision-making bodies. One way to

implement this could be a bicameral governance setup, borrowing from

longstanding practices in national governments. This structure would

include a lower chamber whose role it is to propose novel policies, and

an upper chamber, which either approves them or suggests alterations.

Membership in these chambers would reﬂect diﬀerent experience

levels. In one version of this setup, younger leaders could be responsible

for proposing new policies, which would be vetted and reﬁned by the

# more experienced leaders.

This idea has some precedence in the technology sector: Meta’s

Oversight Board functions like an upper chamber, reviewing content

moderation verdicts made within the company and oﬀering policy

recommendations based on case decisions.

For such bold changes to governance structures, deﬁning the scope of

decision-making of the new bodies is crucial, as they run the risk of reducing eﬃciency and speed in decision-making. Experimenting to see

what works is key before expanding the scope and responsibility of such

# bodies.

# Horizontal Separation

A variation of this separation approach that extends beyond governance

would be to construct “temporal business units,” each charged

with developing capabilities or oﬀerings on diﬀerent time horizons,

according to life stage of each business. Senior leadership’s role would

be to weigh and synthesize these diﬀerent perspectives, which might

contradict or synergize with one another.

One illustration of this is Alphabet’s diﬀerentiated approach to machine

learning and AI development. Google is responsible for short-term

improvements to the technology underlying its search algorithm, while

DeepMind is focused on developing an artiﬁcial general intelligence

in the long term — though their breakthroughs may also have more

immediate payoﬀs, as with the recent introduction of the Bard chatbot,

which emerged from a collaboration between both groups.

# Substitution

Most boldly, paving the way for the next generation may also take

the form of creating space for more junior leaders by imposing term

limits, implementing retirement rules or creating new roles for the most

# experienced leaders.

Peter Drucker was in favor of this, writing: “Unless the seniors vacate

top-executive slots, the juniors cannot move up.” More than half of S&P

1,500 companies have put in place mandatory retirement policies for

CEOs and directors based on age, while rules based on tenure remain

rare. These hard rules should be paired with regular performance

assessments and succession planning to take into account speciﬁc

# circumstances.

Finally, enhancing the representation of the next generation can also be

accelerated through instituting compositional targets or rules to ensure

# age diversity in decision-making bodies.

. . .

Businesses play a crucial role in tackling the challenges of our

times, such as climate change. To enhance their eﬀectiveness in this

arena, they must become more curious to develop the innovations we

require, as well as more eager to adapt their behaviors accordingly.

Current leadership structures can hinder this. Striving towards

intergenerational leadership is key to overcoming these issues and

unlocking competitive advantage by enhancing businesses’ capacity for

# renewal.
