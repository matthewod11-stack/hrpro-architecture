The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor standards a(cid:211)ecting full-time and part-time workers in the private sector and in Federal, State, and local governments.

The Wage and Hour Division (WHD) of the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) administers and enforces the FLSA with respect to private employment, State and local government employment, and Federal employees of the Library of Congress, U.S. Postal Service,

Postal Rate Commission, and the Tennessee Valley Authority. The FLSA is enforced by the U.S. O(cid:211)ice of Personnel Management for employees of other Executive Branch agencies, and by the U.S. Congress for covered employees of the Legislative Branch.

Special rules apply to State and local government employment involving fire protection and law enforcement activities, volunteer services, and compensatory time o(cid:211) instead of cash overtime pay.

# Basic Wage Standards

Covered, nonexempt workers are entitled to a minimum wage of $7.25 per hour e(cid:211)ective July 24, 2009. Special provisions apply to workers in American Samoa and the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands. Nonexempt workers must be paid overtime

pay at a rate of not less than one and one-half times their regular rates of pay a(cid:212)er 40 hours of work in a workweek.

# Wages required by the FLSA are due on the regular payday for the pay period covered. Deductions made from wages for such items

# as cash or merchandise shortages, employer-required uniforms, and tools of the trade, are not legal to the extent that they reduce the wages of employees below the minimum rate required by the FLSA or reduce the amount of overtime pay due under the FLSA.

The FLSA contains some exemptions from these basic standards. Some apply to specific types of businesses; others apply to specific kinds of work.

While the FLSA does set basic minimum wage and overtime pay standards and regulates the employment of minors, there are a number of employment practices which the FLSA does not regulate.

For example, the FLSA does not require:

- 1. vacation, holiday, severance, or sick pay;

- 2. meal or rest periods, holidays o(cid:211), or vacations;

- 3. premium pay for weekend or holiday work;

- 4. pay raises or fringe benefits; or

- 5. a discharge notice, reason for discharge, or immediate payment of final wages to terminated employees.

The FLSA does not provide wage payment or collection procedures for an employee’s usual or promised wages or commissions in

excess of those required by the FLSA. However, some States do have laws under which such claims (sometimes including fringe benefits) may be filed.

Also, the FLSA does not limit the number of hours in a day or days in a week an employee may be required or scheduled to work, including overtime hours, if the employee is at least 16 years old.

The above matters are for agreement between the employer and the employees or their authorized representatives.

# Who is Covered?

All employees of certain enterprises having workers engaged in interstate commerce, producing goods for interstate commerce, or

handling, selling, or otherwise working on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for such commerce by any person, are covered by the FLSA.

A covered enterprise is the related activities performed through unified operation or common control by any person or persons for a common business purpose and —

- 1. whose annual gross volume of sales made or business done is not less than $500,000 (exclusive of excise taxes at the retail

level that are separately stated); or

- 2. is engaged in the operation of a hospital, an institution primarily engaged in the care of the sick, the aged, or the mentally ill

who reside on the premises; a school for mentally or physically disabled or gi(cid:212)ed children; a preschool, an elementary or

secondary school, or an institution of higher education (whether operated for profit or not for profit); or

- 3. is an activity of a public agency.

Any enterprise that was covered by the FLSA on March 31, 1990, and that ceased to be covered because of the revised $500,000 test,

continues to be subject to the overtime pay, child labor and recordkeeping provisions of the FLSA.

Employees of firms which are not covered enterprises under the FLSA still may be subject to its minimum wage, overtime pay,

recordkeeping, and child labor provisions if they are individually engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce, or in any closely-related process or occupation directly essential to such production. Such employees include

those who: work in communications or transportation; regularly use the mails, telephones, or telegraph for interstate communication, or keep records of interstate transactions; handle, ship, or receive goods moving in interstate commerce; regularly

cross State lines in the course of employment; or work for independent employers who contract to do clerical, custodial, maintenance, or other work for firms engaged in interstate commerce or in the production of goods for interstate commerce.

Domestic service workers such as day workers, housekeepers, chau(cid:211)eurs, cooks, or full-time babysitters are covered if:

- 1. their cash wages from one employer in calendar year 2010 are at least $1,700 (this calendar year threshold is adjusted by the

Social Security Administration each year); or

2. they work a total of more than 8 hours a week for one or more employers.

# Tipped Employees

Tipped employees are individuals engaged in occupations in which they customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month

in tips. The employer may consider tips as part of wages, but the employer must pay at least $2.13 an hour in direct wages.

The employer who elects to use the tip credit provision must inform the employee in advance and must be able to show that the

employee receives at least the applicable minimum wage (see above) when direct wages and the tip credit allowance are combined. If an employee’s tips combined with the employer’s direct wages of at least $2.13 an hour do not equal the minimum

hourly wage, the employer must make up the di(cid:211)erence. Also, employees must retain all of their tips, except to the extent that they participate in a valid tip pooling or sharing arrangement.

# Back to Top

# Employer-Furnished Facilities

The reasonable cost or fair value of board, lodging, or other facilities customarily furnished by the employer for the employee’s benefit may be considered part of wages.

# Back to Top

# Industrial Homework

The performance of certain types of work in an employee’s home is prohibited under the law unless the employer has obtained

prior certification from DOL. Restrictions apply in the manufacture of knitted outerwear, gloves and mittens, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs, embroideries, and jewelry (where safety and health hazards are not involved). The manufacture of women’s apparel

(and jewelry under hazardous conditions) is generally prohibited. If you have questions on whether a certain type of work is restricted, or who is eligible for a homework certificate, or how to obtain a certificate, you may contact the local WHD o(cid:211)ice.

# Back to Top

# Subminimum Wage Provisions

The FLSA provides for the employment of certain individuals at wage rates below the statutory minimum. Such individuals include student-learners (vocational education students), as well as full-time students in retail or service establishments, agriculture, or

institutions of higher education. Also included are individuals whose earning or productive capacity is impaired by a physical or mental disability, including those related to age or injury, for the work to be performed. Employment at less than the minimum

wage is authorized to prevent curtailment of opportunities for employment. Such employment is permitted only under certificates issued by WHD.

# Back to Top

# Youth Minimum Wage

A minimum wage of not less than $4.25 an hour is permitted for employees under 20 years of age during their first 90 consecutive

calendar days of employment with an employer. Employers are prohi-bited from taking any action to displace employees in order to hire employees at the youth minimum wage. Also prohibited are partial displacements such as reducing employees’ hours,

# wages, or employment benefits.

# Some employees are exempt from the overtime pay provisions or both the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions.

Because exemptions are generally narrowly defined under the FLSA, an employer should carefully check the exact terms and conditions for each. Detailed information is available from local WHD o(cid:211)ices.

Following are examples of exemptions which are illustrative, but not all-inclusive. These examples do not define the conditions for each exemption.

## Exemptions from Both Minimum Wage and Overtime Pay

- 1. Executive, administrative, and professional employees (including teachers and academic administrative personnel in

elementary and secondary schools), outside sales employees, and employees in certain computer-related occupations (as

defined in DOL regulations);

- 2. Employees of certain seasonal amusement or recreational establishments, employees of certain small newspapers, seamen

employed on foreign vessels, employees engaged in fishing operations, and employees engaged in newspaper delivery;

- 3. Farmworkers employed by anyone who used no more than 500 “man-days” of farm labor in any calendar quarter of the

preceding calendar year;

- 4. Casual babysitters and persons employed as companions to the elderly or infirm.

# Exemptions from Overtime Pay Only

- 1. Certain commissioned employees of retail or service establishments; auto, truck, trailer, farm implement, boat, or aircra(cid:212)

sales-workers; or parts-clerks and mechanics servicing autos, trucks, or farm implements, who are employed by non-

manufacturing establishments primarily engaged in selling these items to ultimate purchasers;

- 2. Employees of railroads and air carriers, taxi drivers, certain employees of motor carriers, seamen on American vessels, and

local delivery employees paid on approved trip rate plans;

- 3. Announcers, news editors, and chief engineers of certain non-metropolitan broadcasting stations;

- 4. Domestic service workers living in the employer’s residence;

- 5. Employees of motion picture theaters; and

# Partial Exemptions from Overtime Pay

- 1. Partial overtime pay exemptions apply to employees engaged in certain operations on agricultural commodities and to

## employees of certain bulk petroleum distributors.

- 2. Hospitals and residential care establishments may adopt, by agreement with their employees, a 14-day work period instead

of the usual 7-day workweek if the employees are paid at least time and one-half their regular rates for hours worked over 8

in a day or 80 in a 14-day work period, whichever is the greater number of overtime hours.

- 3. Employees who lack a high school diploma, or who have not attained the educational level of the 8th grade, can be required

to spend up to 10 hours in a workweek engaged in remedial reading or training in other basic skills without receiving time

and one-half overtime pay for these hours. However, the employees must receive their normal wages for hours spent in such

training and the training must not be job specific.

- 4. Public agency fire departments and police departments may establish a work period ranging from 7 to 28 days in which

overtime need only be paid a(cid:212)er a specified number of hours in each work period.

The FLSA child labor provisions are designed to protect the educational opportunities of minors and prohibit their employment in jobs and under conditions detrimental to their health or well-being. The provisions include restrictions on hours of work for minors

under 16 and lists of hazardous occupations orders for both farm and non-farm jobs declared by the Secretary of Labor to be too dangerous for minors to perform. Further information on prohibited occupations is available from

# Regulations governing child labor in non-farm jobs di(cid:211)er somewhat from those pertaining to agricultural employment. In non-farm

work, the permissible jobs and hours of work, by age, are as follows:

- 1. Youths 18 years or older may perform any job, whether hazardous or not, for unlimited hours;

- 2. Minors 16 and 17 years old may perform any nonhazardous job, for unlimited hours; and

- 3. Minors 14 and 15 years old may work outside school hours in various nonmanufacturing, nonmining, nonhazardous jobs

under the following conditions: no more than 3 hours on a school day, 18 hours in a school week, 8 hours on a non-school

day, or 40 hours in a non-school week. Also, work may not begin before 7 a.m., nor end a(cid:212)er 7 p.m., except from June 1

through Labor Day, when evening hours are extended to 9 p.m. Under a special provision, youths 14 and 15 years old

enrolled in an approved Work Experience and Career Exploration Program (WECEP) may be employed for up to 23 hours in

school weeks and 3 hours on school days (including during school hours). In addition, academically oriented youths enrolled

in an approved Work-Study Program (WSP) may be employed during school hours.

Fourteen is the minimum age for most non-farm work. However, at any age, minors may deliver newspapers; perform in radio, television, movie, or theatrical productions; work for parents in their solely-owned non-farm business (except in mining,

manufacturing or on hazardous jobs); or gather evergreens and make evergreen wreaths.

# Back to Top

In farm work, permissible jobs and hours of work, by age, are as follows:

- 1. Minors 16 years and older may perform any job, whether hazardous or not, for unlimited hours;

- 2. Minors 14 and 15 years old may perform any nonhazardous farm job outside of school hours;

- 3. Minors 12 and 13 years old may work outside of school hours in nonhazardous jobs, either with a parent’s written consent or

# on the same farm as the parent(s);

- 4. Minors under 12 years old may perform jobs on farms owned or operated by parent(s), or with a parent’s written consent,

outside of school hours in nonhazardous jobs on farms not covered by minimum wage requirements.

Minors of any age may be employed by their parents in any occupation on a farm owned or operated by their parents.

# Back to Top

# Recordkeeping

The FLSA requires employers to keep records on wages, hours, and other items, as specified in DOL recordkeeping regulations. Most

of the information is of the kind generally maintained by employers in ordinary business practice and in compliance with other laws and regulations. The records do not have to be kept in any particular form and time clocks need not be used. With respect to an

employee subject to the minimum wage provisions or both the minimum wage and overtime pay provisions, the following records must be kept:

- 1. personal information, including employee’s name, home address, occupation, sex, and birth date if under 19 years of age;

- 2. hour and day when workweek begins;

- 3. total hours worked each workday and each workweek;

- 4. total daily or weekly straight-time earnings;

- 5. regular hourly pay rate for any week when overtime is worked;

- 6. total overtime pay for the workweek;

- 7. deductions from or additions to wages;

- 8. total wages paid each pay period; and

- 9. date of payment and pay period covered.

Records required for exempt employees di(cid:211)er from those for nonexempt workers. Special information is required for homeworkers, for employees working under uncommon pay arrangements, for employees to whom lodging or other facilities are furnished, and

for employees receiving remedial education.

# Nursing Employees

Under the FLSA, most nursing employees have the right to reasonable break time and a private place to pump breast milk for their

nursing child. This right is available each time the employee needs to pump for one year a(cid:212)er her nursing child’s birth. An employer may not deny a covered employee a needed break to pump.

Employers must provide a reasonable amount of break time to pump milk as frequently as needed by the nursing employee. The frequency and duration of breaks needed to pump will likely vary depending on factors related to the nursing employee and the

# child.

Employees are entitled to a place to pump, other than a bathroom, that is shielded from view and free from intrusion from

coworkers and the public. The location provided must be functional as a space for pumping. If the space is not dedicated to the nursing employee’s use, it must be available when needed. A space temporarily created or converted into a space for pumping at

work or made available when needed by the nursing employee is su(cid:211)icient provided that the space is shielded from view, and free from any intrusion from coworkers and the public. A bathroom, even if private, is not a permissible location under the Act.

Certain employees of airlines, railroads, and motorcoach carriers are exempt from the pump at work protections of the FLSA. Employees who are exempted may be entitled to break time and/or space protections under State or local laws.

Employers with fewer than 50 employees are not subject to the FLSA pump at work requirements if compliance with the provision would impose an undue hardship (although State or local laws may still apply). Whether compliance would be an undue hardship is

determined by looking at the di(cid:211)iculty or expense of compliance for a specific employer in comparison to the size, financial resources, nature, and structure of the employer’s business. All employees who work for the covered employer, regardless of work

site, are counted when determining whether this exemption may apply.

Reasonable break time to pump is generally not compensable unless otherwise required by Federal, State, or local law. For

instance, the FLSA requires compensation for all hours worked and break time to pump will be considered hours worked if an employee is not completely relieved from duty during the entirety of the break. When employers provide paid breaks, an employee

who uses that break time to pump must be compensated for that break time. Also, in most cases, the FLSA will require that employers may not reduce exempt employees’ salaries to reflect pump breaks.

Employees may have greater protections under State or local worker protection laws. The FLSA does not preempt State or local laws that provide greater protections to employees - for example, providing compensated break time or providing break time

beyond one year a(cid:212)er the child’s birth.

Workweek - A workweek is a period of 168 hours during 7 consecutive 24-hour periods. It may begin on any day of the week and at any hour of the day established by the employer. Generally, for purposes of minimum wage and overtime payment, each workweek stands alone; there can be no averaging of 2 or more workweeks. Employee coverage, compliance with wage payment

requirements, and the application of most exemptions are determined on a workweek basis.

Hours Worked - Covered employees must be paid for all hours worked in a workweek. In general, “hours worked” includes all time an employee must be on duty, or on the employer’s premises or at any other prescribed place of work, from the beginning of the first principal activity of the work day to the end of the last principal work activity of the workday. Also included is any additional

time the employee is allowed (i.e., su(cid:211)ered or permitted) to work.

# Back to Top

# Computing Overtime Pay

Overtime must be paid at a rate of at least one and one-half times the employee’s regular rate of pay for each hour worked in a workweek in excess of the maximum allowable in a given type of employment. Generally, the regular rate includes all payments

made by the employer to or on behalf of the employee (except for certain statutory exclusions). The following examples are based

## on a maximum 40-hour workweek applicable to most covered nonexempt employees.

# 1. Hourly rate (regular pay rate for an employee paid by the hour) - If more than 40 hours are worked, at least one and one-half

times the regular rate for each hour over 40 is due.

Example: An employee paid $8.00 an hour works 44 hours in a workweek. The employee is entitled to at least one and one- half times $8.00, or $12.00, for each hour over 40. Pay for the week would be $320 for the first 40 hours, plus $48.00 for the

## four hours of overtime - a total of $368.00.

- 2. Piece rate - The regular rate of pay for an employee paid on a piecework basis is obtained by dividing the total weekly

earnings by the total number of hours worked in that week. The employee is entitled to an additional one-half times this

## regular rate for each hour over 40, plus the full piecework earnings.

Example: An employee paid on a piecework basis works 45 hours in a week and earns $405. The regular rate of pay for that week is $405 divided by 45, or $9.00 an hour. In addition to the straight-time pay, the employee is also entitled to $4.50 (half

the regular rate) for each hour over 40 - an additional $22.50 for the 5 overtime hours - for a total of $427.50.

Another way to compensate pieceworkers for overtime, if agreed to before the work is performed, is to pay one and one-half

times the piece rate for each piece produced during the overtime hours. The piece rate must be the one actually paid during

nonovertime hours and must be enough to yield at least the minimum wage per hour.

- 3. Salary - The regular rate for an employee paid a salary for a regular or specified number of hours a week is obtained by

dividing the salary by the number of hours for which the salary is intended to compensate. The employee is entitled to an

additional one-half times this regular rate for each hour over 40, plus the salary.

If, under the employment agreement, a salary su(cid:211)icient to meet the minimum wage requirement in every workweek is paid as straight time for whatever number of hours are worked in a workweek, the regular rate is obtained by dividing the salary by the

number of hours worked each week. To illustrate, suppose an employee’s hours of work vary each week and the agreement with the employer is that the employee will be paid $480 a week for whatever number of hours of work are required. Under this

agreement, the regular rate will vary in overtime weeks. If the employee works 50 hours, the regular rate is $9.60 ($480 divided by 50 hours). In addition to the salary, half the regular rate, or $4.80, is due for each of the 10 overtime hours, for a total of $528 for the

week. If the employee works 60 hours, the regular rate is $8.00 ($480 divided by 60 hours). In that case, an additional $4.00 is due for each of the 20 overtime hours for a total of $560 for the week.

In no case may the regular rate be less than the minimum wage required by the FLSA.

If a salary is paid on other than a weekly basis, the weekly pay must be determined in order to compute the regular rate and

overtime pay. If the salary is for a half month, it must be multiplied by 24 and the product divided by 52 weeks to get the weekly equivalent. A monthly salary should be multiplied by 12 and the product divided by 52.

# Back to Top

# Enforcement Through Investigation

WHD enforcement of the FLSA is carried out by investigators stationed across the country. As WHD authorized representatives, they conduct investigations and gather data on wages, hours, and other employment conditions in order to determine compliance with

the law regardless of workers’ immigration status. Where violations are found, they will recommend changes in employment practices in employment practices to bring an employer into compliance.

The FLSA allows the Department of Labor (“Department”) or an employee to recover back wages and an equal amount in liquidated damages where minimum wage and overtime violations exist. Generally, a 2-year statute of limitations applies to the recovery of

back wages and liquidated damages. A 3-year statute of limitations applies in cases involving willful violations.

Remedies may be recovered through administrative procedures, litigation, and/or criminal prosecution.

The Department is authorized to supervise the payment of unpaid minimum wages and/ or unpaid overtime compensation

owed to any employee(s).

Civil money penalties may be assessed for child labor violations and for repeat and/or willful violations of FLSA minimum

wage or overtime requirements.

In accordance with the provisions of the SBREFA, the Small Business Administration established a National Small Business and

Agriculture Regulatory Ombudsman and 10 Regional Fairness Boards to receive comments from small entities about federal agency enforcement actions. The Ombudsman annually evaluates enforcement activities and rates each agency’s responsiveness to small

entities. Small entities wishing to comment on WHD enforcement activities may call 1-888-REG-FAIR (1-888-734-3247), or write the O(cid:211)ice of the National Ombudsman, U.S. Small Business Administration, 409 3rd Street, SW, MC2120, Washington, DC 20416-0005, or

visit the Ombudsman’s internet website, www.sba.gov/ombudsman/.

The right to file a comment with the Ombudsman is in addition to any other rights a small entity may have, including the right to

contest the assessment of a civil money penalty. Filing a comment with the Ombudsman neither extends the maximum time period for contesting the assessment of a penalty, nor takes the place of filing the response required to secure an administrative hearing

on a penalty. WHD does not consider filing of a comment with the Ombudsman as a factor in determining how to resolve issues raised during a compliance action.
