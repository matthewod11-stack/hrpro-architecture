It’s been less than three years since OpenAI introduced ChatGPT, but

the technology has already begun to transform work. Tasks that once

consumed large parts of many employees’ days can now be done more

# quickly—and in some cases automatically.

Now researchers are focusing their attention up the org chart and

asking a related question: How will gen AI change the work of middle

# managers?

## HBR / Magazine Article / How AI Is Redefining Managerial Roles

A research team led by Harvard Business School professor Manuel

Hoﬀmann wanted to understand how people use gen AI, and the team’s

conclusions suggest the technology is helping individual contributors

take on tasks once done by managers. From 2022 to 2024, the

researchers studied 50,032 global software developers, of whom half

used GitHub Copilot, an open-source gen AI code-writing system.

Copilot is mainly used by programmers to generate code snippets,

helping them write code faster, solve problems more quickly, and learn

on their own. Hoﬀmann and his colleagues observed more than 2.4

million actions taken on the platform, which they grouped into two

categories: core work (coding) and managerial work.

“Studying developers and how they used GitHub provided us with really

detailed information about their work,” Hoﬀmann says. “This allowed

us to follow their activity with precision and granularity to determine if

gen AI was really changing how they work, and in what way.”

They found that having access to Copilot caused people to shift task

## allocation toward their core work and away from project management

activities. Coding activities as a percentage of all work activity increased

by 5%, while project management as a percentage of all activity dropped

## by 10%. Hoﬀmann’s team identiﬁed two underlying mechanisms

driving this shift. First, using gen AI allowed coders to work more

autonomously, and because they were collaborating less, it reduced the

need for them or their managers to coordinate tasks or projects with

others. Second, because the new tool let them write code more quickly,

developers could increase the time they spent on exploration activities,

such as learning or trying something new.

The authors believe these ﬁndings can help companies ﬂatten their

reporting structure. What do they mean by that? They don’t suggest

companies will eliminate middle managers altogether, but they do

believe AI will allow ﬁrms to reduce the number of people in these roles.

For the middle managers who remain, the technology will reduce the

time they spend coordinating and supervising workers or serving as a

liaison between lower and upper management—that is, typical middle

manager work. As gen AI becomes better at scheduling, coordinating,

and checking quality, the remaining managers should be free to do more

valuable work, including pitching in on the hands-on tasks typically

done by individual contributors (in a software environment, this might

be coding). They should also have more time to investigate process

## improvements or experiment with new products.

But maximizing AI’s potential in this manner requires more than

updating the org chart. To ﬂatten a company’s hierarchy, or simply

free middle managers from some project management responsibility,

companies must address two critical questions: What do we automate

and who are we beneﬁting?

Determine what to automate. Although the GitHub Copilot example

focuses solely on coders and their managers, any company can use

gen AI to free middle managers from their traditional tasks. The key is

determining which tasks are ripe for automation and which should be

conducted manually.

But before you decide which tasks to automate, Hoﬀmann recommends

doing what his team did when they started the GitHub study. They

cataloged every task they observed as either a project management task

or a coding task. Any company, no matter the product or industry, can

audit their tasks in this manner. Once you’re done, you’ll be able to

rethink which tasks could shift from middle managers to gen AI.

During the study, Hoﬀmann and his team observed a distinction

between coders who used gen AI and those who didn’t. The gen AI

group was less likely to ask managers or peers for help. That’s not all.

For nearly all activities, in both core work and project management,

developers who used Copilot worked in smaller groups than those who

didn’t. A similar experiment can beneﬁt most companies. Observe how

your team uses gen AI and ﬁnd areas where it can increase autonomy.

“Gen AI can, in some instances, replace a manager, mentor, or any other

individual that junior employees may ask for help,” Hoﬀmann says.

“Managers don’t always have time for people. And their teams don’t

always have the bandwidth to meet in very large groups. But with gen

AI, people can ﬁgure things out by themselves without the need for that

extra layer of management.”

Determine who beneﬁts the most. Hoﬀmann’s team made another

critical observation: Coders who were less skilled than their peers

beneﬁted more from gen AI. This occurred partly because they were

more likely to conduct coding activities and less likely to conduct

project management activities than high-ability developers were. Past

research has shown that people tend to trust their own knowledge and

experience more than an AI system’s. In other words, the less you know

about a topic, the more likely you are to rely on AI’s expertise.

Hoﬀmann views this as a major opportunity for companies to relieve

middle managers from the burden of having to upskill low performers,

among other beneﬁts. Because low performers can now use gen AI to

instantly learn and improve on their own, managers can focus their

time on more-important, hands-on work. This represents hours saved

for each manager for each low-performing individual. It also represents

added hours of productivity for everyone involved. This information

can help middle managers better understand their employees’ strengths

and weaknesses. Do low performers understand what work they need

to do and the quality that is expected, for example? What knowledge

do high performers have that can be shared with lower-skilled workers?

Armed with this knowledge, middle managers can better determine

why employees are struggling. They can then help employees develop

methods to autonomously use gen AI to improve.

You shouldn’t focus solely on low performers. Gen AI oﬀers ample

opportunity for employees of all skill levels to improve at a wide variety

of tasks. Although Hoﬀmann’s research focused solely on coding,

observing how both high and low performers use gen AI—no matter

## the ﬁeld—will present additional opportunities for improvement and

hierarchy ﬂattening. But if you don’t speak to people and learn what

they’re doing, you’ll never know which knowledge and skills can be

transferred across your entire team or workforce. And you’ll never know

which tasks you can relieve your middle managers from having to

# perform.

“We will likely see an increase in agility in companies that use gen AI,”

Hoﬀmann says. “This will lead to the ﬂattening of corporate hierarchies,

which will help streamline productivity and reduce the need for so

# many middle management tasks.”

Has gen AI helped flatten your

# organizational structure?

I think we were already on a path to

flattening. Society is shifting to a skills-

based workforce. We are beginning to

# define someone’s contribution by their

skill set, by the value they create, and

less so by their role. Because AI can

# serve as a helper, a mentor, a creative

## partner, or an information source, anyone

# Lexey Swall

can contribute at a higher level, which

is blurring the lines between middle

# manager and associate tasks.

Does this mean associates are doing what managers used to do?

In some ways, yes. My expectations of associates have skyrocketed.

Because of AI, an associate should be able to show up prepared for a

meeting or a strategic conversation the way a manager or above used to.

Can you offer an example?

Our projects typically start with a discovery process. We go to the client

and ask them questions to try to understand how they work and what

their status is. Associates used to compile the information, review it, and

recommend what to do with it. Today, gen AI helps them do this in three

hours when it used to take five. They’ve gained two hours. My highest

performers use that time to upskill. They offer to do things a middle

manager does. They focus on harder, more advanced stuff. They take on

more work, or they shift their focus to more strategic work. How they decide

to repurpose their time is something I pay close attention to.

Have some middle managers taken on executive-level work?

Absolutely. Here’s one example: So many of my conversations are about

designing a solution to a problem. We’ve got to strategize to design a fix.

Typically, we fix things based on our own standard methodology. Each

problem has a different methodology for fixing it. The expectation used to

be that a middle manager was an expert on the methodology. But now,

when you bring gen AI into the mix, you can train it to master and explain

the methodology to anyone. People can read about the methodology, ask

gen AI about it, and come to a strategy meeting already knowledgeable.

This frees middle managers to execute on the methodology by speaking

directly to clients. They’re spending less time learning and teaching

the methodology, and more time linking the methodology to the client’s

# problem.

Have you met resistance from middle managers? Do they feel

threatened by AI’s capabilities?

We’ve made great strides, but we still have a percentage of people who are

resistant. I would like to think I’ve created a safe space for people to explain

why. Rather than have them hide it, it gives me the opportunity to speak to

them about their fears. I tell them that AI can’t do one of the most critical

aspects of their job. They know how to speak to our clients. They can read

between the lines, and help others articulate a problem, and explain what

they need to solve it. These are human-centric conversations AI can’t have

today. And they were conversations middle managers seldom had time to

have before.
