We’ve all been there: We’re talking to someone and then realize they’re

not actually listening to us. Sometimes it’s obvious, like when someone

is scrolling through their phone while you’re speaking. Other times,

it’s more subtle, such as a phone call where the only response is an

# absent-minded “uh-huh.”

One of the highest forms of respect we can show to someone is to give

them our undivided attention. But that’s getting harder and harder to

## do. With notiﬁcations from smart phones, physical taps from smart

watches, and the random thoughts that pop into our heads, it’s a

challenge to stay focused.

I’ll never forget a business lunch with a mentor. We went to a popular

Harvard Square restaurant frequented by many of our colleagues.

Having spent over 15 years in the Harvard community, I knew many of

the other guests as well as the general manager of the restaurant. While I

loved smiling and saying hello to many of my colleagues as they passed

by, my mentor made a comment that we should probably go somewhere

else for the next lunch so that I could focus on our conversation. The

feedback hurt, but it was valid.

So what do you do when someone isn’t really paying attention to you?

Great conversations have a natural rhythm, and it takes both parties to

intentionally create that rhythm.

Here are a few steps to get back in sync with your counterpart.

Take a step back.

When someone isn’t listening to you, mentally take a step back during

## the conversation. Ronald Heifetz, author and senior lecturer at the

Harvard Kennedy School, talks about getting oﬀ the dance ﬂoor and

going “onto the balcony.” This is a metaphor for stepping back from

the immediate situation so you can look at it as an objective observer,

identify patterns, and strategically ask yourself what’s going on.

I call this moment “pause and breathe”—a quick mental reset. It can be

as simple as taking a sip of water, gathering your thoughts, and deciding

# on your next move.

# Assume positive intent.

While it’s tempting to take the situation personally, it’s important to

## assume positive intent on behalf of the listener.

Consider whether your approach might be contributing to their

disengagement. Ask yourself if you’ve been speaking for a long time

without letting the other person get a word in. Alison Wood Brooks,

## professor at Harvard Business School and author of the new book Talk:

The Science of Conversation and the Art of Being Ourselves, coined a term

for people who don’t ask questions in a conversation. She calls them

## “ZQs” or “Zero Questioners” and talks about the important balance of

speaking versus listening in a conversation.

So maybe it’s you. But maybe it’s not you. It’s easy to assume we’re

the cause of someone’s distraction, but often, external factors are at

play. Think about what you know about this person. Is something going

on in this person’s life? Are they facing a lot of pressure inside or outside

of work? Their distraction might have nothing to do with you. Give them

the beneﬁt of the doubt before responding.

# Ask them a question.

The next step is to actively re-engage your counterpart. Asking a direct

question is the easiest way to capture the attention of someone who

seems distracted.

Try using their name and asking an open-ended question, such as:

“How have you handled this before?” or “What do you think?” These

kinds of open-ended questions require more than just a “yes” or “no”

answer, making your counterpart more likely to respond at length.

Once they respond, keep them engaged by asking a follow-up question.

The most powerful follow-up question I like to ask is “Can you tell me

more?” This type of question can elicit rich responses to your initial

query, and also puts the onus on the other person to ﬁll in the blanks.

Sometimes we are too quick to listen to a question and then move on

to a diﬀerent topic, so take time to truly focus on your counterpart’s

response before moving on to something else.

If your counterpart is truly ignoring you, you can gently ask, “Hey, is

everything okay? You seem distracted and I want to make sure nothing’s

going on.” Remember, positive intent is important so it doesn’t feel like

you’re attacking them.

Change the rhythm.

If the rhythm of the conversation is feeling oﬀ-tempo, you have a few

other options for changing it up.

You could stop talking and let silence do the work. Eventually your

counterpart will look back at you, then you can smile and ask them one

of the above questions to continue the conversation.

Sometimes a physical reset can help refocus the conversation. Shifting

your physical position can reset engagement, particularly in long

meetings or casual one-on-one discussions. If you’ve been seated, move

to stand up. If you’ve been standing, say something like, “Why don’t we

sit down?”

The best communicators aren’t just great speakers—they’re also great

listeners who know how to bring others back into the conversation.

. . .

In a world ﬁlled with distractions, we need to master the art of capturing

and keeping people’s attention. We have a number of verbal and

nonverbal tools at our disposal. And small shifts—both in mindset and
