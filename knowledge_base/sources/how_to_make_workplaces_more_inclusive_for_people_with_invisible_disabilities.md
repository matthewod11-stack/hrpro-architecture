moreGlobally,

one billion people live with a disability. To put that intoperspective, that’s one person out of every seven. While somedisabilities are visible, others — including chronic illnesses, food(or other) allergies, eating disorders, and mental health issues,among other conditions — are not obvious to onlookers.

# U.S., at least

10% of the country has a medical condition thatcould be considered an invisible disability.

Research shows that 88% of employees with invisible disabilitieschoose not to disclose it at work to avoid stigma anddiscrimination. Those who do open up about long-term invisibledisabilities are often

socially isolated, resulting in lower moraleand reduced productivity.To understand the needs of people with long-term invisibledisabilities, we conducted a seven-year study across Europe andthe U.S. with 58 professionals with invisible disabilities acrossvarious industries. We also interviewed 19 HR professionals togain insights into the feasibility and challenges of implementingsome of the recommendations that emerged through the survey.Our study confirmed that people with invisible disabilities oftenfeel excluded at work, and are likely to receive fewer benefits oraccess to training and advancement. This can lead to physical andpsychological distress, putting them at risk of social exclusion,poor well-being, and decreased job performance. We also foundthat employers lack awareness about the needs of people withinvisible disabilities and are often ill-prepared to provide thenecessary support and accommodations. Employees withinvisible disabilities may struggle in silence, feel unsupported,and be misunderstood.There is a real opportunity for new and first-time leaders to drivechange within organizations by increasing their awareness andpracticing more vulnerable and empathetic leadership.

manager, you can create a space in which people feel saferdisclosing and asking for what they need. You can encouragediversity and ensure that differences are valued — rather thanfeared — on your team.Based on the findings in our study, we recommend some practicesfor new managers to create a more inclusive workplace.1) Don’t generalize disabilities.It’s common for non-disabled people to misunderstand what itmeans to live with a specific condition. The reality is that twopeople with the same disability may have very differentexperiences. For instance, two colleagues who both have chronicmigraines might have different triggers or discomforts. Similarly,a generalized anxiety disorder can

include a variety of symptomsthat show up and manifest in entirely different ways dependingon the person.This means your knowledge of a disability and what it looks orfeels like may not correspond to your colleague’s experience of thecondition. Don’t debate them on this point. Making assumptionsabout someone’s abilities can cloud your judgment and result inunconscious bias or microaggressions. As a leader, your role inthis scenario is to listen. Spend time understanding whatsymptoms show up for your team members and when, how thosesymptoms impact their work, and what you can do to supportthem.Our research found that managers that were empathetic, patient,and willing to listen to their team member’s experiences andaccommodate their requests were more successful leaders. Theirteams reported a 63% increase in well-being and 71% increase inengagement compared to the average.

When you approach sensitive conversations about health from aplace of curiosity, it creates a safe environment for people to openup about their disabilities. Active listening can help you payattention to the experiences of others and build trust with yourteam members. If you’re unaware of a particular condition, don’thesitate to ask where you can find more information. You can alsodo your research online to avoid placing the burden of educationon your team members. These actions show genuine care on yourpart and will help your team members perform to the best of theirabilities.2) Figure out how to help your team member succeed intheir role. Our research found that creating a broad policy around disabilitywithout understanding an individual’s specific needs does notwork. Employees with disabilities may feel stigmatized by anumbrella policy that categorizes them in ways they don’t identifywith. Their requirements may not be met by the accommodationsoffered.Consequently, it’s important to have a more personalizedapproach, one that is tailored to each employee’s needs andensures that they can access the right resources. The best way tofigure this out is to ask your team members whataccommodations would be helpful for them.Our research found that when managers used language thatlinked an individual’s needs or accommodations to theirperformance and success at work, it helped employees voice theirconcerns more freely. When managers used phrases such as “Howdo I set you up for success?” or “What can I, as a manager, do tosupport you to perform your best?” they were seen as 92% moreapproachable by their team members. For instance, if your teammember asks for a quiet space to work in, or flexible working

hours on certain days to manage doctor appointments, look forways to make it happen. If you need to speak with your bossbefore approving a request, let your team member know thatyou’ll get back to them, and make sure you follow up as soon aspossible.In general, make it a habit to check in on all of your employees’wellbeing from time to time. During one-on-ones, you could saysomething like, “How have you been doing this quarter? I want tomake sure you have all the resources you need to be successful atwork. Can you tell me what support or accommodations youmight need?”Finally, if your team member requests your confidentiality,respect their decision, and do not push them to open up ordisclose their health conditions with others. Let them know thatevery conversation you have with them will be private, and willnot be shared with the wider team unless they wish to open upthemselves. If you’re obligated to inform HR per your companypolicy, let your team member know.3) Advocate for inclusive policies and practices. If your company lacks a policy surrounding disabilities andaccommodations, an important part of your job as a manager is toadvocate for one or to make your current policies more inclusive.While this may seem challenging as a middle manager, you canbegin by sharing your ideas and suggestions with your boss or theleadership team. You now have the (positional) power to bringnew ideas to the table.Set up a meeting with your boss to discuss some ways to prioritizeinclusion within your company and share what you learnedthrough your conversations with your team members.

more flexible work policies, employee resource groups (ERGs), orcaptioning or sign-language translations during importantcompany calls and events. Just remember to respect individuals’privacy as requested.In our research, we found organizations that adopted inclusioninitiatives, such as those listed above, reported a 26% increase inproductivity. Another idea is to hire an inclusion advocate orconsultant to help audit your company’s policies, conductsensitization workshops, and suggest changes. When companiesdo that, employee wellbeing is likely to increase by 45%,according to our research.Whatever your suggestion may be, advocating for changes thatmake it easier for people with disabilities to succeed can go a longway toward creating an inclusive workplace. 4) Avoid centering activities around food.Food is vital to the contemporary workplace, whether it’s officeparties, birthday celebrations, or lunch options within thecompany. It fuels long days, networking events, and happy hours;it can help build camaraderie, foster belongingness, and breakbarriers between workers’ formal and informal lives. But foremployees with food allergies,

the workplace can be a minefield.Nearly 60% of millennials with food allergies

report experiencing

anxiety at work because of their condition. In addition, a study bythe Asthma and Allergy Foundation of America found thatonly

17% of employers are very knowledgeable about food

allergies. This leaves many workforces in the dark about theircolleagues’ needs and how to accommodate them.As a manager, do not leave it up to your employees to explain theconsequences of food intolerances on their own. Symptoms of

food intolerance are often very personal, and employees mightthink twice before volunteering information that can leave themvulnerable to stigma or ridicule at work. Managers who open upconversations about food allergies on their team before animportant gathering or event were found to be 72% moreapproachable than their peers.When planning office parties, include someone with foodintolerances in the organizing group so you can create a moreinclusive menu. You can also use creative ways to organize eventsaround food. For instance, set up a potluck and ask everyone tobring one dish that helps you learn a little bit about them. Doingso can help your team members feel comfortable opening upabout their intolerances or allergies, and make it easier for theothers on the team to support their colleagues.5) Establish an inclusive community. Ninety percent of people with disabilities in our survey did notfeel a sense of belonging at work. When there are peer supportnetworks at work, people have the space to share theirexperiences without the fear of shame or reprimand.Our research shows that managers who encourage their team toopen up and create safe spaces by being vulnerable themselveswere seen as 75% more approachable than those who didn’t.These “spaces” could include a dedicated Slack channel, regularcoffee chats with the team for open-ended discussions, as well asformal ERGs (as mentioned above) where people with disabilitiescan interact with others going through similar experiences.Advocating for these spaces and motivating people to join themcan make feel employees with disabilities feel seen.Another idea is to create anonymous surveys for employeefeedback on inclusion. This not only helps leaders learn where the
