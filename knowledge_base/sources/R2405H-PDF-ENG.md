Safety is universally regarded as an indispensable right for customers

and employees alike. Government agencies exist to enforce standards,

and ﬁrms spend millions every year testing their products and making

## their workplace environments physically and psychologically safe.

And yet considerable evidence suggests that most companies

mismanage safety. For all the policing and investment in compliance,

products are frequently recalled, and workplace accidents continue

to happen. In 2023 in the United States 3,300 recalls aﬀected more

than 135 million products, a high not seen since 2016. U.S. employers

reported 2.8 million injury and illness cases in 2022, a 7.5% increase

over 2021. The United States saw 5,486 fatal work injuries in 2022—the

equivalent of one death every 96 minutes. Why aren’t companies doing

# better on safety?

Most executives frame safety as a compliance issue. They see it as a

cost and, consequently, they underinvest in it. To make matters worse,

they tend to treat safety more as an abstract value than as a driver of

performance. Finally, when a company is hit with a safety crisis, it often

responds by introducing ﬁnancially and managerially unsustainable

measures that are aimed more at managing its public image than at

resolving the underlying issue, and even those measures are eventually

abandoned. To help companies get out of this rut, we present evidence

that safety can be a key driver of performance, and we oﬀer a ﬁve-step

process they can use to turn safety from a constraint into a source of

# competitive advantage.

# What Companies Get Wrong about Safety

To understand how companies manage safety, we interviewed 76

executives from about 30 companies in diﬀerent industries, including

distribution, education consulting, health care, facilities management,

oil-ﬁeld services, ﬁnance, IT, and manufacturing. The ﬁndings were

troubling. Without exception, every executive described safety as a cost

to be incurred today to mitigate losses tomorrow. And although 94%

claimed that their company viewed safety as a core value, only 17%

said that safety was an explicit part of their company’s strategy. Equally

disturbing, safety was not widely measured: Just 35% said that their

company monitored one or more safety metrics, and only 4% reported

that it linked safety metrics to employee incentives and accountability.

It’s perhaps unsurprising, therefore, that none of the executives we

interviewed reported having any empirical evidence linking safety to

key performance drivers such as customer satisfaction, sales, margins,

# and employee retention.

At the other end of the corporate hierarchy, a 2022 study of U.S.

workers by AlertMedia found that 97% considered physical safety at

work important, but only 54% believed that their employers shared that

opinion. The proportion who said that their company was expending

more eﬀort on safety relative to the previous year has declined, from

55% in 2022 to 40% in 2024.

The tendency to view safety as a constraint is exacerbated at the middle-

## management level, where siloed functional departments implement

## safety—departments such as Health, Safety, Security, and Environment

## (HSSE); HR; and Quality, Safety, and Environment (QSE). In our

interviews with 20 department heads, they told us that they saw their

roles primarily as enforcing rules, investigating incidents, conducting

trainings, and tracking indicators such as injury rates and lost

workdays. Although those activities are important, the language many

of these executives used suggests a heavy focus on compliance and

reacting to problems rather than on proactively managing safety as a driver of customer value or strategic performance. Chief safety oﬃcers

spoke of “minimizing risk,” “enforcing regulations,” and analyzing

“what went wrong.” They described process safety management as

an exercise in “hazard mitigation” and identifying “root causes.” And

consider the language SkyWest Airlines used when talking about safety

in its 2018 10-K ﬁling: It noted “new certiﬁcation requirements,”

## “additional emergency training,” “availability of pilot records,” and

“stricter rules to minimize pilot fatigue” but made no connection

## between safety and customer value, overall strategy, or ﬁnancial

# performance.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Safety Should Be a Performance Driver

This mindset has pernicious consequences. A study conducted by one

of us found that managers allocated 60% fewer resources when an

investment was presented as a way to mitigate future losses than when

it was presented as a way to boost performance. That tendency is further

compounded by well-documented cognitive biases. Behavioral research

shows that people often underestimate their vulnerability to negative

events, leading them to neglect, defer, and underspend on precautions

such as wearing seat belts, getting ﬂu shots, or undergoing cancer

# screenings.

We saw this bias among the 76 executives we interviewed. More than

## 70% framed AI as a growth investment and safety investment as loss

avoidance. “We need to invest, and invest heavily, to realize the beneﬁts

of AI,” declared the CEO of an oil-ﬁeld services company in Houston.

Compare that with his characterization of safety: “Safety is a core value.

We constantly review our safety expenditures and processes to optimize

# them for the future.”

# What the Data Says

CEOs can ﬂip the script on safety and reframe it as a performance

driver to be invested in. Plenty of evidence supports this claim. A

landmark study of the U.S. auto market in 1996 found that consumers

pay signiﬁcantly more for vehicles that have features such as airbags

and antilock brakes. A 2015 study of 16,576 choices made by 540 airline

passengers revealed that safety information drives carrier choice.

Our own research across industries supports this framing. A 2021

## study of 11,451 customers across 1,785 companies in 65 industries

conducted by one of us found that safety is associated with a 9% lift

in overall customer satisfaction, which in turn drives a 13% increase

in sales. A 2024 study of 2,484 B2B purchasing decisions found that

customers are more likely to choose vendors with better safety training.

And a 19-year panel study of 619 publicly traded companies revealed

that ﬁrms with better employee-safety records enjoyed signiﬁcantly

## higher customer satisfaction than companies with lower safety records.

Customer satisfaction is strongly associated with sales growth, bigger

margins, and superior shareholder returns. A 2016 longitudinal study

that one of us worked on, which looked at 4,643 ﬁrms over the period

1994–2010, found that companies that reduced safety lapses for both

customers and employees had higher long-term valuations.

The language many executives use suggests a heavy focus on compliance and reacting to problems rather than on proactively managing safety as a driver of customer value.

We haven’t even mentioned the immediate and tangible beneﬁts from

reducing worker downtime: Our 2023 analysis of 32,061 construction

sites across New York City found that mandatory safety training reduces

worker injury rates by 15% to 18%, delivering $18 million in annual

savings and a 42% return on investment. A second longitudinal study

of 1,921 industrial facilities of a major oil-ﬁeld services company showed

that a 10% increase in monthly training hours led to a 6.5% to 10%

## reduction in employee safety hazards over the course of 128 months.

The empirical case for framing safety as a performance driver is clear:

Safety investments are linked to increases in customer satisfaction,

employee welfare, sales, margins, pricing power, market share, and

## long-term ﬁrm value along with reductions in health care and litigation

costs. Some companies have already ﬁgured this out.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Safety Should Be a Performance Driver

ExxonMobil, for example, has elevated safety to a strategic priority

(succinctly naming the core value “Nobody gets hurt”). The

company has integrated safety into its decision-making and uses a

## comprehensive Operations Integrity Management System (OIMS) to

manage performance. The system tracks a range of metrics such

## as near misses, safety observations, and hazard identiﬁcations to

spot potential safety issues, ensuring that safety is incorporated in

## employee evaluations and decision-making at all levels. ExxonMobil

has an industry-leading personnel-safety performance with a lost-time

## incident rate of 0.02 per 200,000 work hours in 2022.

When adopting safety as a strategic goal, however, managers should

avoid making it a stand-alone initiative. Doing so will only serve to

divorce it from the core business strategy. In our experience, when

safety is treated as a separate initiative, it quickly becomes an exercise

in cost reduction and compliance. Employees see it as an additional

burden, not an integral part of their job or the company’s strategy, and

resources are cut at the ﬁrst sign of ﬁnancial pressure.

# How To Make Safety a Performance Driver

For safety to be an eﬀective performance driver, an organization must

ensure that everyone is aligned on what safety means and on how to

measure success. It must also introduce practices to anticipate risks

and prevent incidents before they materialize, target training on those

practices, and incentivize employees to improve safety.

Align on meaning. It is essential to clarify your deﬁnition of safety

so that everyone understands precisely what it means for your

organization. Alcoa provides an excellent example of such clarity.

Former CEO Paul O’Neill made safety a cornerstone of the company’s

overall strategy and deﬁned it as achieving zero workplace injuries.

With everyone aligned on that deﬁnition and goal, workplace safety

metrics were included in every aspect of decision-making and

## accountability, from the shop ﬂoor to the boardroom.

A school district in Texas we advised took a similar approach. The

district had been experiencing outbreaks of bullying, and concern was

growing that they were aﬀecting educational outcomes and attendance.

To address the problem, the superintendent and the school board

decided to put students’ physical and psychological safety on campus

at the core of the district’s strategy, framing it as a driver of academic-

## achievement outcomes, parent loyalty, and student attendance.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Safety Should Be a Performance Driver

To begin, the board included safety metrics in the superintendent’s

performance evaluation, making one-third of his $75,000 annual bonus

contingent on meeting certain safety goals. To ensure organizational

alignment on the deﬁnition of safety, the superintendent met with

the school principals, and each one made student safety one of three

strategic priorities. Next, the school principals met with their teachers

and staﬀers in small groups to emphasize how reducing bullying would

ultimately improve academic performance and student retention. At

the meetings participants voiced their concerns, oﬀered ideas for

combating bullying, and shared success stories—all of which created

alignment around what safety means to them. Finally, teachers and staﬀ

members used social media and community-engagement meetings to

communicate with parents and students. They listened to concerns,

explained the connection between reduced incidents of bullying and

improved academic outcomes, and shared stories of students who had

beneﬁted from safer schools.

Agree on metrics. Of course, for people to buy in to the goal, you

must be able to demonstrate that safety translates into improved

performance. General ﬁndings, like those cited above, are helpful, but

operational managers in a commercial business, for example, will need

to know that safety, as the company deﬁnes it, delivers positive numbers

## in terms of productivity and market share.

A nursing-home system we worked with in Pennsylvania provides a

good example. It deﬁned safety as decreasing the number of falls

and lowering the incidence of bedsores among residents. The chain

## developed operational measures of bedsores and resident falls and

statistically correlated them with a measure of residents’ quality of life

(as reported in interviews with residents). The quality-of-life measure

was then statistically correlated with resident retention, business

growth, and margins, thus providing a link between speciﬁc safety

metrics and the organization’s operational success measures (Did more

people want to go there? Did they want to stay longer? And did the

## organization beneﬁt ﬁnancially as a result of reductions in bedsores

and fall rates?). As one of the nursing-home directors explains, “Aside

from helping our residents, we now have a business case for our safety

strategy. We track falls and bedsores for each shift—improving safety

helps residents and it helps our bottom line.”

Companies often fall into the trap of tracking too many generic safety

metrics that are not clearly linked to speciﬁc outcomes. When that

happens, employees quickly become cynical about such measures,

viewing them as bureaucratic box-checking that eats up their time

rather than genuine eﬀorts to improve safety. The nursing-home

chain initially had this problem—it was tracking more than 15 safety

metrics, many of which had no clear connection to reducing the

number of falls or bedsores. For example, some of the original safety

metrics pertained to front-desk monitoring, parking lot incidents, safety

measures reported by vendors, and even neighborhood-crime tracking.

Once management realized its mistake, it dramatically simpliﬁed the

measurement system. The chain focused on just a few key metrics

that were statistically linked to the outcomes it cared about. By

jettisoning measures that weren’t adding value, leaders could focus

employee attention on the ones that mattered. The Texas school district

went through a similar winnowing process. Initially each school was

required to track more than 60 safety metrics; of them, only ﬁve

were statistically predictive of student bullying and physical safety. By

ruthlessly prioritizing a small number of metrics clearly linked to safety

outcomes, both organizations built employee buy-in, saved employee

time, and drove real improvements.

Anticipate and prevent problems. Once managers have internalized the

business case for safety and adopted reliable metrics for measuring

success, they readily seek tools and adopt practices that help them

anticipate and prevent safety problems. The nursing-home chain, for

example, provided nursing assistants with wearable ﬂashlights so that

they could easily detect the onset of bedsores. The school district

developed a smartphone-based system that allowed students to record

and report safety incidents. It also trained its teachers and staﬀ to

identify signs of student distress and to proactively reach out.

The Harris County Sheriﬀ’s Oﬃce, which runs one of the largest

prison systems in Texas, provides another example. Improving safety

—reducing inmates’ self-harm attempts, drug abuse, ﬁghting, suicide attempts, and illness—is a key element of its overall strategy. The oﬃce

has taken a multipronged approach to measuring and improving safety

# outcomes.

First, the guards conduct inspections of jail cells every 30 minutes,

enabling them to identify and preemptively address inmates who are

displaying aggressive or self-harming tendencies. Second, leadership

has invested in technology to automate the monitoring of the

## dispensation of critical medications, especially for conditions such as

## diabetes, seizures, schizophrenia, depression, and bipolar disorder. By

proactively identifying inmates who did not receive medicines on time

and correcting the oversight, leadership has minimized the likelihood

of harmful medical incidents. Finally, to reduce the smuggling of

contraband such as drug-laced paper through the mail, the sheriﬀ’s oﬃce has implemented technology to digitize and scan all incoming

# mail.

Safety investments are linked to increases in customer satisfaction, employee welfare, sales, margins, pricing power, market share, and long-term firm value.

Today, on-time cell-inspection rates exceed 99%, the inmate mortality

rate is down 30% (and below the national and state averages), and

use-of-force incidents by the staﬀ have declined 23%. These safety

improvements have helped drive a 24% drop in the attrition rate of detention oﬃcers in a span of three years.

Consider how McDonald’s and the Field Neurosciences Institute

in Michigan worked together to encourage safety behaviors among

neighboring schools. They created the “caught being safe” program

at the institute. Teachers and staﬀ members nominate students who

are observed engaging in safe practices, such as wearing helmets or

life jackets. Students who are “caught being safe” are recognized and

receive a coupon for a prize at participating McDonald’s restaurants.

By fostering a culture that normalizes and celebrates safe behaviors,

the program helps to reduce the number of safety incidents among

# children.

Technology can be a useful aid in the pursuit of safety. Apache

## Industrial, a provider of labor, scaﬀolding, and other services for

industrial facilities in the United States and Canada, developed in-

house laser scanning and 3-D modeling capabilities to scan buildings

and create digital 3-D designs that can prevent hazards and accidents.

“Shorter project time means less exposure to hazards,” explains Spence Killian, Apache’s chief commercial oﬃcer. “We reduced the project time

by 28% for one client—increasing safety and reducing the total cost of

the project.”

## HBR / Magazine Article / Safety Should Be a Performance Driver

Innovative companies are responding to the growing demand for safety-

focused equipment. For instance, in 2019 3M developed a new line

of smart personal protective equipment (PPE) that uses advanced

## sensors and wireless connectivity to both measure worker safety and

track improvements in productivity. Similarly, Chevron is developing a

wearable skin patch that will provide real-time, automated analysis of

sweat and electrolyte loss, alerting wearers to potential heat strain and

the need for a break to replenish ﬂuids and electrolytes.

Target training. Safety training must be customized to achieve speciﬁc

preventive behaviors, and it should prioritize employee convenience.

Otherwise, training programs can waste employees’ time, sap their

morale, and fail to achieve the desired results.

The nursing-home chain initially subjected employees to generic safety

training, conducted during lunch, to explain the importance of safety.

Perhaps unsurprisingly, no safety improvements materialized, so the

chain redesigned its training, making it speciﬁc to bedsore reduction.

It also began oﬀering the training sessions online so that employees

wouldn’t need to forgo lunch to attend them. In addition, each

employee was incentivized with a cash reward and a certiﬁcate for

completing the training. As a result, training completion rates increased

to 96%, employees identiﬁed more bedsores in the pre-formation stage,

and the incidence of bedsores among residents decreased from 23.1% to

# 9.3%—a 60% improvement in safety.

It’s a mistake to assume that more training is necessarily better.

Consider the case of a major industrial company in Houston with more

than $30 billion in annual sales. It initially required employees to take

more than 70 safety trainings, each lasting more than 40 minutes. But

a statistical analysis showed that only nine of those trainings were

predictive of improved safety outcomes. When the company reduced

its required safety trainings by 87%, it saved millions in employee time

without sacriﬁcing results.

What separates useful training from the rest is most likely its speciﬁcity.

In our research, training that focuses on communicating the value of

safety in the workplace is generally not closely tied to improvements

in safety. Rather, companies should mandate training in behaviors that

have been statistically shown to improve safety outcomes.

# Dräger, a provider of ﬁxed and portable

gas-detection systems for preventing

# accidents in the oil, gas, and chemical

industries, exempliﬁes the value of

targeted training. Dräger’s training on the

use of its gas-detection systems covers the

technical aspects of operating the

# equipment, of course, but it also

emphasizes how to interpret data and

explains the response strategies for various

scenarios of gas exposure. This approach ensures that employees are not

just familiar with the equipment but also adept at reacting correctly

under hazardous conditions, thereby signiﬁcantly reducing the risk of

accidents and enhancing overall safety.

Shell uses a similar approach to train contractors in safety. Its

onboarding program uses real equipment, tools, and mannequins to

demonstrate hazards and how to mitigate them, and it signiﬁcantly

improves the way new vendors are introduced to the company’s safety

protocols. Participants acquire speciﬁc capabilities that prepare them

for on-the-ground conditions and develop a proactive attitude toward

# safety and risk management.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Safety Should Be a Performance Driver

Incentivize employees. Many companies incentivize ﬁnancial

performance, quality, and productivity; safety is a minor consideration,

if mentioned at all. Worse, they make the mistake of drastically

increasing safety incentives after an incident—without ﬁrst putting

a safety strategy in place. After the catastrophic Deepwater Horizon

explosion, for example, BP pegged 100% of employee bonuses to safety

in 2010—but only for a single quarter. Most viewed that action as a

public relations stunt rather than a true commitment to safety.

Another common mistake companies make is to peg rewards to

outcomes. In our view, outcomes are the responsibility of managers;

they are ultimately the consequence of a managerial choice of what

behaviors to encourage. When it comes to employees, companies

should reward the preventive behaviors and practices that lead to safe

outcomes. The behaviors themselves should be speciﬁc and measurable

so that the incentives can be clearly linked to them.

The Pennsylvania nursing-home chain takes a two-pronged approach

in this regard. First, certiﬁed nursing assistants receive $70 when they

complete the online bedsore identiﬁcation training. Second, the shift

that detects the highest number of early-stage bedsores each month

earns a group cash bonus of as much as $200. The combination

of individual and team incentives, both tied to clear safety-leading

behaviors, improved the rates of training completion and bedsore

# detection.

A commercial construction ﬁrm achieved similar results using a

straightforward initiative. Employees who consistently wore all required

PPE (helmets, glasses, harnesses) were entered in a monthly drawing for

$200 gift cards. Participation was tracked through a smartphone app.

Within six months PPE compliance had risen from 43% to more than

92%.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Safety Should Be a Performance Driver

For their part, managers need to keep a close eye on behaviors and

## outcomes. For example, directors at the nursing-home chain regularly

meet with shift leaders to review target safety metrics. The weekly

meetings are brief—about 20 minutes—but they’re frequent enough to

keep safety salient in employees’ minds without becoming burdensome.

# What Success Looks Like

Let’s conclude by taking a look at a company that has put all these

elements together to make safety a performance driver. When a new

SVP of strategy and a new CEO took over a facilities management

## company with $1.7 billion in annual sales and 10,000 employees that

manages more than 2,000 client sites, they initiated a project to uncover

the drivers of customer value. They discovered that safety accounted for

# 10% of the total impact.

To deﬁne and align around the meaning of safety, the SVP visited some

200 client sites to gather feedback from site managers and clients. On

the basis of those visits, the company deﬁned safety as safe operations

by employees (preventing lacerations from sharp tools such as kitchen

## knives and garden tools) and safe driving (no incidents of drunk

driving or speeding infractions). It included three behaviors in its safety

metrics: properly covering sharp tools during transport and storage,

using sharp tools correctly on the job, and operating vehicles safely.

The company also introduced a number of practices tied to improved

safety. For instance, it created a conﬁdential hotline that employees

could use to report safety violations without fear of retribution. Site

managers began holding regular safety meetings with shift supervisors

in order to focus them on speciﬁc behaviors and practices. Each site was

given specialty double-canvas covers for sharp tools and access to an

online training program for using them. Site managers were evaluated

according to the percentage of times the tools were properly covered

and the percentage of employees who completed the training. The

company also proactively replaced older equipment with newer, safer

## models with features such as automatic shutoﬀs and safety guards.

Finally, all vehicles were equipped with Breathalyzer ignition locks and

remote camera monitors to prevent drunk or unsafe driving.

## Within 18 months compliance with the sheathing and correct-usage

behaviors rose from 17% to 31% to a consistent 84% to 98% across all

sites. Equipment-related lacerations dropped by more than 70% and

vehicular accidents by more than 90%. As a result, the company’s

already excellent safety record saw a 15% improvement.

To further streamline the safety strategy, the SVP of strategy collaborated with the chief HR oﬃcer to improve the company’s

approach to incident reporting and training. She learned that site

managers felt burdened by too much training that they found

ineﬀective. As a ﬁrst step, therefore, senior leaders reviewed the

company’s portfolio of training programs, ultimately reducing it from

more than 40 mandatory trainings a year to only ﬁve trainings. Second,

leaders reduced the number of safety metrics by 50% and invested in

new technology that shortens the time it takes to gather safety metrics.

Finally, safety-related incentives, which had previously been for top

management only, were extended to site managers. The managers’

incentives were linked to employee behaviors, not outcomes. Their

bonuses were directly tied to the increased application of preventive

## behaviors and practices by site employees rather than the number of

# accidents.

Speciﬁcally, the company tied 20% of a site manager’s bonus to the

sheathing of instruments and correct-handling indicators. It gave a $50

bonus to every employee who completed all ﬁve trainings. Each location

had a $1,000 annual budget earmarked for recognizing employees’

safety behaviors at events or employee town halls. It’s important to

note that the incentives focused on behaviors that prevent accidents;

punitive responses to accidents don’t help prevent them. Regular

audits were conducted to verify compliance with sharp-tools coverage

and handling protocols. High-performing sites were spotlighted in

newsletters and town halls, and their best practices were widely shared.

Managers also worked with local teams to set realistic incremental

targets, and they steadily raised the bar over time.

The VP of marketing developed a communications plan to recognize

and promote the company’s strong safety performance to both internal

and external stakeholders. That increased site managers’ satisfaction

and further diﬀerentiated the service among corporate customers.

Safety is now a key selling point in new-client proposals, and over the

course of a year and a half, sales increased by 24%.

. . .

It’s imperative that we fundamentally rethink the entrenched view

of safety. By reimagining it for the 21st century, not as a defensive

necessity but as an oﬀensive opportunity, companies can elevate safety

from a siloed function to a shared mindset, from a cost center to a

value accelerator. The task of improving safety while delivering value

for customers, employees, and shareholders is one that executives

need to embrace, but they must do so mindfully, systematically, and

consistently. Then safety can become a formidable strategic advantage.
