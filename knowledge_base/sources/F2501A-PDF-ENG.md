Learning Emerging Skills Doesn’t Always Pay Off Employees who focus on core skills perform far better.

If your ﬁrst inclination is to hire and train with an eye toward cutting-

edge skills that your company might have to deploy in the future, you’re

not alone. In 2023 the World Economic Forum reported that 44% of

workers’ skills would need to be updated within the next ﬁve years and

that 60% of employees would require retraining before 2027. Despite

those needs, the average training investment for large companies fell

from $19.2 million in 2022 to $16.1 million in 2023, according to Training

magazine’s 2023 industry report. Companies of all sizes oﬀered ﬁve

fewer hours of training per year per employee, on average, while the

expenses for conducting training continued to climb. With less time and

money available, it’s crucial that your company invest in skills that will

have a lasting and meaningful impact on your organization. But where

should you start?

A recent Gartner survey of 3,375 employees found that training workers

in the core skills essential to their roles right now has ﬁve times

more impact on their performance than teaching “emerging” skills that

don’t have a clear here-and-now application. It’s important to note

that core skills will be diﬀerent for every role, and certain emerging

skills may actually be immediately needed in some jobs. AI-prompt

## engineering, for example, isn’t essential at this point for employees in

accounting, but it is for certain engineers working with large language

models. Unfortunately for HR managers, only 25% of employees prefer

to improve core skills rather than learn new ones. Companies want their

employees to focus most of their training time on mastering their core

skills, but 40% of employees aren’t doing this. That is a mistake.

## Tony Guadagni, a director in Gartner’s HR practice and the lead author

of the survey, oﬀers four tips for building an eﬀective training program

dedicated primarily to core skills.

Determine the right skills. Focus only on your current business needs.

Ask employees what skills they need to thrive in their jobs today. Speak

to your recruiters and managers, too. Drawing on those conversations,

create a list of 10 core skills for every role. They should be tied to

business results, and they should reﬂect only what’s mission critical

now. That’s because roles change quickly, as the survey participants

Guadagni interviewed report, but the fundamental skills required to do

most jobs don’t. That isn’t the case with emerging skills, however. They

evolve rapidly, and some become obsolete before anyone has the chance

to master them.

Tout the beneﬁts of focusing on core skills. Managers and their

employees are often resistant to developmental training, according to

Guadagni. Managers worry that the time employees spend learning or

brushing up on skills will eat too much into their day-to-day tasks.

Employees worry that their regular work will be interrupted and that the

skills they learn won’t help them do their jobs better. This is especially

true when a training program focuses on core skills.

To win over skeptics, you should be clear about why employees must

acquire or improve core skills, even those the employees think they’re

already expert in. No matter which ones you refresh, you should oﬀer

speciﬁc information about how they will help employees succeed and

# advance.

Start small and grow. It takes an enormous amount of time just to

catalog core skills. One company told Gartner that it took so long to

conduct a skills audit for a single set of roles that it had to extend its

## timeline for the whole organization by two years.

Redesigning a training program is costly, especially in the near term, so

start with a deﬁned group of employees and then expand to other areas

as you get results. That way, your HR managers can understand what

works and what doesn’t before rolling a program out broadly. They’ll

also be able to assess how employees are progressing and whether there

will be pushback when the program moves to new departments.

Incorporate emerging skills when they become mission critical. “Over

the course of ﬁve years, everyone will need to learn new skills,” says

Guadagni. You should constantly identify emerging skills and assess

whether they’ll become a requirement in the long run. Then you should

decide whether now is the time to teach them.

How you split the training time between core and emerging skills will

vary for each role. Some departments, such as IT, will need to update

their skills more frequently than others. And timing is key to integrating

emerging-skills training successfully. New skills will always crop up, but

will employees have time to learn them, time to test them, and time to

apply them in their daily functions while also maintaining or improving

# current levels of productivity?

“New skills will atrophy if people don’t consistently apply them in

their roles,” Guadagni notes. “If you’re going to train someone on an

emerging skill, you’d better be sure they’re going to use it.”

What’s your firm’s approach to

# core

# skills training?

‑

We aim to find the essential skills

that people need to bring to work.

This involves understanding the dynamic

nature of their roles and what’s critical in

## each one. For instance, in our technology

roles, core foundational skills include

# programming, analytical thinking, and

quality assurance. In HR, they include

employee relations, change management,

# and organizational design.

How do you handle long-term employees who are opposed to brushing

# up on core skills?

If an employee is resistant, it’s their manager’s job to help them understand

the requirements and hone their skills. This involves a combination of

development and selection. We try to start with people who have a

growth-oriented mindset. They’re more likely to positively receive a training

program, core or emerging, because they understand the direct link

between training and future success. For those who struggle, we provide

## support through additional training and development programs.

How do you keep your workforce up to speed on emerging skills?

We do it by fostering a culture of continuous learning and empowering

employees to take charge of their own development. For rapidly changing

skills, like those involving AI, we provide training on an aggressive

schedule while ensuring employees balance their development with daily

responsibilities. Managers play a crucial role in guiding their teams, helping

them navigate the challenge of staying current while meeting execution

demands. The key is offering the right resources and support to help

employees keep pace with evolving skill requirements.

How do you recommend managers redesign their skills programs to

realize the benefits of strengthening core skills?

HR and leadership need to work together to understand job requirements

and employee skills. Managers must focus on closing the gaps between

skills supply and demand. It’s about supporting continuous development,

and it requires data gathering and analysis to understand the size and

nature of gaps across a team or unit. Once the gaps are identified,

managers can work with HR to target strategies to close them. This may

involve training, development programs, or hiring new talent. The goal is

to ensure that the organization has the right skills—core and emerging—to

meet its strategic objectives.
