# Practice Gracious Communication

Most of us want to communicate with kindness, but it can be

challenging to convey warmth and compassion under frustrating,

stressful, or maddening circumstances. Three practices can help you in your day-to-day interactions, as well as big, diﬃcult conversations.

First, meet confrontation with grace. This means wearing a smile and exuding patience and courtesy when an employee brings you diﬃcult

news or challenges your decision-making. An open-minded tone will

signal that you’re there to listen, process, and problem-solve—not to

reprimand or enforce your own authority.

Next, give credit whenever you can. Recognizing your employees and

showing them gratitude will engender their enthusiasm, hard work,

# trust, and loyalty.

Finally, give people space and clarity so you don’t catch them oﬀ guard.

Schedule conversations in advance or ask them if it’s a good time to

talk—and give them a quick preview of what you’d like to talk about.

These kind, simple gestures will give your counterpart an opportunity

to prepare, and make it clear that you’re interested in listening to their

# response.

# Kindness,” by Sally Susman.

Acknowledge what’s working. As you address uncertainty, point to

areas of progress. Use a “yes, and” approach: Yes, things are messy—and

we’re doing good work. Be honest about challenges without slipping

# into blame or false optimism.

Make space for real questions. Don’t redirect or minimize concerns.

Ask your team what’s weighing on them and how it’s showing up in

their day-to-day work lives. If no one speaks up, check in with trusted

team members behind the scenes to get a fuller picture.

Respond with care. When you don’t have answers, explain what could

inﬂuence the outcome. Share details only if they aﬀect the team’s

reality; disclosing what’s irrelevant or uncertain creates confusion.

Stick to the facts. Avoid speculation. Use data and observable progress

to ground your message. Reinforce how the team’s work supports key business goals like revenue or eﬃciency.

Model resilience. Show up with calm and clarity. In tough moments,

consistency builds trust—and helps your team focus on what they can

# control.

# Business Is Bad,” by Rebecca Knight.

Chunk it up. Your audience can only handle three to four pieces of

information at once. Organizing your key points under one central idea

will help them retain details and connect the dots.

Make it concrete. Abstract ideas are tough to remember. Use vivid,

relatable examples that evoke sensory details to create a mental image

your audience won’t forget.

Provide callbacks. Revisit earlier points to strengthen your audience’s

recall. Subtle reminders of previous content help reinforce memory and

tie new information to existing knowledge.

## Spark curiosity. Don’t just deliver answers—pose intriguing questions

that highlight knowledge gaps. Curiosity fuels memory, making your

# message stick.

# to Science,” by Charan Ranganath.

# Communicate Directly—Not Rudely

Direct communication is an important work skill—especially for a

manager. Being clear about what you want and need from people (and why) makes everything more eﬃcient. But if you’re too harsh, you can

end up doing more harm than good. Here’s how to toe the line between

being direct and veering into rudeness.

- When delivering feedback, focus on facts. Remove your emotions

from the conversation, and instead give the person honest, concrete

evidence about their performance. Your goal is to help them grow, not

# to vent.

- When expressing an opinion, use “I” statements. Avoid making

accusations or casting blame, which will put your employee on the

defensive. Instead of calling them out and pointing ﬁngers, call them

in by expressing your experience of their behavior.

- Turn a hard “no” into a soft “no.” As a direct person, your instinct

may be to unambiguously reject an inessential work request that

comes in when you just don’t have the bandwidth to take it on. But

if you’re too blunt, you risk being perceived as someone who doesn’t

want to collaborate or help out. Instead, ﬁnd the compassion to oﬀer

an alternative that works better for you and your schedule, or kindly

explain why it’s impossible for you to take on.

- When making a request, be considerate, not commanding. There’s

nothing wrong with giving clear, direct instructions and assignments.

Just remember to be reasonable, express gratitude, and oﬀer support if

your employee needs it.

## Communicating Difficult Decisions When You Can’t Be Fully Transparent

When you have to communicate a diﬃcult organizational decision, it’s

hard to know how much information to provide, particularly when you

can’t be fully transparent yet. Saying nothing can undermine people’s

trust, and saying too much can leave people feeling overwhelmed. You

can strike the balance by being candid—up to a point.

Frame the situation’s context clearly so people understand why the

organization is considering big changes. Explain that you’ll be as

## transparent as possible, use plain language (not corporate-speak), and

respond to questions. People appreciate honesty, even if the message

is incomplete or not what they want to hear. Be precise about what

you can say now and when you’ll say more, providing an overall

timeline for the process. But avoid giving people running commentary

as developments unfold; it can lead to unhelpful distractions and take

# up considerable management time.

If possible, let employees in on the options you’re considering, showing

the logic behind your coming actions. This builds trust and helps

mitigate the anxiety they may be feeling as they consider every

combination of eventualities (including catastrophic ones). It also

prevents them from feeling caught by surprise when you announce the

# ﬁnal set of changes.

# Sharpen Your Writing Skills

Regardless of your job, rank, or industry, written communication is

a skill that can set you apart from your peers. Here’s a three-step

framework to help you level up as a writer—whether you’re writing an

## email, a formal document, a social post, or something else.

First, determine the purpose of what you’re writing. What result do

you want to achieve? Are you looking to inform, persuade, or make

a request? Let that purpose inform the substance and style of your

communication from beginning to end.

Then, identify exactly who your audience is and speak directly to them.

This means using language that they understand and a voice that

resonates with them. It also means anticipating and answering their

questions—before they need to ask.

Finally, what’s your point? This is the essential substance of your

writing. To locate the message you’re aiming to deliver, ask yourself how

you would explain it to your audience in 15 seconds or less. Then, get to

the point early in your document, within the ﬁrst 40 to 50 words.

## Great Leadership Is About Great Communication

To be an eﬀective leader, you need to become an exceptional

communicator. Here are four strategies to help you motivate and inspire

# your team with your words.

- Use simple language to write about complex things. Long,

complicated sentences make written ideas hard to understand because

they demand more concentration. You’ll win more supporters if you

replace long words and sentences with shorter, more straightforward

# ones.

- Choose sticky metaphors. When you introduce a new or abstract

idea, your audience will search for something they recognize to help

them make sense of it. A metaphor is a powerful tool that compares or

equates a new, abstract idea to a familiar image or concept.

- Humanize data. Slide decks with statistics and charts are helpful, but

limited. The trick to making any data point interesting is to humanize

it by placing the number in perspective. Any time you introduce

numbers, take the extra step to make them engaging, memorable, and,

# ultimately, persuasive.

- Emphasize your mission. Shine a spotlight on your company’s

purpose across communication channels: meetings, memos, emails,

presentations, social media, and marketing material. If your mission

stands for something, then stand up for it.
