Anyone can experience adversarial behavior at work, but when

adversarial behavior occurs between members of the leadership team,

it can have severe consequences. Initially, these behaviors may manifest

as attempts to suppress or obstruct an executive’s actions. However,

they can escalate to more serious levels resulting in serious personal

## and professional consequences for the targeted executive.

Adversarial behaviors can take various forms. We interviewed a group

of retired and transitioning S&P 500 executives who identiﬁed three

common types of adversarial behavior: 1) One retired C-level executive

explained how they faced public intimidation through humiliation

from the head of a business unit because they were implementing

corporate initiatives that had a negative impact on the unit. 2) Another

C-level executive faced a boycott. The executive was being ignored

and left oﬀ meeting invites where critical decisions were made.

Their contributions were actively undermined, dismissed and even

silenced. 3) One executive encountered sabotage. Someone within their

organization reported them to the ethics hotline wrongly accusing them

of giving cash to a vendor. During the investigation, it became clear to

the executive that someone was trying to distance them from the project

and discredit them in the eyes of the decision-making executive.

Each of these scenarios is only a facet of adversarial behavior. In

fact, when facing adversarial behavior something much worse could be

happening in the shadows—corporate gaslighting. Corporate gaslighting

is a tactic used to sow doubt and undermine an executive’s credibility

among their peers and inﬂuential stakeholders, masking adversarial

# behavior.

Unlike traditional gaslighting, where an individual tries to make

another person doubt their own perceptions, corporate gaslighting

creates a negative narrative to convince an entire organization, team,

or structure to doubt an executive’s performance and role. This not

only aims to destroy their professional reputation but also erodes their

executive conﬁdence. In addition to spreading negative narrative and

exhibiting adversarial behavior on their victim, the perpetrator will use

other techniques to deny and reverse their victim’s position. They can

deﬂect confrontation, distort and downplay the severity of their actions.

Ultimately, they shift the victim-oﬀender dynamic by scapegoating,

using political inﬂuence for self-preservation.

Because corporate gaslighting occurs in stages, sometimes the victim

doesn’t even realize it is happening. They may feel the eﬀects but may

not completely understand what is happening or the severity of the

# situation.

However, if an executive does nothing against these dysfunctional

behaviors, they may regret not acting. Here are three actions that some

targeted executives have implemented successfully.

# Focus on the Right Problem

As corporate gaslighting progresses in stages, the victim may become

preoccupied with defending against adversarial behavior, often failing

to notice that a negative narrative is starting to take root.

A CIO from a S&P 500 global technology company noted:

“I was so stuck in the adversarial behavior that I missed how the

negative narrative around me was taking me down. I could feel it,

but I could not grasp it. If I had the clarity I have today I would

have focused on countering the narrative rather than combating the

# adversarial behavior.”

The executives we interviewed said that recognizing the problem is diﬃcult, especially if experiencing it for the ﬁrst time.

They recommended looking for “smoke”—signs such as patterns,

perception, and reputation. Where there is smoke, there is likely ﬁre.

If there is ﬁre, then adversarial behavior is just the smoke, not the real

# issue.

Questions that executives can ask themselves to help determine if they

risk corporate gaslighting include.

- Is the behavior consistent over time? Does the behavior occur under

# similar circumstances repeatedly?

- What do neutral third parties within the company say about it? Is

there consensus regarding whether the behavior seems deliberate?

- What is the person’s track record regarding similar behavior?

Have they been previously disciplined or reported for similar actions?

## Respond Strategically and Prepare Your Coalition

Responding to adversarial behavior is a nuanced decision that requires

## careful consideration of the impact on corporate values and personal

# principles.

Reﬂecting on past experiences, several executives we spoke with shared

valuable insights highlighting the importance of timing: “If I had waited

a couple of days, the political outcome would have been better,” one

noted. Another executive admitted, “I thought I had more support than

I did. After addressing it, I realized I didn’t”—underscoring the need

to accurately gauge support before taking action. A common theme

emerged around the pitfalls of impulsive decisions with one leader

candidly stating, “Reacting so quickly was a mistake on my part.”

While values provide the rationale for action, relying solely on values

can easily backﬁre. To decide when and how to act, it is important to

test the approach and build a strong coalition.

However, until the coalition is built, it is wise to buy some time.

According to all the executives we spoke with, each executive had their

# own strategies:

- Hold private conversations: Engage in one-on-one or small group

discussions with your current coalition to discuss your stance and

gather feedback on responding to the negative narrative.

- Discuss hypotheticals with mentors: Consult with trusted mentors

## about hypothetical scenarios and potential political repercussions of

addressing the behavior and how to do so.

- Seek positive narratives and endorsements: Ask allies to highlight

your positive narrative and secure smaller, easily publicized

endorsements within the corporation to build a positive reputation.

# Develop a Positive Counter Narrative

The only productive way to counter corporate gaslighting is to create

a positive narrative based on concrete facts and ﬁgures that can be

leveraged in all levels of the organization—above and below, as well

as with peers. This means learning to preemptively script a fact-based

diplomatic deﬂection when faced with a negative narrative.

One CTO from a global S&P 500 technology company, who was battling

the narrative that they couldn’t handle the C-suite pressure, used a

ﬁve-step process for diplomatic deﬂection, which involved shifting the

# focus from the concern to the solution:

- 1. Acknowledged the concern by saying: “Handling the pressures

at the C-suite level is indeed demanding, and it’s natural to have

## reservations about someone’s readiness for that environment.”

- 2. Reframed the narrative: “My primary focus is not just managing

pressure but generating concrete results. That’s where I consistently

# direct my eﬀorts.”

- 3. Highlighted the achievements: “Delivering (e.g., the market

expansion or business optimization) and driving (e.g., revenue growth

or market share increase) is my main concern, which is why you can

already see our teams delivering (e.g., increased quarterly proﬁts,

enhanced customer satisfaction scores and improved operational eﬃciency).”

- 4. Refocused on results: “Leadership in high-pressure environments

demands a result-oriented approach.”

- 5. Reinforced commitment to the business: “While every executive

has their own approach, my commitment is to corporate

# performance.”

In some cases, leaving the company may ultimately be the best option,

especially when corporate gaslighting is ingrained in the culture.

Adversarial behaviors are doorways to corporate gaslighting and doing

nothing is not an option. As business leaders, it is crucial to identify,

respond and counteract such threats to protect your reputation and

career, and those of which you are leading.
