There’s no sureﬁre strategy for building a thriving start-up.

Entrepreneurs have launched successful businesses using frameworks

## like the Business Model Canvas, the Balanced Scorecard, and more.

But in a recent study involving young ventures in Europe, one

technique consistently boosted performance. Firms employing the scientiﬁc method—the centuries-old discipline of formulating, testing,

and tweaking hypotheses—generated more revenue than companies in

a control group did and were more likely to pivot away from unviable

ideas, a routine necessity for early-stage start-ups. And among the top

revenue generators in the experiment, the diﬀerences were especially pronounced. Among the top 25%, start-ups using the scientiﬁc method

generated €28,000 more than the control companies did over the course

of the experiment, on average, and among the top 5%, they made

€492,000 more.

“We started this research by asking ourselves, Why do so many

start-ups fail?” says Alfonso Gambardella, a professor of corporate

management at Bocconi University who is one of the study’s authors.

“After discussing the problem, we realized that many entrepreneurs

were not very good at making predictions about their business. And this

hurt them when it was time to make important decisions.”

For the study, Gambardella and colleagues recruited 759 start-ups by

## advertising on social media, in newsletters and magazines, and at

events. The entrepreneurs running them received training in various

strategic frameworks as well as in evidence-gathering techniques such as qualitative interviews, surveys, and A/B testing. The key diﬀerence

between the control group and the treatment group was that the treatment group was also taught to employ the scientiﬁc method when

applying the frameworks and techniques. That required founders to

develop theories about elements of their proposed businesses and then

test them through rigorous experiments. The control group’s founders,

on the other hand, were free to apply any frameworks and techniques in

the way they wanted.

## Over a span of several months, large teams of research assistants

collected data on the companies and interviewed the founders regularly

by phone. One of the start-ups they followed was Mimoto, an electric-

moped sharing service. It set up an experiment to test its hypothesis

that college students hustling between classes would rather ride

mopeds than walk. After placing dozens of mopeds near an urban

campus, Mimoto realized that young people didn’t use them any more

than older people did. Rather, people of all ages—especially those who

had unpredictable commuting patterns—picked up the mopeds as they

passed through the campus. The entrepreneurs went back to the theory

stage and, on the basis of the data gathered during the experiment,

determined that young professionals, particularly lawyers, were the

most likely to need mopeds, because they were constantly rushing to

and from meetings with clients. The company then pivoted to focus on

that demographic.

## Mimoto’s experiences support Gambardella’s contention that where

founders start out is not really that important because they will test

and test to determine what is possible. Experimentation allows them to

adjust, change, or terminate their approaches much sooner than they would have without using the scientiﬁc method. Pivoting is common for

early-stage start-ups. YouTube started as a dating site before pivoting

to video. PayPal was originally an internet security company. The key

to a successful pivot is focusing not on your original theories but on

the answers you receive from your experiments. They should provide

insight into customer demand, industry pain points, and ultimately,

# viability.

“Some of the ﬁrms pivoted during our study, and that’s not necessarily a

bad thing because most pivoted very early,” Gambardella says.

Embracing the scientiﬁc method isn’t diﬃcult. Entrepreneurs can easily

apply it by following these steps:

First, state your main hypothesis. Mimoto’s founder believed that

college kids would want to rent mopeds to get to classes faster. Only

by articulating that hypothesis clearly and then observing how mopeds

placed around campus were used, and by whom, could the entrepreneur

have realized that he was wrong.

Begin with the idea that your intuition tells you is most plausible. “You

have to start somewhere,” Gambardella says. “But you should have other potential theories you can use if you determine that your ﬁrst theory is

# incorrect.”

Deﬁne the critical dependencies underlying the hypotheses and

investigate them. Leonardo Del Vecchio, the founder of Luxottica, a

maker of eyeglasses, did this when he came up with a theory about

how to grow the company (although it wasn’t a start-up at the time).

He posited that eyeglasses could be more than a means of vision

correction—they could be a form of fashion. He believed that people

would pay extra for stylish glasses and that some people would purchase

more than one pair and create a wardrobe of eyewear. Before going to

market with his hypothesis, he wanted to explore two uncertainties:

Could Luxottica even produce fashionable eyewear? And could it move

from a market controlled by independent retailers to a more direct-to-

consumer approach? Del Vecchio believed both were possible.

To resolve those uncertainties, Luxottica partnered with fashion houses,

such as Armani, to produce designs, which immediately increased

demand. And the company started to invest in direct marketing to

test its ability to sell to consumers rather than to optometrists. Today

EssilorLuxottica, as it’s currently known, is the world’s largest eyewear

company, valued at more than $95 billion.

You can do unstructured brainstorming to identify the uncertainties

your hypothesis involves, but you should focus on the top few—let’s say

# three—factors in your experiments.

Reﬁne your theories and test them again—but more broadly. When

Mimoto found that its theory wasn’t feasible, it developed a new

theory involving young professionals. But it didn’t assume the new

theory would work in the real world just because it had worked in an

experiment. Mimoto tested it by placing dozens of mopeds in urban environments. It reapplied the scientiﬁc method to its new theory until it was conﬁdent it had found a viable solution.

“Entrepreneurs who adopt the scientiﬁc method are not visionaries.

They’re aware that their theories may be wrong. And when they’re

wrong, they modify their theories, which they test again. If no theories

are successful, they terminate the start-up,” says Gambardella.

Even if you end up shutting down a business, don’t worry. “Failing a few

times is a recipe for future success,” Gambardella says.

About the research: “A Scientific Approach to Entrepreneurial Decision-Making: Large-Scale Replication and Extension,” by Arnaldo Camuffo et al. (Strategic Management Journal, 2024)

## “We Would Have Ended Up With a Product That Wasn’t Viable”

Cosimo Cecchini is a cofounder of Osense, a start-up focused on

technology for sustainability that participated in Gambardella’s research.

He recently spoke with HBR about the study and what he learned using the

scientific method. Edited excerpts of that conversation follow.

Why did you join the research project?

Our first start-up idea was for a

# peer-to-peer product-rental service. Our

mission was to reduce consumption to

improve sustainability. Companies would

be forced to produce fewer products,

and their carbon footprint would shrink.

Joining the study was a great opportunity

for us to learn how to test our hypothesis,

which basically assumed people would

# Claudia Gori

use this platform and that it would help

reduce climate change.

But you were wrong?

We used the scientific method to try to validate our idea that people would

rather rent than buy products and that the owners of the products would

make money from the rentals. To do that, we conducted field interviews

asking whether people would be inclined to reuse other people’s goods

and whether people had goods they wanted to rent out. We conducted

approximately 25 interviews, but after only five, we realized this wasn’t

going to work.

What would have happened if you hadn’t used the scientific method?

We probably would have developed our idea about peer-to-peer rentals

further and built a prototype. It would have been costly and time-

consuming. And we would have ended up with a product that wasn’t viable.

The only positive feedback we received during the interviews was that

people were interested in products that promote sustainability. So we came

## up with a new hypothesis around that idea.

Which was?

A platform to encourage the adoption of electric vehicles by persuading

rental-car companies to offer them and connecting those companies

with renters. It was a completely different idea, but it revolved around

sustainability, so we decided to try it. We used the same approach, a field

study, to determine whether the new idea had any viability. We spoke with

rental car companies and their customers about their pain points. We asked

whether a platform like the one we proposed would generate additional

interest in electric cars. Only 20% of the people we spoke with offered any

positive feedback. We were hoping for 60%.

Was that superfrustrating?

Yes, but we were happy to learn these lessons about our hypotheses early

on. Almost immediately after giving up on the second idea, I stumbled

upon a McKinsey report that said limiting Scope 3 carbon emissions—

which aren’t produced directly by a company but come indirectly from

things in its value chain—was the biggest challenge for sustainability-

minded corporations. When we investigated Scope 3 emissions, we learned

that employee commutes, business travel, and logistics are massive

contributors. We asked ourselves, “Can we develop a tracking system that

would give companies real-time access to this data?”

We interviewed sustainability managers. After three field interviews, we

knew we were on the right path. After 10 interviews, nine of the

conversations had been entirely positive.

What were the next steps that you took?

We had to prototype the idea and test it to determine whether it was

feasible in a real-world setting. We ran a six-month pilot with a company

that immediately became our first client once the pilot was complete.

And is your idea still viable?

Yes, but we will continue to test it and test it as we progress.
