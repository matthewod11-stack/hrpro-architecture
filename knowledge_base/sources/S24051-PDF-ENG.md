Not that long ago, teams were typically composed of people with

similar skills working in the same place. Their eﬀorts were based

on the idea that by working together in a well-managed process,

they could deliver replicable results. They primarily operated with eﬃciency and eﬀectiveness but would frequently encounter obstacles,

such as internal siloes or bureaucratic processes, that hindered their

overall performance. In response, they began to innovate how they

worked together, establishing the groundwork for a more ﬂexible,

# HBR / Spotlight / New Rules for Teamwork

## cross-functional approach to their rituals and practices. From the

## Skunk Works engineers of the 1950s to Brazilian football in the 1960s

to the aviation and surgical collaborations that delivered stunning

improvements in the 1990s and early 2000s, organizations have

continually searched for ways to enhance their teams’ eﬀectiveness.

Today, companies of all types are called on to demonstrate integrated,

## cross-functional, project-based teamwork in their operations. In the

tech world, for example, software engineers are expected to connect

with sales teams, data scientists to work on personnel projects,

and user-experience designers to partner with plant managers. Team members may be working together not only from diﬀerent oﬃces

but on diﬀerent continents. Some industries seem to have cracked

## the code on high-functioning teamwork—software and manufacturing

organizations in particular. Other industries, such as those that are

more knowledge-based, are playing catch-up.

Traditional thinking around how to innovate teamwork has often

been based on intuition and observation, with a dash of psychology.

But increasingly we face an environment of constant change and

disruption, and new ideas about how to create well-functioning teams

are emerging; some are based on experience, some are guided by new

practices, and some are being made up on the ﬂy. None of this has yet

cohered into a systematic approach to improving how teams work.

In recent years at McKinsey, we’ve devoted ourselves to developing a

new science of teamwork for our organization. This approach allows

us to understand how our 4,000-plus teams are performing and to

intervene when necessary. It combines the best of established wisdom

with new data-driven techniques and insights. It relies on testing,

learning, analysis, adaptation, and improvement—in real time and with

accountability—to enable continuous learning. And it includes metrics

## that link practices to outcomes, for both individuals and teams. We

have used the framework to test hypotheses about how teams work

best and to apply insights to improve performance. We have applied

this work not only internally but also at several of the companies that

we advise, building on previous learning to understand what eﬀective,

## cross-functional teamwork looks like in diﬀerent contexts.

In this article, we present three key principles of our approach that can

help teams in any organization perform at their best. And we describe

—through examples and a set of action plans how to put them into

# practice.

# Develop an Operating System

We use the term “operating system” to mean the building blocks for

the way team members collaborate, create change, and support one

another. Eﬀective operating systems vary widely, depending on the

needs and norms of the organization. What they all have in common

is that they set out a view of how teams create value, what teams are

supposed to achieve, the technical skills each team member is expected

to contribute, the processes by which the work will be managed, and

## the cultural norms and mindsets of constructive collaboration that

will guide behavior. The best operating systems embed an ethos of

## continuous improvement throughout the organization, not just in a

single team or department. They are structured enough to provide

consistent guidance but loose enough to accommodate changing

# conditions, priorities, data, and needs.

The hands-on world of auto manufacturing produced one of the earliest

and best-known examples of a cross-functional team operating system:

the Toyota Production System. Developed in the 1950s, it combined

## standard work routines with performance monitoring and metrics that

ﬂagged issues and opportunities. Frontline managers were trained to

collaborate closely with teams from a range of disciplines to resolve

problems and drive continuous improvement.

In the 1970s and 1980s, as the software industry started to take shape,

the idea of a team operating system moved from the physical to the

digital world. Developers began using signals to track the quality and

performance of their code, enabling them to adapt quickly when their

work generated an error. Ultimately, in the late 1990s and early 2000s,

this work gave rise to agile, one of today’s foremost team operating

systems and a mainstay of complex operations ranging from chip

# manufacturing to software development.

Rob Tringali is a sports photographer who has captured everything from the Super Bowl and the Olympics to obscure sporting events and high school football games.

At McKinsey, we have created a new team operating system—known as

the Way We Work (WWW)—that reframes, reshapes, and improves on

the principles of agile teamwork. To do their jobs well, our team leaders

need to be able to bring together the best thinking, analysis, coding,

and design expertise from our 7,000-plus experts while working with

other colleagues to build strong relationships and think strategically.

Designed to foster this collaboration across geographies and at scale,

WWW can be used by any team, regardless of size, location, or mission.

Consider the example of a Latin American bank that called us in

to consult on a transformation of its digital strategy and operations.

Things got oﬀ to a rocky start. The bank was working not only with

## us but also with a mix of outside digital architects, designers, and

experts. Team members were greatly frustrated: They didn’t know what

was expected of them or who was responsible for what. Everyone was

working long hours, to little eﬀect. Time to start over.

The team leaders decided to reset using the WWW operating system.

First, they held a structured kickoﬀ—involving all team members,

including outside consultants—that set a work cadence, team norms,

and expectations. Team leaders committed to conducting regular one-

## on-one feedback sessions and twice-a-month retrospective reviews with

the whole team. These systematic take-stock moments, all tracked

by a digital tool, enabled the team to make adjustments as needed.

During one retrospective, for example, the team realized it needed help

applying the bank’s agile methodology to the current transformation

project. So it called in experts to provide coaching. By the end

of the nine-month project, the bank had successfully launched the

digital products it had set out to develop, and the McKinsey team

had completed a comprehensive handover, transferring all relevant

knowledge to the client. Both the McKinsey team members and the

client reported a positive experience—an excellent result after that

# tough start.

Action plan. In our research on high-performing teams, we have found

that the best teams consistently do the three things that our team at the

bank did: hold kickoﬀs, conduct one-on-ones, and take stock of progress

using retrospectives. For our part, we also close out with comprehensive

handovers, documenting our work so that the client, and future

teams, can build on what we did. We recommend that companies use

these practices as the foundation of their teamwork operating system,

tailoring them to reﬂect their important cultural norms. For example,

the “obligation to dissent,” one of McKinsey’s core values, is embedded

## in the design of our one-on-ones and retrospectives.

When we ask our highest-performing teams what they attribute their

success to, their answer is: building trust in client relationships. This

is what the WWW operating model is meant to facilitate—and we have

plenty of evidence that it does. Frequently collecting client feedback,

conducting client retrospectives, and holding one-on-ones—our teams

listed all these as practices that helped them build trusting client

# relationships.

As we continue to evolve the WWW operating system, we’ve invested

in creating tools to help teams run it. We suggest that companies

instituting an operating system do the same. Our teams, for example,

can get professional support to facilitate kickoﬀs and retrospectives,

conduct one-on-ones, and set up protocols for handovers. We’ve also

created a library of WWW resources that is available to all on our

# internal website.

# Invest in Active, Real-Time Measurement

To make teamwork scientiﬁc, organizations need to be able to measure

the outcomes of their actions and determine how changes in the inputs

aﬀect results. At McKinsey, we’ve developed tools that allow us to

# HBR / Spotlight / New Rules for Teamwork

monitor our teams’ needs and performance in real time and then to

# hypothesize, test, learn, and adapt.

One tool we use to measure and monitor people outcomes is a weekly

survey. It is anonymous but segmented, and it is sent to all employees.

It asks a single question: How are you feeling? People respond by

clicking on one of ﬁve emojis, ranging from “Great” to “Terrible.” This

simple query allows us to identify trends in sentiment across diﬀerent

## colleague groups, such as senior leaders, new hires, data scientists, and

editors. If a speciﬁc group is slumping, we can intervene—for example,

by running targeted programming, oﬀering developmental support, or

investing in additional learning and coaching.

To measure functioning, our teams complete an engagement team

survey (ETS) every two weeks. It asks members which WWW rituals they

are using and how consistently. It also asks how they’re feeling about

the project they’re working on and how they’re progressing toward

## their short- and long-term goals, both personally and professionally.

An automated report synthesizes the results. If ETS scores begin to dip,

that’s a sign that a team is struggling—and indicates to leaders that it’s

time to intervene. To measure how well we’re doing with our clients, we

conduct conﬁdential surveys to gather feedback on the quality of our

## work and the eﬀectiveness of our collaboration.

By combining and evaluating the data from the team and client surveys

for a given project, we can identify how and to what extent the operating

model used by teams informs our work with clients. For example, we’ve

found that teams that use all the elements of the WWW operating

## system score signiﬁcantly better on client impact scores than those

that do not—from 10 percentage points higher (for collaboration) to

## 23 percentage points higher (for building client capabilities and skills).

Client and team satisfaction often go hand in hand: Teams with the best

client feedback scores also have the highest team feedback scores, and

# vice versa.

# Rob Tringali

Internally, we’ve used real-time measurement to ﬁgure out whether it

makes a diﬀerence if our teams work in person or remotely. To answer

that question, we studied 40 teams, consisting of 217 consultants, across

geographies and sectors, to understand how each model contributed to

## productivity, client impact, apprenticeship, and personal experience.

The results were unequivocal: The sweet spot for in-person time is

about 50%. When teams colocate half the time over the course of a

project, they’re 10 times as likely to believe they collaborated eﬀectively

compared with those above or below that level. Team members are

25% more likely to be satisﬁed with the quality of their support, and

team leaders are signiﬁcantly more likely to say that they built solid

client relationships. For example, 77% of our team leaders said that they

had built meaningful connections with their clients when they held

problem-solving sessions in person, compared with 59% of those who

ran them remotely.

The data also shows that these beneﬁts aren’t linear. Teams that colocate more than 50% of the time increasingly have to make diﬃcult

trade-oﬀs when it comes to work-life balance and the ability to conduct

focused work. At McKinsey and at other organizations, we’ve found that

teams working remotely about 50% of the time are twice as likely to have suﬃcient recovery from work and are signiﬁcantly more likely to

ﬁnd their jobs sustainable.

Knowing what to measure is critical. For example, trauma centers

determine team eﬀectiveness by measuring how long it takes to

stabilize a patient—a major factor in survival. When experimenting

with methods to reduce stabilization time, some centers tried placing

timers in each trauma bay. Research showed that this simple action

signiﬁcantly reduced stabilization time. The point is that when the right

metrics are identiﬁed and collected, it becomes clear what practices to

# implement for the desired outcomes.

In a very diﬀerent ﬁeld, but using the same principle, the aviation

industry has deﬁned success as fewer crashes—and most important, no

fatal crashes. This has been achieved in part owing to new technologies,

## such as better engines and improved safety systems in the cockpit.

But people, too, have been critical in reducing the number of crashes.

Carriers, pilots, and regulators have all become a single safety team

united by a common goal: no more deaths in the sky. Voluntary

incident-reporting programs ensure that those who give information on

safety concerns will not be punished for errors. Airlines share data with

one another, and pilots are encouraged to recommend solutions. All this

data has enabled industry experts to identify best practices, such as

revised runway procedures, redesigned ﬂight paths, and better signage.

# HBR / Spotlight / New Rules for Teamwork

The result: No U.S. commercial carrier has had a fatal crash since 2009,

and safety rates for civil aviation have improved too. (See editor’s note

# below.)

Action plan. Deﬁne what constitutes success. This could be any

number of things, such as increased revenue, improved employee and

## client experience, capability building, work-life sustainability, or skills

acquisition. Then build digital systems to track those metrics with as

little disruption as possible to teams’ day-to-day work. Finally, use those

systems to learn what combinations of inputs lead to better outcomes.

At McKinsey, success is delivering results for our clients. The signals

that point the way to this outcome are client and team sentiment, and

the inputs are the WWW practices, measured through the team survey.

[ 3 ]

## Create a System for Continuous Improvement and Innovation

The idea of continuous improvement is hardly novel. What is fresh,

however, is that teams today have new forms of technology and data

collection at their disposal to help them self-correct while projects are

underway. At McKinsey, team leaders have access to all the metrics

collected and can use them to track progress and assess feedback in

real time. On the basis of this data, they can—and are expected to

—make improvements. We empower our middle managers to make

changes and to run their own experiments. For example, depending

on where they are in the course of a project, or depending on changes

in team-sentiment data, they might decide to modify their colocation

model from being in-person every other week to being in-person for two

# straight weeks each month.

# HBR / Spotlight / New Rules for Teamwork

To facilitate continuous learning, we’ve created a Way We Work center

of excellence. This is a centralized group of 14 full-time employees

who are responsible for driving the WWW operating system. They also

experiment with innovative practices and monitor the relevant ﬂows of

data to improve the way teams work. The center can step in if a team is

struggling. For example, regional WWW support staﬀ may join a team’s

retrospectives to discuss what could have been done better. They also

may look at the patterns across teams to identify improvements and

## share best practices, particularly with regard to the rapid adoption of

# new technologies, such as generative AI.

Consider what’s happening with the World Economic Forum’s Digital

## Lighthouse Network. This community of cutting-edge manufacturers

applies digital technologies to continuously improve the performance

of cross-functional teams. For example, Bosch China incorporates rapid

## prototyping and testing of new digital tools into standard procedures

to help its teams continuously improve speed and quality. Managers

at Hindustan Unilever’s Dapada factory use an app to track real-time

performance metrics, such as worker productivity, and use the insights

to maximize output. In both cases, technology is used to enhance

teamwork, not to disrupt it.

At McKinsey, we’ve launched Lilli, a knowledge and capabilities

platform that uses generative AI to search and synthesize our entire

knowledge library. Lilli is changing the way our teams operate, by

accelerating problem-solving and giving team members more time to

# spend with clients and colleagues.

Action plan. Identify the metrics that matter most (shift-changeover

time, perhaps), hypothesize which actions could improve performance

in those areas (preassigned workstations, perhaps), and embed

## technologies in the operating system (a smart-planning app, perhaps)

to enable continuous improvement.

It’s important that teams be able to make their own improvements

—something that requires transparency and trust between company

leaders and managers. It also requires an operating system that

is ﬂexible enough for team members to easily adapt in real time.

Continuous improvement can occur only when all perspectives are

considered and all teams have access to a centralized knowledge

# repository.

Finally, it may be useful to set up a center of excellence, staﬀed with

## full-time employees with experience in analytics and operating system

design. The center’s task would be to identify the rituals, data, and

continuous learning practices that are most likely to deliver the best

outcomes for a given team.

. . .

Organizations that embrace the three principles we’ve laid out here will

ﬁnd that a feedback loop develops in which everything—from learning

to employees to clients to performance is connected. Admittedly, this

approach to teamwork requires resources, time, and accountability from

senior leaders. But the investment can yield substantial rewards: Our

research has shown that executives are ﬁve times as productive when

working in high-performing teams as they are in average ones. And

experience has shown that the most expensive team is one that is

struggling.

In a world in which working together is more complex than ever— and more diﬃcult to get right—the new science of teamwork provides

organizations with a framework for continuous learning, improvement,

# and success.

Editor’s note: This article, published in September 2024, references the fact that no U.S. commercial airline carrier has had a fatal crash since 2009. This was true at the time of publication, but on January 29, 2025, an American Airlines flight was involved in a fatal collision with a military helicopter over Washington, DC.
