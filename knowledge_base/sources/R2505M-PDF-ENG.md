Business has made huge strides in advancing economic and social

## prosperity in recent decades through innovative technologies and

new ways of working. But many of those innovations have costs. For

example, plastics are used to make many convenient and low-cost

consumer products, but they create huge problems for both terrestrial

and marine ecosystems and ﬁnd their way into thousands of kinds of

animals, including humans. Fracking technology has kept the price of

oil low, but it has harmful eﬀects on water resources and contributes

to air pollution and other environmental problems. In ﬁnance, credit

default swaps were invented to help investors hedge credit risk, but they

ended up precipitating the 2008 global ﬁnancial crisis.

## Although the unforeseen consequences of innovation can to some

extent be mitigated retrospectively through regulation and tax policy,

we believe that a better approach is to avoid them in the ﬁrst place by

thinking more carefully about how innovation is done.

In this article we’ll look at the strengths and weaknesses of the

two dominant approaches that businesses apply to innovation—

breakthrough thinking and design thinking—which often produce

## socially and environmentally dysfunctional outcomes in complex

systems. To avoid them, innovators should apply systems thinking, a

methodology that has been around for decades but is rarely used today.

It addresses the fact that in the modern economy every organization is

## part of a network of people, products, ﬁnances, and data, and changes

in one area of the network can have side eﬀects in others. For example,

recent attempts by the U.S. government to impose tariﬀs on foreign

imports have had ripple eﬀects on the supply chains of major products

like cars and iPhones, whose components are sourced from multiple

countries. The tariﬀ plans have also led to a spiral of complex and

## unpredictable reactions in ﬁnancial markets.

Systems thinking helps predict and solve problems in dynamic,

interconnected environments. It’s especially relevant to innovation for

sustainability challenges. Electric vehicles, for example, have attracted

a lot of investment, notably in China, because they are seen as a

green technology. But their net eﬀect on carbon emissions is highly

contingent on how green a country’s power supply is. What’s more,

their technology requires raw materials whose processing is highly

polluting. Solar panels also look like an environmental silver bullet, but

the rapidly growing scale of their manufacturing threatens to produce a

tsunami of electronic waste. Truly sustainable technology solutions for

environmental challenges require a systems-led approach that explicitly

recognizes that the beneﬁts of an innovation in one part of the planet’s

ecology may be outweighed by the harm done elsewhere.

In this article we’ll oﬀer a set of principles that can guide companies

in applying systems thinking to complex problems. Our advice is based

## on our work at Innovation North, a research-practice initiative at Ivey

Business School in London, Canada, in which we collaborated with

## over 30 major companies on more than a dozen large projects and

numerous agile sprints. Drawing on insights from that work, we’ll

compare the pros and cons of the breakthrough, design, and systems

thinking approaches.

# Three Modes of Innovation

## Perhaps the most popular approach to business innovation

is breakthrough thinking. It’s the 10x, winner-takes-all model

characterized by Mark Zuckerberg’s mantra to “move fast and break

things.” Here the innovator, typically an entrepreneur armed with a new

piece of technology, ignores existing relationships, norms, and even

laws to create a better product.

For example, when Google set out to improve its search engine, it

didn’t ask permission to make use of people’s personal information.

## Uber didn’t work with local authorities and taxi companies when it

launched its services in new cities—it just did it. The mindset of these

and other Silicon Valley companies is to move forward and worry about

the consequences later. Like Alexander the Great, they make progress

by slicing through the Gordian knot of a complex problem, rather than

attempting to unpick it.

When it works, breakthrough thinking delivers huge rewards for its

practitioners. But it can also create a lot of collateral damage. When

Google rode roughshod over privacy and IP laws, it became the

target of a signiﬁcant public outcry and found itself facing many

legal challenges. Uber put many taxi drivers out of business, and its

gig workers lack many of the beneﬁts and protections of full-time

## employees. Typically, the extent of damage from breakthrough thinking

is highest when it is applied to “wicked problems”—those that are

constantly changing and hard to deﬁne and whose solutions involve diﬃcult trade-oﬀs. The more complex the ecosystem around the

problem, the more likely it is that the solution will impose economic

and social costs. So while breakthrough thinking is ideal if the problem

is clearly bounded—like getting a rocket into space—it won’t work well

when it comes to, say, ﬁxing the U.S. healthcare and education systems.

Angie Quintanilla Coates creates bright, geometric compositions that are inspired by her Mexican heritage and offer a message of optimism.

The second common innovation approach, design thinking, was

popularized in the 1990s by companies like IDEO. It has become the go-

## to methodology for consultants and innovation teams, especially when

the context is complex and features multiple interconnected actors

with divergent goals. Design thinking cuts through that complexity

by focusing primarily on the users of the product or service being

designed. Innovators study people in the contexts in which they

will use an oﬀering, empathize with them, divine their unarticulated

needs, and then seek to reshape products and processes in ways that

improve their experience. Rather than slicing through the Gordian knot,

design thinkers focus on one strand in the knot (the user) and ignore

# everything around it.

Design thinking has a track record of success, but it too has signiﬁcant

downsides as the obsessive focus on the user creates knock-on problems

for other parties. For example, Airbnb solved a problem for homeowners

and vacationers, but it created a host of problems for local communities.

The third approach, systems thinking, emerged from the pioneering

## work of theoretical biologist Ludwig von Bertalanﬀy, computer scientist

Jay Forrester, and others. It had its heyday in the 1990s with the

## publication of Peter Senge’s bestseller The Fifth Discipline. Systems

thinking recognizes and embraces the complexity of organizational

problems, rather than seeking to simplify them. It leads to innovations

that make an entire system more sustainable and resilient, avoiding

the side eﬀects and collateral damage sometimes seen in the other

two approaches. At its best, systems thinking generates more-creative

## solutions and greater engagement in organizational ecosystems.

Design thinkers tend to start the innovation process by focusing on

the customer’s problem, and breakthrough thinkers often start with

the idea. But systems thinkers start by zooming out to understand

the system that the innovation will be part of before they zoom in

to solve the problem. That approach can lead to nonobvious answers. When facing the problem of traﬃc congestion, for example, a design

thinker might widen or add roads. A breakthrough thinker might deploy

technology to dynamically reroute drivers. A systems thinker would

eschew those short-term solutions, realizing that making it easier to

drive would result in a perverse incentive for people to drive more. The

systems thinker might choose the counterintuitive solution of making traﬃc move even more slowly while increasing public transportation

options. The short-term increases in congestion could be exactly what is

needed to discourage people from driving and lessen congestion in the

# long run.

Despite its beneﬁts, systems thinking remains the least common mode

of innovation, largely because it is a slower and more complex way to

solve a problem. In the traditional approach to systems thinking, the

ﬁrst task of the systems thinker is to identify and model all the ﬂows,

## interactions, and feedback loops in the system in question. This can

be a daunting—and sometimes futile—task in a fast-changing world in

which models may never accurately reﬂect reality. And the traditional

systems-thinking innovator who spends time ﬁguring out exactly how

the Gordian knot is tied is almost guaranteed to be overtaken by a

design thinker or a breakthrough thinker who simply slices through it or

# focuses on only one strand.

For these reasons, systems thinking may seem infeasible, even in the

age of AI and quantum computing. So why are we advocating for it?

## A Streamlined Approach to Systems Thinking

To reap the advantages of systems thinking you don’t need to precisely

model a complex adaptive system. Instead, you can develop a general

understanding of critical patterns in the system and then collaborate

with actors in the ecosystem to test simple ideas. The goal is to

experiment, not to make wholesale, potentially catastrophic changes. A

good nudge will often inspire new ideas that can transform the system.

Our streamlined approach to systems thinking has four key steps.

- 1. Deﬁne your desired future state. Standard practice in design

thinking, and to some extent in breakthrough thinking, is to address

the “job to be done” or the “unarticulated need” of the customer.

Construction workers don’t want a drill; they want a hole in the wall.

Music lovers don’t want to own recordings of their favorite songs; they

just want to listen to them. Systems thinking, by contrast, focuses on

the company’s role in some desired future state—one that cannot be

achieved without changes to the many diﬀerent parts of the system.

In our workshops we start by helping a company articulate its North

Star—what it wants the system to deliver—and what its own role will

be in that new system. This helps the company frame discussions with

the stakeholders that will also have roles in the future state and whose

cooperation is needed for the system—and the company—to progress

toward the North Star. It also keeps innovation activities within the

system from going awry. Disparate groups of individuals (within the

same organization or from diﬀerent organizations) can build on one

another’s eﬀorts so that innovation doesn’t become a disconnected or

conﬂicting set of activities.

Design thinking cuts through complexity by focusing primarily on the users of the product or service being designed.

Consider the case of Maple Leaf Foods. In 2019, then-CEO Michael

McCain launched an eﬀort to refresh the Canadian meat-processing

company’s purpose. He recognized that while the processed-food

industry served consumers by creating cheap and tasty products, it

## largely ignored collateral long-term damage to human health from

addictive products that contributed to obesity and increased cancer

risks. Sooner or later, he believed, those societal costs would have to be

addressed by the industry. What would the implications be for Maple

# Leaf as a meat processor?

McCain asked executives and employees to think big, think audaciously,

and think about the future. They decided to become “the most

sustainable protein company on Earth.” No longer would Maple Leaf

Foods be a meat-processing company. Its fundamental role would be

to provide protein within a more environmentally sustainable and

# healthier food-production system.

This North Star captured Maple Leaf’s new role in the food industry,

how it would be fulﬁlled, and how the system itself would need

to change. Raising livestock and processing meat impose severe

environmental costs; the increasingly urgent need to oﬀset those costs

is likely to trigger regulation and taxes, making the traditional meat-

processing business far less attractive. By embracing sustainability

and reframing its North Star as protein processing rather than meat

processing, Maple Leaf explicitly positioned itself to adapt to an

## environment ripe for innovation in insect proteins and plant-based

# proteins.

A simple, well-articulated purpose such as Maple Leaf’s can be

## transformative. In the classic 1960 HBR article “Marketing Myopia,” Ted

Levitt famously explained that the reason railway companies went out

of business was that they thought of themselves as railway companies.

Had they seen themselves as transportation companies or mobility

companies, they might have found a second life. As the article states,

the key to a good articulation of the desired end state lies in focusing on

the fundamental role that the company plays in its system rather than

the products it currently makes.

Once a company has identiﬁed its desired end state, it must then reach

out to partners throughout the business system to win their buy-in to its

new vision. In the case of Maple Leaf, executives and managers worked

with their trade association, the Meat Institute, to create the Protein

PACT to promote sustainable agriculture practices among farmers,

## ranchers, packers, and processors across North America. The CEO

of the Meat Institute has commended Maple Leaf’s “partnership and

generosity in sharing its expertise with peer processor companies of all

## sizes for the advancement of the whole industry.”

In the course of their outreach, companies should expect resistance or,

perhaps more commonly, indiﬀerence, as a company’s desired end state

may seem irrelevant to some stakeholders. That brings us to the next

# principle.

- 2. Frame the problem, reframe it, and repeat. Breakthrough thinkers

and design thinkers invest time in identifying the right problem and

then ﬁxate on it until it is solved. Systems thinkers recognize that there

is often no single way to deﬁne a complex problem and that they’ll need

to reframe the deﬁnition iteratively to engage stakeholders who may

experience a system’s dysfunctions diﬀerently. The trick is to ﬁnd out

how problems that your ecosystem partners are experiencing relate to

the problem you are trying to solve. In only a very few cases will you

ﬁnd that wicked problems like sustainability don’t aﬀect your system

# partners.

Consider our experience advising the University of Guelph. Located

in Ontario, one of Canada’s agricultural heartlands, the university was

seeking to attract more grants to carry out research in regenerative agriculture, in which producers strike a balance between eﬃcient

farming and sustainable practices. Leaders at the university believed

they could best attract funding by showing the impact of their work.

They asked us to help them incubate new ventures (involving Guelph

researchers, farmers, and local entrepreneurs) that applied agricultural

technologies to tackling climate change.

As we embarked on the work, we realized that although farmers cared

about climate change, the issue was not top of mind for them. We had diﬃculty engaging them because they had more urgent day-to-day

challenges, such as planting, harvesting, and ensuring strong yields.

We decided to reframe the problem from climate change to soil health.

The reasoning was that soil health is more central to farmers’ daily

reality while still being deeply related to climate change. Healthy soil

requires rich and diverse populations of microbes. Climate change

causes soil to degrade, making it less eﬀective at capturing carbon

and at supporting biodiversity, among other harmful eﬀects. Those

## eﬀects in turn exacerbate climate change in a vicious feedback loop.

In other words, industrial farming experiences the cost of climate

change through its impact on soil quality. If farmers understood the

relationship between soil quality and climate change, we ﬁgured, they

would be more interested in the university’s research.

With this reframing, more farmers answered our calls and participated

in the workshops with other stakeholders. The work resulted in a

number of innovations, from low-tech solutions, such as oﬀering sheep

for hire to serve as natural grazers and fertilizers, to high-tech ones,

such as developing and applying iron oxide nanoparticles to the soil.

The initiative also served to validate and accelerate the deployment of

Susterre Technologies’ high-pressure water system for planting seeds,

allowing farmers to maintain crop cover, which sequesters more carbon

than tilling soil does.

- 3. Focus on ﬂows and relationships, not products or services. Most

innovators focus their energy on ﬁnding a product or service that will

solve the problem they’ve identiﬁed. And from a user’s perspective,

it is much easier to make sense of the innovation when it comes in

the form of a physical object—for example, Meta’s new smart glasses

## or Braun’s integration of internet-enabled technologies into its electric

# toothbrushes.

However, an innovation need not be a new product, service, or feature

to solve a problem. Changes to the ﬂows or relationships among actors

can be just as eﬀective, either by reducing friction to speed things up or

adding friction to slow down some parts of the system.

Consider insurance companies, which face increasing costs as property

claims rise owing to the growing magnitude and frequency of

climate-change-related weather events. The contractors that insurance

companies hire often throw damaged materials into landﬁlls and

rebuild houses with new materials that draw down natural resources.

All of this contributes to even more climate change.

Co-operators, a leading ﬁnancial services and insurance company in

Canada, knew that it had to disrupt the ﬂow of damaged materials to

landﬁlls and improve the ﬂow of restored materials back into homes.

It developed a resiliency and sustainability strategy and identiﬁed

speciﬁc initiatives that would help its clients and communities rebuild

in ways that would reduce waste and prevent future losses. For example,

Co-operators introduced “drying in place” for homes that experience

damage from clean water. Instead of stripping out and replacing

drywall and ﬂoorboards, vendors bring in high-powered fans to remove

moisture from houses, preventing mold problems and allowing owners

to return to their homes within 72 hours. What’s more, through its

new “soft contents” cleaning process, Co-operators can also restore

owners’ furniture, clothes, and other possessions, thereby saving items

of sentimental value and reducing materials sent to the landﬁll.

Systems thinkers reframe the definition of a complex problem iteratively to motivate stakeholders who may experience a system’s dysfunctions differently.

Co-operators built sustainability requirements into its vendor-selection

process to ensure that when homeowners experience a claims event,

they can more easily choose a vendor that has embedded sustainability

principles and practices into its operations. By removing frictions

related to choosing sustainable solutions, Co-operators has been able

to save money, protect the environment, and improve customer

# satisfaction.

It’s important to note that Co-operators didn’t create any new products,

nor did it make huge investments. Rather, it worked creatively to

improve the quality of ﬂows and relationships within its existing

business system. This is fundamental to systems thinking and

## diﬀerentiates it from other approaches to innovation.

- 4. Nudge your way forward. A lot of the rhetoric on innovation focuses

## on immediate solutions: the moon shot, the silver bullet, the killer app.

Such solutions, however, usually create knock-on problems. Systems-

thinking innovators seek to create an “ecology of actions” that steadily

addresses problems within a system. They look not for leaps but for

nudges and experiments that reveal insights into the system and move

it forward, until it reaches a tipping point and evolves naturally.

Of course, design thinking shares this emphasis on behavior

and experimentation, but it retains nonetheless a focus on a

speciﬁc solution. Systems-thinking experiments are about exposing

interdependencies among partners in the ecosystem as opposed to

testing whether a product or service improves the user experience.

Consider the CSA Group, whose purpose is to advance safety,

## social good, and sustainability for Canadians through standards

development. The beneﬁts of better standards are sizable. According

## to the United Nations Environment Programme, about 37% of global

carbon emissions are associated with the built environment, of which

38% could be reduced through “circular” building techniques. CSA

embarked on a research project that applied circular design principles

to the built environment, such as adaptive reuse of buildings and

putting discarded material from buildings back into the economy.

There are many players in the built environment, including architects,

## engineers, developers, owners, and material manufacturers. Standards

are needed to get them to talk to one another so that circular design

becomes embedded in every step of the process.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Why You Need Systems Thinking Now

In working with CSA, we suggested that rather than try to brainstorm

its way to a set of new, better standards that supported its North Star

of creating a circular built environment, the organization should focus

on an ecology of small actions that covered three areas: educating

## architects, engineers, developers, and owners about the possibilities of a

circular built environment; developing new standards that permitted

reuse of materials; and ﬁnding ways to unlock small amounts of

funding for new pilot projects. We also recommended that CSA engage

a “coalition of the willing”—activists that had already bought into

the idea of a circular built environment. It should launch a few pilot

projects, and with each successful eﬀort, it could bring in more people

and more projects, with each step helping the community move closer

# to circularity.

Often the participants in a circular ecosystem have numerous ideas

about what needs to be done, but the complexity is so daunting that

they don’t know where to begin. The actions we recommended were a

way to nudge things forward, allowing participants to understand the

system better and then map out subsequent actions.

. . .

In advocating for systems thinking we do not expect that companies

or entrepreneurs will abandon the current dominant approaches to

innovation. To begin with, breakthrough thinking is essential to

technological progress. And design thinking is very eﬀective in bringing

managers closer to their customers. But when issues are complex and

aﬀect an array of stakeholders in very diﬀerent ways, those methods

may create as many problems as they solve. Meeting the wicked

challenges that society is experiencing is almost certainly beyond the

## capabilities of even the most inspired breakthrough or design thinkers.

In these situations, systems thinking provides a more robust framework

# for change.
