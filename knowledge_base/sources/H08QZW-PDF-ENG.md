Your employees are reeling from the recent company shakeup, and

the wobbly economy only adds to their unease. Now you need to bring

people together for an all-hands meeting to explain the decisions and

what comes next. There’s a lot to cover; none of it feels easy. What’s the

best way to keep the meeting productive? How can you speak honestly

about what’s hard without letting it deﬁne the conversation? And what

can you do as a leader to inspire conﬁdence in your team in the coming

# weeks?

# What the Experts Say

Between losing colleagues, adjusting to new reporting lines, and the

prospect of having to do more with less, your employees are processing a lot. What you say (and how you say it) at your next all-hands can

either oﬀer relief—or create more pressure, says Leslie DeChurch, an

organizational psychologist and Chair and Professor of Communication Studies at Northwestern University. People react to diﬃcult news on

both an emotional and rational level and “as a leader, you need to strike

a balance by addressing both,” she says. “Focus only on the rational—

budget cuts, layoﬀs, halted initiatives—and you risk coming across as

cold or distant. Lean too far into pathos—‘This is devastating,’ or ‘We’re

in trouble’—and you risk pulling people into a downward spiral.”

Your vibe should be to “meet people where they are by recognizing their

fears,” but not dwelling on them, says Theomary Karamanis, senior

## lecturer of management communication at Cornell SC Johnson College

of Business. “Good leaders acknowledge reality without hesitation.” But

they also leave room for hope and optimism about the future. Here’s

how to strike this balance.

Set a shared vision

In the wake of hard news, the purpose of an all-hands meeting is “to

create a shared mental model of where things stand now, what led to

that point, and the path the organization is on,” according to DeChurch.

People often come to the meeting with assumptions based on what

they’ve heard or read, but to move forward constructively, everyone

needs to be on the same page, she says. As you prepare what you’ll

say—and yes, bring notes—DeChurch advises being “intentional about

the message you want people to walk away with,” and how it maps

to the organization’s goals. “Getting that mental alignment is critical

because it shapes how people do their day-to-day jobs, make decisions,

and keep the work moving.” (More on this below.) Karamanis says that

your message should follow a simple arc: “Here’s what we know, here’s

what we can change, and here’s how we will move ahead together.”

# Lead with empathy

Your delivery should be direct and steady, yet your tone should be

compassionate, says Karamanis. “The key is to lead with empathy,

transparency, and authenticity.” Don’t gather people just to go through

the motions. “Employees crave reassurance and authentic presence,”

she adds. “People can tell when a town hall is just for show.” DeChurch

recommends being explicit about both the emotional weight and the

business reality of recent decisions. “Name the harm: You have to say it

and show that you understand what people are going through,” she says.

Spell out what policy and economic changes mean for your business,

then focus on how it will impact your team and the work ahead. “Talk

about the continued uncertainty,” she says. “People process disruption

emotionally before they can think through it logically. If you don’t

acknowledge what happened and why they won’t be able to move

forward with you.”

Clarify the path forward

Acknowledging diﬃculty doesn’t mean wallowing in negativity, says

DeChurch. Once you’ve said the hard part out loud, “help your team

channel their fears into productive action” by projecting “a positive

vision for the future.” She suggests gently guiding people toward

next steps by saying something like: “Our goal is to thrive and keep

making the best widgets in the world. Right now, doing that is more

complex because of these external factors. But there are opportunities

for organizations that ﬁgure out how to be resilient and adapt. Let’s

be one of them.” Your goal is to reframe the situation and help others

see a path forward, says Karamanis. “Conﬁdence is contagious when it’s

grounded in credibility and care.”

Open the floor

You shouldn’t do all the talking—far from it, says Karamanis. Your

team will likely have things they’re wondering about so be sure to

“create space for questions.” And “if the meeting is virtual and involves

## a large group, then a facilitator gathering questions or chat group

comments can be very helpful.” Pay close attention to what you hear,

advises DeChurch. “You might realize you missed a point for empathy,”

she says. “Or maybe someone will raise an operational question, or

something related to their functional job, and you’ll have a chance to

adjust and reﬁne your approach.” Most importantly, the feedback will

help you gauge whether your approach is landing. Remember: “The

biggest driver of your team’s success is their understanding of how their

role connects to the organization,” she says. And in this new context,

that connection makes all the diﬀerence.

Reawaken to purpose

This isn’t a moment for Pollyanna optimism, but DeChurch

recommends trying to end the meeting in way that leaves people feeling

a sense of clarity and purpose. “People can’t leave feeling demoralized

or scared,” she says. “They need to feel empowered.” She suggests

drawing on an example that ties to the organization’s mission and

## values. You could, for instance, share a hallway conversation with an

employee that highlights how their work connects to the bigger picture,

or a story about a customer where the team’s eﬀorts solved a real

problem. To be clear: you’re not cheerleading or sugarcoating. Rather,

you’re oﬀering “a micro moment that helps people remember why they

do what they do,” she says.

# Be available

No matter how busy you are or how jam-packed your schedule, stay

in the room. “Don’t book another meeting right after,” says DeChurch.

“Chances are there’s someone in the meeting who wanted to speak up

but didn’t feel comfortable saying it in front of the group.” So, stick

around and be there for your team. After the meeting, distribute any

materials that were discussed or referenced. And let everyone know

what to expect in terms of regular updates on the new normal. Follow

up with employees whose roles have changed. “In situations like this,

people who were once peripheral can become central, while those who

were central may feel marginalized,” says DeChurch. For example, the

ﬁnance team might now take the spotlight, while marketing and new

business development roles could be downplayed. “Make sure to talk

to the people feeling this shift most intensely,” she says. “Hear from

them and listen to their concerns.” Be honest, sincere, and inclusive,

add Karamanis. “It can be hard in times like these, but it’s the right

thing to do.”
