Tyler Smith, the founder and CEO of Puck.io, joined the Zoom meeting

and greeted Louis Saad, a venture fund partner, his largest investor,

and Puck’s lead director. It was four days before the company’s board

meeting, and they had a lot to discuss.

Just 18 months earlier Puck’s trajectory had looked fantastic. An

enterprise software company, the four-year-old start-up had completed

a $100 million funding round at a $2 billion valuation and was on track to achieve $100 million in revenue for the coming year.1 When its head count reached 500, Tyler took a lease on a large New York oﬃce space.

The goal was to take the company public in two to three years.

But then tech stocks had started to slide as the Federal Reserve began

raising interest rates to ﬁght inﬂation. IPOs were postponed, and VCs

began advising their portfolio companies to cut costs. Louis, who’d

founded two successful start-ups and a third that went bankrupt during

the Great Recession—precipitating his shift into venture capital—was

especially vocal about the need to aggressively reduce expenses and

lengthen Puck’s funding runway.

At the board’s urging, Tyler had laid oﬀ 20% of Puck’s staﬀ three months

before, with the cuts spread across all functions. Now Louis was pushing

# for a second round of downsizing.

“Thanks for the email,” Tyler said, kicking oﬀ the meeting. “I agree that

we need to bring our monthly operating expenses down even further. I

intend to do that. But I’m worried about morale. I’d like to ﬁnd another

way to cut costs.”

“I get it—I’ve been in your shoes,” Louis replied. “Your team has done

a great job of scaling up. I’ve been happy with most of your spending

## choices over the past year, especially the new oﬃce space, even though

it’s used less than we’d like. But we don’t know how long it will take

for the markets to stabilize, and personnel costs are still more than 70%

of your monthly expenses, so you have few other options. You have to eliminate some perks and—I hate to say it—reduce head count again.” 2

Louis was a persuasive presence on the board, and Tyler had embraced

his perspective in the past. But Tyler was also proud of Puck’s fun,

hardworking, performance-oriented culture. Another round of layoﬀs

might cause the team to lose faith in his leadership.

“People haven’t recovered from the last round of layoﬀs,” Tyler replied.

“We already have too few people doing too much work, and I’m

worried about burnout and talent ﬂight. Other tech companies are

reducing head count, but tech unemployment overall remains low.

Strong performers have lots of options.”

“I’m content to let the full board discuss this on Friday,” Louis said. “But I want to be transparent: I’m going to advocate for more layoﬀs. In this

environment you have to manage burn rate and runway—everything

else is secondary. If you don’t, there’s a good chance you’ll need more funding soon,3 which you may have to raise at a ﬂat or lower valuation. It will be tough to get investors to participate if they don’t see decisive

# action.”

# Runway Isn’t Everything

After Louis made his pitch at the board meeting, Tyler asked for a

couple of weeks to study the workforce and burn rate numbers and

report back. A few days later he met with Simone Ward, Puck’s chief

people oﬃcer.

“Before we discuss more layoﬀs, let’s look at where things stand

now,” Simone said, tilting her screen toward Tyler. “This is the latest

employee engagement survey.” One chart showed that the percentage

of employees who “rarely think about looking for a job at another

company” had dropped from 57% (well above the average at peer

companies) to 42% (below average). Another showed a 10% drop in

employees who said, “I see myself working here in two years.”

“When numbers start dropping like this,” Simone said, “they tend to

keep falling. We need to ﬁx this.”

# “How?” Tyler asked.

“Let’s ﬁnish talking about our retention and recruitment problems

before we start thinking about solutions,” Simone said. “Take Renee,

for example.” Renee Nichols, Puck’s VP of sales, had given notice to take

a job at Microsoft, citing concerns about Puck’s stability and the value of

# her shares.

“The problem is not just that people see stars like her leaving,” Simone said. “It’s been 10 days since we oﬀered Chris Jones the VP of growth

role, and we’re still negotiating. He’s not sure he should leave Axis even though we’re oﬀering him a higher salary and a more senior role.”

Tyler had interviewed Chris and been impressed: He was strategic, hardworking, and a great people leader. But Axis oﬀered Chris great

beneﬁts, whereas Puck’s health care plan required relatively high out-

of-pocket premiums, its 401K match was weak, and its annual bonus

plan was less generous. Chris was pushing for even more money and a

signiﬁcant equity grant to compensate.

“That’s a lot of asks when we’re cutting costs,” Tyler said.

Simone spoke evenly: “Chris’s case just illustrates a trend. Even though we’ve done a round of layoﬀs, we still face critical hiring needs, and

we’re getting feedback that our compensation and beneﬁts package aren’t competitive.” 4

Tyler frowned. “Is there more?”

“Yes—there’s Alan,” Simone said, referring to their brilliant VP of

engineering. Rivals were constantly trying to poach him and his team.

“He’s asking for a discretionary fund for selected salary increases, new

software tools, and team-building events like their annual ski trip.”

Tyler sighed. “Does he realize we’re trying to cut costs?”

“I know,” Simone said. “But if we say no, chances are he’ll leave, and lots

of his team will follow.”

“Okay, let’s try to settle a few of these things,” Tyler said. “First, let’s

go with your idea to double down on talent development programs to

improve engagement. I want people to know we’re investing in their

growth. Second, please try to stretch on Chris Jones’s equity, but let’s

build in clear performance milestones and tell him we’re committed

to improving our beneﬁts over time. Third, tell Alan he can’t have an

exclusive discretionary fund, but we will do a comprehensive review

of his top performers’ compensation. And I’ll schedule a one-on-one

meeting to get him on board.”

“Got it,” Simone said. “Have you decided what you want to do about a second round of layoﬀs?”

“Not yet,” he said. “What do you think?”

“It’s a mistake to focus exclusively on runway,” she replied. “You have to

balance that with the fact that you need a great team motivated to work here. We lost some goodwill with the ﬁrst layoﬀs. A second round will aﬀect our credibility, and it will be tough to convince the team that the

future here is bright.”

“I agree,” Tyler said. “But with the board pushing for more cuts, it’s hard

to say no.”

# Three Cost-Saving Options

Over the following week Tyler noted headlines about the many large and small tech companies5 announcing layoﬀs. Louis continued to argue that laying oﬀ 10% of the staﬀ represented an opportunity to part

ways with the quiet quitters, poor performers, and employees reluctant

to come back to the oﬃce. Puck’s new oﬃces were nearly empty most

Mondays and Fridays, and some employees weren’t coming in at all.

Simone and Ed Bills, Puck’s chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, had worked over the

weekend to put together a few scenarios for reducing the burn rate. On

Monday they asked Tyler to sit down with them, and they laid out three

options for him to consider.

“If you see no choice but to do a 10% head count reduction, we should make targeted layoﬀs, team by team, instead of an across-the-board cut that aﬀects all teams,” Simone said. “We’ll also need to adjust

the product road map to reﬂect the reality that fewer employees will

# accomplish less.”

Ed pointed to one upside of this plan: Because they’d be saving

money on salaries, they could preserve some budget for learning and

development, food, travel, and events to maintain morale. Still, Simone warned, doing layoﬀs twice within a year would have a negative impact

—and some star employees might head for the door.

As an alternative to more layoﬀs, the trio discussed another, two-

pronged approach. To reduce head count, Puck could stop replacing

departing employees and do more to manage out weak performers.

Attrition the previous year among people Puck wasn’t sorry to lose had

been low at 9%, Simone explained. But they could let that number move

up to 12%. The company could further reduce spending by cutting the

budget for events and food, removing low-usage beneﬁts and perks,

and pulling back on other areas of spending on contract and vendor

services and marketing, which had increased over the past few months.

“If we communicate about this the right way, people will understand that we’re making these sacriﬁces to avoid more layoﬀs,” Simone said. “I

think the damage to the culture and performance will be less than if we

put more people out of a job.”

“But remember,” Ed chimed in, “when you cut people costs through

attrition, the savings come more slowly and less predictably, and the

increased workload for those who stay may lead to burnout, lack of trust, and unwanted departures.” 6

He oﬀered a third option: “I love our new oﬃce space, but the reality is

that it’s nearly empty two days a week. We could move to a remote-ﬁrst

model, sublease the entire oﬃce, and ask people to work from home or

from lower-cost coworking spaces. I think that could save us roughly

$5.5 million to $6.5 million annually.”

“Those cost savings are tempting,” Tyler said, “but I still worry about

our culture and collaboration. We made it through the early days of the

pandemic, but performance really picked up when we got back to the

# oﬃce.”

Simone nodded. “True. But this could be an opportunity. If we go with

this plan, we can invest at least some of what we save in other drivers of

employee engagement, like learning and development.”

Tyler thought back to the all-hands meeting where he’d announced the ﬁrst layoﬀ—a painful memory. If he announced another round of job

cuts, putting another group of employees out of work, would he still

have credibility as a leader?

He swung by the oﬃce to pick up his laptop and then began the

walk home. He had a call scheduled with Louis for 8 o’clock the next

morning, but he still didn’t know what was best for Puck.

# Question: What should Tyler do?

# Case Study Classroom Notes

- 1. In 2020 software-as-a-service start-ups receiving Series D or later VC

funding had a median pre-money valuation of $580 million.

- 2. Are Louis’s concerns about burn rate reasonable in this climate, or is he

fixated on costs because of his past?

- 3. VC funding has dropped, in part because the number of exits declined from 1,925 deals valued at $753 billion in 2021 to 1,208 deals valued at $71 billion in 2022.

- 4. If Tyler sweetens the offer for Chris, should he worry that existing

employees who may not have received such rich deals might learn about it and be upset?

- 5. Data from Crunchbase shows that 9% of the start-ups it tracked did two rounds of layoffs in 2022. In the first quarter of 2023 the tech giants Facebook and Amazon announced second rounds of employee cuts.

- 6. Relying on attrition to cut costs can be slow and unpredictable, but there is an upside: Companies needn’t pay severance or extend benefits to employees who resign.

HBR’s fictionalized case studies present problems faced by leaders in real companies and offer solutions from experts. This one is based on a case prepared by the authors for use in a series of workshops to engage portfolio company CEOs at Thrive Capital.

## The Experts Respond: What should Tyler do?

Patrick Pettiti is the founder and CEO of Catalant Technologies, a Boston-based software company.

Tyler’s situation is relatable. The tension at Puck

among employee engagement, top-line growth,

and expenses is real. The challenge for its leaders is

ﬁnding the right balance, which is especially hard

in such an uncertain market. If I were in Tyler’s

situation, my number one priority would be to preserve capital while

ensuring that my employees had what they needed to be successful.

## Unfortunately, the attrition strategy isn’t viable, in my opinion. When

you use performance management to drive people out, as Facebook has reportedly begun doing, it looks like a rolling, unannounced layoﬀ,

which is worse than a formal one. Good managers and organizations

review and rate team members to support and improve their work, not

to reduce head count. Puck shouldn’t risk its reputation as an employer

by taking that approach.

Layoﬀs may prove necessary, but if Tyler goes that route, he needs to

choose the percentage of head count carefully and then guarantee that

the reduction will be the last one. If he’d made a deeper cut in the

ﬁrst round, his lead director might not be pushing for a second one so quickly. Two layoﬀs in a year is bad; three would be much worse.

Tyler could choose to raise capital instead. Although Puck’s trajectory

has slowed, revenue is still growing, so if cash gets really short, he might

be able to bring in more money through a ﬂat round. I wouldn’t advise

taking a signiﬁcant amount of additional ﬁnancing at a lower valuation

—a down round; that’s likely to hurt employee engagement too, because it aﬀects the value of employees’ equity.

I would also look seriously at eliminating the oﬃce. Many organizations

—including ours—have considered that option. We recognize the

importance of a place to create community and for people who prefer

not to work at home. But the reality is that most desks are empty most

days, so this is a large expense that everyone should examine.

Shan-Lyn Ma is a cofounder and the CEO of Zola, an online wedding registry and planning company.

I worry that Tyler is isolated. He’s receiving a lot

## of information secondhand from the chief people

oﬃcer about issues in which I’d expect a CEO to be

## directly involved—for example, in the hiring of a

key employee. So I’d advise him to reengage with

his top team and make this a collaborative decision.

Puck’s senior leaders should decide what to cut on the basis of their

evolving strategy. Their B2B customers will be under budget pressure

too; how should that inform the company’s priorities going forward?

This approach will help everyone understand that cash is no longer

free-ﬂowing. It will get the entire team involved in ﬁnding a solution.

And Puck’s leaders can present it to the rest of the company as a united

# front.

Relying on attrition is the riskiest of the options on the table. The

company would have no control over who might leave. It would risk

losing good people in roles that must be ﬁlled while retaining some

people who are in noncrucial ones. And the speed of attrition would be

# unpredictable.

I don’t think Puck should give up the whole oﬃce space. It has built a

successful culture, and working face-to-face enhances that. Productivity

went up when people went back to the oﬃce. Puck should consider

subleasing excess space or even sharing space with a sublessee on days

when its employees don’t come in.

That leaves layoﬀs, and at this stage I think a second round is absolutely

the right move. In fact, I’d tell Tyler to reduce Puck’s head count

by signiﬁcantly more than 10%. A minimum of 20% would be my

recommendation. The company’s burn rate relative to revenue is no

doubt too high, and most of that expense comes from people costs.

Making no change could mean running out of cash in a year with no

idea what the funding environment will look like. So Puck needs to

extend the runway—quickly.

This dynamic can be seen across the tech industry, not only at start-ups.

Facebook, Google, Amazon, and many others expanded head count

aggressively over the past few years and now have to pull back. If the world’s most proﬁtable companies are facing layoﬀs, Tyler and his team

shouldn’t feel bad about having to make them too. But communication

will be key. The leadership group needs to put policies (such as

severance) in place, clearly explain why the cuts are necessary, and then

work to motivate, engage, and develop the remaining employees—and

keep them excited about Puck’s future.
