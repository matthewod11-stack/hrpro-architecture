Lucas B. is the CEO of a well-known multibillion dollar company whose

survival was at risk at the height of the pandemic. Many analysts

had written it oﬀ. Lucas had a strategy for returning the company

to proﬁtability, which his board supported, but he was struggling to

implement it. In Lucas’s view, he was up against an array of external

obstacles. When we began working together, he resisted the idea that his

own leadership was a central part of the problem.

## HBR / Digital Article / To Coach Leaders, Ask the Right Questions

But his own leadership was exactly the problem. And not for the typical

reasons you might guess.

I have been coaching CEOs and other C-suite leaders for two decades. In

a ﬁercely complex and challenging world, I’ve found that leaders, more

than ever, need to understand how what’s going on inside themselves

is inﬂuencing their actions in the outside world. Instead, for most

corporate leaders I’ve worked with – often doers more than deep

thinkers – what’s going on internally is a vast unexplored territory

that they haven’t valued much. That includes what they’re feeling,

where they’re feeling triggered, and how early experiences in their lives

inﬂuence the choices they’re making in the present.

## The leadership issues that most preoccupied Lucas – and many others

like him — included prioritization, decision-making, accountability,

and aligning and empowering his team members. But our work together

focused equally on three more personal questions designed to better

understand their motivations and impulses:

- Why are you the person and leader you are?

- Who are you capable of becoming?

- What’s standing in your way?

Our premise with clients is deceptively simple: You can’t transform

a company without also transforming yourself. To be a better leader,

you must become a bigger human being. This is based on years of

experience with senior leaders who have failed in implementing new

strategies and change initiatives. Overcoming those obstacles requires

the willingness to challenge the ﬁxed beliefs, blind spots, biases, fears,

## deeply ingrained habits, and rationalizations that profoundly inﬂuence

## all of us, but mostly beyond our conscious awareness.

Leaders deceive themselves when they assume they make free and

deliberate choices. In fact, a range of studies have found that at least

43% of our behaviors — and in some cases far more — occur not by

## conscious intention, but automatically, habitually, and reactively.

The added challenge for leaders is that showing up as strong and

conﬁdent – even invulnerable – has long been considered necessary in

their roles, and core to their identity. Too often, this persona becomes

just another way to defend themselves from discomfort and pain.

Today’s leaders need to understand that openness, humility, and the

desire to grow are critical to running a modern organization.

“There were moments of heated debate where I fundamentally

disagreed with your views,” Lucas told me recently. “I would say that

90% of the time they were signs of me not being ready to make the leap.

The inﬂection points were when I was going into my core and I was

willing to listen, and eventually to evolve.”

For Lucas, that began with exploring what he stood for most deeply,

rather than being overly inﬂuenced by the desire to avoid conﬂict and

reach consensus. It also meant noticing his own tendency to step in and

micromanage. When he began to feel anxious, he would ﬁnd himself

spinning about decisions and seeking multiple iterations of the same

work from more than one person. The more he was able to observe and

accept his contrasting impulses, the better he was able to ﬁnd a balance

# between them.

As Lucas’s capacity to set clear expectations and hold his team

accountable to them increased, so did his willingness to empower others

to reach those outcomes without his direct involvement.

Lucas’s work included owning his unspoken role as the company’s “chief energy oﬃcer.” That meant recognizing that what he felt and

communicated in any given moment had a disproportionate impact on

those who worked under him, for better or for worse. With vulnerability

and transparency, he began to acknowledge his own triggers, and how

he was learning to sit with them, rather than act on them. That allowed

others on his team to feel safer in acknowledging their own struggles.

# What It Means to Be a Leader Today

Part of the modern coaching challenge is understanding that each of

us operates not from a single self, but rather from a complex dance

## between three primary selves: the child, the defender, and the core self.

This perspective is deeply inﬂuenced by Richard Schwartz (no relation)

the originator of a framework called Internal Family Systems.

The child self, which we’re born into, is our most vulnerable self. Our

defender arises early on in our lives to protect our child self from

feelings of fear, hurt, shame, vulnerability, and helplessness. For Lucas,

it was especially powerful to recognize how his defender reacted under

stress, when he felt his own value being threatened. As he was able

to connect with his more capable and measured core self, rather than

simply allowing his defender to take charge, he found that he was

calmer, more self-regulated, more reﬂective, and more able to make

considered choices.

Most corporate leaders I’ve worked with rely primarily on one source

of intelligence and insight – the mind. In fact, there are at least four

centers of intelligence, including the heart, the body, and the spirit.

Making the most fully informed decisions requires drawing on each of

# them.

Lucas, for example, found that his perspective shifted when he stepped

back from the swirl of his conﬂicting thoughts, and listened more

closely to the intelligence of his body. That meant paying more

attention to his deeper intuition rather than relying solely on his mind,

which could rationalize almost any choice he made.

## Why Human Connection Matters as Much as the Bottom Line

Many corporate leaders I’ve worked with have limited access to their

hearts — meaning sensitivity to their own feelings and emotional needs,

and empathy for the feelings and needs of others. This is especially

true of leaders who are motivated primarily by external rewards such as

money, power, and recognition, which are the predominant signiﬁers of

# value in most corporate environments.

Andrew K., for example, is a senior leader who measured himself

almost exclusively based on his company’s bottom line. He felt safe

and comfortable in the objective world of numbers. Awakening the

intelligence of his heart began with his willingness to explore the fears

and discomfort that arose when he turned his attention to what he was

feeling, and how he aﬀected others.

Over time, Andrew discovered that he had been holding his desire for

more human connection at a distance, believing that it would make him

more vulnerable, and get in the way of his external goals. As he allowed

himself to have more personal relationships with colleagues, he also

found that collaboration with them became easier, and that conﬂicts got

resolved more rapidly.

## The fourth center of intelligence, the spirit, refers to the wider

perspective that emerges when leaders ﬁnd the right balance between

taking care of their own needs, and taking care of others.

## HBR / Digital Article / To Coach Leaders, Ask the Right Questions

Paulina B. is the CEO of a large nonproﬁt. The clients that her

organization serves have long been a powerful source of spiritual energy

for her. When we began working together during Covid, she was feeling

deeply burned out, to the point that she was considering leaving her job.

As we explored her experience, Paulina began to see that her defender

arose whenever she felt she was falling short of perfection — in the form

of a relentless self-critic who found her wanting. The louder that voice

became, the harder she pushed herself, the more involved she got in

details, and the more dispirited she became.

We focused together on a very basic question: What fuels your energy,

and what depletes it? By giving herself permission to explore the

answers, Paulina discovered that jumping into every problem in the

organization served her perfectionism, but often prevented her from

investing in the parts of her job that she found most nourishing.

Chief among them were the energy she derived spending time in the

ﬁeld with employees and clients, and interacting with leaders of other

# organizations.

The paradox of working with CEOs and senior leaders, I’ve found, is that

the more they’re able to accept and embrace the parts of themselves

they’ve previously disowned, the less they have to defend. The core

work of a modern executive coach is helping clients to understand

themselves more deeply – to tolerate more of the truth until it can set

them free. That begins with the simplest of questions: “What am I not

seeing?”
