Choosing a cofounder can be a make-or-break decision for startups. On

one hand, cofounders can bring needed skillsets and other resources

that an individual founder may lack. On the other hand, however,

cofounder relationships can be a source of immense conﬂict that can

prove fatal for a startup. For example, recent evidence suggests that up

to 43% of founders are ultimately forced to buy out their cofounder due

## to interpersonal rifts and power struggles.

The ideal scenario, of course, is to ﬁnd a cofounder who has the proper

skills and is also interpersonally compatible. But in reality, this can be

very diﬃcult to ﬁnd. Founders often struggle to convince others to leave

paid employment to work full-time on a new and untested startup idea.

Finding someone who not only wants to join a startup but also has

the necessary skillsets and is compatible with you — i.e. ﬁnding your

business soulmate — is exceedingly diﬃcult.

What makes it so diﬃcult to ﬁnd a cofounder? And what increases

the chances of ﬁnding one? To better understand these questions, we

collected data from the Y Combinator Cofounder Matching platform,

which is essentially a dating website for ﬁnding business partners.

Prospective partners create a proﬁle on the site and can swipe left

or right on potential business partners. We analyzed data on more

than 9,000 proﬁles on the site and performed text analysis on

their descriptions of the ideal cofounder, looking for whether they

focused more on skillsets, interpersonal compatibility, or both. We also

conducted a separate experiment with 769 individuals in which we presented them with a set of hypothetical cofounders that diﬀered in

skillsets and interpersonal traits (values, personality, etc.) and asked

them to choose their preferred one. In addition, we collected transcripts

of conversations between another 147 individuals participating in a

cofounder meetup event and manually reviewed each transcript to see

whether they focused more on skillsets or interpersonal compatibility

# during their conversations.

We found a key diﬀerence between lead founders (i.e., the individuals

who had an idea and were looking for a partner to join them) and the

cofounders (i.e., the individuals who were considering joining the lead

founder). While both the lead founder and cofounders valued skillsets

and interpersonal compatibility to some extent, they did not value each

to the same degree. More speciﬁcally, the lead founders prioritized

## skillsets and de-emphasized interpersonal compatibility, whereas the

cofounders prioritized interpersonal compatibility and de-emphasized

# skillsets.

This mismatch between lead founders and cofounders was evident

across all our datasets and studies. Why is this the case? And what

can lead founders do to overcome this mismatch and successfully form

# partnerships?

We found that these two types of people approach the cofounder formation process with diﬀerent mindsets, with lead founders more

focused on immediate execution and potential cofounders more

focused on whether joining the entrepreneur would be preferable to

whatever they are currently doing. This creates a mismatch between

priorities in terms of cofounder compatibility, which complicates the

# team formation process.

However, we also found that these complications were avoided when

the individuals better understood the mindsets and motivations of

their counterparts. We suggest lead founders and cofounders can better

understand each other’s mindsets to create successful partnerships by

taking the following steps:

- 1. Put yourself in the other person’s shoes.

Lead founders and cofounders evaluate potential partnerships with entirely diﬀerent mindsets and motivations. Lead founders, for

example, have already given a lot of thought to the particulars of

the business idea before they seek cofounders. They may already be

immersed in tangible tasks that demand immediate attention and the

nitty-gritty details of transforming an idea into a viable business. They

are grappling with the pressing needs of their idea and are searching for

someone who can seamlessly contribute to the concrete tasks at hand.

Their focus revolves around execution and turning concepts into reality.

It’s diﬀerent for cofounders. They often do not yet understand the

nature of the idea in great detail, and their view of the company

and its deﬁning features are much blurrier. In many cases, they are

likely to already be employed somewhere else. So, rather than being

driven by “push” factors to ﬁx problems with the startup like the lead

founder might, cofounders are instead driven by “pull” factors: They are

considering whether joining the initiator would be preferable to their

# current job.

Thus, whereas lead founders are more task-driven when ﬁnding

business partners, cofounders are usually more motivated by curiosity

or the possibility of ﬁnding a partner for work that they enjoy more

than their current position. Cofounders are more focused on working

with someone they enjoy, whereas lead founders are more focused on

fulﬁlling a speciﬁc need that must be satisﬁed. In other words, lead

founders think in terms of needs when evaluating potential partners,

whereas cofounders think in terms of wants. Cofounders thus have

more ﬂexibility in terms of the types of lead founders they may join,

since they are not bound to a particular idea or immediate task.

These diﬀerences are important to remember, and both lead founders

and cofounders would do well to put themselves in the other person’s

shoes. Seeing it from their perspective can help potential partners

understand why the person they are talking to is emphasizing or de-

emphasizing certain aspects during your conversation. This leads to our

- 2. Don’t neglect the interpersonal aspect in initial conversations.

In one of our studies, we analyzed business partnerships being formed

in real time. From 2016 to 2017, we collected data at networking events

held at an incubator at a prestigious university in the Midwest. The

purpose of the networking events was to form business partnerships,

and attendees included both lead founders and potential cofounders.

Prior to the networking events, participants wore audio recording

devices, allowing us to capture the content of their conversations. We

also collected data on which individuals actually formed partnerships

# after the events.

We found that some lead founders focused almost solely on the business

idea and the needed skillsets during their conversations. Others,

instead, focused primarily on interpersonal factors (i.e., getting to know

the person, discussing mutual interests, etc.), and devoted only a small

amount of time during the initial conversations to discuss the business idea and/or needed skillsets. We found stark diﬀerences between these

two groups in terms of business partnerships actually being formed.

It may seem counterintuitive that a focus on interpersonal topics

rather than business speciﬁcs is more persuasive, but our data provides

compelling evidence that this is the case. Those who focused primarily

on interpersonal factors during the initial conversations were 70% more

likely to ﬁnd and stick with a business partner.

This does not mean that lead founders can never discuss skillsets;

many of the successful conversations in our sample did include a

discussion of skillsets, but those that were successful also established an

interpersonal connection by, for instance, discussing shared interests,

## hobbies, communities, contacts, or values.

- 3. Consider co-creating the idea with a partner.

There are two basic ways to start a business partnership. In the ﬁrst type

that we’ve focused on so far, a lead founder comes up with an idea and

then seeks out a cofounder who is willing to help. Most of the teams in

our data fell in this group.

## However, the second basic type of business partnership occurs

when two individuals decide to become business partners and

then subsequently co-create the idea together. This is the approach

Konstantin Guericke, one of the cofounders of LinkedIn, recommends.

In an essay on the story of LinkedIn’s launch, Guericke explains that the

team started as a group of people who wanted to work together, but were

not quite sure on what. They batted around many ideas before deciding

on an online network that would connect professionals. In telling this

story, Guericke shared:

When you have nothing, it is almost impossible to convince others to

join your crazy mission. It’s a Catch-22: people won’t join your team if

the idea sounds too crazy, and if they do join it might mean your idea

is not really crazy enough to make a dent in the universe. But when

people come up with a crazy idea together, they have equal stakes in

it. When your team works together to choose and nurture an idea,

you will stick together through the inevitable dark times.

In other words, one way to avoid many of the diﬃculties of ﬁnding

a business partner is by ﬁrst ﬁnding someone who you would like to

partner with. By coming up with an idea together that you can both

agree on and believe in, you can avoid many of the diﬃculties of ﬁnding

a business partner and the potential conﬂicts that can come up down

# the line.

On that note, it is worth noting that the results of our analysis may not

apply to these types of situations in which cofounders meet organically

(prior friends, coworkers, etc.) and come up with the idea together.

In these situations, interpersonal compatibility is likely already high

given the two cofounders already know each other. At the same time,

two cofounders who met organically may be less likely to possess

complementary skillsets as the match was likely more serendipitous

rather than thought-out and deliberate. Our ﬁndings are likely most

relevant to situations where one founder comes up with an idea and

then searches out cofounders to help.

. . .

In short, ﬁnding a business partner is never easy. However, better

understanding the mindsets and motivations of your counterpart —

whether you are a lead founder or cofounder — will help you in the

# journey.
