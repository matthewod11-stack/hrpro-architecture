The past few years have been exhausting for many Western

organizations. Civil strife seems to be widespread, with clashes

over racial, gender, and income inequality; rising authoritarianism;

immigration; climate change; and foreign wars deepening the divides

# in an increasingly polarized society.

It’s perhaps inevitable that in this time of growing discord, conﬂict

at work would increase too. A recent Society for Human Resource

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Conflict-Intelligent Leader

Management survey of 1,622 U.S. workers showed that 76% had

witnessed acts of incivility in the past month, with 21% experiencing

it personally. Nearly half said they had encountered it weekly, and 13%

said they had encountered it daily. Forty-four percent believed incivility

would worsen in 2025, and 26% said they were likely to leave their

jobs because of it. With employee engagement at a low, contentious

interactions at work are estimated to cost businesses more than $2

## billion a day in productivity losses and absenteeism.

Polarization and increased incivility have put CEOs under intense

scrutiny too. Today their every utterance risks backlash from

employees, customers, politicians, or all three. But in this era leaders are

often expected to wade into the fray. Research from Weber Shandwick

published in 2023 revealed that 65% of employees believe that their

companies have a responsibility to speak up about critical social

issues, and upwards of 80% of consumers think that companies should

take stands. Some leaders have a diﬃcult time threading this needle,

however, which may explain why in the ﬁrst quarter of 2024, 622 CEOs

announced their resignations—50% more than quit in the ﬁrst quarter

of 2023, which was already a record year for departures.

CEOs and other corporate leaders are by no means the ﬁrst to navigate

thorny conﬂicts, however. Over the past 30 years, I and my colleagues

## at the Morton Deutsch International Center for Cooperation and

Conﬂict Resolution at Columbia University have drawn insights from

## psychology, peace and conﬂict studies, and complexity science—and

conducted scores of surveys and laboratory, case, and ﬁeld studies—in order to identify the most eﬀective conﬂict-engagement strategies of leaders, mediators, and peacemakers. Those eﬀorts led us to create a

set of principles that will help leaders guide their organizations through

# even the most vexing situations.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Conflict-Intelligent Leader

Our research reveals that leaders need four core competencies to

navigate conﬂict. The ﬁrst, and most foundational, is self-awareness

and self-regulation—recognizing and managing your personal reactions

so that you can remain calm and engage strategically. The second

competency, strong social-conﬂict skills, which include deep listening,

balancing advocacy with collaboration, and checking biases, helps

leaders reach constructive solutions. Situational adaptivity—knowing how to tailor strategies to ﬁt diﬀerent types of conﬂict and when

to lean in, step back, or adjust for cultural nuances—is also crucial.

Finally, systemic wisdom allows leaders to address chronic, deeply

rooted conﬂicts by seeing the bigger picture, embracing complexity, and

learning from past successes and failures.

Leaders who demonstrate the four core competencies have what we

call a high conﬂict-intelligence quotient (CIQ). Our research indicates

that such executives not only excel at dispute resolution but also create

workplace environments where team members experience greater job

satisfaction, empowerment, and well-being. These leaders also tend

to build organizational cultures marked by greater creativity and

constructiveness and, according to research by Nicholas Redding,

the ability to navigate stress and uncertainty. Notably, our research

has found signiﬁcant correlations between employees’ perceptions of

leaders’ conﬂict intelligence and the psychological safety they feel at

work—whether their environment is characterized by mutual trust,

## transparent communication, professional respect, and support for

calculated risk-taking.

It’s easy to confuse emotional intelligence and conﬂict intelligence,

but they’re distinct concepts with unique applications. Emotional

intelligence refers to the ability to recognize, understand, and manage

your own emotions as well as the emotions of others. It involves skills

## like empathy, self-regulation, and social awareness. Conﬂict intelligence

encompasses a broader set of competencies aimed at managing and

resolving disagreements. While emotional intelligence is a crucial

component of conﬂict intelligence and enables people to engage

constructively and adapt, conﬂict intelligence includes understanding

## social dynamics, situational factors, and systemic forces that inﬂuence

# disputes.

The question is, what, exactly, do high-CIQ leaders do during

conﬂicts? What strategies do they employ to successfully manage these

encounters? Our research reveals seven principles that are particularly

helpful in volatile situations. They often are apparent in the work of master mediators and peacemakers of diﬀerent stripes—people who work in business, community organizations, and global aﬀairs. In

this article I’ll draw on examples from those arenas to highlight how eﬀective leaders deploy them.

[ 1 ]

# Lay the Groundwork

Before warring parties ever enter the same room, expert mediators

spend months identifying key players, establishing communication

channels, and building trust with both sides. Skilled leaders similarly

build a foundation for resolving disputes by strengthening their

## organization’s work climate and conﬂict-engagement skills and

infrastructure—before disagreements come to a head. And when a

conﬂict erupts, they choose their moves carefully. Like diplomats who

know that the ﬁrst 48 hours of a crisis can determine the nature of

relationships for years, they understand that their initial responses will

shape all that follows.

George Mitchell’s work on the Good Friday Agreement in Northern Ireland in the 1990s illustrates the eﬀectiveness of laying the

groundwork in a peace process. When Mitchell arrived in Northern

Ireland, he faced a centuries-old conﬂict and communities divided

by religion, politics, and blood. What distinguished his approach was

extraordinary patience and methodical foundation building. He spent

the ﬁrst months doing nothing but listening, conducting more than a

hundred in-depth interviews with people across Northern Irish society

—including paramilitary leaders, clergy, politicians, and ordinary citizens aﬀected by “The Troubles.”

Mitchell’s signature contribution was the Mitchell Principles—a set

of commitments to democracy and nonviolence that created a moral

framework for negotiations. Instead of demanding immediate solutions,

he acknowledged that peace required building blocks. His team

meticulously documented every agreement and concession, creating

what he called “gardens of agreement” in a landscape of conﬂict.

A decade later, Alan Mulally took a similar approach in building a

positive organizational environment at Ford. When he took the helm,

in 2006, the company was facing a $12.7 billion loss and struggling

with a deeply entrenched culture of distrust and secrecy. Fearing

blame or punishment, executives hid problems in their divisions until

they turned into crises. Mulally spent his ﬁrst months establishing

## new communication channels and trust-building mechanisms. His

signature innovation was the business-plan review meeting, a weekly

forum where division executives reported their projects’ status using

a red-yellow-green traﬃc-light system. Mulally publicly celebrated the

executives brave enough to present red projects, declaring, “You can’t

manage a secret.” This seemingly simple change catalyzed a profound

cultural shift toward transparency and cooperation. Mulally’s patient foundation building paid oﬀ as the company’s stock price rose from

$1.01 in 2008 to more than $18 by 2014. But more important, it

transformed a culture that was notoriously confrontational into one

focused on joint problem-solving, which continued long after his

# departure.

[ 2 ]

# Grow Rapport

Seasoned negotiators create what diplomats call “positive peace”

between the parties in a dispute: They don’t just end the conﬂict; they

help foster strong collaborative relationships. They incorporate into

agreements measures that will increase each side’s conﬁdence in the other, knowing that every positive interaction will help build a buﬀer

against future crises. Mediators often pair ceaseﬁre talks with initiatives

like cultural exchanges or joint economic projects that boost trust and

# resilience, for instance.

Business leaders can adopt this approach by designing meaningful joint

ventures that bring people together. Such projects promote positive

engagement and build a rapport that can endure, and even grow, during

moments of tension. The goal is to establish a high ratio of positive to

# negative interpersonal interactions.

The Nobel Peace Prize winner Martti Ahtisaari’s work on the Aceh Peace Process in Indonesia after the devastating 2004 tsunami oﬀers

a good example. The disorder and distress following the disaster

could have deepened the decades-long conﬂict between the Indonesian

## government and GAM (Gerakan Aceh Merdeka) separatists. But

Ahtisaari understood that natural disasters can create what scholars call

“hurting stalemates”—moments when continuing a conﬂict becomes

more costly than peace for all parties. His genius lay in transforming

## humanitarian cooperation into a political breakthrough.

Ahtisaari designed a process in which former enemies worked together

to distribute aid and rebuild communities. Like Mitchell’s “gardens

of agreement” in Northern Ireland, these partnerships created what

Ahtisaari called “islands of cooperation” that gradually expanded. He

insisted on concrete conﬁdence-building measures—joint monitoring

teams, shared reconstruction committees, combined security patrols—

that produced tangible evidence of the beneﬁts of peace. The Helsinki Memorandum of Understanding that emerged from those eﬀorts

included detailed provisions for natural-resource sharing, political

## participation for former rebels, and economic development—a new

# model for a lasting peace agreement.

When Microsoft acquired LinkedIn for $26.2 billion, in 2016, many

commentators expected to see another failed tech megamerger. Instead,

CEO Satya Nadella pursued an approach that would become a master

class in building positive peace between corporate cultures. Rather

than rushing to integrate the social media platform into Microsoft’s

operations, he took the counterintuitive step of maintaining LinkedIn’s

independence while carefully cultivating collaborative opportunities.

He established the Connected Apps initiative, which created speciﬁc

projects where Microsoft and LinkedIn teams could work together

voluntarily, allowing relationships to develop organically. Teams began

discovering natural synergies, from integrating LinkedIn proﬁles with

Microsoft Oﬃce to creating joint AI projects.

The result? LinkedIn’s revenues grew from $2.9 billion at acquisition

to $16 billion by 2024. More remarkably, LinkedIn retained its unique

culture while gaining access to Microsoft’s vast resources.

# Balance Discipline with Creativity

If you watch master negotiators work, you’ll notice that they seamlessly

shift between ﬁrm boundary setting and collaborative problem-solving,

between public strength and private ﬂexibility. One moment they’re

establishing clear red lines, the next they’re exploring innovative

# compromises.

The Norwegian diplomat Jan Egeland exempliﬁed neutral but

principled diplomacy during the peace negotiations in Colombia,

which ended one of Latin America’s longest-running civil wars.

Egeland understood that peace processes needed to address not

## just military issues but the underlying causes of conﬂict, and his

approach demonstrated that mediators can maintain ﬁrm positions

on human rights while still ﬁnding creative solutions for peace. His

most innovative contribution was integrating victims of violence into

the peace process. Instead of treating them as passive bystanders,

Egeland helped design mechanisms for their direct participation in

negotiations. To make sure all voices were heard, he created what he

called “parallel tracks”—one in which formal negotiations proceeded in

Havana, while regional dialogues throughout Colombia ensured local

buy-in and addressed speciﬁc community concerns.

The resulting agreement included not just strict provisions for

demobilizing the FARC guerrilla group but detailed plans for

rural development, political participation, and addressing injustices

committed during the violence. It showed that peace processes could

## balance accountability for past crimes with the need for reconciliation

# and reintegration.

For a business example, let’s turn to Tim Cook, the CEO of Apple. In

the mid-2010s the tech giant faced a deep tension between privacy

advocacy and business growth, particularly as it expanded its service

revenues. That conﬂict took place both inside and outside the company, with diﬀerent internal groups advocating for competing priorities and

external stakeholders pushing for either stronger privacy protections or

enhanced services (which required more data collection).

Cook pulled oﬀ a careful balancing act. He maintained Apple’s strict

public stance on privacy while ﬁnding creative ways to grow service

## revenues through privacy-preserving technologies. This diplomatic

dance included both ﬁrm positions (like refusing FBI requests to

unlock iPhones) and ﬂexible implementation (developing on-device

AI processing). The approach helped Apple achieve both aims—

strengthening its privacy guardrails while growing service revenues

## from $24 billion in 2016 to more than $96 billion in 2024.

# Master Adaptivity

Diﬀerent conﬂicts demand diﬀerent diplomatic tools. An approach

that works for resource disputes might fail utterly for identity-based

clashes. Expert mediators develop diverse intervention strategies—

such as shuttle diplomacy, where intermediaries carry messages

between disputing parties; multitrack engagement, which involves parallel eﬀorts across government, business, and civil society; and

peace corridors, which create designated safe zones for dialogue and humanitarian eﬀorts amid active conﬂict.

Brahimi engaged with both traditional tribal councils (jirgas) in rural

areas and government oﬃcials in urban centers. He understood that

religious authorities needed to be part of the solution and worked

to integrate Islamic principles with international humanitarian law.

conﬂict. In both Afghanistan and later Syria, he engaged neighboring

countries and regional powers, understanding that local conﬂicts often

had international dimensions that needed to be addressed for peace to

In her 12-year tenure at PepsiCo, Indra Nooyi illustrated similar

adaptivity. Nooyi faced a ﬁrestorm when she became CEO, in 2006: Soda

sales were in decline, competition from rival companies had intensiﬁed,

and consumers were demanding healthful food and beverage options.

Tensions were rising between executives in the traditional carbonated

beverages division, who were resisting change, and those overseeing

healthful products, which required new approaches. Units in emerging

markets wanted localized strategies, while the North American units

expected uniform global ones. Investors and the board were pressuring

PepsiCo to improve quarterly earnings, which conﬂicted with Nooyi’s long-term vision emphasizing healthful oﬀerings and sustainability.

These competing viewpoints led to ﬁghts over resources, marketing

## priorities, R&D, and executive compensation metrics.

To manage the disputes, Nooyi developed a variety of strategies,

balancing sustainability with action on immediate business pressures.

For the core beverage business, she maintained traditional metrics

and proﬁt-focused approaches. However, for emerging health-focused

products, she implemented collaborative development processes

involving nutritionists and consumer-advocacy groups. Environmental

initiatives were guided by sustainability frameworks, while market expansion strategies were customized for diﬀerent global regions, each

## with its own cultural and economic context.

This multifaceted approach drove remarkable results: During her tenure

# Leverage the Broader Context

When peace talks stall, experienced diplomats look beyond immediate

hostilities and try to understand the wider constellation of forces

creating tensions—and learn to work with them. They know that

sometimes the key to unlocking a bilateral dispute lies in multilateral

# engagement.

Consider Ralph Bunche’s mediation of the 1949 Arab-Israeli armistice

agreements. Bunche knew that the conﬂict couldn’t be resolved

through a single comprehensive agreement. Instead, he orchestrated

## separate but interconnected negotiations between Israel and each of

## its neighbors—Egypt, Lebanon, Jordan, and Syria. Using proximity

talks—in which parties don’t speak face-to-face but meet at the

## same conference and communicate through an impartial mediator—

to reduce tensions, he focused on practical issues like water rights

and refugees and created solutions that worked on the ground. His

innovative approach earned him the Nobel Peace Prize and established

principles for managing complex regional conﬂicts that remain relevant

# today.

When Paul Polman was the CEO of Unilever, he encountered repeated

## conﬂicts between the company’s sustainability goals and proﬁt

objectives. Recognizing that the disputes reﬂected broader issues, he

initiated what he called “systems mapping”—a comprehensive analysis

of how environmental, social, and economic factors interconnected

across Unilever’s global operations. It revealed that many sustainability

challenges were actually rooted in supply chain structures, consumer

behavior patterns, and market incentives that had evolved over decades.

“As more CEOs and world leaders recognize the systemic nature of the

challenges we face,” Polman explained, “it is also rising in importance

# on the corporate and global agenda.”

His approach transformed what appeared to be a simple conﬂict

## into an opportunity for fundamental business model innovation:

Unilever’s Sustainable Living Brands. These were products designed to

reduce environmental impact and improve social conditions through

## sustainable sourcing, ecofriendly packaging, waste reduction, water

conservation, and other kinds of initiatives. By 2019 they were growing

69% faster than the rest of the business and responsible for 75% of

its growth, demonstrating that understanding broader dynamics could

resolve seemingly intractable conﬂicts.

[ 6 ]

# Aim for Generational Peace

Master negotiators think in decades, not news cycles. Like peacemakers

who plant trees whose shade they’ll never sit under, they invest in

gradual changes that create lasting organizational harmony.

Betty Bigombe’s nearly 30-year involvement in Northern Uganda’s

peace process demonstrates how persistent, multigenerational peace

building can transform conﬂicts. Her approach to child-soldier

rehabilitation, for instance, became a model for addressing the

generational impact of conﬂict. She understood that these children

would become parents and community leaders, making their healing

crucial for long-term peace. Rather than treating them simply as victims

needing immediate help, she developed comprehensive programs that

supported their reintegration over decades. Those programs included

education, job training, psychological support, and eﬀorts to heal

# relationships with their communities.

Throughout multiple failed peace attempts and changes in political

leadership, Bigombe developed what she called “peace infrastructure”

## —networks of trained mediators, community leaders, and civil society

organizations that could continue peace-building work even when

formal negotiations stalled. Because she recognized that women often

bore the greatest burden of wars while being excluded from peace

processes, she created networks of female peacemakers across northern

Uganda, training them in conﬂict resolution and providing resources for

them at the community level. Those networks are still operating today.

## When CEO Marc Benioﬀ confronted growing divisions at Salesforce

around 2018, the challenges were complex and multifaceted. Employees

were deeply divided over the ﬁrm’s government contracts, particularly

with U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and disagreed about whether

tech companies should take stands on social issues such as immigration

enforcement. Rapid growth through acquisitions had also led to cultural rifts between diﬀerent employee populations who didn’t share the same

## expectations about corporate activism and social responsibility.

Instead of imposing immediate policies or taking rigid stances, Benioﬀ implemented what he called “ethical scaﬀolding”—institutional

frameworks for addressing controversial issues. He established

Salesforce’s Oﬃce of Ethical and Humane Use and created structured

stakeholder-input processes that included employee resource groups, external ethical advisers, and aﬀected communities. He strengthened

gender pay gaps, he implemented systematic pay-equity reviews and

committed $3 million to correcting disparities.

The results demonstrated the value of this long-term approach. By

creating multiple channels for employee input and establishing clear

frameworks for addressing controversial issues, Salesforce successfully

navigated numerous potentially divisive situations while maintaining

strong employee engagement. The company achieved an employee

retention rate in the top 10th percentile for companies of its size during

## the Great Resignation of 2022, when turnover among tech companies

rose dramatically, and its employee satisfaction scores remained high even during controversial decisions. And the measures Benioﬀ

established continue to help the company address new challenges as

they emerge, becoming a model for managing workplace polarization.

[ 7 ]

# Be Opportunistic

The most profound negotiation breakthroughs often happen because of

something unexpected—a surprise emotional encounter, unanticipated

common ground, or a crisis that reveals a shared problem. Skilled

mediators learn to watch for emotional turning points, informal

channels, surprising areas of alignment, and other subtle opportunities

that can transform conﬂicts.

## Jimmy Carter’s use of personal diplomacy at Camp David during

Middle East peace negotiations in 1978 demonstrated this principle

in action. Isolating Egyptian president Anwar Sadat and Israeli prime

minister Menachem Begin at Camp David for 13 days, Carter created

a pressure-cooker environment that forced breakthrough moments.

He famously showed Begin pictures of his grandchildren at a crucial

moment of deadlock, helping the Israeli leader reconnect with the

human implications of peace and war. Carter tapped his own religious

background to build bridges with both leaders, ﬁnding common ground

in shared Abrahamic traditions. When formal negotiations stalled,

Carter would take walks with each leader individually, using these

informal moments to explore new possibilities.

Jack Ma’s handling of the Alibaba-Yahoo partnership in 2005, when

he was the Chinese ﬁrm’s executive chairman, also illustrates this

approach. His personal relationship with Yahoo’s cofounder Jerry

Yang, built over several years, was instrumental in facilitating the U.S.

company’s $1 billion investment in Alibaba. It gave Ma opportunities to

meet Yang informally—for instance, on the Pebble Beach golf course,

where they discussed the future of e-commerce and search engines and

laid the groundwork for their partnership. Ma also established cultural

exchange programs between American and Chinese teams to improve

## their understanding of each other’s perspectives and work styles. Those

informal channels proved crucial during negotiations over Alibaba’s

independence and strategic direction, helping Ma successfully navigate

one of the most complex cross-cultural corporate partnerships in tech history. His success demonstrates that sometimes the most eﬀective

path to resolving conﬂicts lies in unexpected connections.

## Building Organizations with High Conflict Intelligence

The most signiﬁcant challenge for business leaders is transforming the

organizational culture to empower employees at all levels to manage disputes eﬀectively. By embedding conﬂict resolution skills throughout

the ranks, leaders can ensure that their organizations thrive even in the

face of internal tensions. That means moving beyond seeing conﬂict

as something to be avoided and framing it as a potential source of

energy, innovation, and growth. That shift begins with creating safe,

facilitated spaces for diﬃcult conversations about sensitive issues in

order to normalize the idea that conﬂict, when handled well, drives

# improvement rather than destruction.

Leaders can help employees adopt this attitude by modeling and

celebrating examples of successful conﬂict engagement, sharing stories

of how constructive disagreement led to breakthrough solutions, and recognizing those who have used eﬀective strategies. A recent study

by our CIQ-Leadership research team at Columbia found that in

organizations where employees rated their leaders high on CIQ, the

overall culture was more collaborative and less contentious or conﬂict-

avoidant. In other words, the positive behaviors the leaders used to

manage conﬂict were being mirrored by the employees.

Today the question for leaders isn’t whether to build conﬂict

intelligence—it’s how quickly they can begin. In a world where change

is constant and complexity is rising, the ability to manage conﬂict eﬀectively isn’t a nice-to-have skill. It’s becoming a core requirement

for organizational success. Those who master this capability won’t just

survive the storms of conﬂict—they’ll learn to sail by them.
