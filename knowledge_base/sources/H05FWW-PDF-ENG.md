The nature of change in business today differs from the past in both

magnitude and pace: Technology is disrupting fundamental business

models, forcing transformation across whole industries. According to a

## 2019 Accenture study, 71 percent of 10,000 companies in 18 industry

sectors are “either in the throes of or on the brink of signiﬁcant

disruption.” Similarly, McKinsey concluded a major study of automotive,

electronics, aerospace, and defense industries, saying, “The industrial

sectors will see more disruption within the next ﬁve years than in the past

20 years combined.”

At the same time, societal forces and new business priorities are

undercutting shareholder primacy while strengthening other stakeholder

interests. Strategic stability has fallen from its pedestal in favor of strategic

# agility.

The responses to this disruption, however, have not been matched in long-

term incentive design. Conventional plans reward executives for winning

over three years. Because companies now are vying to reshape their

business over much longer periods, executives are essentially tied to a

structure that supports only incremental change versus radical

transformation. This disconnect means a clash is inevitable.

It should come as no surprise that the directors we speak with on board

compensation committees have become increasingly concerned. Could

conventional three-year plans inadvertently encourage executives to

compromise long-term performance? Are the plans’ structures too

inﬂexible to allow for quick strategic pivots? How do stakeholder interests

ﬁt into plans that have long focused solely on ﬁnancial results? We get

these questions particularly from tech ﬁrms, which we believe are

# precursors for other industries.

The solution to the disconnect is not obvious, because the search for new

plan designs poses an apparent riddle: How do you set goals for long-term

## transformation, short-term strategic agility, and the building of

stakeholder ecosystems all at the same time? Doesn’t that require

# irreconcilable tradeoffs?

Let the Mission Guide You As it turns out, no. Not if you design your incentive plans around mission,

rather than strategy, attaching targets and incentive payouts to those goals

in a disciplined way. Your company’s mission offers consistent, yet ﬂexible,

## guidance for long-term transformation, agile course corrections, and the

## building, operation, and constant reshaping of stakeholder-rich

# ecosystems.

For effective guidance, a mission needs to answer speciﬁc questions that

can be translated into long-term, measurable goals:

- Who or what are we beneﬁting?

- What stakeholder outcomes are required to create that beneﬁt?

- How can we continuously improve those outcomes — and

# outperform competitors?

Take Southwest Airlines as a hypothetical example. Its mission is

“dedication to the highest quality of customer service delivered with a

sense of warmth, friendliness, individual pride, and company spirit.” The

vision is “to become the world’s most loved, most ﬂown, and most

proﬁtable airline.”

Southwest’s statements contain the essentials for creating outcome- and

stakeholder-based incentive measures that can be improved each year and

calibrated to outperform competitors. It makes clear that customers and

employees are among the key stakeholders to beneﬁt along with

shareholders. Company directors could tie performance to measurable

# goals, such as:

- Customer measures, such as Net Promoter Score (loyalty), customer

# satisfaction score, and/or churn rate

- Employee engagement, attitudes, satisfaction, or turnover rates

- Number of passengers or passenger miles ﬂown

- Brand strength relative to industry, over time

- Returns relative to competitors, over time

- Proﬁtability relative to competitors, over time

These measures are enduring and not linked to the particulars of the

strategy chosen for achieving them. In other words, they don’t put a

## straitjacket on agile strategic changes during long-term transformation.

Although executives will have to make short-term, either/or tradeoffs that

favor the interests of one stakeholder, these goals encourage choices that

provide a balance for long-term sustainable performance. Research by Alex

## Edmans at the London Business School and Rob Markey at Bain &

Company reinforces the importance of establishing this balance. Their

studies show that companies with high employee satisfaction and high Net

Promoter Scores materially outperform their peers.

It’s up to boards to narrow the focus to two to three mission-based

measures that will serve as the basis for a long-term incentive plan, and

then to set goals based on those measures. The goals need to be both

speciﬁc enough to guide actions and measurable enough to show

performance improvement. To complement the long-term goals, directors

should set annual incentive objectives as intermediate milestones to gauge

progress toward long-term outcomes. Using the Southwest example, this

could be the percentage of on-time ﬂights as compared to all ﬂights.

## The Evolution to a New Standard in Long-Term Incentive Pay

Particularly important, this new approach avoids today’s problematic

time-horizon conﬂicts. This change could seem like a detail, but it is in fact

central to addressing a root cause of short-termism and promoting long-

term performance. When boards annually approve a new set of three-year

goals, they of course leave in place the still-running three-year goals from

the prior two years. That creates three sets of goals, which may well

conﬂict. Instead of these overlapping goal cycles, we suggest moving to

end-to-end cycles where the goals remain constant throughout a given

cycle but in succeeding cycles the measures remain the same, while the

goals become progressively more difficult. This new approach holds

## executives accountable instead for stable long-term, outcome-based goals.

This approach also avoids problematic board-management negotiations

over which goals will anchor the incentive plan. Instead of getting paid for

hitting budgeted numbers set in a negotiating dance with the board,

executives would earn incentive payouts based on showing continuous

improvement over the prior year, and on outcompeting peers.

When it comes to payouts attached to the incentive plans, directors could

offer equity based on the achievement of the chosen, precious-few

mission-based outcomes. To assuage the concerns of shareholders, who

are always eager to know that the fortunes of executives are tied to their

stock-market-driven fortunes, pay plans could require executives to hold a

## signiﬁcant amount of stock for the long term, even beyond retirement.

With this approach to redesigning long-term incentives, the board has a

bookend approach that resolves the disconnects we have today. The

speciﬁcs of the mission on the front end tie nicely to the speciﬁcs of

incentive pay on the other. Tying long-term incentives to the mission also

allows a new, natural balance between annual and long-term incentives in

inﬂuencing executive behavior. Short-term achievements can be rewarded

## in annual bonus plans and long-term outcomes in long-term plans.

## In the era of radical strategic transformation, executives and boards may

have no choice but to consider how to make long-term incentives work

better. If companies are to respond to disruptions, if they are to remain

agile, if they are to rally stakeholders to work together to deliver

outperformance in today’s data-dependent business ecosystems, they risk

getting behind the curve if they stick with standard incentive design today,

which so prominently features three-year goal-setting processes based on

ﬁnancial measures. The company’s mission or purpose, elaborated by its

vision, can become “true north,” not just as a driver of an extension of the
