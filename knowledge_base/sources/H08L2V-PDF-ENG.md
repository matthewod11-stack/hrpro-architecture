One of the biggest challenges in strategy is overcoming what Michael

Porter called the growth trap. Simply put, in their eﬀorts to grow,

companies often undertake investments or make decisions that slowly

erode their original unique strategy or dilute the sharp boundaries that

gave the ﬁrm its original clear identity.

The St Louis-based brokerage ﬁrm Edward Jones, for example, has built

its success over the years by targeting conservative individual investors

in rural America, serving them through its vast national branch

network, with each branch being operated by a single broker. It is this

strategy that led journalists to call Edward Jones the Walmart of Wall

Street. However, in its eﬀorts to grow, the ﬁrm is now targeting more

upmarket customers by oﬀering services to high net-worth individuals,

and is also moving into big cities where branches will be operated by

multiple brokers. On the face of it, these seem sensible investments, but

they do run the risk of diluting the ﬁrm’s original strategic positioning

# in the market.

Why it happens

One might wonder why clever people undertake investments that dilute

their ﬁrm’s strategy or diﬀerentiation. As it happens, there are many

good reasons why. First, there is the issue that when an investment is

being evaluated, nobody knows for sure if it will lead to dilution and/or

if it does, how much dilution there would be. It is only after the fact —

and often, long time after the fact — that the dilution eﬀect becomes

apparent and by that time, the damage has been done.

Second, it is rarely one big decision that leads to dilution. More often

than not, it is a series of many small decisions, taken over a long

period, that cumulatively lead to dilution. Since ﬁrms evaluate each

investment on its own merits at the time they are considering it,

individual investments may not appear as too damaging to the ﬁrm’s

diﬀerentiation; and since the investments are taken over a long period of time, it is diﬃcult to assess their cumulative eﬀect, which is the real

# culprit for the damage.

Third, the beneﬁts of growth are evident in the short-term whereas the

dilution — if it happens — becomes apparent in the long term. Not

only are the incentives in any ﬁrm focused on short-term results —

thus encouraging managers to undertake an investment even if they

fear that it might lead to some long-term dilution — but even worse,

these same managers may feel that by the time the dilution eﬀect

becomes apparent, they may no longer be employed by the ﬁrm to be

held accountable! Not to mention that it is next to impossible to link

the dilution of a ﬁrm’s diﬀerentiation to investment decisions that were

taken ten or twenty years earlier, by diﬀerent managers.

Whatever the reasons for the growth trap, the challenge for any ﬁrm is to

grow without inﬂicting too much damage to its diﬀerentiated strategic

# position.

How to avoid it

We can get an insight on how to avoid the growth trap from the

experiences of opera houses as they attempted to innovate their product

oﬀering to attract new and younger customers, without damaging

their traditional oﬀering to such an extent that it would alienate their

## traditional (and usually older) customers.

Their solution was to identify the “core” features of opera (which were

its story and music) and then avoid changing them, while focusing

## all eﬀorts at innovation on the “peripheral” features of opera (which

were the place and time the story took place). In similar fashion, ﬁrms

need to identify the “core” and “peripheral” elements of their strategic

position before deciding what to leave untouched as they grow and what

to experiment with to achieve growth.

Deciding what are core and what are peripheral elements in a strategy

is not easy. To do this, a ﬁrm must ﬁrst list the many choices that

make up its strategy and then assess which of them are the ones that

truly diﬀerentiate it from competitors or give it its unique identity

in the market. This is a subjective decision and likely to provoke

## disagreements and debates in a top management team.

In making this assessment, companies should be guided by the fact

that the core elements of a strategy are not many — it shouldn’t take

more than a few sentences to spell them out — and are usually found in three diﬃcult choices that any company makes when they are ﬁrst

created: Who to target as customers; What to oﬀer these customers; and

How to play the game. Once agreed upon, these “core choices” should

be treated as untouchable, never to be changed unless a change in the

ﬁrm’s circumstances necessitates a complete strategy change.

Successful companies are very good at distilling the essence of

## their strategy down to a few core elements on the who-what-how

dimensions, which they then use to guide their strategic investments.

For example, Christian Van Thillo, the Chairman of DPG Media Group,

the leading media company in Belgium and the Netherlands identiﬁed

the following core elements in DPG Media Group’s successful strategy:

- 1) provide high-quality, professional journalism and be a multi-media

(print, radio, TV, and online) company in every market they operate; 2)

be the undisputed leader in small geographies so that advertisers and

consumers will think of them along with Google and Facebook; and 3)

focus on market leading brands only.

Having a clear sense of the core features of the company’s strategy

helps the senior executives of a ﬁrm avoid making decisions that may

dilute the ﬁrm’s strategic diﬀerentiation. As Van Thillo commented:

“We see opportunities around us all the time. It is easy to get excited

and chase the growth, but all these opportunities need to be evaluated

as to whether they ﬁt with our strategy. And to make this assessment,

you need to be clear in your head what the key elements of your strategy

are.”

Why that solution works

Clarity about the core features of the ﬁrm’s strategic position provides

two key beneﬁts. First, it helps the Board of the company become

an active member in the debate on the growth of the ﬁrm. Growth

opportunities presented to the Board by senior management can now

be evaluated in a rigorous manner by the independent Board members.

The only prerequisite is an independent Board that will not be afraid to

challenge the executive team not only on the ﬁnancial wisdom of their

## investment proposals but also on whether the investment “ﬁts” with the

core elements of the ﬁrm’s strategic position.

Second, it helps operational managers throughout the organization

make decisions with autonomy. This is because the core elements of the

strategy can act as the guardrails within which operational managers

can decide what they can do with autonomy and what they need to get

approval for before acting. Operating within these guardrails minimizes

the risk that managers will make decisions that move the company away

# from its core strategic position.

. . .

Although the advice to identify the core and peripheral features of a ﬁrm’s strategic position sounds easy and straightforward, the diﬃculty

of doing so should not be underestimated. The core features of a

strategy are usually choices that were made a long time ago by

managers who are no longer at the ﬁrm. Current managers may not

feel ownership to the choices made a long time ago by people they

do not know and will naturally be biased towards the strategic choices

undertaken during their tenure. This is made worse by the fact that

managers have a tendency to deﬁne strategy as the decisions they are

taking to move the organization into the future and will never associate

choices made years ago as “strategy.” Yet, the choices made at the

birth of the company are part of its DNA and investment decisions

to guide the ﬁrm into the future cannot be taken without taking into

consideration its DNA. Failure to do so will almost guarantee that the

ﬁrm will fall into the growth trap.

Of course, this does not mean that a ﬁrm will never change its

original strategy or its DNA. Changes in the external environment —

## such as technological innovations, shifts in customer needs, regulatory

changes, and competitive disruptions — can all result in a ﬁrm having

to change its strategy completely. Such radical changes in strategy do

happen but are rare. In the majority of cases, a ﬁrm will need to respond

to changes or undertake investments to grow while utilizing its existing

strategy. Doing so without diluting this strategy can be the diﬀerence

# between success and failure.
