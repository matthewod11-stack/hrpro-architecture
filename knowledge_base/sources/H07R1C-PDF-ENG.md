“James” is an Asian American ﬁnance executive. He’s also a caregiver.

Caregiving isn’t new to James; he has been helping his ﬁrst-generation

## parents as their personal translator and navigator of American systems

since high school. He’s also the father of three children under the age of

- 11. Taking care of others is an integral part of his life.

When we asked James if his caregiving roles have helped him perform

professionally, he didn’t hesitate:

One hundred percent. What I have learned is highly transferable to

the workforce. I am a relationship manager for external clients…And

the better we can understand them, the better we perform…At the

end of the day, asset management is asset management. But those

relationships that we build? Those are what sets us apart. That’s

what makes me so good at my job.

There is no lack of data and information about why organizations

should oﬀer caregiver-friendly employee policies and beneﬁts. We’re

aware of the “mommy penalty” women face when they take time

away from work to care for family members. We know that the U.S.

lacks the infrastructure to support caregivers, and in fact is the only

industrial nation without federal paid parental leave. Many people live

# in childcare deserts.

Given these shortcomings and the fact that 73% of U.S. employees are

caregivers, in order to have a productive and sustainable workforce,

companies must create the infrastructure to support them. The hidden

cost to companies for not supporting caregivers can also be high when

factoring in turnover, lost institutional knowledge, and absenteeism.

However, the conversation about supporting caregivers at work

has typically focused on employee well-being, not the beneﬁts to

employers. We conducted original research to collect stories from

employees like James and found that they bring unique skillsets that

## positively impact culture, retention, and ultimately the bottom line.

## Care Work Builds Invaluable Skills that Help Employers

To demonstrate how caregiving skills are advantageous for companies,

we designed a survey at the Rutgers Center for Women in Business to

collect stories from caregivers. Survey questions included: What skills

did you develop during unpaid caregiving? How did those skills transfer

to the workplace? Does your company beneﬁt from these skills? Do your

coworkers beneﬁt from these skills? Essentially, we wanted to know if

skills honed through caregiving contribute to an organization’s bottom

# line.

We received 131 valid responses comprising 93 stories about child care,

38 about elder care, 18 about caring for someone with a disability,

and six about caring for someone with a long-term illness. (Note that

some respondents told more than one story.) All survey respondents

participated in the paid economy and also provided unpaid, long-term

care for more than six consecutive months. We coded these stories and

aggregated the data into 18 categories. We then identiﬁed three broader

groups based on how respondents demonstrate improved management

skills in the workplace: humanity, productivity, and “cognitivity” — a

term we propose to describe the wide range of mental and emotional

work necessary for the organization to maintain culture, connect

people, and ensure smooth operations.

# Humanity

Improved empathy, emotional intelligence, collaboration, and

teamwork simply make one a better coworker, a kinder manager,

and a more understanding leader. This results in increased retention,

engagement, and innovation. Humanity is what leads someone to

volunteer to step up when someone needs to rush out to pick up a

sick child from school or take time to drive a parent to a doctor’s

appointment. These are the people who listen without judgment and

encourage their colleagues. Here’s how two respondents described the

caregiving skills they bring to work:

Taking care of my three school-aged children…helped me be more

empathetic with coworkers’ personal needs, [leading to] lower levels

## of stress and higher levels of trust within my teams.

— Consulting executive who identiﬁes as male, white; caregiver for

# own children

[My company beneﬁts] by having more engaged employees…[their]

needs are heard and understood, resulting in higher retention.

— Research and development manager who identiﬁes as female,

## white; caregiver for chronically ill parent

# Productivity

Tenacious problem-solvers who excel at time management can

prioritize, persevere, and make decisions with imperfect information.

This improves productivity, which increases the bottom line. Caregivers

are busy — they know how precious time is, and they’re not willing

to waste it. They also know how to take risks and fail forward. These

people come to work with focus and work smarter to meet their

deadlines, getting more done in less time. Here’s what two respondents

told us:

[Being a caregiver] made me a better manager and worker. I am

able to multi-task, switch gears, and not get bogged down worrying

about things I can’t control. I know how to switch focus to what each

employee, team, superior, and client needs at that moment. I know

how to make time for myself to attend to my emotional needs by

connecting with peers, reﬂecting, and seeking support and self-care.

I have been able to lead larger, complex projects and time-sensitive

# retention, and productivity.

## American; parent and caregiver for a disabled person

We may miss some days or hours from work, but overall those hours

are made up 100x by the intense hard work and dedication put in

# after hours.

— Medical/pharma/biotech employee who identiﬁes as female,

## white; caregiver for own children, parents, and a chronically ill

# person

# Cognitivity

We’re calling this third set of caregiving skills “cognitivity,” building

on the concept of cognitive labor, the term often used to describe the

invisible work critical to running a household (sometimes referred to as

the mental load or emotional burden). But the home isn’t the only place

that requires cognitive labor; this is also a key component of smooth

workplace operations. Anticipating needs, spotting small problems

before they turn into big ones, putting measures in place to avoid issues

down the road, and always staying a step ahead are all examples of

cognitivity. People with high cognitivity manage disruptions and take

initiative to complete tasks with little or no direction.

Another way to think about cognitivity is “gluework.” Coined by

engineer Tanya Reilly, gluework is the in-between stuﬀ that holds

people and processes together, which is the foundation of a company’s

culture. In a workplace, this can mean making sure there’s a backup

plan if the technology doesn’t sync for the big pitch, considering dietary

restrictions for the lunch order, taking the meeting notes, and even

running the ERGs. These are often non-promotable tasks — invisible

but critical, and often done by women. Caregivers are required to

maintain a high level of cognitivity since they act as the control tower

## for a range of experts, doctors, schools, schedules, family members, etc.

As one participant told us:

My company beneﬁts because I take care of a lot of problems before

they blow up into larger problems; I have diverse skills they get in one

employee vs. having to pay multiple employees.

# American; caregiver for own children.

## Caregiving Is the Experience Leaders and Managers Need

The workplace has become more complex over the last several years.

Leaders are now required to manage ﬁve generations of workers who

likely aren’t in the same physical space every day. The pandemic,

natural disasters, political instability, and economic uncertainty have

all brought an unprecedented level of business interruption. The pace

of technological change is growing exponentially. The leadership skills

necessary to manage through these new paradigms have expanded.

Many of the skills we’ve grouped into the humanity, productivity,

and cognitivity categories have historically been categorized as “soft”

skills and coded as feminine, which may be why they’ve traditionally

been less valued relative to “hard” or “technical” skills. The irony

is that soft skills are core management skills and harder to develop

(think communication, leadership, decision-making, problem-solving,

## time management, delegation, EQ, adaptability, conﬂict resolution, and

# strategic thinking).

## Additionally, with the advancement of AI, automation, and machine

learning, many technical tasks could be replaced by machines; what

we’ll need are leaders who are communicative, empathetic, and

supportive. These management skills are not often developed through

on-the-job training, corporate coaching, and skills workshops — they’re

developed largely in our personal relationships, and further honed

# through our experience as caregivers.

# And We’re Not Just Talking About Women

People of all genders are equally capable of mastering these skills,

and companies would beneﬁt greatly if all employees, regardless of

gender identity, had heightened skills around humanity, productivity,

# and cognitivity.

Speciﬁcally, if more men invested time in caregiving, we could mitigate the gender imbalance we currently have in our homes and our oﬃces.

It would mean more men would take time oﬀ work for caregiving, seek

## ﬂexible schedules, and demand remote and hybrid work environments.

Perhaps if companies recognized the beneﬁts of hiring and retaining

caregivers, men would be more likely to take advantage of the available

policies because it would be culturally acceptable to do so. Then people

of all genders could continue to work toward professional goals without

sacriﬁcing their caregiving responsibilities.

Which brings us back to James. Until recently, James couldn’t imagine

that he would be able to balance caregiving and work in the ﬁnance

sector. He explained:

In the ﬁnance world, ﬂexibility was just not an option. If you wanted

to work in this industry, you had to give up ﬂexibility. But now

having an employer who understands the need to do caregiving

work has opened my mind to what is possible. And it is an amazing

experience. For [my parents, my kids] and also for me. And now, I’m

a role model for my colleagues. People see me as someone who has

learned to effectively balance work and home.
