As the wave of #MeToo stories have come to light over the past year, it’s

become painfully clear that whatever organizations are doing to try to

prevent sexual harassment isn’t working.

Ninety-eight percent of companies say they have sexual harassment

policies. Many provide anti-sexual harassment training. Some

perpetrators have been ﬁred or fallen from grace. And yet more than

four decades after the term “sexual harassment” was ﬁrst coined, it

remains a persistent and pervasive problem in virtually every sector

and in every industry of the economy, our new Better Life Lab report

ﬁnds. It wreaks ﬁnancial, physical, and psychological damage, keeping

women and other targets out of power or out of professions entirely. It

also costs billions in lost productivity, wasted talent, public penalties,

## private settlements, and insurance costs.

So what does work? Or might?

## Sadly, there’s very little evidence-based research on strategies to

prevent or address sexual harassment. The best related research

## examines sexual assault on college campuses and in the military. That

research shows that training bystanders how to recognize, intervene,

and show empathy to targets of assault not only increases awareness

and improves attitudes, but also encourages bystanders to disrupt

assaults before they happen, and help survivors report and seek support

# after the fact.

Researchers and workplace experts are now exploring how to prevent

sexual harassment in companies by translating that approach. The

## Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in its 2016 task force

report encouraged employers to oﬀer bystander training, for one. And

New York City passed a law in May requiring all companies with more

than 15 employees to begin providing bystander training by April 2019.

It could prove a promising, long-term solution.

But culture change is hard — it can take anywhere from months to

several years, experts say. It’s much easier to go for the annual, canned

webinar training on sexual harassment that checks the legal-liability

box. Yet culture change is exactly why bystander interventions could

be powerful: the strategy recognizes that, when it comes to workplace

culture, everyone is responsible for creating it, every day, in every

# interaction.

## Jane Stapleton, co-director of the Prevention Innovations Research

## Center at the University of New Hampshire and an expert in bystander

interventions, told me about an all-too-familiar scenario: Say there’s a lecherous guy in the oﬃce — someone who makes oﬀ-color jokes,

watches porn at his cubicle, or hits on younger workers. Everyone

knows who he is. But no one says anything. Co-workers may laugh

uncomfortably at his jokes, or ignore them. Maybe they’ll warn a new

employee to stay away from him. Maybe not. “Everybody’s watching,

and nobody’s doing anything about it. So the message the perpetrator

gets is, ‘My behavior is normal and natural,’” Stapleton said. “No one’s

telling him, ‘I don’t think you should do that.’ Instead, they’re telling

the new intern, ‘Don’t go into the copy room with him.’ It’s all about

risk aversion — which we know through decades of research on rape

prevention, does not stop perpetrators from perpetrating.”

When bystanders remain silent, and targets are the ones expected

to shoulder responsibility for avoiding, fending oﬀ, or shrugging oﬀ

oﬀensive behavior, it normalizes sexual harassment and toxic or hostile

## work environments. So bystander intervention, which Stapleton and

others are beginning to develop for workplaces, is designed to help

everyone ﬁnd their voice and give them tools to speak up.

It’s all about building a sense of community. “Bystander intervention is

not about approaching women as victims or potential victims, or men as

perpetrators, or potential perpetrators” she said. “Rather, it’s leveraging

the people in the environment to set the tone for what’s acceptable and

what’s not acceptable behavior.”

At the most fundamental level, bystander interventions could begin —

long before an incident of harassment — with workers having non-

## threatening, informal conversations in unstressed moments about how

to treat each other, how they can help each other do their jobs or make

their days better, and practice giving positive feedback. Normalizing

talking about behavior and deﬁning respectful behaviors everyone

agrees on may make it easier for coworkers to see and give negative

feedback if a worker later crosses a line, Fran Sepler, who for 30

years has worked as a consultant, trainer, and investigator on workplace

harassment prevention, told me in an interview. “So when a co-worker

tells an oﬀensive joke, it’s easier to say, ‘Remember how we talked, and

we all agreed about what’s OK to say at work? That’s not it.’”

In testimony before the EEOC, Sepler suggested organizations create

“feedback rich” environments, where middle managers are trained to

## respond to complaints and issues in an emotionally intelligent way, and

where people feel comfortable speaking up and listening, no matter the

# issue.

In campus settings, bystanders are trained to recognize when a sexual

assault may be imminent and intervene by, for instance, disrupting

the environment — turning the lights on at a party, or turning the

music oﬀ — defusing the situation, with humor perhaps, distracting or

interrupting a potential perpetrator, drawing a potential target away, or

drawing others in.

But disrupting sexual harassment in the workplace requires a very

diﬀerent set of tools. “Too often people let things slide, concerned that

if they get involved, it might aﬀect their own career aspirations,” Alberto

Rodríguez. supervising attorney for the New York City Commission on

Human Rights, told me.

Because careers and reputations can be on the line, Sepler suggests

considering a matrix of questions before acting: “Can I have an impact?

Is it safe? What is the best strategy given the culture of the organization

# and my level of inﬂuence?”

Bystanders in the workplace can defuse harassing or oﬀensive language

or situations with humor, she said, or verbal or nonverbal expressions

of disapproval. They can interrupt a situation by changing the subject,

or inserting themselves into the situation. “If it’s the ﬁrst time you hear

someone say something oﬀensive, you might try humor as a way of

getting their attention, making a caustic remark, or saying, ‘What year is

this? 1970?’ as a way of getting their attention,” Sepler said. Even so, she

cautioned that bystanders must weigh whether the colleague has the

reputation for being a jerk. Another option bystanders could consider is

having a conversation after the fact, when tensions have cooled, laying

out why the behavior was oﬀensive.

For a harassing boss or someone who holds power over your career

or livelihood, where direct confrontation could be riskier, defusion,

distraction, or interruption are still possible tools for bystanders in the

moment. And after the fact, bystanders can also seek out a supervisor or

inﬂuencer, make a report, or help a target make a report.

At a minimum, bystanders can always show support to targets, who

often feel isolated, humiliated, diminished, and alone after a harassing

incident. “Going to someone and saying, ‘I saw how they were treating

you. I didn’t like it. Is there anything I can do to help?’ Or, ‘It’s not your

fault, let’s go talk with human resources.’ That might be all you can do,”

Sepler said. “That’s not nothing.”
