# HBR / Digital Article / Design Your Transformation for Simplicity — Not Efficiency

To keep up, business leaders are attempting the most aggressive

transformation agenda in history, making fundamental changes in

either what they are doing or how they are doing it.

Unfortunately, the mere act of attempting transformation doesn’t

guarantee success. It’s estimated that 70% of all change initiatives fail.

This aligns with our own Gartner research: In a 2023 survey, only

14% of CFOs reported none of their transformation projects failed in

the previous two years. In another study that year, logistics leaders

reported similar experiences — only 24% of their transformations were

# successful.

## Transformations: More Frequent, More Difficult

The imperative to transform to keep pace with change, coupled with the

need to get better at actually transforming, led us to dig deeper into the

## causes of transformation success and failure.

We focused on the procurement function, which has carried a

## particularly heavy transformation burden across the last few years.

We surveyed 276 procurement professionals from a cross-section of

markets and industries in 2023 and found that the average function

had undertaken nearly one new transformation per year since 2018 — at

the time of the survey, they were balancing around three simultaneous

# transformations.

Despite this volume of experience — or maybe because of it — 70% of

respondents to Gartner’s survey reported that achieving transformation

objectives was harder than expected. And a majority of transformations

were found to be under-delivering on expected value. For example,

respondents gave an average score of 58 out of 100 when asked the

extent to which the transformation met cost savings objectives, the most

## common objective of procurement’s transformation initiatives.

Ultimately it is a function’s workﬂows — the processes they perform in

the course of their work — that are being transformed. For this reason,

in seeking to explain those disappointing outcomes, we zeroed in on

how transformation leaders design and revise workﬂows impacted by

# their transformation.

# Efficiency vs. Designed Simplicity

## The vast majority of organizations today attempt transformation by

focusing on eﬃciency, following what can be described as a “minimum

viable product” strategy. Business leaders taking this approach

prioritize speed at every turn, trying to implement transformed

workﬂows — and thereby the transformation itself — as quickly as

possible to begin extracting value sooner to keep up with the pace of

change they are confronting.

We identiﬁed that organizations following this approach:

- Deploy transformed workﬂows quickly and iterate improvements to ﬁx

# any workﬂow gaps after the launch.

- Empower and expect staﬀ to leverage experience and judgment to

overcome any ambiguity that arises in these transformed workﬂows.

- Focus on creating standardized, uniform processes.

While a seemingly common-sense approach that works in many other

contexts, we found that in the context of functional transformation,

the eﬃciency-focused approach has almost no impact on improving the

success of a transformation. We measured success as both achieving the

intended transformation objectives and doing so with as little diﬃculty

# as possible.

In fact, our research found that functions that perfect the eﬃciency-

based approach saw their transformation success increase by just 5%.

# HBR / Digital Article / Design Your Transformation for Simplicity — Not Efficiency

By contrast, organizations that used an approach that we’ve dubbed

“designed simplicity” increase their transformation success by 42%.

# What Is Designed Simplicity?

We deﬁne designed simplicity as a user experience–based approach

to business process management that seeks to reduce complexity by

designing procedures, tools, and stakeholder interactions that are easy

for users to understand and execute. Organizations that follow the

designed simplicity approach to designing and revising workﬂows as

## part of a transformation follow nine principles.

They ensure that transformed workﬂows:

- Have no gaps or ambiguities when a transformation goes live

- Make it easier to do the job

- Are easy to understand and follow

- Cover even rare scenarios

And when thinking about the design and implementation of those

workﬂows, their leadership ensures that they:

- Work as an integrated team along with managers and staﬀ

- Remain closely involved, even if delegating particular tasks

- Take steps to minimize added diﬃculty

- Bake learning and development into actual work • Make special eﬀort to recognize change adoption

These seem like common-sense principles, but most functions don’t

abide by them in practice out of expediency and a fear that a focus on

process will delay implementation. While that’s a reasonable concern,

those following the eﬃciency-based approach reach implementation

only six weeks sooner than those following designed simplicity — a

## drop in the bucket against the 2.5 years the average transformation

takes. Even those paltry six weeks exist only on paper, as the

transformation is not truly complete when it goes live under the

# eﬃciency approach.

The designed simplicity approach improves transformation success

while reducing the risk of unintended consequences, and actually

increases the likelihood of additional beneﬁts beyond the

transformation’s objective:

- Staﬀ satisfaction increases by 123%

- Eﬃciency goes up by 68%

- The struggle to meet ordinary demands is reduced by 26%

- And the typical decline in employee morale born out of transformation

is reduced by 51%

## Why Designed Simplicity Succeeds Where Efficiency Fails

Why does designed simplicity work so well?

Designed simplicity focuses on the transformation’s ROI, not its ﬁnish line.

The eﬃciency approach aims to reduce the time between the decision to

transform and the implementation of the transformation, and by doing

so minimize time-to-ROI. Not only does this not work, as mentioned

above, but in elevating time-to-ROI, these leaders are mistaking a

## successful transformation initiative for a successful transformation.

Organizations don’t undertake transformations for the purpose of

completing them quickly. They undertake them to achieve functional

and organizational objectives. While both time-to-ROI and ROI matter, the latter matters much more. In the tradeoﬀ between speed and

quality, the eﬃciency approach gets the balance wrong, and designed

simplicity gets it right.

Transformed workﬂows are much more complete when deployed.

To get to ROI as fast as possible, eﬃciency-focused organizations

typically adopt minimum viable workﬂows (i.e., incomplete workﬂows). This means eﬃciency-focused leaders are, in eﬀect, charging staﬀ with

the task of making an incomplete transformation work.

Conversely, with designed simplicity, new and revised workﬂows

don’t get deployed until they are complete, meaning there are no gaps or ambiguities staﬀ have to ﬁgure out on their own.

Necessarily, workﬂows, tools, templates, and playbooks are developed

before the transformation is implemented, not after. Though iterative

improvement will no doubt happen, any faults in such workﬂows are minor enough that delays in improvement don’t hamper staﬀ as they

put the workﬂow into practice.

Staff’s user experience and input are a priority. The eﬃciency-based approach relies on staﬀ to ﬁll in the gaps in incomplete workﬂows. While relying on staﬀ experience to compensate

for process deﬁciencies may work for smaller changes, transformations

are about fundamental changes to tasks or even entire value chains. In other words, the eﬃciency approach is predicated on staﬀ

compensating for workﬂow deﬁciencies using experience they don’t

have. Not only does this explain why the eﬃciency approach doesn’t

work, but it’s also why it’s associated with declining morale.

Consider a procurement function that hasn’t previously been

responsible for sustainability. Leadership decides to add this to

procurement’s remit – a transformation because it’s a fundamental

change in responsibility. As part of this transformation, procurement

must add sustainability metrics to its supplier selection criteria.

Ideally, the leaders who decided to undertake the transformation

will also have determined what speciﬁc KPIs are required and what

weight they should be given alongside other factors that drive suppler selection. Even so, staﬀ are the ones who must execute on the vision.

They will need to collect the metrics from suppliers. Service agreements

may have to be renegotiated to require suppliers to collect and share the

data behind the metrics. Some suppliers and internal customers will ask for waivers, and staﬀ will have to decide whether to grant them based

on criteria a team member will need to develop, if the transformation’s leaders haven’t already, kicking oﬀ another data collection and due

## diligence process on a supplier-by-supplier or even a purchase-by-

# purchase basis.

In the race to declare the transformation complete, the eﬃciency

approach adds sustainability metrics to supplier selection criteria while

leaving these novel, intricate, multi-stakeholder complexities to be worked out by staﬀ. Transformations are fundamental changes, which means staﬀ are most likely inexperienced in sustainability, and yet they

are tasked with solving these complexities in real time alongside all

their other business-critical responsibilities. Leadership is frustrated

about underperformance against a transformation that has ostensibly

been completed. This pales in comparison, though, to the frustration that their staﬀ feels, with their already diﬃcult jobs now burdened with

an even more complex series of problems where they feel unsupported

# by transformation leaders.

By contrast, the goal of the designed simplicity approach is to simplify workﬂows in advance, achieving a positive user experience for the staﬀ. To ensure this, leaders, managers, and staﬀ collaborate as an integrated team throughout the transformation so staﬀ can provide real-time

input, rather than just feedback after the fact. This distinction is critical.

In the sustainability example, this means stakeholders across functions

and up and down the seniority scale collaborate to ensure the workﬂows

created to accomplish the objectives are complete and workable before the new sustainability rules are put into eﬀect.

For example, part of the new workﬂow is getting existing and

prospective suppliers to agree to abide by the new requirements.

Procurement and legal should work together to write model contract language. Within procurement, leaders, managers, and staﬀ should

collaboratively devise practical negotiation strategies for reaching

acceptable agreements with suppliers who are initially unwilling or

unable to abide by the new contract language.

This solves two challenges. First, it ensures that users have what they

need to complete the workﬂow at the time the new sustainability mandate takes eﬀect. By doing this work in advance, staﬀ are not

simultaneously trying to write their own contract language, decide

for themselves if variations to that language are acceptable, and

make up negotiation strategies on the spot, all of which blunt the

transformation’s eﬃcacy and cause frustration for all involved.

Second, it ensures not just that staﬀ have tools, but that they have eﬀective tools. If the legal department, in its zeal to protect

the company’s interests, writes contract language tilted too far in their favor, they’ve put procurement staﬀ at a disadvantage when

negotiations start; some suppliers, for instance, won’t bother entering

into negotiations if the starting point is too far from what they can agree to. And when procurement leaders, managers, and staﬀ collaborate

on negotiation strategies, it ensures that these strategies reﬂect the ﬁrsthand staﬀ knowledge about their suppliers and counterparts that

would otherwise be absent.

It’s worth reiterating that, core to the designed simplicity approach, is understanding the diﬀerence between input and feedback. Input

occurs when workﬂows are being designed and can have a meaningful,

even determinative, impact on the ﬁnal output. Feedback, on the other

hand, is received after transformation leaders have put in signiﬁcant eﬀort and believe the workﬂow design to be done or nearly so. That

makes them understandably averse to acting on any feedback, short of

a terminal defect, that requires them to substantially redo their work or

that means their work is farther from completion than they believed.

Anyone who has ever been someone else’s employee has at some point been invited to oﬀer feedback on a misguided initiative only for the ﬁnal

output to be nearly identical to the draft.

Seeking feedback — rather than input — is a fatal ﬂaw in workﬂow

design because simplicity is always relative. It’s not enough that

transformation leaders believe they’ve designed a simple workﬂow

because they’re not the ones who will be carrying it out. This is why

user experience and input are at the very center of designed simplicity.

All reasonable scenarios are planned for.

In the race to design minimum viable workﬂows as part of the eﬃciency

approach, the result tends to be one-size-ﬁts-all outputs that address only the ideal and most common scenarios staﬀ will ﬁnd themselves in.

Even in ideal, common scenarios, transformations add complexity.

Returning to the sustainability example, an ideal scenario — the

supplier has the requested sustainability metrics and is pleased to hand

them over — still adds additional steps, activities, and considerations

that complicate the workﬂow.

The more realistic scenario is a less-than-ideal one — perhaps some

suppliers don’t have or are unwilling to share metrics. This not only

adds more disruptive complexity to the process (e.g., negotiations), it

creates new subprocesses with their own workﬂows (e.g., the waiver

# process).

Uncommon scenarios might be infrequent, but that’s precisely why they

tend to add more complexity than common ones. What if a mandatory

sustainability metric applicable to the vast majority of suppliers isn’t

applicable to a handful of them? What if a waiver can’t be granted? What

if the supplier’s sustainability practices are the subject of litigation or a

# regulatory action?

When these less-than-ideal and uncommon scenarios inevitably occur, a one-size-ﬁts-all workﬂow means staﬀ must ﬁgure out how to deal with

the complexity of the work. Those complexities can be technical (what’s

the right way to do this?) or worse, organizational (what’s the right way

to do this given multiple stakeholders and their competing priorities,

existing policies, budget limitations, etc.?).

With designed simplicity, time and energy is spent on comprehensive

completeness up front. Situational ambiguity is engineered out of the

process by developing workﬂows that cover all reasonably foreseeable situations so staﬀ can easily navigate the less-common and less-

than-ideal circumstances that will inevitably arise, even if they are

encountered very soon after implementation.

## How to Implement the Designed Simplicity Approach

Leaders of any function wanting to ensure they increase their chances

of success with their next transformation should be guided by the

principles of designed simplicity by following these steps:

- 1. Survey

Map the current state of the workﬂows being transformed.

- 2. Investigate

Interview workﬂow users to identify speciﬁc complexities in the

process. Organize them into categories representing the root causes of

complexity: “too many,” “too few,” and “too diﬃcult.” Continuing the

sustainability example, there might be too many sustainability KPIs to eﬀectively manage; there might be too few (or no) tools for gathering

KPI data from suppliers; and balancing sustainability KPIs alongside

## all the other requirements (cost, speed, risk, business continuity, etc.)

might be too diﬃcult, for instance if the acceptable minimums for all

those requirements make it nearly impossible to ﬁnd a supplier who can

meet them all simultaneously.

- 3. Mitigate

Design/revise the transformed workﬂows to avoid/resolve the process

# complexities:

- When users’ pain is because of “too many,” remove redundant

or overlapping requirements, steps, or required tools within the

# workﬂow.

- When users have “too few,” close gaps in data, objectives, instructions,

## tools, requirements, or steps within the workﬂow.

- When users report “too diﬃcult,” break down arduous steps into

smaller, easier pieces, clarify data requirements and decision-making

models, and provide more support/tools to users within the workﬂow.

- 4. Partner Build an integrated team of staﬀ, managers, and leaders to co-design new, transformed workﬂows. Ensure that each workﬂow has clear goals

and objectives, that it’s easy to understand and execute, that the work is

easier to accomplish with the workﬂow than without it, that it accounts

for all reasonable scenarios users will encounter, and that users have

## access to necessary information and tools.

- 5. Listen

Monitor the adoption of transformed workﬂows. Use instances of

low adoption as an indicator of a lack of simplicity or eﬃcacy in

transformed workﬂows, not as a measure of compliance. When low

adoption occurs, go back to step one.

. . .

Designed simplicity oﬀers a fundamentally new approach to achieving

transformation success. In prioritizing user experience over speed

and eﬃciency, adopters have seen an improvement of 42% in their

transformation success scores, meaning transformation objectives are

more likely to be met, and the diﬃculty of transformation is decreased.

By embedding these principles, business leaders can ensure that their

transformations are not just completed but are successful in delivering

sustained value and strategic advantage for their organizations.
