You’ve just announced a change that you know is right for the

organization. But you also know this direction will make some

team members unhappy. And sure enough, soon you notice passive-

## aggressive comments from certain colleagues.

Even worse, the backlash feels personal. It’s not gentle, “let’s slow

down here” type concerns. Rather, others are openly questioning

your choices, undermining your judgment calls, excluding you from

conversations, or otherwise treating you like you’ve overstepped your

bounds—even when you have higher authority.

This happened to Rick, a newly appointed city administrator. A few

months into the role, he restructured a cumbersome project approval

process that was delaying road repairs and business permits. Rick

knew the change meant some department heads would lose inﬂuence

and control, but he underestimated how vocal the resistance would

## become. In the ﬁrst staﬀ meeting after the announcement, the public

works director attacked Rick for “not understanding the complexities

## of municipal operations.” Then the planning and zoning manager

chimed in with concerns about “rushing the implementation.” Rick

spent several more meetings defending something he thought was

ﬁnal. When broader skepticism began aﬀecting how the rest of his

team approached other requests he made—including routine budget approvals and staﬃng decisions—Rick knew something had to be done.

Many leaders ﬁnd themselves in this bind of needing to balance

bringing people along without letting others’ emotions derail necessary

changes. Here’s how to navigate that tension and respond when you

# receive backlash.

# Reframe resistance.

When people are upset with you, your brain assumes you must have

done something wrong. You take it personally, when in fact, most of the

time, people’s reactions have less to do with you and more to do with

their own fears. According to change management researcher William

Bridges, any transition begins with an “endings” phase, where people

grieve what they’re losing before they embrace what they’re gaining. In

other words, the backlash you’re experiencing is a natural byproduct of

processing the end of something familiar.

At ﬁrst, Rick took the department heads’ concerns as a referendum

on his leadership, spending meeting after meeting defending his

credentials and explaining his rationale. But putting their reactions

into context helped Rick develop more compassion and cooled his own

defensiveness. He realized that the public works director was wrestling

with losing the inﬂuence he’d held for 15 years. The planning manager

was processing the reality that her gatekeeping role was about to

diminish. Rick could also more rationally explore whether his plan was

sound or if their feedback contained valid concerns worth addressing.

Acknowledge the discomfort without apologizing.

You can validate someone’s experience and not backtrack on moving

the organization toward its goals. Try statements like these to show that

you’re listening without signaling that you’re open to reversing course:

- I understand that this shifts how you’ve been operating and that’s

hard. I’m committed to supporting you.

- This changes how we work with the client. I recognize that and I

appreciate us working through it together.

- It’s a new process and is deﬁnitely more involved than what you’re

used to. Help me understand where you’re getting stuck.

Notice that you are not apologizing for any mistake or inconvenience,

nor are you agreeing that you may have moved too fast. Instead,

showing that you empathize with the impact while making it clear the

decision still stands and isn’t up for debate.

# Redirect conversations to next steps.

When discussions dwell on why a direction, change, or request is wrong

or unfair, gently pivot to implementation and execution. You might say:

- I hear your concerns, but at this point we need to focus on next steps.

What support do you need from me?

- I understand your perspective. We’ve weighed the pros and cons, and

we’re going forward with X. Let’s talk about how to make this work for

# your team.

- Those are good points to keep in mind for the future. Right now

though, I need to know the speciﬁc obstacles you’re facing with Y so we

can hit the deadline.

If they push back with some version of “What if this doesn’t work?,”

recruit them as a collaborator in the solution. For example, “That’s

exactly why I need your expertise on the operations side,” or “You know

this process better than anyone, so what should we watch out for?”

Be clear about what’s negotiable and what’s not.

That could sound like: “We’re freezing spending on all events. That’s not

changing. What we can discuss is options for digital marketing.” You’re

directing people’s desire for contribution and inﬂuence to an area where

they can meaningfully move things forward.

Rick stayed ﬁrm on the fact that the new approval process would move

forward, but allowed the department heads to choose which projects

to pilot the new system with ﬁrst. Suddenly, instead of ﬁghting the

change, his team was debating the merits of starting with road repairs

versus business permits, which was ultimately a much more productive

# conversation.

Amplify your early adopters.

There are likely people who agree with you or who are already seeing

progress, but they may not be as vocal. Give them a platform to share

their support and what’s working. For example, in team meetings,

ask them to share their experience, for example, “Abud, you’ve been

piloting this with your team. What have you learned so far?” To avoid

## the appearance of favoritism, position this as information-sharing that

helps everyone succeed.

Navigating backlash rarely feels good, even when you know it’s

a predictable part of the process. But the irony is that it’s often

a rite of passage—a sign that you’re making important, necessary

choices. Having the courage to stand behind tough calls isn’t always

comfortable, but it’s often what separates good managers from the

leaders who drive meaningful change.
