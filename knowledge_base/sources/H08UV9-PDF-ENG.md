The stakes in C-suite hiring are existential. After all, talent risk is value-

creation risk. Nowhere is this truer than in the middle market, where

leadership’s impact is most directly felt and executives are unlikely

to be supported by layers of management and squads of subject-

matter experts. But when leadership changes are necessary—because of

## retirement, change of control, or performance issues—middle-market

companies and investors ﬁnd themselves at a serious disadvantage.

They often lack the internal capabilities and outside support that will

help them ﬁnd and assess the best candidates.

It’s not a small problem, and it’s especially acute in private equity,

where portfolio company CEO turnover is frequent and normal. About

a third of middle-market companies are owned by private equity, and

many currently founder-led companies will have at least one phase of

PE ownership eventually. A majority of PE deals—58%—result in the

# replacement of the CEO within two years.

## With that much turnover, middle-market PE ﬁrms and their portfolio

companies need tools, processes, and expertise to ensure that they’re

ﬁnding the leadership they need.

# Where Current Options Fall Short

Large PE ﬁrms are acting on their understanding of the importance of

leadership in value creation; a growing majority of them now employ

a human-capital partner, whose role includes staﬃng, assessing, and

developing portfolio company leadership. The best of them have

developed impressive processes to ensure their success.

But the role of human-capital partner is much less common among

middle-market PE ﬁrms, which focus on buying companies with

revenues between $10 million and $1 billion. These ﬁrms generally have

smaller portfolios and fewer roles to ﬁll, making the cost harder to

justify. Because their middle-market portfolio companies also tend to

have less-sophisticated human resources teams than big companies,

there’s a capability gap: When it comes to ﬁnding, assessing, and

building talent, the middle market is underserved.

Most middle-market companies (and middle-market PE ﬁrms) are

forced to choose between two ﬂawed options when assessing executive

leadership: search ﬁrms and large psychometric vendors oﬀering one-

# size-ﬁts-all reports.

Search ﬁrms are invaluable for sourcing candidates, but when they also

## assess those candidates, conﬂicts of interest arise, because search ﬁrms

get paid when an executive is placed. Furthermore, most mid-sized companies—even PE ﬁrms—cannot oﬀer the deal ﬂow that qualiﬁes

them for the best, most customized support from search ﬁrms; they’re often served by diﬀerent people for each search, which can reduce

## institutional knowledge and accountability.

On the other end of the spectrum, large psychometric providers oﬀer

standardized assessments like personality tests designed to predict

executive performance, identify risks and weaknesses, evaluate a

person’s teamwork skills, and so on. The reports they provide are

data-rich but interpretation-poor—algorithmic outputs that often miss

nuance, context, and the human element. While they assess the

candidate, it’s left to the hiring team to determine whether that

candidate actually ﬁts what the job requires.

This is where middle-market companies and PE ﬁrms confront the

## familiar conundrum of middle-market enterprises everywhere: They

have big-company needs but small-company resources. On the PE

ﬁrm side, the people responsible for ﬁnding and evaluating candidates

are usually the ﬁrm’s operating partners (OPs), who may be smart

operators but rarely have HR expertise. On the company side, nearly

half (46%) of midsized companies say their HR departments are tactical

and operational, not strategic; and if they’re hiring as part of a PE

acquisition, they and their C-suite colleagues might not yet understand

the pressures and requirements of working for PE owners.

They need a way to surface risk that isn’t on the resume. That risk

is often hiding in plain sight—within the very traits investors tend to

# overvalue.

# When “Top Traits” Become Red Flags

In the rush to hire high-impact leaders, PE ﬁrms often seek out certain

signature traits assuming they translate into scalable leadership. But

## these traits, when over-indexed or unchecked, often create just as many

problems as they solve.

Let’s take a closer look at two of the most commonly misunderstood—

## and misused—traits in the portfolio company talent equation: agility

# and conﬁdence.

Ask any PE investor what they want in a C-suite executive and

“agility” is almost always at the top of the list. Investors want leaders

who can move fast, pivot strategy, act decisively when a plan breaks

down, and seize unexpected opportunities. Our AlixPartners Disruption

Index shows that 40% of executives in companies with signiﬁcant PE

ownership say their executive team isn’t agile enough, compared to just

# 19% in companies with no PE ownership.

But agility isn’t a silver bullet. It’s a trait, and like all traits, it comes with tradeoﬀs. Highly agile executives tend to excel in chaotic, ambiguous

situations. They thrive on change and can quickly reorient under

pressure. But those strengths often come at the expense of structure,

consistency, and follow-through. Agility and operational rigor rarely

live in the same person. Agile leaders move fast—but don’t always

land the plane. In a post-merger integration, strategic pivot, or early-

stage growth context, agility can be a superpower. But in a steady-state

scaling phase, where precision and systems matter most, it can become

# a liability.

Consider this case: A veteran CEO with previous PE experience was

selected by a middle-market ﬁrm to lead a rapidly scaling industrials

company. He came highly recommended by a prominent search ﬁrm

and was hired for his experience and dynamic working style. And

in some ways, he delivered: He moved fast, brought energy, and

executed at a pace consistent with PE expectations. But cracks quickly

surfaced. He remained woefully disconnected from operational details;

delegated with vague, high-level direction; and failed to follow up on

critical initiatives. In the wake of rapid M&A, he struggled to bring

the operational discipline the business needed to integrate and scale eﬀectively.

If agility is often misunderstood, conﬁdence is even more so. Many

executives see conﬁdence as an unqualiﬁed positive: a trait that signals

decisiveness, presence, and control. But conﬁdence, like agility, comes

with a shadow side. Left unchecked, it can morph into arrogance,

resistance to feedback, or a lack of collaboration. And in a PE-backed

environment, where alignment with ownership is as important as

execution, that can cause serious problems.

Conﬁdence is often what gets executives promoted, but when it isn’t

tempered by humility or self-awareness, it becomes a red ﬂag. We

worked with one ﬁrm that hired a regional sales VP from a Fortune

500 company to become its ﬁrst chief revenue oﬃcer for a $1.4 billion

food company. While he had been charismatic, sharp, and superb in his

previous role, in his new one he became the kind of boss who resisted

collaboration and didn’t listen to feedback, even from the CFO. In PE-

backed environments, that kind of conﬁdence without humility is a risk

# signal.

## How to Find the Signal Beneath the Surface

Middle-market companies and PE ﬁrms cannot aﬀord to rely on gut feel,

résumés, or conﬂicted assessments when it comes to leadership. It’s

easy to see the consequences of hiring failure: high rates of unplanned

turnover, delays or derailments in value creation because an executive

## struggles as the business expands, ineﬃcient post-merger integration in

## rollups—leading, ultimately, to lower returns for investors in an already

challenging environment.

What’s needed is a sharper lens: one that illuminates risk, balances

## strengths, and aligns leadership ﬁt with the realities of the business.

Pre-hire assessments must recognize the behavioral patterns that shape

how a leader actually leads and test them against the needs and

opportunities of the business. The real questions for investors are: What

does the business need right now? And how will that change over the

coming quarters and years?

Middle-market PE ﬁrms and portfolio companies should take three

steps to ﬁnd the right leadership talent within the inevitable constraints

that bind them:

- 1. Make hiring a core competence.

The ﬁrst step is to recognize the issue. Given the amount of executive

turnover that’s built into the PE model, hiring needs to be managed

with a process. That shouldn’t be bureaucratic, but it shouldn’t be ad

hoc either (as it too often is); the mantra for the middle market must

always be “just enough process.” PE ﬁrms need to institutionalize their

knowledge, learn from mistakes and successes, assess talent and talent

## gaps across the portfolio, and create measurements.

- 2. Find an expert advisor.

PE ﬁrms should develop a relationship with an expert advisor that’s

more than transactional. While they might not have the resources for

## a human-capital partner, their OPs and portfolio company leadership

need to be able to work with someone who knows the ﬁrm, has the

expertise to administer or evaluate assessments that complement what

OPs and executive teams learn from interviews, and who doesn’t have

# an economic conﬂict of interest.

The long-term relationship is important for three reasons. The advisor

# will:

- 1. Come to understand the ﬁrm’s strategy and culture.

- 2. Become a resource who can coach (or replace) an executive who

# needs help.

- 3. Become more committed to and accountable for the long-term

success of the executives they help ﬁnd.

- 3. Get serious about succession planning.

Boards, operating partners, and portfolio company leaders should

commit to investing in succession planning, which is more important

than ever as holding periods have increased. Only one in nine PE ﬁrms

have conducted a formal analysis to identify can’t-lose players in the

## organization, and just 26% of companies with signiﬁcant PE ownership

say they’re implementing succession planning—11 points lower than the

## ﬁgure among companies without PE investment.

. . .

The pressure to perform—which all companies face, none more than

those owned by private equity—needs to be matched with process that

makes high performance possible. Together these steps can go a long

way toward ensuring that investors and executives can be conﬁdent that

leadership can deliver, not just survive.
