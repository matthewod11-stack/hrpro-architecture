In the past few years, addressing systemic pay inequities has been

a goal for many companies. Not only does improving equity protect

companies from legal liability, but it also helps build a better, fairer

workplace. How to achieve pay equity, however, isn’t always obvious.

When we present our research on pay equity analysis to business

leaders, we’re often asked for advice on how to identify and address

the gaps, especially when resources are limited.

# HBR / Digital Article / Your Company Wants to Close Pay Gaps. Here’s Where to Start.

The answer may not be as obvious as you might expect and depends on

the organization’s motivation when considering closing gaps. Does the

company want to build an equitable workplace, minimize regulatory

risk, or both? We draw upon our research to oﬀer ﬁrms a way to

think about their pay gaps and determine which to close depending on

# priorities.

# Start With a Pay Equity Analysis

The ﬁrst step is to run a pay equity analysis. This is a systematic

analysis of employees’ compensation to determine whether one or more

demographic groups (e.g., women or a racial minority) are underpaid.

A pay equity analysis gives us a measure of a pay gap after accounting

for pay drivers like job roles and qualiﬁcations. For example, a 5% pay

gap between men and women across a company means that even after

factoring in the diﬀerences in responsibilities, experience, education, or

other factors that legitimately aﬀect compensation, women are paid 5%

# less than men on average.

Once you’ve identiﬁed the pay gaps, you have to ﬁgure out what

to do about them. The size of the gap is just one consideration.

Companies must also weigh their speciﬁc regulatory environment and

how important gaps are to their stakeholders when deciding how to

# address pay gaps.

# Understanding Regulatory Risk

Companies concerned about reducing their legal liability should focus,

at least initially, on their pay gaps’ statistical signiﬁcance—that’s

often what courts and regulators look at to determine potential

# discrimination or inequity.

Statistical signiﬁcance denotes the likelihood that something (like a pay

gap) happened by chance. In many settings, the threshold for statistical

signiﬁcance is 5%. (Note that we are discussing two diﬀerent numbers

here, one is the size of the pay gap (e.g. 1.5%) the other is its statistical

signiﬁcance (e.g. 5%)). Companies whose gaps are deemed statistically

signiﬁcant are likely discriminating against a group of employees in the

# eyes of the court.

If you conduct a pay equity analysis, one of the outputs—in addition

to the size of the gaps—will be your gaps’ statistical signiﬁcance. This

ﬁgure is inﬂuenced by a number of factors, including the size of your

## organization and your ﬁrm’s pay structure.

The more employees there are, the more conﬁdent you can be about

whether a pay gap happened by chance. To see why, imagine ﬂipping

a coin. If it comes up heads 3 times out of 4, you might attribute that

to chance. If it comes up heads 30 times out of 40, you would be more

convinced the coin was weighted toward heads.

For similar reasons, the more regimented a ﬁrm’s salary structure

—that is, the more precisely an employee’s job and qualiﬁcations

determine their pay—the more likely it is that a pay gap of a given

size will be considered signiﬁcant to a court. In other words, if jobs

and qualiﬁcations closely predict employees’ pay at a ﬁrm, it’s harder to

attribute a pay gap within that organization to chance.

# The Size of Gaps Matters to Stakeholders

Statistical signiﬁcance isn’t the only type of signiﬁcance that counts.

The average employee, investor, or manager is much more likely

to focus on economic signiﬁcance, which is simply the size of the

measured pay gap. For example, at a small ﬁrm, a 4% pay gap

between employees of diﬀerent demographic backgrounds may be

economically signiﬁcant—and thus important to stakeholders—but

statistically insigniﬁcant. That does not mean this gap should not be

# How to Close Gaps—And Keep Them Closed

- 1. Take stock of values and the regulatory environment to set goals

First, ﬁrms should see where they fall along the spectrum of internal

and regulatory pressures to set a pay gap goal. At one end of the

spectrum, we have ﬁrms whose stakeholders do not care intensely about

pay equity and who face minimal regulatory pressure to address pay

gaps. Organizations at this end of the spectrum may, at their discretion,

take action to correct any obvious inequity, but may not do much

# beyond that.

At the opposite end of the spectrum are ﬁrms whose values and brand

are inconsistent with having pay gaps and that face intense regulatory

scrutiny and legal liability in relation to pay equity. Such ﬁrms should

seek to close their pay gaps to zero and keep them there, as zero is

an easy and impactful ﬁgure to communicate to employees, external

# stakeholders, and regulators.

Between these poles, there are ﬁrms that may face little regulatory

pressure regarding pay equity but hold values inconsistent with having

pay gaps. Such a ﬁrm should establish a tolerance threshold of

acceptability for its economic pay gaps (e.g., 1%) and manage the gaps

below this level, ideally close to zero. Another intermediate case are

ﬁrms that are mostly concerned about regulatory risk. Such ﬁrms may

take little consideration of economically signiﬁcant gaps except when

they are statistically signiﬁcant. These ﬁrms need to determine how

large a pay gap can be before it is statistically signiﬁcant and work to

keep their gaps within regulators’ accepted levels.

- 2. Close or reduce existing gaps

Once an organization has clariﬁed its pay gap goals, it’s time to close

the gap. First, the pay gap needs to be reduced to below its internal

threshold (which can be based on statistical signiﬁcance or economic

# signiﬁcance).

If a ﬁrm’s pay equity analysis reveals a pay gap, and that gap is over

the ﬁrm’s threshold, the ﬁrm will need to give raises to employees of

the underpaid demographic(s) the sum of which would be determined

by what it would take to pull the gap within the ﬁrms’ acceptable

# threshold.

Depending on the regulatory environment, the size of the gap relative

to the target or depending on budgetary limitations, some ﬁrms choose

to address the disparity incrementally. In other words, a company may

make smaller pay adjustments over several compensation cycles in

order to bring its pay gap below its threshold. It’s also not unusual

for complex organizations to allow diﬀerent units, subsidiaries, etc. to

reduce pay gaps at diﬀerent rates. This is especially the case when the

initial pay gaps diﬀer in size and the units and subsidiaries work in

very diﬀerent labor markets, impacted by diﬀering degrees of regulatory

# oversight.

- 3. Build thresholds into compensation practices

Once a pay gap is closed, pay equity needs to be integrated into

the organization’s compensation processes to prevent the gap from

reappearing. This is because every compensation decision that a

manager makes—hiring, ﬁring, or ad hoc salary adjustments—aﬀects

the pay gap. Unless an organization is unusually static, such decisions

happen on a rolling basis.

As a result, an organization’s pay gap is a dynamic metric. A ﬁrm thus

needs to build in a tolerance margin around its target pay gaps.

The size of this margin depends on a few factors, including the size of

the organization and the regimentation of the pay structure. We know

## that the smaller the organization, the larger the impact of each decision.

If a well-paid woman leaves a small organization, her departure will

have a larger impact on the gender pay gap than it would if she left

## a large organization, simply because in a smaller organization, each

employee represents a larger proportion of the workforce. In general,

## then, the larger the organization and the more regimented its pay

structure, the less wiggle room is needed.

- 4. Practice proactive pay equity management

Get ahead of future pay gaps by ensuring that new hires (and

internal promotions) get unbiased starting salaries (which can be

evaluated based on a ﬁrm’s pay equity model). A proactive approach

also includes monitoring pay equity in real time and accounting for

the changes in the workforce as they happen. Finally, it includes

making ad hoc adjustments in a data-informed manner that ensures

internal consistency with similarly situated employees. These days,

sophisticated but user-friendly software exists to help with this process.

Pay equity presents both consequences and opportunities for ﬁrms.

On the one hand, ﬁrms must ensure their pay gaps do not call down

the wrath of stakeholders or regulatory authorities. On the other

hand, ﬁrms that deﬁne clear pay equity goals and adhere to them set

themselves apart as good places to work, and their employees are less

likely to leave. We strongly encourage ﬁrms to take a proactive approach

to pay equity, whether to minimize regulatory risk, ensure minimal

# equal pay gaps, or both.
