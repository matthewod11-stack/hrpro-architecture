# Who is Covered

The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA) is administered and enforced by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The Act establishes minimum wage, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and youth employment standards generally

aﬀecting full-time and part-time workers in the private sector and in Federal, state, and local governments.

Section 14(c) of the FLSA authorizes employers, after receiving a certiﬁcate from the Wage and Hour Division,

to pay subminimum wages - wages less than the Federal minimum wage - to workers who have disabilities for

the work being performed. The certiﬁcate also allows the payment of wages that are less than the applicable prevailing wage to workers who have disabilities for the work being performed on contracts subject to the

McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA) and the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act (PCA). Payment of

wages under a Section 14(c) certiﬁcate may be subject to the requirements of Executive Order 13658, which

establishes a minimum wage for work performed on or in connection with certain covered government

# contracts.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

Employers must obtain an authorizing certiﬁcate from the Wage and Hour Division prior to paying

subminimum wages to employees who have disabilities for the work being performed. To apply for a

certiﬁcate, employers must submit a properly completed application (Form WH-226), Application for Authority to Employ Workers with Disabilities at Special Minimum Wages), as well as Form WH-226A, Supplemental

Data Sheet for Application for Authority to Employ Workers with Disabilities at Special Minimum Wages and

## the required supporting documentation, to:

# United States Department of Labor

## Wage and Hour Division 230 South Dearborn Street, Room 530

Chicago, Illinois, 60604-1757

1-312-596-7195

Certiﬁcates covering employees of work centers and patient workers normally remain in eﬀect for two years.

Certiﬁcates covering workers with disabilities placed in competitive employment situations or School Work Experience Programs (SWEPs) are issued annually.

Commensurate wage rates. Subminimum wages issued pursuant to Section 14(c) of the FLSA must be

commensurate wage rates - based on the worker's individual productivity in proportion to the wage and

productivity of experienced workers who do not have disabilities performing essentially the same type, quality,

# and quantity of work in the geographic area from which the labor force of the community is drawn. The key

## elements in determining commensurate rates are:

Determining the standard for workers who do not have disabilities - the objective gauge against which the productivity of the worker with a disability is measured

Determining the prevailing wage - the wage paid to experienced workers who do not have disabilities for

the same or similar work and who are performing such work in the area. Most SCA contracts include a

wage determination specifying the prevailing wage rates to be paid for work on the SCA contract

Evaluating the quantity and quality of the productivity of the worker with the disability

All commensurate wage rates must be reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at periodic intervals. At a

minimum, the productivity of hourly paid workers must be reevaluated every six months and a new prevailing

wage survey must be conducted at least every twelve months.

Any employee paid a subminimum wage (or his or her parent or guardian) may petition the Secretary of Labor,

under FLSA Section 14(c)(5), to have the commensurate wage rate reviewed to determine if the wage is

justiﬁed. The review will be conducted by a U.S. Department of Labor Administrative Law Judge. Such

petitions are completely independent of any enforcement action that may be undertaken by the Wage and

Hour Division. Although the petition does not have to follow a particular format or form, it must be signed by the individual (or his or her parent or guardian) and should contain the name and address of the individual

ﬁling the petition and the name and address of his or her employer

. The Wage and Hour Division's role in the petition process is solely to serve as a conduit—the means through

which the petition is forwarded to the Oﬃce of the Chief Administrative Law Judge. The Wage and Hour

Division does not serve as a party in this matter. It does not represent either the employee with a disability or his or her employer. In all matters relating to the propriety of a commensurate wage rate, the burden of proof

rests with the employer. See 29 CFR Part 525.22 for more information.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Notices. Each worker with a disability receiving a subminimum wage under FLSA Section 14(c), and, where

appropriate, the parent or guardian of such worker, shall be informed orally and in writing by the employer of

the terms of the certiﬁcate under which such worker is employed. In addition, employers of workers with

disabilities receiving subminimum wages must display the Wage and Hour Division poster, Employee Rights for Workers with Disabilities Paid at Special Minimum Wages (WH Publication 1284). This poster explains the

# conditions under which subminimum wages may be paid. The poster must be posted in a conspicuous place

# on the employer's premises where employees and the parents and guardians of workers with disabilities can

readily see it.

Additionally, each worker with a disability and, where appropriate, a parent or guardian of the worker, must be

informed, orally and in writing, of the terms of the certiﬁcate under which the worker is employed. This

requirement may be satisﬁed by making copies of the certiﬁcate available.

Posters. Every employer of employees subject to the FLSA's minimum wage provisions must post, and keep

posted, a notice(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm) explaining the Act in a conspicuous place in all of their establishments. Although there is no size requirement for the poster, employees must be

able to readily read it. The FLSA poster is also available in

Spanish(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsaspan.htm),

Chinese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwagecn.pdf),

Russian(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/FLSAPosterRuss.pdf), Thai, (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageThai.pdf) Hmong,

## (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageHmong.pdf)

## Vietnamese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageViet.pdf), and

Korean(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageKorean.pdf). There is no requirement to post the

poster in languages other than English(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm).

Certain industries have posters designed speciﬁcally for them. Employers of Agricultural Employees (PDF)

# (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/wh1386Agrcltr.pdf) and State & Local Government Employees

(PDF)(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/wh1385State.pdf) can either post the general Fair Labor

# Standards Act poster(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm) or their speciﬁc industry poster.

There are also posters for American Samoa (PDF) (https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/americanSamoa/ASminwagePoster.pdf) and the Commonwealth Northern

## Mariana Islands (PDF)(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/cnmi.pdf).

As discussed above, under FLSA Section 14(c), employers of workers with disabilities who are paid

subminimum wages are also required to post the "Employee Rights for Workers with Disabilities Paid at

# Special Minimum Wages" poster

.

In addition to the recordkeeping requirements imposed on all employers subject to the FLSA, those paying

subminimum wages to workers with disabilities under Section 14(c) must also maintain records regarding the

disabilities of the workers, prevailing wage surveys, work measurements, and individual productivity. See the following for the general FLSA recordkeeping requirements.

Every employer covered by the FLSA must keep certain records. Employers must keep records on wages,

hours, and other information as set forth in the Department of Labor's regulations. Most of this data is the type

that employers generally maintain in ordinary business practice.

# There is no required form for the records. However, the records must include accurate information about the

# employee and data about the hours worked and the wages earned. The following is a listing of the basic

payroll records that an employer must maintain:

Employee's full name, as used for Social Security purposes, and on the same record, the employee's

identifying symbol or number if such is used in place of name on any time, work, or payroll records

Address, including zip code

# Birth date, if younger than 19

Sex and occupation Time and day of week when employee's workweek begins.

Hours worked each day and total hours worked each workweek

Basis on which employee's wages are paid (e.g., "$9 per hour", "$440 a week", "piecework")

# Regular hourly pay rate

# Total daily or weekly straight-time earnings Total overtime earnings for the workweek

## All additions to or deductions from the employee's wages

Total wages paid each pay period

Date of payment and the pay period covered by the payment

For a full listing of the basic records that an employer must maintain, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements Under the FLSA(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs21.pdf).

Employers are required to preserve for at least three years payroll records, collective bargaining agreements,

and sales and purchase records. Records on which wage computations are based should be retained for two

years. These include time cards and piecework tickets, wage rate tables, work and time schedules, and

## records of additions to or deductions from wages.

The FLSA does not contain any speciﬁc reporting requirements; however, the above referenced records must

be open for inspection by the Wage and Hour Division's representatives, who may ask the employer to make

extensions, computations, or transcriptions. The records may be kept at the place of employment or in a central records oﬃce.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Section 14(c) certiﬁcates can be retroactively revoked if it is found that false statements were made or facts

were misrepresented in obtaining the certiﬁcate or if it is found that any of the provisions of the FLSA, SCA, or the terms of the certiﬁcate have been violated.

The Department of Labor uses a variety of remedies to enforce compliance with the Act's requirements. When

Wage and Hour Division investigators encounter violations, they recommend changes in employment

practices to bring the employer into compliance, and they request the payment of any back wages due to

# employees.

The Department of Labor may also bring suit for back pay and it may obtain injunctions to restrain persons

from violating the Act.

The Act also prohibits the shipment of goods in interstate commerce that were produced in violation of the

minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, or subminimum wage provisions of the FLSA.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

The issuance of a certiﬁcate under the provisions of FLSA Section 14(c) for payment of subminimum wages does not excuse noncompliance with any other Federal or state law or municipal ordinance establishing

# higher minimum wage standards.

# Compliance Assistance Available
