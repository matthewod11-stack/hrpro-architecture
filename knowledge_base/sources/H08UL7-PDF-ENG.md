Chances are you’ve tried to create ﬁrst-rate teams for your company’s

most important work by enlisting ﬁrst-rate people—that’s what most

organizations do. And chances are you’ve noticed that a collection of

virtuosos doesn’t usually make a virtuosic team.

In fact, such a group placed in a room or on Zoom is just as likely as any

arbitrary collection of people to malfunction, like the managerial team

my research colleagues and I were invited to observe in the all-glass

oﬃce of their company’s Swiss headquarters.

The trouble started when one team member came to a meeting 13

minutes late, and another blew up at them. “You act like our time

doesn’t matter,” a teammate barked. “Every one of us had to stop

something important to be here—on time!” Others rolled their eyes. You

could feel the team self-destructing.

These were top people with tons of talent, yet the company leader was at

his wits’ end. Like so many executives I’ve worked with, his strategy for

creating high-performing teams had been to put good people together

and “just hope.” This strategy wasn’t working.

In order to create top-performing teams—at all levels of the

organization—what you actually need is team emotional intelligence.

That ﬁnding is the outcome of the two decades my colleagues and

I spent studying multiple industries, and it has been reinforced by

a subsequent decade of applying our ﬁndings in industries such as

## pharma, healthcare, oil and gas technology, and more.

# Understand Team Emotional Intelligence

Team emotional intelligence, or Team EI, is diﬀerent from individual

emotional intelligence. Team EI isn’t an inherent trait that belongs

to any one individual. It’s a set of habitual routines, or norms, that

together meet the core social needs that are activated when people

enter teams. These include the need to feel genuinely accepted, known,

and valued; the need to engage in discussions that build a shared

## understanding of the team’s priorities and experience; and the need

to have a genuine sense of inﬂuence and agency within the team.

Norms that address these social needs build a productive emotional

environment that includes trust, psychological safety, and a sense of

# belonging.

In my new book, I outline a full set of Team EI norms. The top three

for meeting people’s social needs are understanding each other better,

routinely assessing strengths and opportunities, and routinely talking to

stakeholders. When teams build these three norms and fully embrace

their importance, they see large improvements in member motivation

and shared goal achievement. Team members ask one another more

questions and share more ideas and knowledge, which makes their day-

to-day work and their disagreements easier to manage

The good news is that these norms can be acquired by any team, and in

a very straightforward manner, as long as the teams are conscientious

about adhering to them and including them in their everyday culture.

High-performing teams never leave anything to chance; everything they

do to maintain the norms that support their constructive culture is

# intentional.

## Assess Your Team’s Emotional Intelligence

The ﬁrst step in acquiring these norms is to understand your

team’s current baseline. My colleagues and I have developed a quick

assessment that lets you gauge a group’s Team EI, so you can see what

changes may improve your culture. As the leader of the team, read each

item below, and jot down a score between 1 and 5 for each that reﬂects

how you perceive the team operates in each area:

- 1. Your team is not actively doing this.

- 2. Your team tries but is weak in this area.

- 3. Your team is ok or following this norm sometimes.

- 4. Your team does this most of the time and you feel it does a good job.

- 5. Your team is especially strong in this area.

Encourage individual team members to ﬁll this out as well

(anonymously works best) so you can learn more about how your team

members experience the team’s operations. Team leaders are often the

last to know how team members experience their team. This assessment

provides an opportunity to test your assumptions.

Understanding each other better.

- We try to understand one another’s needs.

- We work to know the talents and skills of every member in this team.

- All members of our team are treated with respect.

- We routinely give one another feedback that can help members learn

# and grow.

Routinely assessing strengths and opportunities. • We regularly assess the eﬀectiveness of our norms, processes, and

# performance.

- We anticipate problems or challenges and actively work to prevent or

address them.

- When a problem does arise, we take quick action to solve it.

Routinely talking to stakeholders.

- We actively build relationships with our stakeholders.

- We regularly speak to and build relationships with those in other groups or departments who can provide resources that aﬀect our performance.

Look at your scores and see where you should improve. Lower numbers indicate areas where you should focus your eﬀorts. Look at the overall

range of responses and see where they fall. Averaging responses will

give you a general indication of where your team lies, but ranges

among members’ responses can matter even more, revealing areas where people have diﬀerent experiences.

Use these scores to start a conversation about whether current norms

support a day-to-day culture that encourages teamwork and best

serves the team’s goals. Resist the desire to blame outliers on their

personalities; instead, focus on the inﬂuence of norms on poor team

habits. In teams, outliers often present opportunities to innovate—

changing behavior is easier and faster if you focus on modifying norms

rather than trying to change people. For example, we’ve found that

selﬁsh behavior in teams frequently emerges as a defensive response

to norms that allow for the inequitable treatment of members. It’s

## surprising how often perceived invisibility during team discussions

leads to self-defeating behaviors like interrupting or displaying anger;

research suggests that this happens when people prioritize reclaiming

control over getting along with teammates.

## Foster Your Team’s Emotional Intelligence

Once you select a norm to adopt, kick it oﬀ with activities that get it

rolling and build the momentum necessary for new norms to take hold.

Here are some examples from work my colleagues and I did to help

teams build more emotionally intelligent cultures.

Understanding each other better. We worked with a global leadership

team in the oil and gas industry whose members were working in silos

rather than focusing on shared goals. They struggled to reach their

potential because they were competing with one another instead of

# collaborating.

Their Team EI assessment led them to recognize that they knew little

about one another’s roles, responsibilities, and unique needs. To kick oﬀ the norm of working to understand each other better, they decided

to prioritize visiting one another’s work locations, where they could

## learn more about individuals’ responsibilities, work context, current

challenges, and more. They did this by taking detours during routine

travel. Everyone visited someone during the ﬁrst six months and shared

with the team what they’d learned from the visit.

These visits boosted team trust and sense of psychological safety. It

increased the quality of the feedback that members shared with one

another and feelings of support within the team. Some of the feedback

boosted the emotional intelligence of individual team members. One

member, for example, learned that his novel ideas were valuable and

that he needed to assert himself and share them more often. Within a

year, he was promoted to a higher-level position in the company.

Routinely assessing strengths and opportunities. We worked with

## a leadership team in the healthcare industry whose new leader

micromanaged team members and then let go of two people who didn’t

respond well to his style. When the results of the team’s annual job

satisfaction survey showed a steep reduction in satisfaction from the

previous year, the leader asked us to lead a two-day team-building

# workshop.

We opened the workshop with a structured conversation about the

team’s anonymous responses to the Team EI survey. They uncovered

## concerns about members’ relationships with their team leader and

with one another. By the end of the two days, they’d developed an

improvement plan. At the top of the list was a monthly meeting

that they labeled Candid Conversations, with the goal of making the

discussions open and authentic. They organized these conversations

## as SWOT analyses (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, Threats).

Each meeting opened with a monthly open assessment of the team’s

progress, which included feedback from the team leader. They’d then

discuss upcoming challenges and opportunities and brainstormed how

to address them proactively.

Subsequent anonymous Team EI surveys revealed that the team felt

good about its progress. The team leader agreed. Most importantly, he

stopped micro-managing his team members.

Routinely talking to stakeholders. By taking the survey, one team

in the technology industry discovered that it was not reaching out

## to customers and stakeholders, such as members of upper-level

management, often enough. Team members knew that building these

relationships could provide them with key information and visibility.

They chose to adopt a norm of increased stakeholder communication

and involvement. They started by completing a stakeholder analysis

map, on which they listed the names of all the stakeholders they could

think of and brainstormed what a closer connection to each one might

provide. They assigned one team member to serve as an ambassador to

# the ﬁve most important right now.

Ambassadors met their stakeholders and collected feedback and

insights from each. Their actions improved their relationships with

their top three customers. Upper management shared information

about exactly how the team’s work connected with the company’s larger

strategic goals. These conversations provided important learning for the

team and helped members feel more connected to their customers and

# their company.

. . .

Team success is best predicted by the norms and routines that team

members use to integrate the knowledge, ideas, and talents inside and

outside the team into daily decisions. Emotionally intelligent routines

shift the focus from individual performers to the development of a

robust collective brain that outperforms virtuosos working in silos every

# time.

By assessing how your team stands in its emotional intelligence norms,

you and your team can identify concrete actions that will build a more

collaborative and productive environment. Social norms are necessary

for making feelings of belonging, trust, and psychological safety present

and resilient. Taking actions to intentionally build Team EI norms will

help you meet the innate social needs your team members bring to

work every day, including genuine acceptance, shared understanding,

and a sense of agency. Addressing these needs helps your team and its

members thrive, no matter what disruptive change faces them around

# the next corner.
