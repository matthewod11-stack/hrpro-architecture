# You Can’t Sit Out Office Politics

as an executive across thecorporate, nonprofit, and public sectors. Throughout these years,I wore my refusal to engage in office politics as a badge of honor.To anyone who would listen (and perhaps even a few whowouldn’t), I said: “I really don’t have the stomach for all of thatstuff. Politics are dreadful, dangerous, and unnecessary, and I’msimply too straightforward for all of the subterfuge they require. I

don’t come to work to play games — I come to work to get thingsdone.”Given my approach, it’s unsurprising that I was entirelyunprepared and out of my depth when, several years into mycareer, I was laid off. It wasn’t because I was performing poorly orfailing to meet my goals. It was because I had neglected to formrelationships with people who had the power to advocate for myjob.I was let go under the guise of “budget cuts,” but in reality, I hadbeen gracefully and expensively fired without question orreproach because someone with authority wanted me gone. Thisis an example of “office politics” at their worst.The experience made me realize that my head-in-the-sandapproach needed updating. It was high time I became a littlemore politically intelligent at work. I immersed myself in thetopic. I read every article, book, and study I could lay my hands onand sought professional guidance from a fellow executive-turned-coach.The more I learned, the more I began to reflect on my career.Though I reached a great deal of success, there were also manyopportunities I had missed and many times that I had faltered as aresult of my lack of education around office politics. It’s notsubject covered in most colleges or business schools, despite thefact that it’s essential to surviving (and thriving) in every workenvironment.That’s why, in my work now, as a global consultant, I’ve made it apriority to educate professionals at every stage in their careers onorganizational politics and how to navigate them at work.

Despite all the negative connotations, office politics are notinherently evil. They are about two things: influence andrelationships, and the power these two things give you — or don’t.Having now lectured about organizational politics to thousands ofemployees around the world, I have uncovered five myths that areas widespread and harmful as they are naïve and as universal asthey are wrong. If you’re starting out in your career and think it’sbest to sit politics out, you should learn the truth soother thanlater.

In every lecture or workshop I run, I start by asking people to usethree words to describe office politics. One hundred percent of thetime, 99% of the words given are negative. “Toxic,” “frustrating,”“dangerous,” “demotivating,” “draining,” “unfair,” “unnecessary,”“cliques,” and “gossip” almost always rise to the surface. Lastweek, an employee used the word “heart-breaking.”

The fact that these are the words we associate with office politicsexplains why this first myth is so prevalent. How could any of uspossibly engage in things that are widely seen as toxic anddangerous, or at the very least unethical and unpleasant, if we arenot ourselves toxic, dangerous, unethical, and unpleasant?This myth is premised on an incomplete and one-sidedunderstanding of what office politics really are. Though officepolitics can be used both ethically and unethically, at their corethey are just the range of

# informal, unofficial, and sometimes

behind-the-scenes efforts that happen in all organizations aspeople position themselves, their interests, their teams, and theirpriorities to get things done.For example, let’s say you have a big meeting coming up wherestakeholders at your company are going to decide which projectsto invest in — including yours. If you’re savvy at politics, youknow that to get your project approved, you first need tounderstand the priorities and perspectives of those stakeholders.You need to engage with them beforehand and learn what theyare looking for so that you can more persuasively present youridea.This is an example of how office politics can be ethically use tohelp you gain an advantage.Even so, destructive and negative politics also can — and do —exist. In the same situation, if you were to spread a rumor aboutthe lack of scientific evidence behind your colleague’s project inorder to get yours chosen over hers, that would be an unethicaluse of politics.By painting all political activities with the same brush, we areoblivious to the potential for constructive politics — that is, the

range of perfectly ethical and appropriate activities that serve tostrengthen relationships of support, expand influence, and builda powerful base that allows you and your team to be moreeffective.

Organizational politics are inescapable. A few years ago, I wassharing this reality with a group of young managers. One of thedelegates was visibly concerned by what I was saying and so Iasked him to share what he was thinking.“I’m really struggling to accept that there is never going to be aplace where I am not going to have to deal with politics. Surelythere has to be somewhere?”“Like where?” I asked.“Well, what about NGOs? Or a church? You know — places wherepeople work for the greater good of the world. Surely there are nopolitics there?”I suppressed a laugh and by way of an answer told him the story ofa friend of mine who had been a church minister. After having leda congregation for about 10 years, she decided to get intobusiness. The one thing that really concerned her in making thetransition was the dreaded “corporate politics” that colleagueswarned her about and that friends in business repeatedlycomplained about. Undeterred, but still quite nervous, she madethe leap into a big auditing firm and after a few months, I couldn’twait to find out how it was going.

“I’m loving it,” she told me over coffee.“What about the politics? Are you coping?” I asked her.“Politics? Are you kidding me? Corporate politics are absolutelynothing compared to church politics!”Lee G. Bolman and Terrence E. Deal’s

research hits the nail on thehead when it states, “the question is not whether organizationswill have politics but rather what kind of politics they will have.”As human beings, we are social creatures and the use ofrelationships, informal influence, and power plays is part of howwe engage — for better or for worse.

How many times have you heard someone say, or perhaps evenfound yourself saying, “I don’t do politics. My work should speakfor itself.”

saying I like better: “You can’t let your work speak for you; workdoesn’t speak.”Since it is people that speak, we need to speak about our work,and we need other people to speak about it too. However,“speaking about our work” doesn’t mean reciting a laundry list ofthings that we are doing. Instead, it’s about framing what we aredoing in terms of the impact it’s having on the organization andwhy it matters.In workshops and lectures, participants and I often have lengthydiscussions about whether “self-promotion” is necessary, or evendesirable. Many of us have a deeply held view that talent and hardwork should be all that one needs to succeed. I think what lies atthe heart of this belief is that so many of us treat work like school.When we are at school, it is generally a given that if we work hardand master the subject material, we will get good marks andproceed to the next level. In the workplace though, thinking likethis is a risk and a mistake because the reality at work is thatinvisible contributions have no value.

In the absence of in-person interactions, surely all the power playand informal maneuvering tactics employed in office politicsdisappear? Anyone who has shifted to remote work during thepandemic knows that that this is

# not the case.While

research shows that office politics diminish in onlineenvironments, there’s no evidence that they disappear entirely.This isn’t surprising — most human beings are much more drivenby the informal and political than they are by the formal and

prescribed. Again, this can either be negative or positive, but it isa key part of human behavior, no matter what kind ofenvironment we are operating in.People who think they “don’t play politics” are often verysurprised to hear that when they are “taking something offline,”“socializing” their idea with decision makers in advance of a moreformal meeting, or “just having a chat” with someone they thinkcan help them to be more effective, they are in fact engaging inpolitical activities. This is true whether you are doing these thingsin person or remotely.

I am often asked whether certain people are more suited topolitics than others. My reply is always the same — the skills thatlie at the heart of political intelligence certainly come morenaturally to some than to others. But they are still skills. They arenot traits that we are either born with or not born with. As with allskills, you need to practice them to master them.After discussing the key skills and strategies of the politicallysavvy in one of my workshops, a young manager who was lookingat me with a mixture of exhaustion and astonishment, sputteredout, “But this is a lot of work!”She was spot on.With all the demands on your time and energy, it may feel likegetting your unread emails down to double figures is the biggestachievement you’ve made all week. Now, you may be wondering:Am I telling you that, in addition, you need to find the time and

energy to invest in relationships, get strategic about yoursupporters and sponsors, look for ways to increase the influenceand power you have, and then use all of those things to advanceyour career?Well, yes.Doing so takes intentionality, focus, and practice — and it willcome more naturally, secondhand even, with time. Thealternative (i.e. failing to curate your network, build your brand,and all the other things that politically smart people do) is likelyto result in an otherwise promising career never reaching theheights that it could. Or even worse,

derail you career completely.

Now that you understand the truth behind these myths, let’s takea look at what you can do to ease yourself into playing “officepolitics” well.

Start to be aware of your language and how it is framing yourreality, specifically how it frames the way you understand thework environment and how you choose to show up in it.Are you sucking up or are you focussed on building andunderstanding new relationships? Are you resentful and irritatedthat you have to have a bunch of smaller meetings before a bigmeeting or do you recognize the power in being prepared, layingthe groundwork, and giving your ideas the best chance of success?Do you view informal conversations as lobbying (with all thenegative connotations this generally carries) or do you see themas doing important homework?

It’s almost never about the activity itself, but rather the intentionbehind the activity and the interpretation and judgement weattach to both. Clearly, we tend to put more energy intosomething we see — and label — as positive and important, thaninto those things we begrudge or don’t see the point of doing.Alternatively, if the negative connotations of “office politics” areso ingrained in you that you cannot change your mindset, trycalling them something else. Tell yourself, “I am buildingstrategic relationships with my stakeholders,” or “I’m expandingmy coalition of support.”What you call them doesn’t matter. What does matter is that yousee these things as valuable and important and put effort andenergy into them.

Rather than spending your time and energy bemoaning orresenting the nature of organizations (which are inherentlypolitical), focus your time and energy on understanding

# what

kind of political environment you are in.Is your company minimally, moderately, highly or pathologicallypoliticized? To what degree does the political culture fit your(current) personal political style and what you want out of yourlife and career?Kathleen Kelley Reardon, an expert on organizational politics,classifies

political players into one of four types:1. The purist: Do you dislike all thought of politics, and simplywant to get on with the job at hand?

- 2. The street ﬁghter: Do you believe the best way to get ahead isthrough the use of rough tactics, even at the expense of others?3. The Team Player: Do you believe in getting ahead by workingwell with others and participate in the politics that advancegroup goals?4. The Maneuverer: Do you believe in getting ahead by playingthe games of politics in a way that is skillful and unobtrusive tothose who only take things at face value?Of course, all of us can develop skills and change our approach ifwe really want to but unless we make these changes, it’s veryunlikely that a purist will be happy or productive in a highlypoliticized environment or that a street fighter will be welcome ina minimally politicized environment.

Focusing only on your

performance currency, or the credibilityyou build through your work, is very unlikely to get you thesuccess you’re aiming for — be it a bonus, promotion, orrecognition from senior executives. However, investing time inyour networks and building the connections that can speak foryou and your work will get you those things. This investment instrategic relationships is not a distraction from your “real” job, butin fact, one of the most important aspects of it.While it’s clearly important to build relationships deliberatelywith people who can be your allies, don’t make the mistake ofneglecting to build relationships with people who have thepotential to be your adversaries. Every additional adversary thatyou have lessens your political capital and your effectiveness.

You also need to understand where and how relationships are stillbeing built, especially as the work environment becomes morevirtual. WhatsApp chats? Virtual coffee meetings? Hour-long callswhere there is no agenda other than to catch up with colleagues?If none of these are happening, perhaps you can start them; notonly with people who are already in your network but also withthose who you would like to have in your network.Social media offers myriad opportunities to reach out to newconnections outside of your organization. The value that this canoffer your career is immense. A network that is as diverse andwide as possible has repeatedly been shown to be

Getting up and trying again is whatmatters. Winston Churchill said it well, “In war you can only bekilled once. In politics you can be killed many times.”Remember that doing politics on your own terms, with a clear-eyed view of how to be effective without selling your soul orsacrificing your values, will not only benefit you but so too thosecolleagues and stakeholders who are counting on you to do the
