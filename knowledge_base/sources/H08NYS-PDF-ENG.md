## Online labor market platforms like Fiverr, Handy, Uber, and Upwork

have grown signiﬁcantly since the late 1990s, radically transforming

the economy and the management practices used to support gig work.

One major change introduced by these platforms is their reliance

on customer ratings to assess worker performance. Unlike traditional

organizations, where performance evaluations typically involve input

## from team members and supervisors over a prolonged period and across

multiple performance dimensions, online labor platforms often rely

## on quick, single-dimension evaluations from customers immediately

following a brief interaction.

The implications of this shift are profound. Customer ratings on

these platforms are not just performance feedback; they directly

## inﬂuence workers’ job opportunities, work assignments, and income.

As a result, even subtle biases in customer evaluations can lead

to signiﬁcant inequalities for workers, particularly those from

marginalized backgrounds. To mitigate these disparities, the design and

structure of these evaluation processes are crucial.

Our research, recently published in Nature, demonstrates how

customer evaluation processes on online platforms can unintentionally

amplify the eﬀects of subtle biases. Traditional approaches to

mitigating bias, such as diversity training and bias awareness

## campaigns, focus on supervisors and colleagues in traditional

workplaces. However, applying these interventions to the usually

anonymous customer is challenging because they are not employees

and are not easily trained or monitored.

From this research, we oﬀer three strategies for platforms to create more

eﬀective evaluation processes that can reduce bias and improve the

platform’s ability to identify the quality of service.

## Why the Five-Star Rating Scale Fails and How Dichotomization Helps

While people often believe that evaluations are meritocratic in

theory and that they are fair measure of performance, it has been

demonstrated that subtle biases can inﬂuence evaluations, even

without conscious awareness. The likelihood that these subtle biases

inﬂuence ratings may be compounded when customers have greater

latitude to make the assessment (e.g., including more scale points

that encourage greater diﬀerentiation). For example, a customer with

## unconscious bias might rate a worker of color with four stars instead

of ﬁve, believing they are still giving a good evaluation; it is, after all,

the majority of the available stars. However, when these slight rating

downshifts are unrelated to quality and are repeated across thousands

of transactions, these small biases accumulate, resulting in measurable

## inequalities in worker income and opportunities.

Workers face growing reputational insecurity as online labor market

platforms use opaque algorithms and customer ratings to determine

## work opportunities. Even small changes in worker ratings can

drastically reduce their earnings.

We proposed that switching to a dichotomous rating scale (e.g.,

thumbs up/thumbs down) could reduce these biases by simplifying

the decision to a dichotomous choice. Instead of allowing for nuanced

## but potentially biased evaluations, a dichotomous scale encourages

evaluators to focus on the essential question: Was the performance good

# or bad?

# Testing the Impact of Dichotomization

We tested our theory using real-world data from a home services

## platform operating in various cities in North America. The platform

suddenly changed its rating system from a ﬁve-star scale to a thumbs

## up/thumbs down scale without any notice to customers or workers. By

analyzing nearly 70,000 customer ratings (some that occurred before

and some after this unexpected and sudden shift), we found a clear

pattern: Workers of color received slightly lower ratings on average

## (4.72 stars) than white workers (4.79 stars) under the ﬁve-star scale—a

statistically meaningful diﬀerence, even though the company had no

evidence that this gap reﬂected actual diﬀerences in job quality.

This seemingly small diﬀerence had substantial economic

consequences. As on many popular platforms, workers were directly

aﬀected by the ratings they received. In this case, the platform used

customer ratings to calculate worker pay, which led to workers of color

earning 91 cents for every dollar earned by white workers. However, the

## change from a ﬁve-star rating scale to a thumbs up/thumbs down rating

scale oﬀered some promise. Immediately after the change in the rating

system, the racial disparity in customer ratings disappeared completely,

and relatedly, so did the racial disparity in pay.

We then conducted a variety of online experiments that helped conﬁrm

that the expression of racial bias made available by the ﬁve-star

scale was signiﬁcantly reduced with the use of a dichotomous scale.

Consistent with our hypothesis, we found evidence that structurally

altering customer evaluation systems from the ubiquitous ﬁve-star scale

to a dichotomized rating system decreased the racial inequality in

## customer ratings and the associated disparity in income.

## What Platforms Can Do to Reduce Rating Bias

Based on these ﬁndings, we recommend the following strategies for

platforms seeking to reduce biases in similar evaluation processes,

especially given the challenges related to changing individuals’

# underlying biases.

# Check for gaps.

Platforms should regularly audit their rating systems to see if

evaluations vary systematically based on characteristics commonly

## unrelated to the quality of work, like the demographic identity of the

worker. Recall that we found that white workers received an average

rating of 4.79 stars, whereas workers of color received 4.72 stars on

a ﬁve-star scale. Though this 0.07-star diﬀerence may appear small,

our ﬁndings indicate that it translates into meaningful disparities in

## worker earnings because of the subsequent reliance on ratings. As

these seemingly small biases in evaluations can compound over time—

shaping future work opportunities and ﬁnancial outcomes—platforms

should be vigilant in assessing whether their evaluation process

## inadvertently reinforce demographic inequalities.

A simple yet eﬀective approach for platforms is to regularly compare

ratings across demographic groups. To most accurately detect bias and

not quality diﬀerences, platforms should compare ratings for workers

performing similar jobs with comparable experience. Platforms can also

proactively analyze individual customer rating behaviors to identify

customers who consistently rate workers diﬀerently based on worker

# demographics rather than performance.

Keep it simple.

Adopt simpler evaluation processes that direct raters’ attention to

the core assessment—Was the performance good or bad?—rather than

complex rating systems that may introduce ambiguity and bias. Our

research suggests that while more intricate evaluation methods appear

to provide platforms with greater nuance for customers, they often

do not result in material diﬀerences. For example, in our study, we

observed the rating inﬂation that is common on similar platforms:

When using a ﬁve-star scale, customers overwhelmingly assigned

scores of ﬁve stars, eﬀectively diminishing the intended granularity

of the evaluation scale. As raters already underutilize the available

distinctions in more intricate evaluation processes, simplifying the

process may yield similar information while reducing bias.

# Provide clearer rating guidelines.

Platform leaders might initially worry that moving to a simpler thumbs

up/thumbs down scale could sacriﬁce valuable distinctions provided

## by a multipoint scale, such as the ubiquitous ﬁve-star rating scale.

However, as mentioned above, rating inﬂation is quite common, as

evaluators rarely use the full rating range, making these distinctions

less likely. Further complicating the issue, evaluators typically decide

for themselves what dimensions matter, turning ratings into a catch-

all measure that combines multiple potentially unrelated factors into

a single ambiguous score. However, one potential solution is for

platforms to consider using a series of dichotomous ratings across the

## most important criteria—such as timeliness, communication, or job

## satisfaction—to clearly and eﬀectively capture detailed feedback.

## For platforms on which a dichotomized rating scale isn’t feasible or

appropriate, one of our follow-up experiments suggests that providing

customers with explicit instructions can reduce biased ratings.

Speciﬁcally, within a ﬁve-star scale, evaluators who were explicitly

guided to focus on distinguishing “good” from “bad” performance gave

higher ratings to workers of color compared to those evaluators who

received no additional information. Thus, platforms that choose to

retain their existing rating systems can improve fairness by clearly

deﬁning what each rating means and actively encouraging customers

to utilize the entire rating scale.

. . .

Eﬀective evaluation processes must be accurate, fair, and easy to

understand. Our research demonstrates that a simple shift from

## multipoint rating scales to a dichotomous thumbs up/thumbs down

scale can lead to profound improvements in fairness and performance

assessment on an online labor market platform, beneﬁting workers,

platforms, and customers alike. Beyond creating a fairer and more

merit-based evaluation process, these suggested changes help platforms

## better pinpoint genuine quality issues, more clearly measure customer

satisfaction, provide workers clearer expectations and actionable

## insights about their strengths and areas for improvement, and

ultimately ensure customers consistently receive high-quality service.
