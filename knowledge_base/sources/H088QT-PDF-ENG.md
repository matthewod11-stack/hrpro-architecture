More than four years after the Covid-19 pandemic accelerated an

immediate shift to remote knowledge work, it’s clear that, despite

some organizations’ attempts to lure employees back to the oﬃce full-

time, hybrid work arrangements are here to stay. And yet employers

are still struggling with implementation. In particular, the managers

we have talked to point to three key issues: scheduling, culture, and

# productivity.

# Scheduling

Many organizations have settled on a set combination of remote and

onsite work, such as three in-oﬃce days, say Tuesday to Thursday, and

two work-from-home days, say Monday and Friday. However, employees

don’t always adhere to those guidelines. Indeed, tracking data suggests

that some are not coming in as often as expected (or mandated); consider the trend of “coﬀee badging” where employees put in a brief appearance at the oﬃce but take oﬀ at the earliest opportunity. We’ve

also heard managers express frustration about employees using onsite

## days rather than work-from-home ones for medical appointments or

leave, resulting in even less time with colleagues. In short, even though

employers are doing whatever they can to bring people in — free meals,

less restrictive dress codes, social events, and nicer oﬃce spaces — these eﬀorts do not appear to be working.

To overcome this challenge, we recommend shifting the focus from how

often your people should be in the oﬃce to when that physical presence

and togetherness is important. For example, when employees are new

to the organization and getting onboarded and trained, it is more

critical for them to come in and connect in person with key colleagues.

## Likewise, during busy periods, or when teamwork and collaborative

decision-making is required, employers should have greater leeway to mandate and enforce attendance; if the reasoning is eﬀectively

communicated, employees are more likely to understand and accept

the policy. For instance, it is completely reasonable to request that

employees attend critical meetings in person. This approach seems

to be working for J.M. Smucker, which requires employees at its

headquarters to be physically present during 22 “core” weeks, which are

announced one year in advance.

# Culture

Many leaders also worry about the diﬃculty of building and sustaining

corporate culture when employees are physically together less often,

meeting mostly virtually, and often multitasking rather than fully

engaging in those get-togethers. Some managers have told us that even

when their team members are in the oﬃce together they still meet via

Zoom or Teams rather than face-to-face. They also report that people seem more eager to take oﬀ as soon as the workday ends, leading to

poorly attended happy hours and other social events.

Again, we suggest that organizations reframe their “ask” to employees.

Instead of encouraging people to come to the oﬃce to boost the

organization’s culture and their own interaction with peers, try

appealing to their motivation to help others. Research on prosocial impact suggests that will be more eﬀective than emphasizing the

beneﬁts to the company or even themselves. (In one study, for

example, medical workers were more likely to wash their hands when

signs highlighted patient rather than personal safety.) Explain how

employees’ presence in the oﬃce might help coworkers, customers, or clients and make them more eﬀective mentors, allies, and advocates.

Research also suggests that people especially value the opportunity

to interact with the beneﬁciaries of their work, so arranging such

encounters might also help entice workers to come in more often.

# Productivity

Finally, some supervisors are concerned by their lack of insight into

what exactly employees are doing when working remotely. While some

roles (e.g., sales) have clear performance metrics, others don’t, and

while workers may feel equally or more productive at home versus the

oﬃce, there is no hard evidence to back them up. Further, given stories

about the growth of weekday yoga and golf and employees holding

down multiple full-time jobs — sometimes labelled “overemployed,”

“double-dippers,” or “polyworkers” — we can understand managers’

# worries.

Our advice is to ﬁrst accept the reality that managing people is

more diﬃcult in a hybrid world. Leaders must learn to monitor their

employees’ performance and give adequate support and feedback in

a way that is transparent but not too heavy-handed. For instance,

checking in on employees to see what they are doing and asking how you can help them is diﬀerent than checking up on employees to make

sure they are being productive, asking for unnecessary reports and

updates, or using electronic surveillance. Managers might also want to

review and revise employees’ job descriptions and responsibilities and

annual goals to focus on deliverables. For instance, for some employees,

it could be helpful to identify and articulate what speciﬁc tasks or

objectives should be achieved on a daily, weekly, monthly, or annual

basis. Finally, with research suggesting that most employees working

from home actually put in longer hours, managers must resist the

tendency to suspect their employees of shirking (and be mindful of

biases that may make them even more suspicious of women in this

# regard).

Managers in hybrid workplaces should work with their organizations

to free up more of their time for the interpersonal aspects of

management. They can also seek formal training to develop more of

the knowledge and skills they need to manage remote workers and

## informal opportunities (e.g., lunch and learns) to share best practices

and discuss challenges with peers. For instance, we have heard from

organizations looking for opportunities to bring together managers and

## employees to share thoughts and opinions about which aspects of their

return-to-oﬃce policies are working — and which need improvement.

Such conversations can help organizations determine what practices
