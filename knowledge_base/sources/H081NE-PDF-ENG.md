As he refreshed his email for what felt like the hundredth time, Partha

Shah still couldn’t believe what he was seeing: a job oﬀer from one of

the Fortune 100 global technology companies he had dreamed about

since starting business school. His application had been a longshot —

he didn’t have the quantitative chops the company was looking for. But

Partha did bring many other things to the table, like his marketing

seamlessly interact across cultures. This last talent came naturally: He

had easily made friends with students from nearly every continent, he

followed creators from around the world to stay up on global trends,

and he leapt at any chance to travel abroad. Given his deep interest in

cultures near and far, the part of his new job that he was least worried

about was the multicultural aspect.

Imagine his surprise, then, when he struggled to bond with his new

colleagues, who were nothing like the cosmopolitan peers of his own

age whom he had so successfully connected with at school. Even after

several weeks of working together, his new coworkers still felt like

strangers. Interacting with them felt awkward, unnatural, and forced.

For the ﬁrst time, Partha experienced cultural diﬀerences as a barrier.

It was confounding, especially since he couldn’t pinpoint how or why

relationship building seemed so diﬀerent from what he was used to.

Worse, he didn’t know what to do about it — and not only did this make

his daily work life less pleasant, but he fretted that it could impact his

# career prospects, too.

The reality of today’s global organizations, like the one Partha joined,

is that they simply aren’t prioritizing cultural awareness or appreciation

of cultural diﬀerences to the degree they should. One survey found that

89% of corporate employees serve on at least one global team, and 62%

have colleagues from three or more cultures. These employees need

to be able to build eﬀective cross-cultural relationships despite their

cultural diﬀerences. This will only become more critical as companies

continue to globalize and diversify. And it’s not just large companies

going global. According to a recent survey, 75% of small and medium-

sized businesses are planning to increase their international headcount.

Like Partha, most of us never consider how culture shapes our

## expectations and assumptions about relationship building. But from

our research with over 100 professionals around the world, it’s very clear

that our cultural upbringing does inﬂuence how we form and maintain

connections with others — often quite signiﬁcantly. In our new book

Forging Bonds in a Global Workforce, we identify six core elements of the

relationship code, including where relationship building takes place,

who can initiate relationships with whom, what kinds of relationships

people attempt to form, what types of personal information people

share, how people present themselves in the early stages of getting

acquainted, and how quickly we expect to establish a working sense

of trust and rapport. These elements are at the root of the confusion,

misperception, and misattribution that can occur when people attempt

to build relationships across cultures.

By paying attention to these six elements, global workers like Partha will

gain insight into why things may “feel diﬀerent” when getting to know

their colleagues. They may even discover they have more in common

with their colleagues than they initially assumed. In this article, we’ll

introduce the six core elements of the relationship code: place, power,

# purpose, privacy, presence, and pacing.

# Place

## Relationship building ﬂourishes in diﬀerent places in diﬀerent cultures.

The key is to know which locations are likely to be the most conducive

to forging bonds with your colleagues from other cultures so you can

make the right moments count. For example, relationship building

in Japan — especially with a superior — is typically restricted to

events outside the workplace, like a visit to a karaoke bar. As a global

worker in Japan, it’s important to recognize the unique opportunity

for relationship building that a karaoke bar might provide, especially if

that particular location doesn’t carry the same meaning in your own

## culture. By contrast, relationship building in a Canadian workplace

might happen in many places inside the workplace — in the breakroom,

in the hallway, before or after a meeting, at lunch, during a break

from work. In this case, saving your bonding attempts for oﬀsite events

might mean your chance never comes. And in other cultures, like India,

relationship building may be especially likely at non-work events like

local festivals or family celebrations, where you may be invited to a

colleague’s home. If you don’t show up, you might not only insult your co-worker but you might ﬁnd it diﬃcult to forge that same bond back in the oﬃce.

# Power

To varying degrees across cultures, power shapes the perceived

boundaries of relationship building, particularly around who can have

relationships with whom, at what level, and who takes the lead. Imagine

that you come from a hierarchical culture, like South Korea, where

you were taught to show great respect and deference to elders — in

## your family, at school, in religious contexts, and then ultimately at the

workplace. Now imagine that as a young adult, you work at a startup

in the U.S., where building connections with superiors is normal and

even expected. You might ﬁnd yourself in the breakroom between

meetings, where people are casually making small talk, laughing, and

joking across seniority levels. It might be hard for you to enter the

fray to connect with your boss; it may even feel inappropriate and

# disrespectful.

Now let’s consider the reverse: What if you were raised in a very ﬂat

hierarchical culture where rank was downplayed, like Sweden or the

Netherlands, and you end up working in China or Malaysia. Now, you

likely need to show deference to your boss and patiently wait for signals

that a relationship is even an option. These signals may be indirect

— like sharing a small personal detail or showing a small gesture of

kindness — so you will have to make sure your antenna is up. In

global work, paying attention to the power element will give you a

better chance of fostering relationships in a way that seems appropriate,

# eﬀective, and professional.

# Purpose

Not all professional relationships serve the same purpose. Some

## oﬀer clear instrumental beneﬁts or strategic rewards, like that of an

independent consultant hoping to secure a deal with a key client.

Others oﬀer intrinsic beneﬁts, like the camaraderie and validation you

receive from working together. Professionals in places like Germany

may prefer to keep these two purposes separate: You wouldn’t

necessarily expect to become chummy with your work colleague here,

and it could feel like an intrusion or violation to do so. Yet in other

cultures, like Brazil, workplace relationships are cherished for their

own sake and colleagues often become friends who make a habit of

meeting up on the weekends for fun. And in some places, like the U.S.,

we see a blend: People enjoy building a personal connection, but more

to motivate the team, function eﬀectively, and get the job done faster.

These notions about purpose are linked to diﬀering interpretations

of “professionalism.” If we don’t pay attention to this, we can easily

feel annoyed, disillusioned, confused, or judgmental when a colleague

deviates from what we’re expecting.

# Privacy

All relationships involve some degree of personal disclosure, but what

you reveal and how soon you share it vary tremendously across cultures

(and personalities!). A Brazilian interviewee said there’s almost no topic

she wouldn’t discuss with her workmates, and she found it oﬀ-putting

that people would put up artiﬁcial walls around their personal lives

while at work. “What’s the big deal? We’re all just people!” According

to her, if she tried to get to know someone a few times and they

wouldn’t open up, she would likely assume that person was a snob, or

anti-social, and would probably give up. Now consider a totally diﬀerent

perspective from a Taiwanese manager, who griped that the default

American style of getting-to-know-you questions was far too personal.

“They say things like, ‘Tell me about yourself,’ or ask questions about

my background, my family. And I’m thinking, ‘Slow down, I just met

you! Let’s talk about something less personal ﬁrst.’” It’s easy to see how

these diﬀerences in cultural norms could easily lead two colleagues to

completely misjudge each other’s approach and even assume that the

relationship was hopeless, when the truth is that they just have diﬀerent

# norms for what they share and when.

# Presence

When you meet someone for the ﬁrst time, what kind of signals do

you send? Are you likely to smile and greet them with an inviting,

warm, upbeat, positive tone? Do you put the other person at ease with

your casual demeanor and relaxed vibe? Or do you take a restrained

approach, perhaps wearing a poker face and focusing on protocol over

cheerfulness? That’s what we mean by “presence” — the verbal and

non-verbal presentation style you send, and expect to receive, during

your initial interactions. And just like our other P’s, this one has strong

cultural roots, which makes it ripe for misunderstanding.

A good example of a culture clash around presence is a networking

event involving American and French professionals. Our French

interviewees told us that they try very hard to make a good impression

by being polite, digniﬁed, correct, and somewhat reserved at ﬁrst.

They may also try to show their intelligence and competence by

discussing something more philosophical, which feels to them like

safe professional territory. Yet, in doing so, they may come across

as unfriendly and snooty to their American counterparts, who are

typically not scanning for erudite discussion but are looking for signs

of cheerfulness and agreeability. Meanwhile, the American who is

chatting about what they perceive as “everyday topics” like sports and

pop culture — all while wearing a big grin and standing in a relaxed

manner — can look trivial, immature, and lacking gravitas. These mixed

signals can jeopardize a relationship before it even gets started, not

because the diﬀerences are insurmountable, but because each party’s

interpretations around their meaning can lead them to think the other

person is not worth getting to know.

# Pacing

Do you feel comfortable getting acquainted quickly? Or do you prefer

taking things slow? Pacing, which is similar to privacy, is relevant

## to professional relationships across cultures because some cultures

(and personalities) are quick to develop an initial working trust and

then get down to business right away, while others might be slower

to open up. In Germany, for example, it generally takes a while to

## feel comfortable enough with a new work colleague to share personal

information with them. This is exempliﬁed by the fact that Germans

often wait for a long time before even using the more familiar form of

the pronoun “you” (which is “du”) — defaulting instead to the more

formal version (“sie”) until the time is right. You just don’t typically

## fast-track personal relationships in Germany as you might in the U.S.

or some South American countries. We similarly heard from a Japanese

expat interviewee in Jordan that he had come to expect many rounds

of tea and sweets as part of the local getting-acquainted dance. To him,

the series of introductory conversations was superﬂuous to the tasks at

hand, but because he understood the pacing code, he tried to go with

# the ﬂow.

. . .

These core elements of building relationships across cultures aren’t

meant to be a formula that can predict what someone from a given

culture will be like, nor are they meant to tell global workers like Partha

exactly how to build relationships with colleagues across cultures.

Instead, they are meant to help professionals who work with colleagues

from diﬀerent cultures understand their own relationship “code,”

develop a sense of others’ styles, and (crucially) anticipate and identify

key gaps and overlaps between the two. With this newfound clarity,

the next step is to ﬁnd ways to bridge those gaps — or at least work

around them — so that otherwise promising relationships don’t fail to

launch. At the end of the day, people will make their own personal

determination about the extent to which they will adapt to the other’s

code, or simply accept the diﬀerence. But understanding the diﬀerence

is a critical ﬁrst step in building the relationship.
