Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA),

as amended(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/0001.mspa.htm) (29 CFR Part 500(/elaws/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi/t/text/text-

# idx^Q^c=ecfr|amp;sid=48d6ee3b99d3b3a97b1bf189e1757786|amp;rgn=div5|amp;view=text|amp;node=29:3.1.1.1.1|amp;idno=29&exitTitle=www.ecfr.gov&fedpage=y

The Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) is administered by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The Act

safeguards most migrant and seasonal agricultural workers in their interactions with farm labor contractors, agricultural employers, agricultural

associations, and providers of migrant housing. However, some farm labor contractors, agricultural employers, agricultural associations, and

providers of migrant housing are exempt from the MSPA under limited circumstances.

The MSPA requires farm labor contractors, agricultural employers, and agricultural associations, who recruit, solicit, hire, employ, furnish,

transport, or house agricultural workers, as well as providers of migrant housing, to meet certain minimum requirements in their dealings with

migrant and seasonal agricultural workers. These requirements include:

Farm labor contractor registration: Farm labor contractors (and any employee who performs farm labor contracting functions) must

register with the Department of Labor before recruiting, soliciting, hiring, employing, furnishing, or transporting any migrant or seasonal

agricultural worker. Agricultural employers and associations (and their employees) need not register as farm labor contractors.

# An agricultural employer or association using the services of a farm labor contractor must ﬁrst verify the registration status of the farm labor

# contractor. This process includes determining that the contractor is properly authorized for all activities he or she will undertake. To verify

## registration status, call 1-866-4-US-WAGE (1-866-487-9243).

Employment relationship: Under certain circumstances, the Department of Labor may determine that an agricultural employer or

association that uses the services of a farm labor contractor is a joint employer of the agricultural workers furnished by the farm labor

contractor. In joint employment situations, the agricultural employer or association is equally responsible with the farm labor contractor for

# compliance with employment-related MSPA obligations, such as the proper payment of wages.

Disclosure: Employers must provide each migrant and seasonal day-haul worker with a written disclosure at the time of recruitment that

describes the terms and conditions of his or her employment. When oﬀering employment, the employer must provide such disclosure to all

seasonal workers upon request. The disclosure must be written in the worker's language, as necessary or reasonable. The employer must

also post in a conspicuous place at the job site a poster setting forth the rights and protections that the MSPA aﬀords workers (See notices and posters below). A housing provider must post or present to each worker a statement of the terms and conditions of occupancy.

Wages, supplies, and working arrangements: Each person employing agricultural workers must pay all wages owed when due. Farm

labor contractors, agricultural employers, and associations are prohibited from requiring workers to purchase goods or services solely from

such contractor, employer, or association, or any person acting as an agent for such a person. In addition, no farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, or association may violate the terms of the working arrangement without adequate justiﬁcation.

Housing safety and health requirements: Each person who owns or controls housing provided to migrant agricultural workers must

ensure that the facility complies with the Federal and state safety and health standards covering that housing. Migrant housing may not be

occupied until it has been inspected and certiﬁed to meet these safety and health standards. The certiﬁcation of occupancy must be posted at the site.

Transportation safety: Each vehicle used to transport migrant or seasonal agricultural workers must be properly insured and operated by a

properly licensed driver. Each such vehicle must also meet Federal and state safety standards.

Employer protections: Farm labor contractors must comply with the terms of any written agreement they make with an agricultural

# employer or association.

Enforcement: The Wage and Hour Division enforces the MSPA. During a MSPA investigation, Wage and Hour investigators may enter and

inspect premises (including vehicles and housing), review and transcribe payroll and other records, and interview employers and employees.

The MSPA provides migrant agricultural workers and day-haul seasonal agricultural workers the right to receive written notice of the terms and

conditions of their employment when recruited. In addition, it provides seasonal workers the right to receive such written notiﬁcation upon the worker's request. The MSPA also requires employers of migrants and seasonal agricultural workers to adhere to the disclosed terms and

conditions of employment. Certain exemptions and exclusions apply to these provisions.

The MSPA gives migrant and seasonal agricultural workers the right to ﬁle a complaint with the Wage and Hour Division, ﬁle a private lawsuit

under the Act (or cause a complaint or lawsuit to be ﬁled), or testify or cooperate with an investigation or lawsuit in other ways without being

intimidated, threatened, restrained, coerced, blacklisted, discharged, or discriminated against in any manner.

Posters. Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association, that is subject to the MSPA and that employs any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker is required to post a poster explaining the rights and protections for workers required under the MSPA,

# such as the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act (MSPA) poster.

The poster must be posted in a conspicuous place at each place of employment. There are

English/Spanish(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/mspaensp.htm),

English/Haitian(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/mspaencr.htm), English/Vietnamese, and

# English/Hmong(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/mspaenHmong.pdf) versions of the poster, all of which can be printed from the

# Web.

There are no size requirements for these posters. Employers are encouraged to make the poster available in languages other than English.

Notice for terms and conditions of housing. Each person or organization that owns or controls a facility or real property used for housing

migrant workers must comply with Federal and state safety and health standards. A written statement of the terms and conditions of

occupancy must be posted at the housing site where it can be seen or be given to the workers. The written statement must include the

following information on the terms and conditions of occupancy of such housing:

The name and address of the farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, or agricultural association providing the housing The name and address of the individual in charge of the housing

The mailing address and phone number where persons living in the housing facility may be reached

Who may live at the housing facility

The charges to be made for housing

The meals to be provided and the charges to be made for them The charges for utilities

## Any other charges or conditions of occupancy

If the terms and conditions of occupancy are posted, the statement must be displayed and maintained during the entire period of occupancy. If

the terms and conditions of occupancy are provided to the worker through a statement (rather than through a posting), this statement must be

provided to the worker prior to occupancy. Employers may use a DOL form, WH Form 521 - Housing Terms and Conditions (PDF) (https://www.dol.gov/whd/forms/wh521.pdf), to satisfy this requirement.

Notice of employment terms. Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, and agricultural association that recruits any migrant

agricultural worker must provide the following information at the time of recruitment, while seasonal workers must be given the information

verbally when they are oﬀered work, and in writing, if requested. The information required to be disclosed includes the following information:

The place of employment (with speciﬁcs, such as the name and address of the employer or the association) The wage rates (including piece rates) to be paid

The crops and kinds of activities on which the worker may be employed

# The period of employment

The transportation, housing, and any other employee beneﬁts to be provided, if any, and any costs to be charged for each

Whether state workers' compensation or state unemployment insurance is provided Whether there is a strike or other concerted work stoppage at the place of employment

Whether the person has an arrangement with any establishments in the area to receive a commission or other beneﬁt from any sales by

# such establishment to the workers

Note: If workers' compensation is provided, this information must include the name of the workers' compensation insurance carrier, the name

of the policyholder, the name and telephone number of each person who must be notiﬁed of an injury or death, and the time period within which such notice must be given. This requirement in the section above may be satisﬁed by giving the worker a photocopy of any workers'

compensation notice required by state law.

Payroll statements for workers. In addition to making records of payroll information (see Recordkeeping section below), the farm labor

contractor, agricultural employer and agricultural association must provide each migrant or seasonal agricultural worker a written statement of this information. This information must be provided at the time of payment for each pay period which must be no less often than every two

weeks (or semi-monthly). In addition to the payroll information speciﬁed below, such statement shall also include the employer's name,

address, and employer identiﬁcation number assigned by the Internal Revenue Service. In the case of a worker who is jointly employed, only

one of the two joint employers needs to provide a written statement to the workers.

Responsibilities of Joint Employers. Agricultural employers who use the services of a farm labor contractor may be in a situation of joint employment with the contractor in regard to the employees. Joint employment means that an individual is employed by two or more persons

at the same time. Where a joint employment relationship exists, each of the employers must ensure that the employee receives all

employment-related rights granted by the MSPA, such as accurate and timely disclosure of the terms and conditions of employment, written

payroll records, and payment of wages when due. If either party fails to comply with the law, both parties may be held liable. For more detail

on joint employment see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #12: Agricultural Employers Under the Fair Labor Standards Act(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs12.pdf) and Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #35: Joint Employment and Independent

Contractors Under the Migrant and Seasonal Agricultural Worker Protection Act(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs35.pdf).

# Field Sanitation Standards. In addition, the Occupational Safety and Health Act's ﬁeld sanitation standards require covered agricultural

# establishments to provide toilets, potable drinking water, and hand-washing facilities to hand-laborers in the ﬁeld; to provide each employee

# reasonable use of the above; and to inform each employee of the importance of good hygiene practices. For more information on the ﬁeld sanitation standards see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #51: Field Sanitation Standards under the Occupational Safety and Health

## Act(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/whdfs51.pdf).

Payroll records. Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, and agricultural association that employs migrant or seasonal agricultural workers must make and keep the following records for each worker:

## Name, permanent address, and Social Security number

Basis on which wages are paid

Number of piecework units earned, if paid on a piecework basis

Number of hours worked Total pay period earnings

Speciﬁc sums withheld and the purpose of each sum withheld

# Net pay

Each farm labor contractor, agricultural employer, and agricultural association that employs migrant or seasonal agricultural workers must keep

all payroll records for each worker for a period of three years. When a farm labor contractor employs migrant or seasonal agricultural workers for an agricultural employer, agricultural association, or other farm labor contractor, the employer must also provide these payroll records for

each employee. The person receiving these records must maintain them for a period of three years.

Certiﬁcate of registration. Any person acting as a farm labor contractor is required ﬁrst to obtain a Certiﬁcate of Registration authorizing each such activity. For more details, see the Instructions for Form WH-530: Application for a Farm Labor Contractor or Farm Labor Contractor

Employee Certiﬁcate of Registration. The phrase "farm labor contracting activity" means recruiting, soliciting, hiring, employing, furnishing, or

transporting any migrant or seasonal agricultural worker.

Any employee of a registered farm labor contractor who performs farm labor contracting activities solely on behalf of such contractor, and who

is not an independent contractor, must obtain a Farm Labor Contractor Employee Certiﬁcate of Registration authorizing each such activity. The employee's certiﬁcate must show the name of the farm labor contractor for whom the activities are to be performed. The contractor whose

name appears on the employee's certiﬁcate must hold a valid certiﬁcate of registration covering the entire period shown on the employee's

# certiﬁcate.

Each registered farm labor contractor and farm labor contractor employee must carry the certiﬁcate of registration card at all times when

performing farm labor contracting activities and must show the card, upon request, to anyone with whom he/she intends to deal as a farm labor contractor.

Section 110 of the 1977 Mine Act established a maximum civil penalty for each violation of an MSHA mandatory health or safety standard or violation of the Act. The Mine Act also established civil penalties for failing to correct a violation for which a citation was issued; discriminatory

conduct under Section 105(c) of the Act; and smoking or carrying smoking materials, matches, or lighters. Section 8 of the 2006 MINER Act

established a maximum civil penalty for a "ﬂagrant" violation and established minimum civil penalties for unwarrantable failure violations and

increased civil penalties for operators who fail to timely notify MSHA of certain accidents.

On July 1, 2016, the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) issued an interim ﬁnal rule to adjust the amounts of civil penalties assessed or enforced in the DOL's regulations

The Federal Civil Penalties Inﬂation Adjustment Act of 1990 as amended by the Federal Civil Penalties Inﬂation Adjustment Act Improvements

Act of 2015 (Inﬂation Adjustment Act) requires agencies to adjust the levels of civil monetary penalties with an initial catch-up adjustment,

followed by annual adjustments for inﬂation. The DOL is required to calculate the catch-up and subsequent annual adjustments based on the

Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers. The new penalty levels, which include MSHA civil penalties, are eﬀective no later than August 1, 2016.

# The provisions of Sections 110(c) and 110(d) of the Mine Act are among the most stringent levels of enforcement action available to MSHA to

# ensure compliance with the Mine Act and related standards. Under these provisions, MSHA is authorized to propose the assessment of a civil

# penalty against a director, oﬃcer, or agent of a corporate operator who knowingly orders, authorizes, or carries out a violation of a mandatory safety or health standard, or to pursue criminal proceedings against an operator or a corporate director, oﬃcer, or agent who willfully violates a

mandatory safety or health standard. MSHA conducts investigations under Sections 110(c) and 110(d) to establish the facts and

circumstances surrounding certain violations of the Mine Act or of mandatory safety or health standards in order to determine whether the

violations were knowing or willful in nature. In general, the violations reviewed include those involving imminently dangerous situations and a

high degree of negligence or reckless disregard. Criminal investigations may also result from reports of alleged violations of Section 110(f) (false reporting) or Section 110(h) (equipment misrepresentation). If evidence of a willful violation is found, the case is referred to the

# Department of Justice.

The Mine Act does not give MSHA the authority to cede its responsibilities to states or any other political subdivisions. The Mine Act does not preempt state mine safety and health laws, except insofar as they may conﬂict with the Mine Act or MSHA's regulations. States may have

## more stringent health and safety standards.
