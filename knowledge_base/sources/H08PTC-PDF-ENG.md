The blurring of boundaries between people’s jobs and personal lives,

exacerbated by the pandemic, can make it feel like the workday never

ends. The burnout that results from never quite feeling unplugged has

become a major drain on workers and businesses, reducing employee

# well-being and productivity.

Employers have responded by promoting wellness programs

and encouraging work-life balance—initiatives proven to increase

productivity, reduce turnover, and boost job satisfaction. But our

research reveals a hidden contradiction at the heart of these eﬀorts:

While companies say they want employees to unplug, they may be

quietly punishing those who actually do.

In new research, published in Organizational Behavior and Human

Decision Processes, we found that even when leaders recognized that

detaching from work boosts employee well-being and improves job

performance, they still penalized employees who engaged in these

behaviors when they were up for a promotion or being considered

for a new role. This is because these workers were seen as less

committed than those who worked around the clock, even if their job

performance during working hours was perceived to be higher than

their “committed” counterparts.

But we also found that there are structural changes organizations can

make to help protect workers’ boundaries without also penalizing them:

creating a culture that both mitigates burnout and rewards strong work.

# The Research

Across 16 studies with 7,800 of participants, we explored a simple

question: How are employees who try to switch oﬀ from work during

non-work hours perceived?

In controlled experiments, we presented managers with proﬁles of

employees who were identical in quality (i.e., past annual evaluations)

but varied in their use of detachment strategies. For example, one employee left an out-of-oﬃce reply during a weekend getaway while

the other employee did not.

Managers consistently reported that the employee who disconnected

from work over the weekend would be more recharged and more

productive upon their return, thus recognizing the beneﬁts of

detachment on employee performance. However, they also penalized

## that same employee in evaluations, consistently rating them as less

committed and less promotable than their colleague.

This penalty persisted even when the detaching employee was a

manager’s direct report, when the detaching employee was objectively

better at their job, when neither of the employees actually did any work

during their time oﬀ, and when the reason for detachment was virtuous

(e.g., caring for a sick family member).

Perhaps our most eye-opening ﬁnding? The eﬀect was just as strong

among managers who say they value work-life balance as it was

among those who do not. Even managers who report having explicitly

encouraged detachment in their organizations penalized detaching

employees in our studies. That is not just inconsistent and unfair, it

is a recipe for a burnout culture.

# Why It Happens

The issue lies in how we, as leaders, interpret eﬀort and commitment.

We are trained, often unconsciously, to value visibility and

responsiveness as a proxy for dedication. Employees who respond late

at night or skip vacations are seen as “going the extra mile.” Meanwhile,

those who protect their non-work hours are viewed as less passionate,

less committed, and therefore less promotable, even when they are

equally or more eﬀective on the job. This mindset ignores our own

lay theories and years of supportive research showing that people who

detach from work come back more energized, more productive, and less

likely to burn out.

This detachment paradox reinforces a damaging culture, rewarding

those who constantly stay plugged in and, over time, creating a

leadership pipeline that undervalues work-life balance. The result is a self-perpetuating cycle of overwork and burnout is increasingly diﬃcult

to break. Ultimately, everyone loses: Employees suﬀer, organizations

pay the price in lowered productivity and increased turnover, and the

broader economy feels the impact through rising healthcare costs due to

# work stress.

# What Leaders Can Do

Our ﬁndings suggest that executives and managers must be intentional

about how they communicate around work-life balance and must

implement concrete policies so their organization are practicing what

they preach. Vague or half-hearted eﬀorts to promote balance may do

more harm than good if the evaluation system rewards the performance

# of constant availability.

We oﬀer leaders the following recommendations to help them break

## their teams out of the damaging cycle of overwork:

- Ask yourself: Who are you rewarding? Are your highest-rated

employees those who seem most “available” or those who are actually

doing the best job? If your top performers feel they must sacriﬁce rest

to prove commitment, your evaluation system may be broken.

- Redeﬁne commitment. Start separating performance from presence.

Being constantly available should not be equated with dedication.

Make it clear that outcomes, not responsiveness or hours logged, are

# the benchmark.

- Stick to working hours. Discourage managers from contacting

## employees outside of work hours unless necessary. Many email

programs have built-in alerts that can remind managers and

employees when they are sending messages outside of standard hours.

When oﬀ-hours work is expected, oﬀer overtime pay or compensatory

# time.

- Implement policies that encourage detachment. Clear, formal

policies change norms. In one of our studies, which included 200

U.S. managers, we found that simply showing them a company policy

that encouraged email-free weekends signiﬁcantly reduced managers’

subconscious bias against those who disconnect. Make sure your

company has policies to help reinforce stated values.

- Train managers. Penalizing those who unplug—or favoring those

who do not—is often done unconsciously. Help your managers spot

these biases and counteract them during performance reviews and

hiring conversations by reminding them of company values and

# policies around work-life balance.

Whatever steps you take, ensure buy-in from leaders across the

organization. Clear, consistently enforced policies are more eﬀective

# than broad statements of support.

. . .

Expectations about when and how employees should be available for

work have permeated our workplace culture. Our research shows just

how hard these assumptions are to shake, even when people recognize

## the value of greater work-life balance and support well-being in theory.

To build a high-performing and sustainable organization, we must

eliminate the bias against employees who are willing to set clear

boundaries around their work and instead hold them up as models for

others. We need to redeﬁne commitment not as self-sacriﬁce, but as the

ability to show up energized, focused, and ready to contribute.

If your company claims to value employee well-being, your promotions

and policies must reﬂect that. In the long run, your best employees are

not the ones who burn out trying to prove their worth. They are the ones
