Five years after the Covid-19 pandemic forced companies to go remote

with little warning, many ﬁrms are mandating that their employees

return to the oﬃce (RTO) ﬁve days a week. As a leader, you may be

wondering if you should follow suit, especially as JPMorgan, Amazon,

and even the U.S. government are moving in this direction.

# HBR / Digital Article / Does Returning to the Office Support Your Company’s Strategy?

While this may be the right decision for some organizations, we advise

caution before making a knee-jerk decision. There are many companies for whom aspects of remote work are paying oﬀ—for talent acquisition

## and retention, productivity gains, new market expansion, and more.

But some organizations aren’t realizing these beneﬁts. Our research and

experience working with dozens of companies navigating remote and

## hybrid work reveal three common reasons as to why:

- 1. Their policies aren’t designed to meet strategic business needs

- 2. Their policies aren’t implemented in ways to help leverage talent

- 3. Their policies are rarely or never ﬁne-tuned .

Instead of playing follow the leader on RTO, organizations should be

much more strategic about what’s truly working about their remote or

hybrid strategy—and which areas they should revamp.

Here are some places where current approaches fall short, as well as

strategies for truly embedding hybrid work into your business.

# The Problems with Current Approaches

The evidence is clear that, for many employees and organizations, working remotely at least part of the time pays oﬀ. In the U.S. from

2019 to 2022, for example, the rise of remote work was associated with productivity growth across 61 diﬀerent industries in the private sector.

People who are remote workers one to two days a week are rated by

their supervisors as having higher performance than full-time on-site

employees. Experiments led by Stanford researchers at a global travel

agency in China found that hybrid employees working from home

two days a week are as productive as fully on-site workers—and are

happier and less likely to quit. These ﬁndings are especially true for

## non-managers and employees with a longer commute. Studies also

show signiﬁcant cost-savings: many employees are willing to take a pay

## reduction in exchange for WFH ﬂexibility, and real estate cost savings

can be as high as 50%.

But we’ve found that many ﬁrms don’t actually know if this data applies

to them: if their employees are more productive or innovative under an

in-oﬃce mandate or working remotely some of time, how they perceive

issues of fairness when it comes to remote work policies, or whether

their lives will become more stressful by going into the oﬃce every day

# or not.

This can lead to common errors. One involves siloed policies, where

ﬂexibility is applied in isolated pockets of the organization (e.g. one

## unit’s leader adopts an across-the-board fully remote policy without

considering how jobs are structured or work with other units). Another

is a laissez-faire approach, which leaves ﬂexibility decisions up to an

individual employee and managers without developing a cohesive team

approach or consistent standards; this can make it diﬃcult to even

schedule meetings or decide on core working hours. Both of these

approaches can also create divides across the workforce and make

managers’ jobs harder, among other consequences; as a result, it’s no

wonder many leaders might question whether remote or hybrid work is

# worth it.

## Embed Remote and Hybrid Work Into Your Business Strategy

You can avoid the shortcomings of these approaches by truly integrating

remote or hybrid work into your strategy as it’s appropriate for

your speciﬁc business, and developing the infrastructure (technical

and cultural) to support it. The result is a work structure that

is directly connected to how your company supports operational

excellence, innovation, and culture—and, as a result, how it achieves its

ﬁnancial goals. We recommend focusing on ﬁve speciﬁc areas to better

understand your organization’s current approach—and identify where

you might need to make changes.

- 1. Market and innovation goals

First, ask: What are our market and innovation goals—and can remote

or hybrid work support them? By connecting these goals to your work

policies, you’ll gain clarity on how your hybrid or remote work can (or

can’t) beneﬁt your company long-term.

For example, one of Daysmart’s goals was expansion, which they didn’t

want sidelined during the pandemic. So, the business management

software ﬁrm embraced remote work as a cornerstone of its strategy,

doubling its talent pool from six to over 30 U.S. states, as well as other

global locations, thus extending its market reach.

To bridge the gap between your market goals and a hybrid or remote

strategy, map your market needs ﬁrst, then align hybrid and remote

work strategy across critical job roles, teams, and locations. Identify

## key business goals—such as expansion, innovation, repeat customer

service, or cost eﬃciency—and analyze whether and how remote or

hybrid work helps achieve them. Pinpoint critical job roles within and

## across teams and locations and whether a remote or hybrid setup fosters

high performance. This includes identifying which critical job tasks are

individual or interdependent. For example, NVIDIA’s business model

centers on innovation and technological leadership, yet it also gets high

revenue from hardware sales and cloud services. Their hybrid work

model allows those with innovation roles in software development and

AI research—which is performed on a laptop and via videoconferencing

—to work remotely at least part of the week. Yet, those in hardware

or lab roles, which involve working directly with manufacturing or

scientiﬁc equipment, generally work on site.

Second, ask: Can remote and hybrid work enable new pathways to

innovation by broadening collaboration within and across geographies,

tapping into diverse perspectives beyond the traditional oﬃce

environment? And can it accelerate the pace of problem-solving to

## enhance creativity and the exchange of ideas via open innovation to

# drive solutions?

To link innovation goals to deploying hybrid and remote work, bring

employees together for structured collaboration periods to support

speciﬁc market strategies. Establish clear systems for virtual or on-

## site brainstorming, cross-functional team sprints, and synchronous

and asynchronous collaboration, and create a digital repository

for capturing and reﬁning new ideas. For example, Atlassian uses

“collaboration zones” where employees can utilize remote and hybrid

arrangements, so long as their location ensures four to six hours of daily

# overlap with their coworkers.

It’s also vital to set clear goals to assess linkages between innovation and

market performance metrics in relationship to a distributed workforce.

Setting benchmarks, such as time-to-market for new products or

customer engagement levels, can help to measure whether your hybrid

work structure is helping you reach your company’s speciﬁc targets.

- 2. Governance

Ask: What are our governance obligations—and is hybrid or remote

work linked to them? Depending on your industry or location,

integrating hybrid or remote work into business governance opens up

opportunities to align with Environmental, Social, and Governance

(ESG) goals. For example, workplace ﬂexibility is increasingly

recognized as more than a perk; it’s a crucial metric for human-capital eﬀectiveness and ESG reporting. A recent KPMG report underscores

this trend, noting that ﬂexible work is a rising concern for corporate

boards and investors. Global banking ﬁrm Northern Trust, for example,

has committed to reaching net zero carbon emissions and includes

measuring employee commutes as one key aspect of its plan to achieve

# this goal.

So, investigate whether this a particular concern for your stakeholders

by examining your organizational mission, values, and industry

standards. Clarify how remote or hybrid work aligns with your

company’s values and governance principles to communicate a

## consistent message to employees, investors, and board members. For

instance, digital banking solutions company Q2’s hybrid work model

is oriented around “support[ing] the mission, strengthen[ing] the

community,” referencing its value statement to develop “strong and

diverse communities by strengthening their ﬁnancial institutions.”

Organizations should also benchmark against industry ESG standards.

Download competitor reports to analyze how they position remote and

hybrid work, looking for trends in governance disclosures and investor

priorities. Gartner, for example, publishes quarterly benchmarking

reports associated with various return-to-oﬃce and hybrid work trends

and patterns that companies may access to compare themselves.

- 3. Internal data and analytics

Ask: Do we use internal data to understand what’s working about our

remote or hybrid strategy? Do we know which jobs and tasks can

be done remotely and to a high degree of quality, and which can’t? Do we eﬀectively plan and implement team coordination? And do we

regularly gather feedback from team leaders and employees to improve

# our hybrid or remote work strategies?

For example, Moody’s empowers managers to collaborate with their

team to develop a remote or hybrid conﬁguration tailored to the

team’s needs. It then collects data to monitor outcomes like promotion

## rates, pay equity, and well-being across job levels, gender and other

demographics, and location to look for disparities between employees with diﬀerent work conﬁgurations. Managers and their teams then

adjust their remote/hybrid work approach to address any inequities the

data reveal. For example, lower levels of reported well-being among a

certain demographic (e.g., new hires) or work arrangement (e.g., on site,

remote) of employees would trigger further analysis to understand and

# address the discrepancy.

Often, data measured across common jobs and the team level is key.

When Northern Trust decided to migrate work teams by functions to

hybrid work, it used data and experimentation to guide the process.

They ﬁrst assessed risks of moving tasks and jobs from fully onsite

to hybrid, focusing on business processes in whole teams rather than

for individuals. Selected teams served as hybrid pilots, with team

charters outlining expectations, along with extensive pre- and post-

# rollout analysis and ﬁnetuning.

Finally, track individual and group satisfaction, performance, and

well-being associated with remote and hybrid work to identify areas

to improve. Dropbox continually reﬁnes its remote-ﬁrst approach,

utilizing internal data to identify what works best. By enhancing

mentorship and local meetups in response to employee feedback,

Dropbox boosted employee job satisfaction to 72% from 64%.

- 4. Recruitment and retention

Ask: Do we understand if remote and hybrid work is important in

attracting and retaining workers? Answering this question will depend

on several factors, including labor market trends for types of people you

want to hire, where they are, and what your current top performers

want and need to do their best work. For example, high-demand

professionals, such as engineers or data scientists, often expect remote

and hybrid work as the industry standard. Geographic location also

matters. Are you competing in a region with a tight labor market where

## remote and work expands your talent pool?

Look at your top performers—does remote and hybrid work help them

thrive? Your long-term workforce strategy is another key factor. Are

you scaling a distributed workforce for growth, or does in-person

collaboration remain essential? Finally, assess whether remote and

hybrid work improves engagement and retention. Do employees stay

longer and perform better when given hybrid or remote options?

Evaluating these questions will help you determine how central remote

work should be in your talent strategy.

Doing this right can yield huge beneﬁts. Yelp, which adopted remote

work to save on real estate costs, reduced turnover by 13% since 2021.

Spotify’s “Work from Anywhere” policy, launched in 2021, signiﬁcantly

contributed to talent retention, cutting attrition rates by 15%. By noting that remote staﬀ aren’t “children,” Spotify has not only strengthened its

## employer brand but reduced turnover talent.

- 5. Manager training

Ask: Are managers aware of how their important role in making remote

or hybrid work successful—and do they receive training based on it?

Traditional management strategies often fall short in remote and

hybrid settings, and only 28% of hybrid team leaders receiving

relevant training. This highlights the need to upskill leaders to meet

these new demands, including developing managers’ skills in team

building, assessing employees’ performance, and enhancing well-being

when face-to-face interaction is limited. For example, Pinterest, which

allows employees to work remotely or in person, has a “Manager Kickstart” program to train leaders on how to eﬀectively manage remote

workers, paired with detailed follow-up analysis of the program’s eﬀects. Cisco provides training around assessing outcome-based

performance, holding employee onboarding discussions to choose

the best hybrid conﬁguration, and supporting employee well-being.

And Gitlab trains leaders how to support company culture and build

# informal relationships remotely.

To understand what your managers may (or may not) know, and areas

they struggle with:

- Assess current management gaps. Conduct surveys or structured

interviews with managers and employees to identify challenges

in leading remote and hybrid teams—focusing on communication,

## performance assessment, and team cohesion.

- Provide targeted, hands-on training. Oﬀer structured programs

like Pinterest’s “Manager Kickstart,” with practical workshops on

coaching remote employees, fostering engagement, and setting clear

performance expectations. Pair training with real-world case studies

and peer learning.

- Measure and evaluate leadership eﬀectiveness. Track key

## indicators—such as employee engagement, retention, and team

productivity—before and after manager training. Use these insights

to ﬁne-tune programs and provide ongoing manager coaching.

Too many ﬁrms treat remote and hybrid work as a temporary

adjustment or an afterthought, leading to inconsistent policies and

missed opportunities. It’s no surprise some are yet again backtracking

and adopting return-to-oﬃce mandates. But instead of jumping on or oﬀ the latest remote and hybrid work bandwagon, your company can

take a strategic, data-driven approach to embed remote and hybrid

work into your business. As demands to adapt to the rapidly-evolving

future of work intensify, the organizations that succeed won’t be the

ones haphazardly reacting to trends but those that thoughtfully act to

make hybrid and remote work as a core part of their strategy.
