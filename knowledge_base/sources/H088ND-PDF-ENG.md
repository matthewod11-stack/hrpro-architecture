Asian Americans are crucial in today’s knowledge economy: around

60% hold at least a bachelor’s degree and, despite representing only

about 7% of the U.S. population, account for 50% of the workforce in

leading Silicon Valley tech companies.

But here’s the catch: Although Asians are the most educated segment of

the American workforce, they are the least likely among all racial groups

to ascend to leadership roles. In fact, a detailed analysis of top Fortune

500 technology companies shows that Asian professionals are even less

likely to progress in their careers today than they were a decade ago.

This paradox points to a severe underutilization of Asian talent,

as deﬁned by the U.S. Census to include people originating from

East, South, and Southeast Asia. This squandering of talent not only

curtails individual career trajectories, it also directly impacts corporate

productivity. When a substantial portion of a company’s workforce is

hindered from contributing fully, the entire organization suﬀers.

The urgency to address this challenge is further ampliﬁed by ongoing

demographic shifts. Pew research shows that in the last two decades,

the Asian population segment in the U.S. has surged by 81%, outpacing

the growth rates of 70% for Hispanics, 20% for Black and 1% for

white segments. This makes Asians not only America’s fastest-growing

## portion of the workforce, but also its fastest-growing business and

# consumer market.

Of course, prejudice based on race or ethnicity and unconscious bias

play a role in these challenges. In this article, we will explain how the

## unintentional mismanagement of Asian workers results in their career

stagnation and lost organizational productivity. We will also oﬀer our

views on strategies for ensuring Asian employees can grow and thrive

within organizations, in ways that further a company’s broader business

# Dispelling Myths on Asians in Leadership

Asians are often viewed as a uniformly successful group. While highly

diverse, Asians by and large do excel in acquiring higher education

and securing entry-level positions. However, when they should be

leveraging their education and hard work to ascend in their careers,

their prospects often take a sharp and unexpected decline.

Although Asians make up around 13% of the U.S. professional workforce, they hold only 1.5% of Fortune 500 corporate oﬃcer roles.

This disparity is even more pronounced for Asian women, who make up

less than 1% of promotions into the C-suite. Additionally, more than half

of Fortune 1000 company Boards have no Asian directors.

For many, being “stuck” somewhere in the middle of the career

ladder is a profound source of disappointment, frustration, and

even shame. This challenge is particularly poignant for those whose

professional achievements symbolize the culmination of their family’s

## multi-generational immigrant dreams and sacriﬁces.

These racial inequities stem in part from a lack of awareness about

cultural diﬀerences. In the case of Asians, cultural diﬀerences are often

misunderstood, leading to a systemic waste of diverse talent.

Asians are frequently stereotyped as excellent workers, but poor

leaders. In truth, Asians make excellent leaders. For example, a study

encompassing 1,000 startups that achieved unicorn status — each

valued at over $1 billion — over the past decade revealed that one-third

of those founded in the United States had an Asian founder.

Furthermore, a Goldman Sachs study of 5,000 CEOs, evaluating

CEO eﬀectiveness, indicated that Asian CEOs are typically appointed

during corporate crisis. Despite these challenging circumstances, the

median Asian CEO elevates their company from underperforming to

outperforming their sector by nearly 50%. Goldman Sachs concludes

that Asian leaders bring unique abilities and perspectives that enable

them to succeed in leadership roles.

Thus, the real question for companies is not whether Asians are

competent leaders, but rather why their potential is being squandered,

and how we can maximize their contributions to corporate results and

# proﬁts.

## Organizational Barriers to Asian Career Growth

To understand why Asians face unique career barriers, it’s crucial to

consider demographics: 71% of Asian adults in America are immigrants.

(In contrast, only 17% of all American adults are immigrants.) Most U.S.-

born Asians are children of these immigrants, so despite their ﬂuent

English and American education, they are raised with Asian cultural

values and norms, which diﬀer markedly from the Western values

# prevalent in corporate America.

This demographic divide creates a culture clash in the workplace. Many

Asians uphold values like academic excellence, hard work, humility,

## and respect for authority — essential for leadership in collectivist

and hierarchical Asian societies. However, leaders often prioritize

colleagues who embody the individualistic and assertive styles of

Western cultures. As a result, Asians are often relegated to the fringes of corporate networks, where they may stagnate throughout their careers.

This marginalization breeds a deep sense of alienation. Only 16% of

Asian men and 20% of Asian women feel a sense of belonging in their

workplaces, according to a study from Bain & Company — the lowest

# rates among all demographic groups.

Such isolation and exclusion not only negatively aﬀects Asian

professionals, it also has concrete business impacts. Asian employees

are signiﬁcantly more likely than their white and Black counterparts

to disengage from work due to these cultural disconnects, often by

considering quitting or scaling back their ambitions, according to a 2011

Coqual report. In fact, it’s the youngest cohort of Asian employees, those

most likely to be U.S.-born and native English speakers, who report

feeling the least belonging.

Clearly, time spent in the U.S. alone will not rectify the isolation

experienced by Asian employees. Companies aiming to better utilize

their Asian employees, while enabling them to thrive and lead, must

adopt a proactive approach to doing so.

## A Five-Step Roadmap for Leveraging Asian Talent

To optimize the contributions of your Asian professionals, we propose

ﬁve actions based on our respective experiences helping companies

grow through more a more strategic approach to talent.

Equip leaders to lead effectively across all cultures.

When we consider culture, our thoughts often turn to its visible aspects:

food, arts, and festivals. However, like the bulk of an iceberg, the most

substantial parts of culture remain unseen. Beneath the surface are the

learned and shared patterns that powerfully shape our interactions with

# others.

For example, a common misperception holds that Asians excel

in technical domains but are deﬁcient in communication skills.

Considering that Asians in America come from societies encompassing

## over half of the world’s population, such a viewpoint not only

diminishes the vast diversity of this group, but also exposes a critical

gap in cultural understanding. Asian communication styles are not

deﬁcient, but simply diﬀerent. They tend to be more nuanced and

layered compared to the direct approaches favored in Western contexts.

These underlying aspects of culture are the crucial “diﬀerences that

make a diﬀerence” to individual and team performance. Since they

are subconscious and deeply embedded, we frequently struggle to fully

understand their inﬂuence.

But understand them we must, since a key factor in whether diversity

improves performance is whether leaders eﬀectively harness cultural

diﬀerences. Research has shown that multicultural teams perform

better and unlock more creativity when their diﬀerences are understood

# and utilized wisely.

We’ve observed that, since the upper echelons of many organizations

are quite homogeneous, they often become cultural echo chambers.

Consequently, many leaders have limited opportunities to understand

the cultural “diﬀerences that make a diﬀerence” to team performance

or to develop the skills to leverage them eﬀectively. This often results

in leaders inadvertently imposing their own cultural norms on their

teams, stiﬂing diverse voices, and leading to teams that are culturally

homogeneous even if they are demographically diverse. In this way,

many leaders’ goals to be inclusive can be undermined by their own

# behavioral norms.

Such homogeneity tends to reinforce itself, preventing leaders from

gaining meaningful experience with the learned and shared patterns of

other cultures. This situation perpetuates cultural silos and groupthink,

hindering the team’s ability to innovate and respond dynamically to

# new challenges.

Eﬀective training empowers leaders not only to learn about cultural

diﬀerences, but more importantly, to adapt their behaviors to lead

eﬀectively across those cultures. For example, at a global asset

management ﬁrm, one of us (Joy) equipped senior partners with

## insights into the evolution of Asian and Western cultures and how these

developments subtly inﬂuence interactions on their teams today. Joy

also introduced eﬀective strategies for engaging and motivating team

## members and clients from across cultural backgrounds.

And at a technology ﬁrm, Joy and her team facilitated interactive

sessions between company leaders and Asian employees, focusing on

mutual learning and mentoring. Participants explored the logic behind

cultural norms — such as indirect or direct communication — from

## the perspectives of diﬀerent cultures, with guidance from colleagues

who are experts in those cultural contexts. Moreover, they practiced

adapting their behaviors creatively to thrive in these new settings while

staying true to their core values and authentic selves. This exercise

enabled employees to learn from their diﬀerences, and to recognize the

value that all cultures bring to achieving organizational goals.

By enabling leaders to adeptly bridge cultures, this approach to

leadership development transforms cultural diversity from a potential

## source of isolation and marginalization into a potent source of

# innovation and growth.

Equip Asian employees with professional development that meets their needs.

Professional development is the single top predictor of Asian employee

satisfaction and belonging, according to Asia Society research —

and companies consistently struggle to give Asian employees the

professional development they need.

Research published by the Asian Psychological Association emphasizes

that “developing Asian leaders requires organizations to consider the

cultural context and tailor training to meet their unique needs.”

Traditional leadership programs often do not address the experiences

and developmental needs of individuals raised outside Western cultural

norms. This oversight not only impedes the career progression of Asian

participants, but also risks reinforcing negative stereotypes. Further,

when training falls short, there is a tendency to mistakenly attribute the

failure to the trainees’ supposed lack of leadership capabilities, further

marginalizing them and perpetuating the myth of Asians as inadequate

# leaders.

We do not suggest pushing for the Westernization of Asian employees;

instead, organizations should focus on helping them embrace their

own identities while understanding and adapting to Western business

norms. The goal is to empower them to be fully eﬀective and authentic

# in every setting.

## For instance, for a global material sciences company, Joy and her

team created a 15-month training program that guides Asian learners

from being peak performers to becoming extraordinary leaders. The

program begins by clarifying the “unwritten rules” of Western business

and encouraging cultural self-discovery, allowing learners to recognize

and appreciate their cultural strengths. We then teach the emotional

intelligence (EQ) skills which are highly valued in Western corporations.

Crucially, these programs extend beyond training the Asian employees

themselves. We also provide a streamlined module for their managers

and sponsors, equipping these leaders to eﬀectively support and lead

multicultural teams. This is essential because frontline leaders are

crucial for supporting Asian employees—and indeed, all employees – to

be both eﬀective and authentic at work.

Promote and integrate qualiﬁed Asian employees into organizational leadership.

Creating equitable career opportunities for Asian professionals

necessitates a concerted eﬀort from leadership to establish unbiased

career progression frameworks. Research from the Journal of Business

and Psychology illuminates a critical obstacle: a double whammy, where

stereotypical perceptions of Asians directly oppose the traits valued

## in Western leadership (assertiveness, dominance, and charisma) — yet

## coincide precisely with those of an ideal follower (competence, hard

# work, and docility).

This “role incongruence” not only obstructs the career advancement

of Asian individuals, but also diminishes organizational willingness to

nurture their leadership potential by making it less likely for executives

to identify Asians as high-potential leaders. Importantly, the same

research indicates that once Asian Americans are in leadership roles,

they are often viewed as equally eﬀective as their white American peers,

eﬀectively debunking misconceptions about their leadership abilities.

The solution is clear: Promote qualiﬁed Asian professionals into

leadership roles. In so doing, organizations can address and dismantle

entrenched cultural biases and also capitalize on the unique

perspectives and leadership styles that Asian professionals contribute.

Some of the steps to achieving this include implementing transparent,

merit-based promotion criteria and eliminating stereotypical language

from employee evaluations. It is also crucial to ensure that Asian

employees are fully supported and integrated within the informal

# networks of their peers and leaders.

Embrace “culture add” instead of demanding “culture ﬁt.”

The celebrated individualism of corporate America, characterized by

optimism, ambition, and entrepreneurial drive, is globally admired.

## However, this culture often inadvertently fosters dynamics where the

most assertive voices win, leaving quieter, potentially transformative

contributors overlooked, their potential untapped and motivation

drained.

# HBR / Digital Article / Stop Overlooking the Leadership Potential of Asian Employees

Instead of trying to ﬁt everyone into this Western mold, organizations

can beneﬁt by adopting some of the collectivist values of many Asian

## cultures. For example, the Asian focus on group synergy can eﬀectively

## complement the individualistic nature of Western companies. By

integrating these values, organizations can shift from a culture that

inadvertently promotes groupthink to one that sees diﬀerences as

opportunities for mutual learning. Within the team, the focus shifts

from individual winners and losers to everyone pulling together to

achieve shared success. This evolution allows organizations to move

beyond being dominated by the loudest voices towards a more balanced

approach that prioritizes the needs of the entire organization.

To do this, leaders should consistently emphasize the interdependence

of the team and the importance of every voice. One eﬀective strategy

being implemented in several technology companies includes requiring

all team members to write memos before meetings. This practice

ensures that all voices contribute, prevents language and cultural

diﬀerences from overshadowing who gets heard, and promotes the deep

thinking necessary for generating valuable ideas. This approach also

addresses the ineﬀectiveness of traditional brainstorming, which can

be particularly counterproductive when mismanagement of cultural

diﬀerences stiﬂes diverse voices.

Additionally, leaders have a crucial responsibility to overcome our

natural tendency to gravitate toward those similar to us. It is essential

for leaders to ensure that Asian employees and all team members

form the strong emotional bonds that are necessary for everyone to

contribute fully and eﬀectively. Leaders should consider increasing

one-on-one interactions with their Asian employees to foster these

connections, thereby facilitating eﬀective teamwork and individual

# thriving.

By pivoting from a “culture ﬁt” to a “culture add” mindset, teams can

enhance their operations with the diverse perspectives of all members,

including those from Asian backgrounds.

## Leverage Asian employees to power domestic and global market expansion.

Leaders aiming for top-line growth should ensure their Asian employees

aren’t relegated to back-end technical roles. These workers possess

unique strengths that can help power the capture of new and rapidly

expanding markets.

A prime example is JPMorgan Chase, which has established a dedicated Oﬃce of Asian & Paciﬁc Islander Aﬀairs under the leadership of longtime bank executive Vivian Young. This oﬃce actively cultivates

opportunities for Asian business owners and their communities,

enabling the bank to provide culturally responsive services tailored

to their evolving needs. For example, through market research, the oﬃce has identiﬁed an impending wave of succession planning needs

within Asian communities. In response, JPMorgan Chase is working

with Asian community partners and local chambers of commerce to roll

out succession planning workshops and additional services designed

for these business owners. This proactive strategy not only strengthens

community ties but also positions the bank at the forefront of market trends, ensuring it is ready to eﬃciently meet emerging demands.

Given their predominantly immigrant background, some Asian

employees also provide exceptional access to resources in Asia, which

is home to a majority of the world’s population. If the employee

is open to playing such a role, their extensive networks can give

## their employers a competitive edge in understanding, identifying and

capturing opportunities within these key regions.

Moreover, incorporating Asian perspectives at the board level

can signiﬁcantly enhance a company’s market strategy. Just as

technological or domain-speciﬁc expertise is valued, companies can

proﬁt from Asian board members who bring relevant market insights

## and act as vital links to domestic and international markets.

A notable example is Starbucks, which has pinpointed Asia as a

key growth market. To support their expansion in this vital region,

Starbucks appointed as a Board member Wei Zhang, a former senior

Alibaba executive who brings deep expertise in both global technology

# and Asian markets.

Such strategic appointments can enable a deeper understanding of how

to optimally utilize the Asian workforce to achieve organizational goals,

turning cultural diversity into a strategic advantage that drives growth

## and positions the company as a leader in global markets.

## Asian Employees as Catalysts for Organizational Growth

As many companies scale back their diversity, equity, and inclusion

programs, it’s essential to recognize the pressing need for progress in

ensuring that all employees can thrive and lead. This commitment

must include America’s fastest-growing workforce. When we enable

Asian employees to fully contribute to corporate results and aspirations,

everyone wins.

In fact, we believe companies that fully utilize their Asian employees

can enhance bottom-line productivity, drive top-line growth in

domestic and global markets, and increase overall enterprise value. To

determine the appropriate investment, companies should analyze both

## the costs of current practices and the potential returns to shareholder

# value.

# HBR / Digital Article / Stop Overlooking the Leadership Potential of Asian Employees

Let’s consider a hypothetical high-tech company employing 1,000

professionals, reﬂecting Silicon Valley norms where 50% of the

workforce is Asian with a conservatively estimated salary of $150,000.

Research from Qualtrics indicates that only 20% of employees who

don’t feel a sense of belonging are engaged at work, compared to 91%

of those who do. Using Bain and Company’s ﬁnding that around 80%

of Asian employees don’t feel belonging, we can infer that only 34% of

Asian employees are engaged, leaving 66% disengaged.

Using Gallup’s ﬁnding that a disengaged employee represents a cost

of 34% of their annual salary, by better engaging Asian employees,

the company could achieve productivity gains of $17 million per year.

Assuming an enterprise value to earnings ratio of 10x, this $17 million

annual proﬁt boost translates into a remarkable (albeit theoretical)

## $170 million increase in enterprise value for shareholders. These

calculations scale linearly. A company with 5,000 employees could

realize productivity gains of $85 million per year and create $850

# million in enterprise value.

This approach also has the potential for wider organizational

transformation. When companies leverage the diverse talents of their

Asian workforce, they can evolve into more global, agile, and powerful

hubs of innovation and growth. This strategy not only better engages

## Asian employees, but also attracts and inspires top talent from all

# backgrounds.

By strategically meeting the needs of their Asian employees, leaders can

## alleviate widespread frustration and lack of belonging among this key

workforce segment, and thus bolster the present and future success of

# their enterprise.
