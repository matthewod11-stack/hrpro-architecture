In our years as executive coaches, we’ve had hundreds of people ask

us how they can become executive coaches, too. Not surprisingly, we

have ﬁelded an increase in inquiries over the past three years, ever since

Covid fundamentally changed the world of work.

That’s not just anecdotal. According to the International Coach

## Federation (ICF) 2023 Global Coaching Study, the estimated number of

coach practitioners is more than 109,000 globally, having increased 54%

# between 2019 and 2022.

While we appreciate that those who are asking us how to become a

coach likely value the profession, recognize that coaching is a powerful

way to support others, see the ﬂexibility and autonomy that having

a coaching practice can oﬀer, and perhaps have even beneﬁtted from

being coached themselves, we also acknowledge that we must tell them

# the truth.

And the truth is — it takes hard work in ways that might surprise you.

Why? Because many people misunderstand what coaching is,

underestimate the process to become a credentialed coach, and don’t

anticipate the ongoing eﬀort required to generate and develop business

to make a living doing this work.

The ﬁve of us have approximately 60 years of collective coaching

experience and we all really, really love what we do. But each of us has

our own “secret sauce” to building these rewarding coaching careers;

there’s no single playbook. How many clients should you have? What

other income streams should you consider? How many hours per day

should you coach? How do you get clients (and keep them)? And most

importantly, how hard is it? We want to give you some clarity so that you

can fulﬁll your own coaching dream.

## Why People Say They Want to Become a Coach

Coaching is a helping profession, and we often experience a “helper’s

high” (similar to a runner’s high) when we help. We humans are

naturally wired for pro-social behavior, and the thought of getting paid

to help others certainly seems like a win-win.

Many people who are interested in the profession believe they

have natural coaching skills that they could leverage into a career.

Furthermore, they may be at a stage in their careers where they have

knowledge and experience and want to share it. They may also be at a stage where they’re tired of oﬃce politics and reporting to managers,

and desire more autonomy and agency in their work. More than ever

before, people want ﬂexibility and control over where, when, and how

they work.

Another reason we hear from our colleagues and clients delights us:

Many people have experienced powerful, positive transformations with

coaches, and they want to be a part of that process from a diﬀerent

# perspective.

# What People Misunderstand About Coaching

Before we dispel the common misunderstandings about coaching, let’s

clarify what coaching is. The ICF deﬁnes coaching as “partnering with

clients in a thought-provoking and creative process that inspires them

to maximize their personal and professional potential.” The process of

coaching often unlocks previously untapped sources of imagination,

# productivity, and leadership.

Executive coaching is diﬀerent from sports coaching. Sports coaches

instruct, direct, strategize, and drive their athletes to win. In many ways,

the sports coach is in the driver’s seat, with the team as passengers. In

executive coaching, the coach sits in the passenger seat, with the client

driving. The coach brings the process, but the coaching goes where the

client takes it and explores what the client wants to explore. This can be a diﬃcult mindset for aspiring coaches to understand initially.

To be clear, executive coaching is not:

- Teaching, instructing, or advising. Coaching involves helping the

client to reﬂect, build their awareness, and tap into their own inherent

wisdom to reach new awareness and understanding of themselves.

- Consulting or problem-solving. Consulting focuses on a problem

and the conditions surrounding it, whereas coaching focuses on the

person and supports them as they tackle the problem. If you had to

decide between two options, a consultant might do a thorough analysis

and oﬀer their expert recommendation. A coach doesn’t even need

to know what the choices are! The coach doesn’t oﬀer solutions. The

coach is there to help the client solve their own problem.

- Mentoring. We turn to mentors to hear the knowledge they’ve learned

from their life’s experience. When you say, “when I was in this

situation, here’s how I handled it,” you’re acting like a mentor rather

than a coach. Coaches don’t need experience in the client’s topic

to create profound transformation. The coach relies on the craft of

coaching to help the client unlock their own expertise.

- Giving feedback. Sometimes people say that someone “needs

coaching” when what they really mean is that they need feedback.

Feedback is most eﬀective when given directly by colleagues or a

manager. Coaches can then help clients process feedback they’ve

received and can support them in getting the feedback they’d like to

# receive from others.

All of these are essential tools in any helper’s toolkit. They’re just

diﬀerent tools from coaching tools. Coaches may call on these practices

when they believe it would be helpful, but ground their practice in

distinct coaching competencies.

## What It Takes to Have a Successful Executive Coaching Practice

To be successful as an executive coach, you ﬁrst need to learn the

craft of coaching. Training from an accredited coach training school

can take up to one year. Earning certiﬁcation through ICF also requires

working with a mentor coach, at least 100 hours working with clients,

and passing an exam.

Independent coaches also need to be entrepreneurs. While some

coaches ﬁnd employment within organizations, many operate

independently, which means being an entrepreneur, with all the

potential risks and rewards. You will need to put more eﬀort and hours

into building your business than into coaching. According to the ICF

## Global Coaching Study, in 2022, coach practitioners on average spent

# less than 12 hours per week coaching.

New coaches often have to learn more than coaching — they have to

learn to sell. It is not enough to be a great coach; to do this for a

living, many coaches need to learn business development. Developing

business can include networking, investing in writing or speaking

engagements, running seminars, and having ﬁt conversations with

# potential clients.

And what if you‘re not interested in sales or in building a business?

Then you can align yourself with a ﬁrm that will do that part for you (for

a hefty chunk of the revenue). If you are going to go that route, you’ll

need a lot of coaching hours and a successful track record to be selected

to join these ﬁrms.

It may take you years to build up your coaching income. According to

the ICF, years of coaching experience is positively linked to the drivers

of coaching revenue. Earning capacity for coaches varies widely. The

study reports that 53% of coaches globally earn less than $30k in annual

revenue from coaching. Typically, the more experienced the coach,

the higher the reported average fee per one-hour coaching session.

Newer coaches fresh out of a certiﬁcation program can expect $100-

$300 per coaching hour, while some seasoned coaches earn over $750

per coaching hour. In our experience, C-level executives expect their

coaches to have at least 5-7 years of full-time experience as an executive

# coach.

To mitigate this, many new coaches diversify their businesses by

oﬀering services beyond coaching. Almost all coach practitioners (93%)

oﬀer services in addition to coaching. Most frequently, coaches also

oﬀer consulting (59%), training (58%), and/or facilitation services (55%).

Coaches might teach a range of workshops — both virtually and in-

person — on topics related to leadership development. On average,

coach practitioners oﬀer almost three (2.8) services in addition to

# coaching.

And while we aren’t new coaches, each of us has found that this variety

adds depth and fulﬁllment to our practices and makes us stronger

coaches, which makes us more attractive to clients.

What to Do If You Really, Truly Want to Become a Professional Coach

First and foremost, if you want to become a professional coach, we

recommend working with a credentialed coach yourself so that you

really understand what coaching is — and isn’t. This may lead you to

ask yourself if what you really want to do is give advice, share your

expertise on how to do things, and solve problems. If so, you may ﬁnd a

## better ﬁt as a consultant, mentor, or teacher.

Next, you should also consider whether you thrive with independent

work or in collaboration with others. Coaching isn’t really a team sport,

and you can often ﬁnd yourself alone in your home oﬃce on successive

calls with clients for a whole day, without anyone to socialize with.

Many people become coaches because they love working with people,

only to ﬁnd themselves working alone at home.

Reach out to coaches you know and trust, and ask them how they really

make their living — and what they wish someone had told them about

becoming a coach. One of us wishes they knew how lonely it could be.

One of us wishes they knew how often people would misunderstand

what coaching is (this is why it’s a good investment of time and eﬀort

to set clear expectations before your client invests in your services). And

another one of us wishes someone had advised them to identify which

leaders and situations they’d like to specialize in earlier on.

Put in time every day to cultivate your network. That’s where your

referrals and clients will come from.

And invest in your own personal development by attending an

accredited coaching school (in person, online, or hybrid), taking

continuing education courses, and joining a community of coaches with

whom you can share the trials and joys of building a coaching practice.

The International Coach Federation can help you ﬁnd all three.

Finally, you may also need to ﬁnd a way to support yourself ﬁnancially

while you are training as a coach and for the ﬁrst few years of your

coaching business.

Being an executive coach can be fulﬁlling, rewarding, ﬂexible, lucrative,

and yes, fun! By investing in becoming an excellent coach and building

your business, you can create a career that centers on helping others

imagine and realize their potential. If you approach this process
