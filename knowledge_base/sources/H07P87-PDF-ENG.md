When taking on a new leadership role, it’s natural to focus on the

immediate challenges of making a successful transition, including

accelerating your learning, building relationship with stakeholders,

and securing early wins. However, it is essential to complement

this “now-forward” planning with “future-back” thinking about your

desired destination and what it will take to get there. As Stephen

Covey expressed in his best-selling book, The Seven Habits of Highly

Effective People, you want to “start with the end in mind.” This means

envisioning what you want to accomplish in the new role so you will be

ready to move beyond it and then working backward to map out how

you will get there. In so doing, you can shape your early actions to lay

# the foundation for long-term success.

The starting point is to engage in what Dan Ciampa, the noted executive

coach, deﬁned as “era planning.” Your era is the anticipated duration of

time you think you will be in the new position. Of course, you may end

up staying longer or leaving earlier, but try to make a rough guess about

when you will have accomplished enough to be “done.” You’ll want to

ask yourself two key questions: “As I wrap up this job, what will be true?”

and “What will be possible?”

# Envisioning Your Leadership Legacy

The ﬁrst question — “What will be true?” — asks you to outline the

legacy you aspire to create and the story you will tell about your

achievements. Focus on what you want to be remembered for in your

new position and what you want your team and peers to say about your

# leadership.

Consider key areas such as:

- Performance outcomes: What are the tangible results — for example,

in terms of increased productivity or proﬁtability — you will achieve?

- Organizational transformation: How will you reshape the team and

# its culture?

- Innovation: What will you do to foster creativity and develop new

# areas for growth?

- Talent development: How will you hire and train people to take the

# organization into the future?

Distill these into a concise, written personal narrative. Then, think

about what you need to do, starting now, to realize this legacy.

# Creating Future Possibilities

The second question — “What will be possible?” — encourages you to

envision futures beyond your current role and strategize the steps you’ll

take to turn them into viable options. This process involves identifying

multiple potential paths forward and pinpointing the skills you’ll need

to acquire and the connections you’ll need to establish over the course

of this era to make those viable options. By exploring diﬀerent scenarios

and actively planning your development, you’ll be better equipped to

adapt and seize emerging opportunities.

Take these steps:

- Create a list of potential futures, considering logical next steps in your

## organization and your industry, as well as less conventional but still

attractive options that would take you in diﬀerent directions.

- Assess whether there are skill gaps you need to close to achieve some

or all of those futures by reﬂecting on your existing strengths and areas

# for improvement.

- Identify the bridges — the steps and connections — that would allow

you to transition from your current role to your desired future options.

These might include expanding your professional network, deepening

your industry knowledge, or engaging in what Ken Banta and Orlan

Boston described as “strategic side gigs,” such as teaching or working

# on boards of directors.

- Develop a plan for how you’ll acquire the skills and build the bridges to

make the potential futures you have identiﬁed realistic options, setting

speciﬁc goals and holding yourself accountable for achieving them.

As Peter Drucker said, “The best way to predict the future is to create

it.” By imagining multiple potential futures and working toward them,

you’ll create real options for yourself when you’re ready to move on from

# your current role.

To successfully step into a new leadership role and set yourself up

for long-term success, you must balance “now-forward” planning with

“future-back” visioning. This mindset will empower you to make early

decisions that will accelerate your transition, pave the way for long-term

impact in the new role, and contribute to your continued career growth.
