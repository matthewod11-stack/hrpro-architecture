The debate about AI’s impact on consulting tends to swingbetween two extremes: Some argue that AI

will render

consultants obsolete; others claim it

will only make them more

indispensable. Both views miss the more nuanced and importantreality: Consulting isn’t disappearing; it’s being fundamentallyreshaped.

For decades, the industry has operated on a stable “pyramid”model: a wide base of junior consultants handling research,modeling, and analysis and supporting a narrow apex of seniorleaders who guide strategy and manage client relationships. Thispyramid structure has powered the economics of consulting andshaped the profession’s identity.But AI is upending that model. Generative AI tools, predictivealgorithms, and

synthetic research platforms are rapidlyautomating the very tasks that once filled junior consultants’weeks. As this transformation accelerates, consulting firms face achoice: evolve their delivery model or risk becoming irrelevant.As leaders of an AI-native consulting firm,

Disruptive Edge, two ofus, David Duncan and Tyler Anderson, are experimenting withthis new model, exploring how AI tools can help with a wide rangeof consulting tasks—from automating routine research toaugmenting more advanced analysis and synthesis. The aim is tosee how these tools can speed delivery, sharpen the quality ofinsights, and free consultants to focus on the things that demandjudgment, creativity, and deeper engagement with clients. Alongwith our third coauthor, Jeffrey Saviano, an expert in theemerging fields of AI governance and ethics, we’re also thinkingthrough how critical components of consulting firms, such astalent development and governance, need to evolve in these newmodels.

The core reasons companies hire consultants are unlikely to goaway any time soon. Organizations will continue to need external,

specialized expertise, flexible capacity, credible validation, and anindependent perspective on complex problems.But while the demand remains, AI is undermining the traditionalmodel consulting firms use to fulfill it. This model depends onjunior consultants spending weeks on tasks such as gatheringdata, analyzing it, modeling scenarios, and crafting slides tosupport senior consultants-led recommendations. Today, AIsystems can do all of that, and more—and they do it faster, morecheaply, and, in many cases, better.For example, McKinsey’s proprietary AI assistant,

Lilli, is nowused by over 72% of its workforce, reducing research andsynthesis time by around 30%. The Boston Consulting Group is

using

Deckster, a tool that creates presentation decks in minutes,and Bain

has deployed

Sage, an AI copilot trained on its internalIP. Applications of agentic AI are also on the rise, with exampleslike

Deloitte’s Zora AI agents and PwC’s

agent OS platformreshaping internal workflows and client offerings. Across theboard, generative AI is

increasingly performing the work usuallyhandled by large teams of junior consultants.The work being automated isn’t trivial. It already includes tasksthat are the cornerstone of lower-level consulting roles and isencroaching on the tasks of the middle tier as well. If AI takes overwork that used to justify thousands of billable junior hours, thepyramid will collapse under its own weight.

In response, we propose that a new model is emerging: theconsulting obelisk. Unlike the traditional consulting pyramid,which depends on a wide base of junior consultants, the obeliskrepresents a tall, narrow model: fewer layers, smaller teams, and

more leverage at every level. Instead of relying on sheer scale, thismodel is built around three human roles:

AI facilitators are early-career consultants trained in the latestAI tools and data pipelines. They design and reﬁne AI-drivenworkﬂows, helping teams generate insights at speed. This roleoﬀers a new kind of apprenticeship that emphasizes technicalﬂuency and applied judgment from day one.

Engagement architects are experienced consultants who leadprojects. They help deﬁne the problems to solve, interpret AIoutputs with human judgment, and translate them intoactionable strategies. They orchestrate how work gets done andadapt as conditions change, while ensuring that insights turninto results.

Client leaders focus on the long game. They cultivate deep,trusted relationships with senior executives, help them makesense of change, and stay close enough to advise them on howto stay ahead of disruption.We identified these roles based on the three functions that areessential for any consulting firm to operate: Someone must buildand implement the workflows that generate outputs for the clientproblem at hand, someone must lead the work and translate itinto recommendations, and someone must build and sustaintrusted executive relationships. Together, these roles also create anatural pipeline for talent development—a pipeline that must besustained even in the age of AI.The obelisk model balances these roles across levels, reflecting ashift away from scale for its own sake. What matters now isdelivering sharper thinking with greater speed and less overhead.More than just a cost-efficient response to automation, the obelisk

represents a necessary evolution of how consulting talent isstructured and deployed. As AI takes over routine tasks, humanenergy can be reallocated to what matters most: insight,judgment, and trusted partnership.

Some of the clearest examples of the obelisk model aren’t comingfrom the big firms but from a fast-growing wave of AI-nativeboutiques.

Monevate, a firm focused exclusively on pricingstrategy, combines deep expertise with AI-enabled playbooks andmodeling tools to deliver advice without a traditional analystlayer.

SIB, which specializes in cost reduction, uses AI agents toscan invoices and vendor contracts for savings opportunities,deploying human experts only when needed. Both firms avoid thepyramid structure entirely, delivering focused, repeatable valuewith fewer people and far less overhead.

Unity Advisory, launched by former partners of the Big Fourprofessional services firms and backed by $300 million in privatecapital, represents perhaps the most deliberate reinvention of theconsulting model at scale. It positions itself as conflict free,meaning not encumbered by audit-advisory entanglements orclient conflicts, and AI-native by design. Rather than build atraditional pyramid, Unity relies on agile pods of seniorconsultants who work in close coordination with proprietary AItools to deliver high-speed, high-quality strategy support. Itdoesn’t hire large, entry-level analyst cohorts or rely onhierarchical, middle management structures; it has eliminatedthe classic leveraged pyramid of billable hours in favor of fast,expert-driven delivery, a textbook expression of the obelisk inaction.

Disruptive Edge is applying similar principles. For example,rather than have junior consultants spend weeks building

foundational knowledge, we kick off engagements with

AI-

powered deep research reports that synthesize vast amounts ofinformation quickly. Tools like the AI-powered app-developmentplatform

Lovable allow teams to move from concept to fullyfunctional prototypes in under two weeks rather than months.This enables us to staff assignments with smaller, more seniorteams and spend more time with clients where it matters most.While

research on traditional firms confirms that AI tools canperform many of the tasks that once occupied large teams ofjunior consultants, often with gains in speed and quality, therelative newness of the obelisk model means long-term evidenceis still to emerge. However, we believe that, if foundational taskscan be automated or accelerated, then smaller, more senior-heavyteams can focus more on the areas where human expertise createsthe most value.

Despite the forces causing this shift, many traditional consultingfirms will struggle to make the leap. As Clayton Christensenexplains in

The Innovator’s Dilemma, incumbents rarely disruptthemselves, especially when their existing model is still printingmoney. In consulting, that model is the highly profitable pyramid.The pyramid model has long shaped consulting firms’ culture,economics, and delivery. Promotions, compensation, staffingmodels, and even the mental model of what “good consulting”looks like are all wired around headcount and leverage,containing powerful incentives to maintain large teams of juniorconsultants.This is precisely what makes change so hard. Even as firms investin AI tools or announce AI innovation labs, those capabilitiesoften remain siloed from core delivery. Flashy demos may

impress clients, but the underlying engine— large project teamsstaffed with junior talent—remains largely untouched. Moving toa leaner, AI-augmented structure can feel like an existential threatto firms built on scale.There’s also a talent realignment challenge. Traditional firms arebuilt to recruit and train generalist MBAs by the hundreds. Butthe future demands something different: smaller cohorts fluent inAI tools, data workflows, and systems thinking. Some havelaunched upskilling programs (PwC, for example,

has committed

$1 billion to AI training) but culture and incentives will naturallylag, with systems still favoring hours billed over insight delivered.These symptoms all point to a deeper issue: treating AI as a tool tobolt onto the old model rather than a reason to re-architect it fromfirst principles. In the short term, that may preserve margins. Butover time, it opens the door for smaller, AI-native firms to movefaster, operate leaner, and offer clients more value with fewerpeople and at lower cost.

The implications of this shift are profound. Consulting firms thatcontinue to rely on junior-intensive models risk becoming slower,more expensive, and less relevant. Those that act decisively canemerge leaner, more expert-driven, and far more valuable toclients.For incumbent firms, transitioning to the obelisk model will notbe easy. Entire workflows will need to be redesigned around AI toredefine how value is created and delivered. Training anddevelopment of junior talent will need to evolve to integrate AIfacilitation skills with more traditional consulting skills likeproblem-solving, communications, and client management. And

compensation models must evolve, rewarding strategiccontribution and client outcomes over billable hours.This new model also raises important questions around AIgovernance and ethics. In traditional consulting, clientdeliverables typically passed through layers of review by analysts,senior consultants, managers, and partners, making it easier tocatch issues and assign responsibility. But in the obelisk model,where small teams move quickly and AI plays a larger role indecision-making, new approaches will be needed to ensure thatAI-powered decisions are understandable, equitable, and made bypeople who are clearly accountable.One of us (Jeffrey Saviano), is a former EY partner who now leadsa research team developing new models for AI governance andethics at Harvard’s

Edmond & Lily Safra Center for Ethics, aninstitution focused on strengthening research and teaching onethical issues. Its work emphasizes the need for business leadersto take responsibility for governing AI themselves versus waitingfor government regulation. That means building ethicalguardrails into how AI is used, not relying solely on centralizedcompliance teams or after-the-fact reviews. We’ve seen how this isespecially important in the obelisk model, where ethicalaccountability must be clear, distributed, and embedded directlyinto team workflows—especially as small expert teams areempowered by tools capable of influencing high-stakes decisions.Despite the challenges for consultancies, this is not a moment forincrementalism. The winners will be those who move first andreimagine the industry before someone else does it for them.
