In today’s fast-paced and complex business environment, fostering

collaboration across organizational silos, whether between diﬀerent teams, divisions, or regional oﬃces, is no longer a luxury — it’s a

necessity. It is key to improving performance, unlocking innovation,

and speeding up coordination.

Both research and practice highlight the importance of engaging

employees in breaking down silos. These individuals, known as

“boundary spanners” or “network brokers,” often go beyond their

formal roles to bridge gaps between disconnected people and units

in an organization, facilitating the ﬂow of ideas, information, and

resources. Research also suggests that engaging in these activities can

boost employees’ careers because they are exposed to unique strategic

## information and insights from diﬀerent parts of the organization.

## However, our recent research uncovers less obvious, yet signiﬁcant

risks associated with cross-silo coordination. Across ﬁeld data, surveys,

and experiments involving more than 2,000 working adults across two

countries, we found evidence that engaging in collaboration across

silos, and particularly acting as an intermediary between disparate

individuals in an organization, can lead to increased levels of burnout

# and negative social behaviors.

## The Unseen Costs: Cognitive Overload and Emotional Strain

While past research has documented many beneﬁts of boundary-

spanning, we suspected that individuals collaborating across silos may

be faced with higher levels of cognitive and emotional demands, which

could lead to higher levels of burnout. We also wanted to understand

if the exhaustion and burnout they faced may lead to abusive behavior

# toward others.

We employed a multi-method approach to test our ideas. First, we

conducted a ﬁeld study at a university in South America. We collected

email exchanges among employees to measure how and how much

they collaborate across silos. These emails were anonymized to remove

## any personal information about the senders and recipients. We also

measured their burnout and level of aggressiveness using a survey.

In a second study, we surveyed a sample of U.S. employees across

a range of organizations in diﬀerent industries. We asked them to

report on their behavior when collaborating across silos and, later, on

their burnout and abusive behaviors toward others. In a third study,

we conducted an experiment that placed participants in scenarios

representing diﬀerent ways to collaborate across silos and measured

## their impact on self-reported burnout and abusive behavior. Across the

studies, we measured moderate levels of abusive behaviors relevant to

workplaces, such as being rude to others, making negative comments,

undermining others, and putting them down.

Throughout these three studies, we identiﬁed that engaging in cross-

silo collaborations, especially when keeping people across silos apart

(whether physically or in terms of communication) increases burnout.

This increase in burnout is due to the additional cognitive and

emotional demands these activities entail. When engaging in cross-silo

collaborations, employees need to handle complex, often conﬂicting

information and perspectives from various sources and reconcile them

to generate value for their work and their organization. They often

encounter divergent expectations or group norms and need to adapt

to them to make progress in their work. Moreover, while breaking down

silos and facilitating collaborations, individuals often ﬁnd themselves

with limited control over their collaborators’ work.

Take the hypothetical case of Nilam, an engine system engineer at

a successful startup, who is loosely based on a range of informal

interviews we conducted with managers. Nilam works with two

## coworkers from diﬀerent teams: Jun, a marketer, and Riley, a

production lead. On one particular project, Nilam sought their perspectives early on in designing of the company’s new fuel-eﬃcient

# engine.

While Nilam was initially thrilled to work with both of them,

the demands associated with these interactions soon became

overwhelming. Jun advocated for a power-dense engine that market

research shows to be in demand. On the other hand, Riley was

concerned about the production and cost constraints of such a new

engine: Increasing its power density might mean higher production costs, even hurting its fuel eﬃciency.

The cognitive load ramped up as Nilam tried to reconcile these

## conﬂicting requirements through separate back-to-back meetings with

Jun to discuss customer preferences and with Riley to go over

production costs. Each meeting ended with a list of action items

that Nilam had to incorporate into the engine design, adding to their

# workload.

Moreover, Nilam faced the challenge of adapting to diﬀerent group

norms. As a marketer, Jun was all about making quick decisions and

fast iterations. Riley, however, followed the stringent protocols of their

production team and was methodical and risk-averse. Managing these

conﬂicting approaches was stressful for Nilam and took a toll on their

# mental health over time.

Our research also shows that the higher level of burnout boundary

spanners such as Nilam experience can have spillover eﬀects on their

coworkers because it increases the likelihood of engaging in aggressive

or abusive behavior. Feelings of exhaustion and of being overwhelmed

can lead to abrupt or derogatory comments, displays of impatience,

as well as being more prone to conﬂict. All of this poses a serious

threat to the vital role boundary spanners play in fostering cross-silo

# collaboration within an organization.

## The Solution: Organizational Support for Connection and Recovery

So, what can organizations do to encourage important cross-boundary

engagement without exhausting their employees? We suggest three

# main strategies.

## Strategically integrate cross-silo collaboration into formal roles.

Certain functions within organizations are structurally positioned to

## engage in cross-silo collaboration more frequently, for example, project

## management, sales and marketing, and human resources management.

The ﬁrst step to reducing burnout from cross-silo collaboration is to

formally recognize their role in bridging diﬀerent contacts and teams in

## their job description, workload, and performance evaluation.

For example, in Nilam’s case, this would mean including the

## involvement of key stakeholders from marketing and production as

part of an engine system engineer’s job description and responsibilities,

along with developing speciﬁc objectives related to this boundary-

spanning role. Recognizing these activities as part of Nilam’s role is an

explicit acknowledgment of the demands that the role carries. The same

addition would apply to the job of Jun and Riley, such that marketers

and production leads expect to cowork with people from diﬀerent

# teams.

What’s crucial here is ensuring that the work performed by boundary

spanners is recognized and that there are clear expectations for

## their indispensable role as cross-team, cross-function collaborator, in

# addition to their functional roles.

Provide adequate resources.

Burnout often stems from a mismatch between the demands of a

job and the resources available to an employee. This issue becomes

more acute for those who informally take on the task of cross-silo

collaboration, as they face extra cognitive and emotional burdens

without necessarily receiving additional support to manage these

# challenges eﬀectively.

Therefore, it becomes crucial not only to acknowledge people’s

roles in cross-silo collaboration formally, but also to equip and prepare them with suﬃcient organizational resources. These resources

include essential technological tools for collaboration and, perhaps

## more importantly, comprehensive training programs in areas such

## as communication, negotiation, cultural sensitivity, and project

# management.

Furthermore, given the evidence that recognition and incentives

can mitigate the negative impact of burnout, oﬀering rewards for

achievements in cross-silo collaboration can provide further motivation

and recognition. For example, consider introducing a “Cross-Function

Collaboration Champion” award, accompanied by a ﬁnancial bonus,

to recognize individuals or teams who excel in cross-silo collaboration

between diﬀerent departments or geographical locations to enhance

work quality or knowledge exchange. By ensuring that employees are

both well-equipped and recognized in this manner, organizations can

signiﬁcantly mitigate the risk of burnout and foster a healthier, more

# productive workplace environment.

Develop multifaceted check-in mechanisms and provide opportunities to disengage.

Due to the inherently demanding nature of cross-silo collaborations

— both informal and formalized — engaging in boundary-spanning

activities can lead to burnout among employees. Therefore, it is crucial

for organizations and managers to identify when their key boundary

spanners are becoming overloaded and help them disengage regularly.

Detecting burnout in employees requires a multifaceted approach that

combines direct communication with observation to provide feedback

and support. First, managers can actively use their one-on-one check-

ins to understand the challenges faced by boundary spanners. Second,

## observations of changes in work habits, such as a sudden drop in

productivity or an increase in absenteeism, can be a sign of burnout.

Additionally, since burnout often manifests in aggressive behavior

toward others, it is important for managers to be vigilant if team

members suddenly act aggressively or abusively. Third, pulse surveys,

which typically collect data on employees’ current state of mind,

workload, and well-being, can be another way to detect symptoms of

# burnout in boundary spanners.

Finally, because the demands faced by individuals like Nilam occur

## informally outside the zone of formal inﬂuence of their manager, they

are often only partially visible. Hence, to help boundary spanners

disengage, organizations can cultivate a wider workplace culture that

emphasizes the importance of breaks and recovery time and legitimizes

disengaging completely from work during the evening or the weekend.

For example, having leaders delay their answers (or questions) until the

next working day signals that immediate responses are not required

# during non-working hours.

. . .

Cross-silo collaboration is a double-edged sword in the modern

workplace. While it undeniably serves as a catalyst for expedited

coordination and innovation, it can adversely aﬀect the well-being of

those who engage in it. The good news is that organizations can adopt a

multifaceted approach to support their boundary-spanning employees.

Adopting these approaches will require eﬀort and time at both the

organizational and individual levels. However, we believe this is a

worthy investment, not only to address the risk of employee burnout
