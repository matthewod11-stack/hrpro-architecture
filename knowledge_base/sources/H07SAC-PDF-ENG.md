Vacations are meant to be rejuvenating. Time oﬀ can not only help you

restore your mind, body, and soul, it also has a positive impact on your

work life: One study found that employees who take 11 or more vacation

days are more likely to receive a raise or bonus.

However, not all vacations are as restorative or energizing as we

hope they’ll be. Chronic work stress can interfere with our plans. The

phenomenon of getting sick as soon as you start to relax even has a

# name: leisure sickness.

## HBR / Digital Article / When Your Vacation Wasn’t Exactly Relaxing

Even when pacing yourself, your time oﬀ doesn’t always go as planned.

The vacation itself can be a source of stress for a variety of reasons, from

strained relationships, pre-vacation stress of getting everything done,

unexpected travel delays, or the weight of impending deadlines and

workload when you return.

So, what can you do when you come back to work more exhausted than

when you left — especially when everyone assumes you’re well rested

and raring to go but you feel just as depleted (or more) than before? Here

are ﬁve steps you can take to refresh on your return.

- 1. Take inventory of your health and energy.

Unless you’ve been on a rejuvenating health retreat, it’s possible that

you’ve veered away from your healthy routines, maybe skipping out on

physical activity or ﬁnding yourself caught up in a full schedule and

indulging a bit too much.

On your return, assess and acknowledge your energy levels, taking

inventory of how you’re feeling to determine what you need. Research

has found that optimizing your energy along the following domains can

help boost wellbeing and performance: sleep, movement, connection,

## time outdoors, relaxation and meaningful engagement.

Start by rating yourself on a scale of 1-10 in terms of your current energy

levels in each of the above areas. Then identify where you would like to

be in each domain and one action you can take to reinforce or improve

each of these elements of your wellbeing. Reassess daily for a week,

tracking how your energy shifts as you re-engage in healthier habits.

- 2. Ease back into work.

Coming back from a vacation can be a challenging experience when

you are feeling overwhelmed or stressed about catching up with emails

and conversations that were piling up while you were supposed to be

# relaxing and enjoying time oﬀ.

Resist the temptation to dive into work headﬁrst by building in a day

of transition and recovery before returning to normal. You might even

consider drafting an auto-response or extending your OOO for an extra

# day or two.

Before you enter into a full day’s work, set some guard rails for your

time so that you can get oﬀ to a good start. Begin with essential and

time-sensitive tasks and give yourself a buﬀer to catch up on emails and

updates that can come later. Block time out on your calendar also for

activities that energize you.

- 3. Reflect on the positives; reframe, and learn from the negatives.

It’s easy to get overwhelmed or disappointed by things that may not

have gone as well as you had hoped — but there are likely some positive

memories to hold onto. Take some time to reﬂect and savor those

experiences, as well as lessons and insights gained. Capture them on

## paper, so you can share them with your team members, and reinforce

the beneﬁts of your time away. If the trip left you feeling in a rut, maybe

you can ﬁnd solace in the fact that you’re home again getting back to

# normal.

- 4. Use the fresh start effect to set new habits and routines.

The fresh start eﬀect is the phenomenon of increased success in

behavioral change associated with new beginnings, such as birthdays,

the new year, and other milestones. You can harness this eﬀect by using

your return to work as an opportunity to reset.

Coming back from a vacation is a good time to establish new practices

that further enhance your energy and productivity, like exercising,

shutting oﬀ notiﬁcations, blocking distractions, or writing in a journal

each night. Seek out habits and routines that feel replenishing in

your day-to-day life. You can leverage practices such as timeboxing to

optimize your energy for the things that matter to you.

It can be tempting to try to overcompensate but don’t let remorse

drive your actions. Rather think about the routines that will work

within the context of your daily life so that your habits can be

sustainable. Determine what you need to do today to get back on

track, leave remorse out of the equation and do what you need to create

# forward momentum.

- 5. Clarify what you need for future time off.

Use this experience as a learning opportunity to set the ground for a

more replenishing vacation in the future. Decide how much structure

was energizing versus draining on your energy. Who do you want

to spend time with and how far do you want to travel? How much

communication with your team do you need for your own wellbeing and

# connection needs?

Even a good vacation can sometimes be exhausting. If you don’t

properly manage your time and energy when returning, your

exhaustion can have a cumulative impact on your wellbeing, work,

relationships, and performance. If you didn’t get what you needed from

this vacation, use it as motivation to ensure that you build sustainable,

## energy-preserving practices into your daily life.
