In October 1922, the very ﬁrst essay in volume 1, number 1 of Harvard

Business Review laid out the purpose of the brand-new journal. “It is

pertinent to inquire how the representative practises [sic] of business

men generally may be made available…and how a proper theory of

business is to be obtained,” wrote Harvard Business School dean

Wallace B. Donham. Without such a theory, “business will continue

## unsystematic, haphazard, and for many men a pathetic gamble.” To

remedy that situation, HBR would seek to provide “a better theoretical

# basis for executive action.”

At the time, the business world had reason for optimism. The First

World War had ended just a few years before. The Spanish ﬂu pandemic

had subsided. The economy had weathered a brief depression, and

the outlook was decidedly improving. In that ﬁrst issue, writing about

the taxation of capital gains, accountant George O. May said as much,

noting that, in the U.S. at least, business was getting “back to more

# normal conditions.”

But the normality May saw in 1922 proved to be ﬂeeting. In just a few

years, the stock market would crash, followed by the Great Depression

and another world war. If a proper theory of business was desirable

in optimistic times, surely the tumult that marked so much of the

century would make it all the more essential. The need to understand

how business and organizations function, to learn from the experience

of others, and to detect patterns in seeming chaos has only gotten

# stronger.

So, what can we learn from the past 100 years of management thinking?

For this Big Idea series, we asked experts to look back — and forward

— to help us understand what good leadership should look like,

how successful organizations are structured, what qualities make up

a job people love, and what needs to change to improve business’s

# relationship with the rest of society.

We also admit that management advice hasn’t always gotten things

right, and that what worked for one era may not for another. So we

asked an array of researchers which management practices should

be retired for the next 100 years. Their answers point to the impact

## of increasingly ﬂuid organizational structures, the need for more-

proactive retention eﬀorts, and why union busting must end, among

# other ideas.

Finally, our contributors dug into our archive to gain insight into what

occupied us over the past 100 years and why. Tejas Ramdas, Raﬀaella

Sadun, and Nicholas Bloom created a visual representation of how our

topic mix — and the issues that are most pressing for managers —

has changed. Colleen Ammerman and Boris Groysberg analyzed when,

and how, HBR has covered women over the decades. And our audience

engagement editor, Kelsey Gripenstraw, compiled a list of our most

popular articles. The variety might surprise you!

This package shows us how the world that HBR covers has evolved.

Our readers still care about balance sheets and operations, but their

scope of responsibility has expanded to include issues far beyond the

strict purview of their businesses and rarely — if at all — considered in

1922: urgent social issues involving race, gender, and other dimensions

## of diversity; political polarization; and the existential threat of climate

change. And while readers from HBR’s early decades would witness

the emergence of such marvels as jet engines, transistors, lasers —

## and space exploration, computers, and the internet not long after —

they weren’t yet imagining the promise of artiﬁcial intelligence or the

# challenge of the Great Resignation.

Just as the concerns of our readers have evolved, so has our

understanding of leadership. Most obviously, the white, male, U.S.-

centric perspective of HBR in 1922 has expanded to include people

of every race, gender, and background. We have also shifted away

from assuming that companies should be hierarchical and leaders all-

knowing authorities, and toward embracing ﬂatter, more networked

structures that demand a more humble and open-minded approach —

one that requires great leaders to motivate their teams rather than issue

# edicts.

Organizations have gotten more complicated, as has the challenge of

running them. They need leadership at all levels, not just at the top.

They need managers who can think not just about the bottom line but

about the culture they help shape. Leaders must learn how to bring

## out the best in their teams, their organizations, their partners, and

their communities. They must understand that to accomplish anything

substantial — internally or externally — they have to reach across

## the boundaries of functions, business units, organizations, and even

# sectors.

In 1922 leadership was the province of the few. In 2022 we believe

that anyone who wants to become a good leader can do so with the

right kind of guidance. Perhaps what we’re still talking about is the

“better theoretical basis for executive action” that Wallace B. Donham

envisioned 100 years ago. Providing that essential insight is still what

drives us. And we hope it continues to inspire you.
