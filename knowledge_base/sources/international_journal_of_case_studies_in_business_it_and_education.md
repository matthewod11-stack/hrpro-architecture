# ABSTRACT

Purpose: This review paper's objective is to look into how workplace culture affects the results of employee mental health and well-being. The review will cover the body of research on the subject and offer a thorough grasp of the elements that influence both healthy and unhealthy workplace cultures. Methodology: The systematic search and selection of pertinent studies on workplace culture and employee mental health and well-being will be the emphasis of this review study. Several peer-reviewed academic research examine and take into account the study's theoretical foundations. The majority of the information used in this article is taken from secondary sources. Journal articles and academic research publications provide secondary data. Findings: The findings demonstrate that organisational culture has a major impact on the mental health and wellbeing of employees. Through developing supportive leadership, social support, suitable job expectations, work-life balance, and effective regulations, healthy workplace cultures that promote employee mental health and well-being can be improved. The outcomes of employee mental health and well-being, however, can be negatively impacted by unfavourable workplace cultures, which are defined by unsupportive leadership, a lack of social support, excessive job demands, a lack of work-life balance, and insufficient policies. The study also discusses opportunities for future research, such as the need to look into the potential effects of workplace culture on certain mental diseases and the moderating effects of individual traits. Originality/Value: By offering an exhaustive synthesis of the body of research on the subject, this review paper makes a significant contribution to the body of knowledge on workplace culture and employee mental wellbeing and well-being. The study report will also offer useful recommendations for businesses, decision-makers, and practitioners on how to foster supportive work environments and enhance employee mental health and wellbeing. Overall, this review paper significantly contributes to our understanding of how workplace culture affects outcomes related to employee mental health and well-being. Paper Type: Literature Review Keywords: Workplace culture, Mental health, Employee well-being, Mental health outcomes, literature survey, ABCD Analysis 1. INTRODUCTION :

Employee well-being and mental health are greatly influenced by the employment environment. According to research, an organization's workplace culture can significantly affect employees' happiness and job satisfaction [1]. Higher levels of job satisfaction and productivity can result from supportive work environments that put an emphasis on employee well-being, as well as better employee retention and organisational performance [2]. These work environments generate healthy interactions between co-workers, employee engagement, and a sense of meaning and purpose in one's work.

Additionally, they offer chances for professional growth, acknowledgement, and work-life balance, all of which can improve employees' general wellbeing [3–4]. From a contrasting perspective, unfavourable workplace cultures that promote stress, conflict, and toxicity can have a variety of detrimental effects on both employees and businesses [5] in addition to adversely impacting employee well-being. In such cultures, employees may experience high levels of stress, feel unsupported or undervalued, and have difficulty balancing work and personal life. This can lead to increased absenteeism, decreased job satisfaction, and reduced productivity [6-7]. Negative work cultures can also result in higher turnover rates and lower levels of employee engagement, which can ultimately impact organizational success and reputation [8]. In recent years, there has been a growing recognition of the importance of creating positive work cultures that prioritize employee well-being and mental health [9]. Organizations are increasingly investing in employee well-being programs, such as stress management and mental health support services, to promote a positive work environment [10]. Yet, there is still more to be done to guarantee that staff members have access to the tools and services they need to take good care of their mental wellness and overall wellbeing. [11]. This is particularly important in the post-pandemic workplace, where many employees are facing new challenges such as remote work, increased workload, and social isolation [12]. Prioritizing employee well-being and developing work environments that support mental health and well-being are crucial as firms navigate the post-pandemic landscape [13]. The present role of research on workplace culture and its effects on workers' mental health and well-being will be examined in this review article.

- 3. METHODOLOGY :

For this review paper, databases such as Google Scholar and Cross Reference were searched to collect journal articles. A total of 116 papers and reports were reviewed and articles were searched using keywords such as Workplace culture, Mental health, Organizational culture, well-being. Data was also collected from other secondary sources such as websites and news reports. The data has been grouped under each keyword and presented in a tabular form.

- 4. REVIEW OF LITERATURE/RELATED WORKS :

4.1 Work culture: Researchers have been interested in work culture for many years because of how it affects employee attitudes, behaviour, and overall organisational results. Culture is a set of universally held underlying assumptions that a group developed as a means of resolving its issues with external adaptation as well as internalization. These basic presumptions have shown to be effective enough to be accepted as true, and as such, are passed down to newcomers as the proper framework for understanding, feeling, and acting upon those issues. (Hogan, S. J., & Coote, L. V,2014). [14]. Research has shown that positive work cultures, characterized by supportive leadership, open communication, teamwork, and trust, have a significant positive impact on employee well-being, job satisfaction, motivation, and productivity (Maher, 2000; Saks, 2006; Schneider, et al.,2013). [15- 17]. Yet, unsatisfactory work environments that encourage stress, conflict, and toxic behaviour can have a severe impact on the mental health and wellbeing of employees, which can lead to an increase in absenteeism, attrition, and decreased organisational performance (Leiter & Maslach, 2004; Lutgen-Sandvik, Tracy, & Alberts, 2007) [18- 19]. Work culture can significantly influence how employees perceive justice, trust, and loyalty to the

firm, according to authors' research (Colquitt et al., 2007,) [20]. To comprehend the complexity of work culture and how it affects employee outcomes, numerous models have been developed. For instance, the Clan, Adhocracy, Market, and Hierarchy forms of corporate cultures are suggested by the Competing Values Framework. Each culture type has distinctive traits and is connected to various outcomes for workers and businesses (Yu & Wu,2009). [21]. Similar to this, the Job Demands- Resources model asserts that an organization's culture can help or impede employees' capacity to meet job demands and access job resources, with corresponding positive or negative effects (Bakker & Demerouti, 2014) [22].

4.2 Employee Mental Health: Employee mental health is a topic of growing concern for employers, employees, and researchers. Research have demonstrated that mental health issues can result in unfavourable results such more absenteeism, lower productivity, and higher attrition rates. To address this issue, researchers have conducted studies on the causes, consequences, and interventions related to employee mental health. According to one research by Harvey, et al. (2017), work-related stress significantly increases the likelihood of developing mental health issues [23]. Another study by Lee, et al., (2018) shown how job instability could harm an employee's mental health. [24]. On the contrary hand, a study conducted in 2017 by Cooper & Nielsen discovered that having high levels of job autonomy and peer support at work can be beneficial for mental health [25]. The contribution of workplace interventions to improving employee mental health has been studied by a number of researchers. In a meta-analysis of workplace mental health interventions, LaMontagne et al. (2014) discovered that they can significantly improve employee mental health outcomes [26]. Similar findings were made by Lindsay, et al. (2019), who found that workplace adjustments can motivate people with mental health concerns to remain working and be productive [27]. The significance of organisational culture in fostering employee mental health has also been emphasised by research. According to a study by Aldamman, et al., (2019), elements of a supportive work environment, like a friendly team dynamic, are linked to better mental health outcomes for employees [28]. Another study by Joo and Lee (2017) discovered that an organisational culture that places a high priority on employee well-being can increase employee engagement and decrease burnout [29]. Individual-level characteristics have also been discovered to be significant predictors of employee mental health, in addition to organisational influences. For instance, Hakanen et al (2006) .'s study discovered that work engagement, which is characterised as a pleasant state of mind related to one's work, is linked to lower levels of stress and burnout [30]. Another study by Yang, et al. (2019) discovered that improved mental health outcomes are related to self-compassion, which is defined as treating oneself with love and understanding [31].

They argued that clear and transparent communication can improve employee engagement, reduce conflicts, and promote a sense of community among employees. The study emphasized the need for leaders to establish clear communication channels and to actively listen to employee feedback. Examined how national culture can influence work culture in multinational organizations. According to the author, national culture significantly influences workplace culture as it influences societal values, attitudes, and behaviours. The study examines how different national cultures may impact work culture, such as the emphasis on individualism versus collectivism, the importance of hierarchy and power distance, and the level of uncertainty avoidance. The researchers argued that diversity and inclusion are crucial aspects of work culture that can influence organizational outcomes such as employee satisfaction and performance. They also noted that organizations that promote diversity and inclusion tend to be more innovative and adaptable to change. The authors emphasise how the rising use of technology in the workplace has changed work culture, including a move towards a more virtual and remote work environment. They argue that this shift has both positive and negative implications for work culture, with benefits such as increased flexibility and productivity, but also potential challenges such as decreased social interaction and potential for work-life imbalance.

Workplace culture can significantly influence whether or not employee well-being is promoted or hampered. The prevalence of mental health difficulties in the workplace is a serious concern. To address this issue, organizations need to prioritize creating a positive and supportive workplace culture that prioritizes employee well-being. This can include initiatives such as flexible work employee assistance programs, arrangements, and promoting work-life balance. The working environment's culture significantly affects employees' well-being and state of mind. A positive workplace culture can lead to improved mental health outcomes, while a toxic culture can have negative consequences. Strategies to promote a positive workplace culture include providing social support, offering resources for stress management, and addressing systemic issues such as discrimination and inequality. According to the review, workplace bullying can have a range of detrimental mental health consequences for workers. Moreover, physical health issues including heart disease and gastrointestinal diseases can result from workplace bullying. The authors stressed the requirement for efficient bullying prevention and intervention measures that also support staff members' mental health. The study demonstrated a beneficial relationship between work-life balance and employee mental health and suggested that businesses offer work-life balance initiatives to assist staff members.

# Leadership and employee mental health

## The role of workplace culture in employee mental health

According to the study, good leadership can improve employee mental wellness and health. In particular, helpful, open, and respectful leaders can foster an environment at work that supports employee wellbeing. Yet, dictatorial, critical, and careless leaders can create a work climate that is toxic and detrimental to the mental health of their employees. The authors discovered that improved mental health outcomes for workers were connected with a healthy workplace culture, which is defined by pleasant social connections, encouraging leadership, and appreciation of employees' achievements. Negative workplace cultures, on the other hand, were linked to higher levels of stress and burnout among workers and were characterised by bad relationships, a lack of support, and low recognition.

## The role of stigma in employee mental health

According to the authors' meta-analysis of 82 research, job demands were positively correlated with burnout and depressive symptoms, but job resources were adversely correlated with these conditions. According to the author's examination of the literature on various research on employee engagement and mental health, there is a beneficial connection between the two. Particularly, workers who are motivated at work to experience better mental health outcomes, such as higher levels of job satisfaction, reduced levels of stress and despair, and improved overall wellbeing. According to the authors, job stability should be offered by companies to workers in order to support their overall and mental wellbeing. They advise employers to be open with workers about job security difficulties, but they also accept that, in some circumstances, insecurity may be vital for organisational survival and competitiveness. According to the study, prejudice related to mental health problems has a detrimental effect on employees' mental health. As a result, businesses should lessen mental health stigma and raise public awareness of mental health concerns.

This includes both physical and psychological dimensions of wellbeing, such as having positive relationships with colleagues and managers, and experiencing good physical health. The author's concept of employee well-being spans a wide range of areas that affect a person's overall well-being. These areas cover both personal characteristics like psychological, physical, and intellectual well-being as well career advancement, work-life balance, and corporate culture. The three main components of employee wellbeing are: (1) subjective well-being; (3) (2) workplace wellbeing; psychological well-being, according to this study's analysis of the concept of mental health The research found that employee well-being is a crucial factor in organisational success and growth. Artificial intelligence in the workplace has the potential to increase commitment and wellbeing among workers. Positive correlations exist between organisational dedication and workers' well-being. relationships among Happiness and organisational are employees performance (mutual gains perspective). Well-being in terms of health seems to have contradictory effects. The measurement of significant variables, the level of investigation, and the study design are examples of study characteristics that have an impact on the findings. In this study, the authors look at the theoretical foundation and structural elements of employee well-being (EWB) in organisations. The three elements that make up EWB are life well-being, workplace well-being, and psychological well-being. EWB and job performance as well as affective organisational commitment are strongly correlated. For EWB, there is measurement invariance in both Chinese and American contexts. The findings from a sample of 786 full-time employees from diverse professional sectors demonstrate four types of employee well-being: 9 to 5 or calm, work engaged or excited, workaholic or anxious, and burnt-out or weary.

relationships with various forms of employee well-being. There were significant relationships between heavy and soft work investors and a number of employee well-being variables. The long-standing topic of employee well-being has its roots in McGregor's Theory Y, according to the writers, who have offered a comprehensive viewpoint on the matter. Job satisfaction is positively connected with personal happiness, including positive and negative affect, subjective well-being, psychological well-being, and eudaimonia. A few benefits enhanced satisfaction performance, increased job satisfaction, and improved health. Given that it is regularly determined to be strategically significant individuals, to both organisations and employee well-being has emerged as one of the central topics of research in the study of businesses. A 62-item questionnaire on employee well-being was developed for empirical validation. The new employee well-being measure is made up of four unique elements, according to exploratory factor analysis (EFA): social, psychological, subjective, and workplace well-being. Positive relationships exist between psychological capital, such as optimism, hope, self-efficacy, and resilience, and worker wellbeing and job satisfaction. Social support at work has a positive impact on staff well- being, job satisfaction, and organisational commitment.

Job insecurity is negatively related to employee well- being, and it leads to decreased job satisfaction and increased stress and anxiety Internal service quality has a favourable impact on employee commitment and satisfaction, which in turn has a positive effect on staff performance. Employers should prioritize protecting their employees' mental health because it has a significant impact on productivity In order to evaluate the role of positive psychology and attitude in an organisational environment, this research uses a critical literature review methodology approach. Employee happiness and a positive attitude about work are key factors in improving corporate citizenship behaviour during a crisis. A positive mindset and psychology can result in the best performance outcomes during times of crisis. It is concluded that a variety of critical factors, such as workplace positivity and employee well-being in times of crisis, are necessary for enhancing corporate citizenship behaviour. The leadership, line management governance, and employee well-being are examined in this chapter.The results show that leadership and line management are essential for influencing and promoting workplace well-being.

Contribution by the Researcher The study discovered a link between a toxic workplace culture, which is defined by high levels of rudeness, bullying, and abusive management, and poor results for employees' mental health, including melancholy and anxiety. These detrimental effects may damage an employee's relationships and personal life in addition to their employment. According to the study, an encouraging workplace culture significantly affects the mental health and general wellbeing of employees. Positive mental health outcomes were more likely to be reported by employees who felt supported by their coworkers and managers, had a sense of belonging, and felt that their work was meaningful. According to this research, encouraging employees to take calculated risks, think creatively, and seek out learning opportunities at work may benefit their mental health and general wellbeing. A sense of autonomy, mastery, and purpose, all of which are crucial for fostering better mental health outcomes, may be fostered in innovative workplace cultures. It has been demonstrated that toxic workplace cultures, which are characterized by rudeness, bullying, and abusive behaviour, significantly affect employee churn. Workers who encounter these unfavourable behaviours are more likely to quit their jobs, either voluntarily or as a result of being fired without cause, which can result in high turnover rates for the company. As employees are more likely to feel valued and involved in their work, a pleasant workplace culture can result in better levels of employee retention. Increased job satisfaction, motivation, and company loyalty may result from this. Employees are less likely to quit their job and look for work elsewhere

when workplace. The authors found that a positive association between innovative workplace culture and employee innovation. Specifically, employees were more likely to generate creative ideas and take risks when they perceived their workplace culture supported and encouraged innovation. Such a culture can help businesses stay competitive and adapt to changing environments, by fostering an environment of continuous learning and improvement. According to the study, managers that set a good example for their staff and build a welcoming workplace are more likely to see improvements in their workers' mental health. In particular, the study discovered that leaders who demonstrate qualities good like communication can enhance the wellbeing, job satisfaction, and engagement of their workforce. Yet, bad leadership traits like micromanagement, abusive supervision, or favouritism can foster a toxic workplace environment and have a detrimental effect on the mental health of employees. The research organisational ingrained transformation, which conventions, beliefs, and communication patterns, can have a major impact on workplace culture. Employees may have a sense of loss or uncertainty about their function in the new environment as a result of this disruption, which can result in resistance to change and bad attitudes towards the company. According to the study, employee engagement— defined as the degree of dedication and motivation that employee has for both their work and the company—is a crucial element in determining workplace culture. Positive behaviours and attitudes, such as improved cooperation, productivity, and innovation, are more likely to be displayed by engaged workers. A positive workplace culture marked by high levels of trust, communication, and collaboration can result from this. The research found that psychological safety, or the belief that it is safe to speak up and share ideas without fear of retribution, is a critical component of workplace culture that impacts employee well-being and performance. According to the study, remote workers may feel lonely, disconnected, or burnt out if they don't receive enough support or contact from their coworkers and managers. This can have an influence on workplace culture and employee well-being.

According to the study, supportive workplace cultures that give workers access to tools and social support lead to better mental health outcomes for workers, levels of stress, anxiety, and depression. The study found that autocratic workplace cultures, which involve strict top-down control, are associated with negative employee mental health outcomes, including increased stress, burnout, and reduced job satisfaction. According to the study, collaborative workplace cultures that value cooperation and teamwork are linked to better physical and mental health in workers, as well as higher job satisfaction and reduced stress. The study found that hierarchical workplace cultures, which emphasize rigid organizational structures and strict adherence to rules and procedures, are associated with negative employee mental health outcomes, including increased stress and reduced job satisfaction. According to the study, flexible workplace cultures that promote greater autonomy and a healthy work- life balance are linked to better employee mental health outcomes, such as less stress and burnout as well as higher levels of job satisfaction. The study found that task-oriented workplace and prioritize cultures, which productivity, are associated with negative employee mental health outcomes, including increased stress and burnout. The study demonstrated that employee mental health outcomes, such as higher job satisfaction, lower levels of stress, and better physical health, are connected with person-oriented workplace cultures that promote employee well-being and growth.

autonomy, growth chances, and a purposeful and distinct job role all define this type of culture. Emotional exhaustion, which is a condition brought on by continuous job expectations, can develop as a result of a toxic work environment. An employee's emotional wellbeing can be particularly harmed by abusive supervision, such as demeaning or disparaging remarks, which can worsen emotional tiredness. Better employee well-being, engagement, and performance are all correlated with an environment at work that promotes psychological safety. On the other hand, a culture marked by mistrust, a lack of trust, and a fear of speaking up can result in poor mental health outcomes and decreased productivity. According to the study, company culture might affect how well employees sleep. Employees have been shown to have higher sleep quality when they work in an environment that prioritises work-life balance, offers social support, and provides opportunity for skill development. On the other side, a bad work environment marked by a lack of social support, excessive job demands, and little control over one's workload can make it difficult for employees to get enough sleep. According to study, workplace cultures with high demands and little employee control are more likely to make workers more stressed out. This may result in a number of unfavourable consequences, such as burnout, absenteeism, and reduced job satisfaction. On the other hand, workplace cultures that place a high priority on employee well-being and offer assistance with stress management can result in lower levels of stress and better overall outcomes for employees' mental health. According to the study, workplace culture can have a big impact on employee absenteeism since a toxic or unfriendly workplace can promote stress and burnout, which can lead to more frequent absences from work. On the other side, by encouraging employee engagement and job satisfaction, a supportive working environment that prioritises employees' well-being may help lower absenteeism. It has been discovered that workplace cultures that value social support, communication, and trust help employees feel less anxious. The study discovered that workplace stressors like excessive workloads, little job control, and inadequate social support were linked to higher levels of anxiety among workers. Employee depression levels have been linked to positive and encouraging company cultures. The effectiveness of interactions between workers and their managers, as well as the availability of

possibilities for learning and advancement, can also influence the results of employee mental health. According to the study, a toxic workplace culture marked by a heavy workload, shoddy task control, and scarce resources is linked to higher levels of employee burnout. On the other side, a supportive workplace environment that fosters employee wellbeing and offers chances for professional advancement has been linked to lower levels of employee burnout. The study underlines the value of developing a welcoming and inclusive workplace to avoid employee burnout. A workplace culture that prioritizes employee well- being and provides support after traumatic events can reduce the risk of PTSD among employees. This can be achieved through initiatives such as providing counselling services, allowing time off for recovery, and creating a supportive and understanding work environment. By promoting a culture of empathy, understanding, and support, employers can help reduce the risk of PTSD among their employees. Higher rates of substance addiction among employees have been linked to a poor workplace culture defined by low job satisfaction and high stress. A positive workplace culture that promotes work-life balance and provides social support has been linked to better sleep quality and lower rates of insomnia among employees. A negative workplace culture characterized by job insecurity and poor management has been associated with higher rates of suicidal ideation among employees. Employees' overall mental health results have been linked to workplace cultures that encourage social support and employee engagement. A healthy workplace culture can promote job satisfaction and wellbeing, lower stress and burnout, and boost employee morale and motivation. On the other hand, a toxic office environment marked by high stress levels, conflict, and unfavourable relationships between coworkers can have a detrimental effect on employees' mental health, increasing their chance of developing depression, anxiety, and other mental health issues. Employee emotional exhaustion has been linked to toxic workplace cultures marked by heavy workloads, little control over tasks, and scant social support. A protracted period of work-related stress can leave you feeling mentally and physically exhausted, depleted, and worn out. It may result in worsened work output, elevated absenteeism, and plans for turnover.

## The survey of literature undertaken shows

(1) Increased wellbeing, job satisfaction, and work engagement can result from a positive

# workplace culture.

(2) A negative workplace culture can lead to decreased well-being, including increased stress,

# anxiety, burnout, and exhaustion.

(3) Companies can build a culture that promotes the mental health and wellbeing of their employees by promoting a good work environment. This can entail fostering a work-life balance, offering helpful resources and programmes, emphasising employee feedback, and presenting chances for growth and development.

(4) In general, there are many different ways in which workplace culture and mental health and well-being are related. Organizations can increase employee well-being and eventually enhance their overall performance and success by acknowledging the significance of workplace culture and taking action to establish a good and supportive environment.

- 5. CURRENT STATUS & NEW RELATED ISSUES :

Organizational psychology is becoming increasingly interested in studying how workplace culture affects workers' mental health and wellbeing. Many studies have demonstrated that workplace culture can significantly affect outcomes related to mental health, including stress, depression, and burnout. Employee mental health can be particularly negatively impacted by toxic workplace cultures marked by bullying, harassment, and discrimination. On the other side, supportive and creative workplace cultures that place a high priority on employee growth and well-being can result in better outcomes for mental health.

- 6. IDEAL SOLUTION, DESIRED STATUS & IMPROVEMENTS REQUIRED :

The best course of action would be to encourage positive workplace cultures that put employee well- being and mental health as a top priority, given the current state of research on the effects of workplace

culture on employee mental health and well-being. This can be accomplished by implementing a variety of interventions, including encouraging work-life balance, offering social support, establishing effective leadership techniques, supporting fairness and justice, making the most of job resources, and lowering stigma surrounding mental illness. Organizations must put their employees' mental health and wellbeing first in order to attain this ideal outcome, and they must engage in therapies that deal with the detrimental effects of toxic workplace environments. This necessitates a change in company culture and values to one that is more encouraging and employee-centered. As part of the necessary improvements, managers and supervisors must be trained to recognise and address mental health issues, resources and services must be made available, and the influence of workplace culture on employee mental health and well- being must be frequently assessed and monitored. Organizations can foster a healthy workplace culture that benefits both employees and the business as a whole by placing a high priority on employee mental health and well-being.

- 7. RESEARCH GAP :

An important and challenging area of research is the connection between workplace culture and outcomes related to mental health and wellbeing. Although there is data to support the idea that a supportive employment environment might result in better mental health and well-being outcomes, there are still many open issues and knowledge gaps in this field. The particular mechanisms by which workplace culture affects mental health outcomes, as well as the part played by individual characteristics (such as personality and coping mechanisms) in this relationship, are just a few examples where additional research is needed. Further research is also required to determine the efficacy of initiatives designed to enhance workplace culture and advance employee wellbeing. In order to completely comprehend the connection between workplace culture and mental health/well-being outcomes and to create efficient interventions to enhance employee well-being, further study is required.

- 8. RESEARCH AGENDAS BASED ON RESEARCH GAP :

- 1. Investigate the specific mechanisms by which workplace culture impacts mental health outcomes: The specific elements of workplace culture (such as corporate ideals, leadership philosophies, and communication patterns) that influence better or worse outcomes in terms of mental health should be the subject of future research. To learn more about the connection between workplace culture and mental health, researchers could use qualitative techniques like focus groups or interviews.

- 2. Examine the significance of individual characteristics in the association between workplace culture and mental health outcomes: While there is evidence to support this, it is likely that the relationship is regulated by individual differences such personality, coping mechanisms, and social support. Future studies could examine the interactions between these personal variations and workplace culture and how they affect mental health outcomes.

- 3. Assess the success of initiatives to enhance workplace culture and advance employee wellbeing: While workplace treatments aiming at enhancing employee well-being are receiving more attention, these initiatives still require more thorough evaluations. To assess the efficacy of interventions like leadership development courses, wellness initiatives, and flexible work schedules, researchers could perform randomised controlled trials.

- 4. Explore the impact of workplace culture on different subgroups of employees: Workplace culture may impact mental health outcomes differently for different subgroups of employees (such as those with disabilities, minority groups, and older workers). Future research should explore how workplace culture impacts mental health outcomes for these subgroups and develop tailored interventions to address their unique needs.

- 9. ANALYSIS OF RESEARCH AGENDA :

The proposed research agenda emphasises the need for additional investigation of the link between workplace culture and outcomes related to mental health. It recommends that researchers look into the precise mechanisms by which workplace culture affects mental health outcomes, investigate the significance of individual differences, assess the efficacy of workplace interventions, and take into account the influence of workplace culture on various employee subgroups. Organizations can increase

employee wellbeing by addressing these research areas and improving their understanding of how workplace culture affects mental health outcomes. In order to enhance mental health outcomes at work, collaboration between researchers, organisations, and policymakers is essential, as this research agenda demonstrates.

- 11. ABCD ANALYSIS OF CHOSEN RESEARCH PROPOSAL :

The ABCD analysis is a method used to assess a particular area, focusing on its advantages, benefits, constraints, and disadvantages [112]. This method helps individuals to identify key factors related to a problem or situation and develop effective and efficient solutions [113]. However, it's important to remember that the ABCD analysis should be used in combination with other tools to make well- informed decisions [114]. When evaluating a proposal, it's important to consider multiple perspectives and potential areas of risk [115]. The information gained through the ABCD analysis can be used to adjust proposals and mitigate risks before they become problematic [116].

# 11.1 Advantages:

(1) Increased employee well-being: Organizations can pinpoint areas for improvement and make plans to create a safer and more encouraging work environment by looking at how workplace culture affects employee mental health and well-being. This in turn may enhance workers' productivity, job happiness, and general well-being.

(2) Financial savings: Reduced absenteeism, presenteeism (being physically present but not completely engaged or productive), and turnover are all factors that can be expensive for businesses. Organizations may be able to cut these expenditures by understanding how workplace culture affects mental health.

recommendations for companies to support worker wellbeing.

(5) Organizations may improve their ability to recruit and retain top talent, boost employee engagement, and generally operate more effectively by understanding the role of workplace culture on mental health outcomes.

# 11.3 Constraints:

(1) Difficulty in measuring workplace culture: Workplace culture is a complex construct that

can be difficult to measure accurately using standardized tools.

(2) Subjective nature of mental health: Mental health is a subjective experience and can be

difficult to quantify objectively, which can affect the reliability of research findings.

(3) Potential for response bias: Participants may be reluctant to provide honest responses regarding their mental health status or workplace culture due to social desirability bias or fear of repercussions.

(4) Limited generalizability: The external validity of the research may be constrained by the fact that the results of a single cross-sectional study may not be generalizable to other groups or circumstances.

(5) Potential confounding variables: Other factors such as personal life events, pre-existing mental health conditions, or environmental stressors could impact mental health outcomes, making it difficult to isolate the impact of workplace culture alone.

# 11.4 Disadvantages:

(1) Self-reported data on mental health and well-being are subject to bias since individuals may

# under- or over-report their experiences.

(2) Due to the wide variations in workplace cultures, the research results may not be applicable to

## all types of organisations or industries.

(3) The research may uncover negative aspects of workplace culture, which could potentially create

# discomfort or conflict in the workplace.

- 12. FINDINGS :

(1) A supportive work environment, work-life balance, and a healthy social environment are all

factors that can boost employee mental health and wellbeing.

(2) A poor work environment, including bullying, discrimination, and an excessive workload, can

## harm an employee's mental health and wellbeing.

(3) Various workplace culture elements, such as communication, organisational fairness, and job expectations and control, have different effects on workers' mental health and wellbeing.

## workplace culture and mental health outcomes.

(5) Workplace culture interventions, such leadership development courses and wellness initiatives,

have the potential to enhance staff members' mental health and wellbeing.

- 13. SUGGESTIONS :

(1) Create and put into practise workplace culture interventions: Employers should put into practise workplace culture interventions that deal with the elements the study found to be beneficial to workers' mental health and wellbeing. This can entail educating managers on supportive leadership techniques, encouraging candid communication, and cultivating an inclusive and respectful work environment.

(2) Promote healthy lifestyles, flexible work schedules, and wellness initiatives: Employers should promote healthy lifestyles, flexible work schedules, and wellness initiatives. This can enhance workers' mental health and well-being while lowering stress associated to the workplace. (3) Companies should offer support for mental health through initiatives including employee assistance programmes, counselling services, and mental health education. For workers who may otherwise face stigma and limited access to support, this can help.

(4) Companies should promote diversity and inclusion programmes, deal with workplace harassment and discrimination, and create a secure and encouraging work environment in order to establish a culture of respect and inclusion. By lowering stress and boosting job satisfaction, this can support employee mental health and wellbeing.

(5) Assess workplace culture often: To pinpoint areas that need change and monitor advancement over time, employers should regularly analyse workplace culture. This can ensure that organisational efforts to change the workplace culture are successful and that the work environment is positive and helpful.

- 14. CONCLUSION :

In conclusion, the culture of the workplace has a big impact on the mental health and wellbeing of employees. According to research, while healthy and innovative workplace cultures can improve employee wellbeing, toxic workplace cultures can result in detrimental effects like stress, burnout, and depression. Organizations should place a high priority on creating a supportive workplace culture that supports employee well-being and a sense of community and support in order to solve this issue. This can be accomplished using a variety of tactics, including offering tools for mental health, fostering work-life balance, and encouraging employee in decision-making. Organizations can foster a more productive and healthy work environment by putting an emphasis on employee well-being, which will benefit both the individual employees and the business as a whole.
