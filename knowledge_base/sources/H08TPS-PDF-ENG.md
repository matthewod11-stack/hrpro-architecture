For months, economists, journalists, and analysts have wondered

whether a recession might hit the U.S. economy. When a recession

strikes, many companies respond by immediately downsizing their

workforce to preserve cash, streamline operations, and maintain

## ﬂexibility in the face of macroeconomic uncertainty. Yet these

employment cuts can have devastating consequences on workers and

cause lingering damage to the labor market at large.

In new research, we studied the spillover impacts that corporate job-

cutting during a recession can have on employees’ long-term economic

well-being and the labor markets in which they reside—and what

corporate leaders and policymakers can do to mitigate such eﬀects.

We found that concentrated bursts of employment cuts amplify the

negative worker consequences of layoﬀs—and they can help explain

why job loss during recessions is particularly devastating for labor

markets. Our work suggests that it would be valuable for ﬁrms and

policymakers to work together to retain workers in the midst of

# economic downturns.

## How Individual Job Cutting Impacts the Broader Economy

Employment cuts can have devastating consequences on workers,

especially when they are part of a broader economic downturn. Previous

academic research has established two facts about ﬁrm layoﬀs. First, the

start of a recession prompts many companies to sharply and suddenly

destroy more jobs. Second, the average worker who is laid oﬀ during a

recession experiences a staggering 19% decrease in their future lifetime

earnings, compared to a less extreme 11% earnings loss associated with

layoﬀs during normal times. Together, these two facts paint a troubling

picture: companies ramp up job cuts exactly when they impose the most

# damage on aﬀected employees.

Nonetheless, many corporate leaders feel that they must make the diﬃcult decision to proactively reduce their workforce at the start of

a recession in order to safeguard their ﬁrms’ ﬁnancial well-being and

# long-term viability.

But here’s the rub: recessions induce many business leaders, across a

broad array of geographies and industries, to simultaneously conclude

that it is a prudent time to cut employment. With so many laid-

oﬀ workers desperate to ﬁnd a new job, even healthy ﬁrms may

struggle to adjust their business plans to accommodate new employees.

Unemployed workers, in turn, may be forced to endure a prolonged

spell of joblessness that weakens their skills and attachment to the labor

force. As a result, individually rational decision-making by companies can produce ineﬃcient collective outcomes in the market.

We examined the signiﬁcance of these spillover eﬀects to better

understand what might be done to prevent such rapid deterioration of

labor markets. To do this, we used comprehensive administrative data

from the U.S. Census Bureau on workers’ quarterly employment status

and labor earnings between 1994 and 2020. We studied the variation

in the employment cuts by large national ﬁrms that operate in many

diﬀerent geographic markets and which tend to make company-wide

layoﬀ decisions based on factors, like credit, that are unrelated to the

conditions in any one local market. The large employment share of

these ﬁrms means that their workforce decisions are key drivers of local

# labor market conditions.

We ﬁnd that job destruction has substantial negative spillover eﬀects.

When a worker is laid oﬀ in a local labor market with a one percentage

point higher rate of job destruction, they earn an estimated $4,200 less

over the following six years than laid-oﬀ employees where there was a

lower rate of job destruction. Our ﬁndings suggest that each layoﬀ that

an individual business makes during an economic downturn leads to a

## per-year reduction of $17,000 in total earnings across workers outside

of their own business. In other words, the pile-on of layoﬀs severely

deteriorates local labor markets, which may take years to recover.

## What Policymakers and Corporate Leaders Can Do

Our ﬁndings suggest that the aggregate eﬀects of job destruction

impose substantial costs on workers by damaging wider labor market

conditions. This may be one reason why some regions have struggled to

# recover from the Great Recession.

## For policymakers, the large spillover eﬀect from layoﬀs may

motivate greater interventions to directly stabilize employment during

## downturns. While the expansion of job-saving employment subsidies

(such as short-time work) has been a historical staple of European

labor market policy, the United States has only recently experimented

with expanding familiar types of ﬁrm support. Research on the most

## prominent of these policies—the Paycheck Protection Program during

the COVID-19 pandemic—has found that these subsidies helped to

prevent job loss for millions of workers. However, the lack of targeting

and substantial cost leave scope for better policy design in preparing for

# the next recession.

Though we only examine private U.S. employment, our results may also

inform workforce decisions of public institutions that wish to avoid

congesting the labor market. The negative consequences can be seen

from the recent wave of layoﬀs from the federal workforce, which has

led to an overwhelming number of new applications and has made ﬁnding jobs in state and local governments more diﬃcult for displaced

# workers.

Our research also has implications for the diﬃcult decisions employers

must make when restructuring their workforce. Advance notice of

workforce cuts, as mandated for mass layoﬀs covered by the WARN

Act or performed by federal agencies, helps maintain a vibrant labor

market by giving workers time to ﬁnd new opportunities that ﬁt their

skills and experience. Because workers would seek to avoid looking for

jobs when labor market conditions are poor, companies experiencing

ﬁnancial strain may want to consider alternative work arrangements

before resorting to layoﬀs. For example, recent research suggests that

many workers would be willing to accept wage cuts to avoid being laid

oﬀ by their employer. These kinds of interventions—which can prevent

workers from facing total joblessness—may help maintain vibrant labor

markets while oﬀsetting some of the steep ﬁnancial costs faced by

# workers.

# Some Caveats

There are several important caveats with the interpretations and

implications of our results. First, in additional analyses, we ﬁnd that

employers tend to have a higher revenue-per-worker following episodes

of job destruction due to the reallocation of labor to growing ﬁrms.

While our paper suggests these potential productivity gains do not fully

oﬀset the estimated costs faced by workers, more research could help

provide a more complete understanding of the eﬀects of job destruction

on the labor market and how its deterioration might impact ﬁrms’

# revenues.

. . .

Many ﬁrms turn to layoﬀs to stabilize their businesses during an

## economic downturn. Yet the collective impacts of these decisions across

businesses can cause lasting damage to workers and labor markets.

Our research suggests ﬁrms and policymakers can help support healthy

labor markets when they work together to stabilize and maintain jobs in

# times of crisis.
