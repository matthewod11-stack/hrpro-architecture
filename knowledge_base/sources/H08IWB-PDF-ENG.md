In an era where job loyalty is increasingly rare and employees are

quick to seek better opportunities, retaining top talent has become

a formidable challenge for business leaders. Despite the fact that

98% of Fortune 500 companies have mentoring programs, only

37% of professionals actually beneﬁt from them. This disconnect is

exacerbating retention issues. So, why are mentoring programs failing

to deliver on their promise, and what can organizations do to ensure

these initiatives eﬀectively retain their top talent?

The issue lies not with mentoring itself but in the underutilization

and ineﬀective reach of many mentoring programs. While studies

have consistently shown that eﬀective mentoring boosts employee

## engagement, retention, and productivity, the reality on the ground

often falls short. Programs are frequently conﬁned to a small group

of employees or lack the necessary communication and visibility to

attract participation. As a result, many employees are unaware of or

uninterested in participating in mentoring opportunities. Moreover,

potential mentors might be too overwhelmed with their own workloads

to commit to meaningful mentorship, leading to a cycle of under-

# engagement.

Two of us (Lopata and Gotian) have both spent many years working with

large organizations and have found that many employees are unaware

of the presence of mentoring programs, how to access them, or even if

they qualify. Many employees would have welcomed the opportunity to

beneﬁt from a guide through the next stage of their career but simply

didn’t realize the support was there for them. Others would have been

delighted to mentor but were never asked.

These are simple obstacles that can be ﬁxed with relative ease.

## Tailor Communication to Individual Preferences

To enhance engagement with mentoring programs, organizations

need to rethink their communication strategies. A one-size-ﬁts-all, top-

down communication approach is ineﬀective, especially with today’s

workforce that craves personalized interactions. Employees want to feel

like valued participants in the process, not just recipients of directives.

Employees today view themselves as consumers of workplace

experiences, seeking empowerment to make their own choices. By

referencing frameworks like Dr. Ellie Drago-Severson’s on diﬀerent ways

of knowing, organizations can understand that employees have varied

motivations and communication needs. Organizations should think

about how they frame the availability of mentoring programs, giving

employees more reasons to engage with them. Mentoring programs

should be positioned to include:

- Highlighting practical beneﬁts: Many employees are driven by what

mentoring can do for their immediate career goals. Communication

should focus on the speciﬁc, tangible beneﬁts of participation, such as

## skill development and career advancement.

- Aligning with organizational values: For those who seek validation

and alignment with company culture, emphasizing how mentoring ﬁts

into the organization’s values and long-term goals can be particularly

# motivating.

- Fostering personal and professional growth: Many employees

value growth opportunities. Communication should underline how

mentoring aligns with their personal values and career aspirations,

promoting it as a tool for their long-term success.

By aligning mentoring programs with these areas that are important to

their employees, organizations can craft more engaging and impactful

communication strategies that resonate with a broader spectrum of

# employees.

## Leverage Storytelling to Highlight Benefits

Storytelling can transform a routine announcement into a powerful and

engaging call to action. Instead of merely informing employees about

the existence of a mentoring program, organizations should present

it through compelling stories that illustrate its impact and relevance.

Sharing compelling stories of employees who have achieved signiﬁcant

career milestones through mentoring brings the beneﬁts of, and need

for, mentoring to life for each individual employee.

These stories can be communicated through internal newsletters,

video testimonials, and company meetings, capturing employees’

imaginations by giving them scenarios they can aspire to match and

illustrating the tangible beneﬁts of participation. Focus on the end

result — what mentoring helped individuals achieve — rather than

simply talking about mentoring without context. Your employees need

to be drawn toward mentoring when hearing the stories, seeing it as

important to help them meet their own career objectives.

## Foster Ongoing Advocacy from Senior Leaders

The role of senior leaders in championing mentoring programs cannot

be overstated. Their support not only elevates the visibility of these

initiatives but also underscores their importance. But leaders need to

do more than just endorse them at their inception. They should remain

actively engaged throughout the lifecycle of the program.

This engagement can take various forms: from sharing personal

mentoring experiences to publicly highlighting the successes of

participants to regularly speaking about the beneﬁts of mentoring

in meetings and town halls. Leaders should also act as mentors

themselves, setting an example and demonstrating the value they

place on the practice. Ongoing advocacy from senior leaders sends a

## powerful message to the rest of the organization about the importance

of mentoring, encouraging broader participation and commitment.

# Expand Access and Inclusivity

For mentoring programs to achieve their full potential, they must be

inclusive and accessible to a wide range of employees. Traditionally,

mentoring is reserved for high-potential employees or those on

leadership tracks, leaving a signiﬁcant portion of the workforce

underserved. Expanding access to mentoring programs ensures that

more employees can beneﬁt, which not only increases engagement but

also strengthens the organization’s culture of support and development.

To broaden access to mentoring, organizations need to implement the

previous solutions we have discussed here. Stronger communication,

engaging storytelling and advocacy from the leading ranks will all be

key factors in securing the resources needed to implement a mentoring

culture across the board. People need to truly understand, and believe,

in the power of mentoring, the impact it can make on individuals,

## and the beneﬁts to the organization’s productivity, recruitment and

# retention.

Mentoring activity — whether as mentor and mentee — should be

encouraged within individuals’ workﬂow and recognized in appraisals.

The narrative needs to move from mentoring is a “nice to have” to being

## an essential part of personal and career development.

. . .

Transforming your organization’s mentoring program into a powerful

tool for employee retention requires more than just setting up

the framework. It involves strategically communicating eﬀectively,

leveraging storytelling, engaging senior leaders, and expanding access.

By implementing these strategies, companies can bridge the gap

between potential and performance, leading to higher employee

# satisfaction and improved retention.

As the job market continues to evolve, organizations that fully harness

the potential of mentoring will not only retain their top talent but also

foster a more motivated and productive workforce. By making these
