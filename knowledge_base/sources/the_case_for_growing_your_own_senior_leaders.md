Though most companies conduct some sort of successionplanning process, few executives feel that they have adequatebench strength. As a result,

according to a 2009 study, only a littlemore than 60% of first level managerial positions and 52% ofsenior positions are hired from within.Obviously this is just one study and numbers may have improvedin the past couple of years, but even if they are off by 10%, theresults are still disturbing, for two reasons:First, it’s more expensive to hire externally, particularly at seniorlevels. Companies need to run advertisements, pay recruiters, andask internal people to spend company time sorting throughresumes and conducting interviews. There is also

# evidence from a

Wharton study that external hires are generally paid more thancomparable internal people. After all, most people won’t riskswitching companies unless there is a financial incentive.However, the most significant expense is from lost or diminishedproductivity. Onboarding to a new company and culture

takes

time, which means that externally hired managers may not addfull value for months, or even years — another finding from theWharton research.

The second problem is that it puts the company at risk. Withoutready-to-go replacements, jobs can remain open for long periodsof time, which can delay projects or reduce the effectiveness ofday-to-day operations. What’s even worse is that focusing onexternal hires sends a signal to internal people that they are not“good enough” to be promoted, or that their opportunities arelimited. And without a sense of future possibilities, morale suffersand commitment wanes.Simply going through the motions of succession planning won’tcreate bench strength by itself — nor will it convince managersthat they will have future opportunities. In fact, the best that agood process can do is to analytically highlight the gaps wheresuccessors are needed. In one company, for example, the head oftalent created a wonderful “book” which mapped out all of thekey positions, strengths and weaknesses of incumbents, andsuccessors who could step into these jobs either immediately, inone year, or three years. The only problem, as the BoardCommittee pointed out, was that there were virtually noimmediate replacements for any of the top executives.To make succession-planning a success, there are two inter-connected ingredients that need to be added to the mix. The firstis a genuine commitment, at every level of management, thatidentifying and developing bench strength is a critical leadershipresponsibility — and that managers need to be held accountablefor making sure they have successors in place. This means thatwhile the HR function can provide support and guidance, and

coordinate the planning process, it is managers who have to makeit happen.The second ingredient is an active development process toprepare people for next-level jobs. This too needs to be part ofeach manager’s responsibility — to help subordinates identifydevelopmental needs and career aspirations, and consciouslybuild learning objectives into their work.It’s easy for managers to point fingers at the HR function or atsenior executives for a lack of bench strength. Creatingsuccessors, however, is every manager’s job. In fact, if you reallywant to move on or move up, you need to make sure that you havesomeone in place who can take over when you are ready to go.
