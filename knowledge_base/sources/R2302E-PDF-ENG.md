Do the best leaders take charge, lead from the front, give orders, and

push people to do great work? Or do they listen to them, empower them,

and get out of the way?

After spending years considering clashing arguments from renowned

leaders and academics—and hundreds of hours studying this question

ourselves—we’ve concluded that it’s a false choice. The most eﬀective

leaders, our research shows, routinely shift between those two

approaches to meet the demands of the moment. They build teams and

organizations whose members are adept at switching back and forth

too, and leverage their formal authority and the respect they’ve earned

to shape when and how their people do so.

We’ve learned about this bimodal leadership approach in our

## interviews, observations, and research at a wide variety of

organizations, including AstraZeneca, Microsoft, Pixar, IDEO, the

## Golden State Warriors, professional and ﬁnancial services ﬁrms, health

## care organizations, oil and gas conglomerates, and Silicon Valley start-

ups. By being intentional about how much power they wield or delegate

as events unfold, the successful managers we’ve studied enhance the

performance of their teams. In this article we explore the strategies they

use to operate in this fashion.

# The Case for Dual Power Modes

Our research shows that when leaders and teams get stuck in either

“exercise authority” mode (in which the leader holds tightly on to

## power) or “ﬂat” mode (in which the leader levels the hierarchy and

shares power), they run into trouble. Teams ruled by overbearing

leaders who issue commands don’t generate the innovative, creative

thinking that is the lifeblood of companies. When we did in-depth case

studies of 10 start-ups, we found that those trapped in a top-down

mode had CEOs who said things like “If I’m paying them, they’re

supposed to do whatever I tell them.” Such CEOs didn’t have the

skill, credibility, and trust needed to get ideas and suggestions from

employees. In contrast, ventures stuck in ﬂat mode lacked the crisp decision-making, disciplined coordination, and eﬃcient action that

drive good implementation. One CEO, for example, constantly deferred

to his team and kept asking for feedback and repeating that everybody’s

opinion was valid. He put oﬀ urgent decisions and, when he made them,

based them on advice from members who had less expertise than he

did.

The most successful leaders and teams rarely get stuck. That’s what we

found in our study of 258 virtual teams that were competing to develop

ideas for a new start-up. We ran that competition with help from the

Stanford Graduate School of Business, which provided the funding for

the prizes. Leading venture capitalists judged the teams’ performance.

We discovered that teams that routinely shifted between “one person

clearly takes the lead” and “we all participate equally” outperformed

those that operated in just one of those modes.

In another study we conducted a randomized experiment with 150

temporary teams made up of senior executives from a wide range of

companies. The leaders of 50 teams maintained a traditional hierarchy,

the leaders of another 50 created a ﬂat hierarchy, and those heading

the remaining 50 alternated between the two—they gave members time

to voice their opinions and ideas but then stepped in and asserted

authority when needed. The teams played a simulation game in which

members climbed Mount Everest together. They were evaluated on

the quality of their decisions—such as when to start and end the

daily climb, whether to climb that day at all, and how to allocate

oxygen to team members—many of which required them to synthesize

information held by diﬀerent members. Here again the teams that

alternated modes performed much better than the others, making

# objectively superior decisions.

# When, Where, and How to Shift

Leaders who are adept at shifting power modes let everyone know when

it’s time for divergent thinking (during idea generation, for instance)

and when it’s time for convergent thinking (to, say, map out next

steps). They send clear signals about when their teams should oﬀer

suggestions, raise concerns about problems and risks, and argue. They

also make it psychologically safe for people to speak up—ensuring they

feel they’ll be heard, respected, and valued. And when it’s time to end

the discussion, make a decision, and act, skilled leaders signal that

they’re taking charge again.

Teams that routinely shifted between “one person clearly takes the lead” and “we all participate equally” outperformed those that operated in just one of those modes.

That’s what the ﬁlmmakers at Pixar Animation Studios do. Pixar is

renowned for compelling and proﬁtable computer-animated movies

## such as Ratatouille, Finding Nemo, and Soul and the Incredibles and

Toy Story series. According to Ed Catmull, who cofounded Pixar and

was its president for its ﬁrst 32 years, the company uses power shifting

in the meetings of a group dubbed “the brain trust.” At these meetings

ﬁlmmakers—including story artists, producers, and directors—help

directors develop their ﬁlms by oﬀering suggestions and criticism and

debating diﬀerent solutions. Catmull recently told us, “While outside

the room, one person may have more authority than another, inside the

brain-trust meeting everyone’s voice has equal weight. The people in

the room must view one another as peers.” To help “remove power from

the room,” he added, during these sessions the most prestigious people

“keep quiet for the ﬁrst 10 or 15 minutes” and allow others to speak.

At the end of the meeting, after the group has ﬁnished sharing and

debating ideas as peers, the hierarchy kicks back in: “The ﬁnal decision

on how to solve a problem is always the director’s,” Catmull said.

Meetings are a good opportunity for leaders to shift power modes.

Though people love to hate meetings, every organization needs

them to generate ideas, share information, debate possible solutions,

communicate decisions, steer implementation, and ﬁre people up. Sure,

many organizations have too many meetings, but you always need

some, and eﬀective leaders know how to get the most out of them.

Once you understand how and where to shift power modes, you can

increase your ability to do it by taking these four steps:

- 1. Revisit Your Mindset

Many leaders hold ﬂawed beliefs about power that prevent them from

alternating between exercising and delegating authority. Here’s how to

# escape that trap.

Question the assumption that hierarchy is ﬁxed. Yes, most companies

have—and need—an organizational chart with job titles and reporting

requirements that spell out who has the authority to make key

decisions. But savvy leaders know that the messy and ever-evolving

nature of organizational life means it’s unwise—if not impossible—to

keep the same pecking order in the organization at all times.

Members of the best teams don’t treat rules and roles like a

musical composition that’s played exactly as written. Instead, like jazz

musicians, they improvise, trying new things and constantly making

adjustments in response to one another’s moves, while still being

guided—and often constrained—by the original theme. Jazz bands

routinely rotate leadership, giving each player a chance to have a solo

or develop a musical idea while others play a supporting role. This

ability to support another musician is known as comping—listening and

responding without overshadowing—and it’s one reason jazz players are

so respected by other musicians.

Look at how much airtime you get. We’ve found that leaders often talk too much in meetings where everyone is supposed to contribute.

Like good jazz players, successful leaders excel at both exerting their

power and relinquishing it at the appropriate times. We saw this at one

start-up where the CEO told his team he was “horrible at sales” and

invited one of the women on it to take the lead at a meeting to draw up

the sales strategy. She steered the conversation, and he jumped in only

occasionally with questions. At the end of the meeting the CEO took

control back, adding a few things to her list, telling her what to do next,

and then securing commitment from everyone in the room to support

the new strategy. This approach ensured that every team member would

follow up and help turn the new strategy into organizational action.

Recognize that sharing power doesn’t diminish your authority. Many

leaders fear that encouraging others to voice opinions and make

decisions will weaken their own standing. But there is good evidence—

including a study by Tsedal Neeley and B. Sebastian Reiche—that the

opposite is true. Leaders who know when and how to cede power earn

respect and commitment. The best people want to work for them, and

## the team member with the most pertinent expertise sways decisions.

For all those reasons, their teams perform better.

In their study Neeley and Reiche tracked 115 senior leaders at a global

U.S.-based tech consulting company. Most of them were responsible for

selling and implementing projects in countries where they had little

experience. The leaders who were rated as top performers by their

superiors and got more promotions routinely ﬂattened the hierarchy.

They practiced “downward deference”: working side by side with

employees rather than lording power over them. Like the Brazilian

leader who told his Singapore team, “Let’s invert the jobs here. You

don’t work for me. I work for you,” they acknowledged subordinates’

technical and cultural expertise by deferring to their judgment. The

worst-performing executives insisted on maintaining a rigid pecking

order and behaved as if they were the smartest people in the room, even

when they were clueless about local traditions and markets. One was

an American boss who was sent home from China after a year because

he didn’t trust his local team, talked too much, and kept conveying the

message “I’m the expert because I have led so many things.”

- 2. Analyze Yourself and Your Team

Leaders and teams often don’t even realize that they’re trapped in

one power mode. That’s why being aware of your own tendencies and

making your team members aware of theirs is crucial. Here’s how to

do it.

Study your habits. Look at how much airtime you get in discussions.

We’ve found that leaders often talk too much in meetings where

everyone is supposed to contribute ideas. In one of our classes, students

attended all-hands meetings at ﬁve start-ups and tracked the amount

of time each attendee spoke, the number of statements each CEO

made, and the number of questions the CEO asked employees. All the

meetings were an opportunity for people to check in and ask for help

or oﬀer it to others. One CEO was dismayed to learn that during a 15-

minute stand-up meeting, he talked more than 50% of the time, made

10 statements, and asked only two questions. But the feedback helped

him change: In later meetings his share of airtime dropped to about

30%, and he started asking a lot more questions.

It’s also good to actively seek feedback from people close to you who

see you in action and are willing to be candid with you. Ask them to let

you know whether you’re too dominating in conversations that would

## beneﬁt from a diversity of perspectives and whether your presence

stiﬂes discussion because people don’t feel comfortable speaking their

# minds.

Study your team’s norms. The challenge here isn’t just to identify your

team’s default mode; it’s to understand what’s causing it (such as your

own behaviors or the team’s history) and how to push members out of

their comfort zone and teach them to transition between modes.

The CEO of one management team we worked with was frustrated

because members rarely spoke up or debated, even when invited to

do so. Our interviews and surveys showed that the team was stuck

## in the exercise-authority mode, with the CEO dominating discussions

and decisions. Though that mode had made sense when the company

was navigating a series of crises, including a corporate turnaround

and the pandemic, it was now hurting team members’ ability to make

contributions, argue over ideas, and innovate. We worked with the CEO

and the team to embrace and live the mantra “debate, commit, and act.”

We taught them how to use tools such as assigning a diﬀerent member

to serve as devil’s advocate during each meeting. And we introduced

a 360-degree feedback system that helped members relearn when and

how to speak up and debate openly in team meetings.

If your team has trouble changing modes, look at the agendas for your meetings. Do they clearly indicate when you want to discuss ideas and when it’s time to make a decision?

Other teams have the opposite problem. They can’t stop brainstorming

and debating and are still trying to reach consensus long after a decision

should have been made and carried out. Their leaders need to step in

and force closure, but they don’t. We’ve seen numerous start-ups fail

because of this phenomenon. For instance, at one we studied, the two

cofounders couldn’t determine which of them should be the CEO—even

though investors had asked them to do so— and struggled to make

decisions about how to build their product (what dimensions it should

be) and get it to market (which segment to target ﬁrst). With no clear

decision-maker, they stagnated in an endless back-and-forth. Frustrated

with the stalled product development, their investors pulled the plug.

- 3. Set Expectations

Skilled leaders aren’t coy or subtle about when to operate in one

power mode or the other. They send crystal clear signals about the

modes people will work in before meetings, programs, tours, or other

# gatherings.

Spell out shifts in agendas. If your team has trouble changing modes,

look at the agendas for your last ﬁve or six meetings. Did they clearly

indicate when you wanted people to generate or discuss ideas and when

it was time to make a decision? A good way to do that is to specify

“debate” under an agenda item, with the amount of time that will be

devoted to the discussion, followed by “commit and act,” with the name

of the decision-maker. If a meeting is being held to announce a decision

and answer questions about what it means for the team, state that in the

invitation, and make it clear the meeting is not a brainstorming session

# or an occasion for input.

Differentiate meetings. Another way to get employees to shift power

modes is to stipulate the purpose of meetings. This is something

Massimo Lombardo, who at the time was the director of the Codogno

Hospital in the Lombardy region of Italy, did in the early months of the

Covid-19 pandemic. The hospital was hit with a tsunami of patients,

which overwhelmed its capacity in terms of beds and staﬀ time.

Making matters worse, it took days to process the tests for diagnosing

the virus. The hospital’s leaders and staﬀ had to innovate at a time

when demands on them were extraordinary. To keep things on track,

Lombardo speciﬁed which meetings were ones where staﬀ members

would receive their marching orders and which were sessions where

they should contribute ideas. The daily morning all-staﬀ meeting, when

hospital employees gathered to align their plans for the day, was when

they’d get their orders. But at debrieﬁng meetings, held twice a day,

all employees—from plumbers to nurses to surgeons—were encouraged

## to share their experiences and propose solutions to problems. At the

debrieﬁngs Lombardo listened to what all attendees had to say and

thanked them for their input, and their ideas were considered seriously.

The approach worked: Patients received the care they needed despite

the tough circumstances, and the solutions the group brainstormed in

the debrieﬁngs helped Codogno and other Italian hospitals it shared

# them with cope with the Covid crisis.

Use rituals to mark transitions. Top performers in many ﬁelds do this

to shift their attention and focus their minds. Wade Boggs, the former

third baseman for the Boston Red Sox, ate chicken before each game

and wrote the Hebrew symbol for chai (which means “life”) in the dirt

every time he went to bat. The tennis star Serena Williams bounces the

ball exactly ﬁve times before her ﬁrst serve and two times before her

second. The ballerina Suzanne Farrell pinned a small toy mouse inside

her leotard, crossed herself twice, and pinched herself twice before

going onstage.

When you want input on an idea, don’t use potentially intimidating language such as “Is there anyone who disagrees?”

## HBR / Magazine Article / You Need Two Leadership Gears

Our work shows that rituals reduce employees’ anxiety and increase

## their conﬁdence before high-pressure tasks—and that group rituals

enhance the meaning of work and improve group performance. But

more to the point, rituals can be a powerful way to indicate shifts

from one power mode to another. For instance, as we learned from

interviewing them, when U.S. Navy SEAL teams switch from the pure

## command-and-control mode of missions to after-action reviews—at

which everyone is expected to share criticisms, suggestions, and kudos

equally—all present take oﬀ their stripes and other signs of rank to

## signal a temporary ﬂattening of the hierarchy.

Avoid sham ﬂattening. After we introduced the notion of power shifting

to one company, an executive (let’s call him Sanjay) shared a story

about his boss (we’ll call her Aretha): Again and again, Aretha would ask

Sanjay to run a meeting and make a key decision. Then, at the 11th hour,

just as the decision was about to be made, she would jump in and make

it herself. Such behavior is rampant in organizations where leaders

struggle to give away real control but believe—or at least behave as if—

making false promises about empowerment will placate followers. Their

hollow words backﬁre, however, because teams learn that they can’t

trust those leaders. So during periods of promised ﬂatness, members

stay silent or go through the motions as they wait for the boss to—yet

again—snatch back control.

- 4. Reinforce Shifts with Words and Deeds

When coaching leaders we use the hippopotamus as a metaphor:

Leaders have to know when to rise out of the water and exercise

their power and when to cede it to others and sink down, leaving just

their eyes above the surface to discreetly watch their teams. The hippo

metaphor helps leaders escape the “always out of the water” or “always

underwater” mode and provide their teams with the right level of power

at the right time. But to do that eﬀectively, leaders must be mindful of

the words they choose, their body language, and how or whether they

# participate in particular meetings.

Lead by example. In the best meetings we’ve studied, the coordinated

power shifts across team members are automatic, instant, and graceful.

At one multinational health care company, for example, the CEO kicked

## oﬀ a monthly meeting with his 11-person executive team with a few

inspiring reminders of the bigger vision the company was seeking to realize. Then he passed the baton to the chief marketing oﬃcer, who

shared her goal for the discussion: making a ﬁnal decision about the

new brand logo. She then invited all in the room to speak their minds

—which prompted a barrage of facts, recommendations, and concerns.

The CEO explicitly minimized his power as the discussion continued—

he moved to the back of the room and made sure to speak last. At the

end of this burst of ﬂatness, the CMO took charge again and made the

decision on the ﬁnal version of the new brand logo. Then the CEO took

over and led the team in a discussion of the next agenda item. The team

was eﬀective because all its members were adept at assuming, sharing,

and giving away power—and understood when it was time to make the

# next transition.

Announce shifts. Tell people that right now it’s time to change modes,

using simple, clear language and maybe even raising your voice a bit.

The CEO of a global technology company we work with does this well.

He routinely announces, “Let’s create a moment for brainstorming” or

“We’ve heard many perspectives; let’s now turn to making a decision.”

That said, you need to make such interjections thoughtfully; the wrong

words may sow fear and confusion, while the right ones will provide

clarity and comfort. When you want input and debate about your idea,

don’t use potentially intimidating language such as “Is there anyone

who disagrees?” That can create the impression that you’ve made up

your mind and are just going through the motions of asking for others’

opinions. Instead you might say, “Does anyone have a diﬀerent point

of view?” or “Is there a diﬀerent way to look at this decision?” Such

seemingly small tweaks in wording can have a big eﬀect.

Use body language. Your nonverbal behavior can reinforce or

undermine your message. Asking, “Does anyone have a diﬀerent view?”

with your arms crossed while standing at the head of the table (while

everyone else is sitting) won’t be as eﬀective as asking the same

question while seated at the middle of the table with your arms

uncrossed and a slight smile on your face. And simply making eye

contact with someone in the room can serve as an invitation for that

person to speak.

You can also follow the example of one adept manager we met, who had

been given a leadership award by his company. When he wanted all his

team members to jump in and solve a problem presented by a colleague,

he’d say something like “You all ﬁgure this out—you know way more

than I do” and then move from the front of the room to the back.

Read the room. Eﬀective leaders know when a shift from command

and control to empowerment is in order. Take Steve Kerr, the coach of

the Golden State Warriors, who in the 2014–2015 season had the most

## wins of any ﬁrst-year coach in the history of the National Basketball

Association, culminating in the team’s ﬁrst NBA championship in 40

years. Over the next seven years the Warriors went on to win three more

# championships.

At diﬀerent points during a season, when Kerr feels his players need to

be reenergized, he gives them the opportunity to decide how to play.

That’s right—they decide the strategy to use during the game, a task

Kerr is usually in charge of as their coach. He told us, “I read the room.

I can tell when they need a boost in motivation because the season is

long and requires much persistence. Those are the moments where I

give them power.”

Leave the room. If you’re the most powerful person in the room, no

matter what you do or say, your mere presence can be intimidating.

Your authority alone can squelch comment and debate and create

## awkward silences after someone oﬀers an idea and everyone waits for

you to express an opinion. One possible remedy: Leave—or never enter

—the room. At Pixar, Catmull asked Steve Jobs not to show up at brain-

trust meetings because he felt that Jobs’s presence would stiﬂe the ﬂow

of suggestions made by the ﬁlmmakers.

## In October 1962, President John F. Kennedy’s advisers were debating

how to respond to the Soviet Union’s eﬀorts to place nuclear missiles

on the island of Cuba, just 100 miles from Florida. As the psychologist

## Irving L. Janis recounts in his 1982 book, Groupthink: Psychological

## Studies of Policy Decisions and Fiascoes, Kennedy gathered some 20

experts with diverse viewpoints and knowledge. To encourage them

to express their opinions and avoid groupthink, he divided them into

smaller teams and asked each team to develop possible solutions. Then,

following the advice of his brother Robert Kennedy, who “felt there was

## less true give-and-take with the president in the room,” JFK deliberately

chose not to attend some of the team meetings.

. . .

The key to successful leadership is knowing when to get in the way,

when to get out of the way, and how to send crystal clear signals to

your followers about which mode to operate in right now. As Tommy

## Lasorda, the late, great manager of the Los Angeles Dodgers baseball

team, put it, “Managing is like holding a dove in your hand. If you hold

it too tightly, you kill it, but if you hold it too loosely, you lose it.”
