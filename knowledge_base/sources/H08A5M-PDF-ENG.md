Corporate growth is the ultimate team sport, relying on multiple

functions’ data, technology, and expertise. This is especially true

as technology innovation and AI introduce new revenue streams

and business models, which require signiﬁcant cross-functional

collaboration to get oﬀ the ground.

# HBR / Digital Article / Why Cross-Functional Collaboration Stalls, and How to Fix It

A recent Gartner survey of more than 400 business leaders found

that most companies are running as many as ﬁve types of complex

initiatives at once. For example, an organization might be designing

cross-channel customer experiences, while also combining its sales and

marketing functions, and crafting new digital growth strategies. Each

of these programs could involve ﬁve to eight corporate functions and

20 to 35 team members. The sheer breadth of resource commitments

across such a range of initiatives creates a basic, pervasive background

# complexity.

Bringing some order to the chaos is imperative. Overall, Gartner

research shows 78% of organizational leaders report experiencing what

we call collaboration drag — too many meetings, too much peer

## feedback, unclear decision-making authority, and too much time spent

getting buy-in from stakeholders.

When collaboration drag is high, we’ve found businesses are 37% less

likely to exceed their revenue and proﬁt targets, failing at the very

things their lofty cross-functional agendas are meant to achieve. For

most organizations, collaboration drag has reached epidemic levels.

## Executive Alignment Alone Is Not the Answer

Can collaboration be saved? The answer is “yes,” but not in the way

most people think. Typically, when cross-functional eﬀorts stall, leaders

attempt to improve executive alignment, believing that widespread

## agreement on goals and priorities at the top of the management

hierarchy will trickle down. Having achieved top-to-top alignment,

executives then put additional heft behind their eﬀorts to break down

functional barriers by investing in common systems and new, cross-

# functional roles.

Unfortunately, Gartner research found that none of these practices

improve collaboration drag. In fact, the small number of companies

## in our study without high levels of executive alignment report minimal

collaboration drag. Perhaps when functions keep their distance from

one another, there’s less disagreement. That being said, there’s likely

# less innovation, too.

Organizations that prioritize cross-functional collaboration still face

## the reality that even in the best-run companies with strong executive

relationships, working across functions remains messy, political, and

## frustrating. At every level of the org chart — from junior employees

to senior leaders — Gartner survey respondents admit to sometimes

snubbing other functions or leaping into action without clarifying

objectives. These kinds of occasional experiences dramatically increase

# collaboration drag.

Ultimately, executives’ attempts to ﬁx the broader collaboration

environment have no real impact on the ground, because they’re simply

too far removed. Instead of looking outward and upward, leaders must

## look within their own functions for resolution.

Gartner has identiﬁed several strategies that help business leaders

equip their teams to meet the demands of complex organizational

# dynamics:

## Extend executive alignment practices down to tactical levels.

The practices required to achieve executive alignment, such as building

relationships and clarifying who’s accountable for what, can often easily

be extended downward.

For example, telecommunications company Inﬁnera has made trust a

companywide priority to improve collaboration dynamics. Instead of

leaving trust to grow organically, Inﬁnera’s CEO and executive leaders

use a “trust matrix” to document and track critical relationships at both

the C-level and among lower-level leadership teams. The ratings are

updated twice a year and are completely transparent to members of the

executive leadership team, encouraging candor and accountability.

Inﬁnera believes the primary value of the exercise comes from its ability

to stimulate thinking and discussion about the reason behind certain

ratings, which helps reveal sources of tension that could otherwise go

unnoticed. The ratings, and reasons behind them, help identify where

drag is occurring and prompt teams to talk about issues impeding

collaboration success. Although senior management suggests speciﬁc

solutions to challenges, such as where resources can be redeployed

or communication improved, team leaders themselves are expected to

address these relationship issues and formulate concrete action plans.

Broader awareness of the health of critical relationships will enable

leaders to assess where collaboration is dragging. To get started,

executives should approach peers in other functions who already see

their area of the business as critical to achieving shared goals. Capture

feedback in a shared document that is transparent for all involved, and

then meet to discuss what’s driving the feedback. Teams within speciﬁc

functions can also leverage this practice to monitor their dynamics.

## Develop employee strategic and interpersonal skills.

Gartner research ﬁnds that a range of skills can reduce collaboration

drag, including:

- Interpersonal inﬂuence skills, such as trust building, political

# navigation, and situational judgment

- Critical thinking skills, such as problem-solving or systems thinking

- Technical skills, such as data literacy and tool or platform utilization

These skills help teams navigate tricky group dynamics, grasp how

diﬀerent pieces of a project ﬁt together, and speak a common language,

particularly on technical projects. To build these skills, Gartner research

has found it’s not enough to oﬀer the on-demand virtual courses that

are typical at most companies. Making new skills stick requires guided

practice, mentorship, and a team culture that treats learning as a must-

do — a level of functional priority that many organizations don’t reach.

One instructive example comes from a ﬁnancial services company

based in Austria. Raiﬀeisen Bank International (RBI) went through a

major technology transformation to deliver on the company’s vision for

data-driven customer engagement. Following four months of research

into skill gaps and common pitfalls during similar transformations,

RBI’s transformation leaders designed a learning program that balances

theory and expert advice with on-the-job practice. Individuals work

alongside peers in other functions to practice and apply new skills

— such as customer journey design and agile methods — under the

## guidance of their training coach (typically a vendor partner). This

training model gives learners a chance to practice both technical and

## cross-functional collaboration skills at the same time.

RBI rewards ongoing employee participation in the learning program

## through gamiﬁcation points, prizes, and highly visible leadership

recognition. RBI has seen success from investment in their employees’

learning: Employees who completed the program are collaborating

more eﬀectively to complete more technical work in-house, driving cost

# savings and revenue growth.

## Look for collaboration drag within functions or teams.

Collaboration drag isn’t limited to cross-functional eﬀorts. This ﬁnal

piece of the solution requires a solid understanding of how work gets

done today, including the confusing and exhausting parts. Functional

leaders can start by reducing nice-to-have collaboration in favor of

must-have collaboration, prioritizing participation where teams can

make the clearest impact.

Take the example of a large global supply chain organization, where

the customer insights and marketing leader led a multiyear functional

transformation to “Say no and mean it.” To support this cultural change,

she started by assessing how business partners were working with the

marketing function. She worked with peer executives to determine

which initiatives were linked to a company strategic priority — and

found that most approved projects did not tie back. At that point, she

had a clear business case to look deeper within marketing.

The next step was to map processes in detail and reach a more

comprehensive understanding of how work gets done for typical

## marketing projects. With this information in hand, the function could

show business partners that a single line item on their project plan often

meant more than 40 distinct marketing tasks. This transparency helped

## project teams more accurately assess the priority level of asks, scope

their timelines, and understand how marketing adds value.

At the same time, the leader coached her team to recognize their

own people-pleaser tendencies and set appropriate boundaries. She

held workshops that focused on how to communicate with diﬀerent

stakeholders to push back in a way that was still respectful and

appropriate to the relationship. Marketers also learned to present

realistic alternatives or facilitate self-service solutions, such as working

directly with an agency or vendor, instead of doing everything

# themselves.

Consequently, her team has successfully renegotiated their role on

cross-functional programs, and they are now seen as business partners

# in pivotal commercial decisions.

Business today requires a high degree of cross-functional collaboration

to achieve nearly any meaningful objective. When cross-functional

eﬀorts stall, which is a natural and frequent occurrence, organizations

should encourage functions and teams to develop their own talent and

improve their own processes. Doing so will enable employees to thrive in inherently diﬃcult environments.
