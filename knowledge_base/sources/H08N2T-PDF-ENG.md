Are you thinking of changing jobs, or even careers?

If so, you are not alone. Estimates suggest that more than 40% of

workers are entertaining the possibility of a job switch, while another

20% have recently quit their jobs. This ﬁgure is even higher among

knowledge workers, with LinkedIn estimating that 70% of its users are

passive job seekers—that is, people who are not actively trying to get a

new job, but are open to the idea of a better opportunity. In the realm of

relationships, this would equate to 70% of married people being “open”

to a better spouse (we would surely talk about a marital satisfaction

# crisis of these proportions).

## The underlying reasons for the prevalent interest in job-switching and

career-pivoting are well known. First, most people dislike their jobs,

with Gallup data showing that only three in 10 people feel engaged at

work. Note that these estimates are based on people who work in some

of the most successful organizations in the world—that is, companies

## that care enough about employee morale and engagement to actually

poll employees about their experience. We could expect things to be

even bleaker for other workers. Second, although managers and leaders

play a major role in driving employee motivation and performance

(or lack thereof), most people are disenchanted with their boss, if not

traumatized by them: Research shows that people trust strangers more

than their manager; that merely 20% of boards feel conﬁdent in the

## quality of their leaders and managers; that between 30–60% of leaders

act “destructively”; that people tend to “join organizations but quit their

bosses”; and that many managers are simply incompetent in their roles.

Third, career moves can be a tricky and complex endeavor, with many

factors determining the ﬁt between our interests, abilities, and choices.

Add to this the recent disruption in jobs and skills caused by AI, and it is

hard to disagree with Tom Peters’ rule: “If you are not confused, you are

not paying attention.”

Although it would be ludicrous to pretend that there’s a magic bullet to

improve your job situation or address your career concerns (precisely

because things are complex), it is nevertheless possible to think through

a foundational self-assessment of the potential motives driving your

interest in diﬀerent jobs or careers, and where there might be a potential

## ﬁt between your motivations and the career choices at hand.

## Self-Assessment: What Do You Value Most at Work?

To help you assess and reﬂect on what really motivates you in your

career, consider this series of science-based questions that can help you

determine whether a new job or career path might be a good ﬁt:

- 1. What are my non-negotiables, personal values, and top priorities?

How important are factors like job stability, ﬂexibility, or work-life

balance to me? Do I care about working form anywhere or working from home? Would I be happy with a job that requires me to go to the oﬃce

almost every day? Do I want a certain lifestyle, which would beneﬁt

from a low-stress environment, or a wellness culture that encourages

time oﬀ? How important is it for me to align my personal values with

the company’s mission, mandate, or values? Do I want to start a family,

which would require good insurance and good family leave policies?

Do I want to retire early, which would require a certain salary and

## compensation? (More on ﬁnancial considerations below.)

These questions should help you assess your foundational needs,

such as ﬁnancial security or the ability to manage your personal life

alongside your career. Being clear about your priorities, especially the

one or two non-negotiables, is a great starting point to guide you in your

# search.

Ideally, your non-negotiables should boil down to just one or two

factors, which may be best understood when you consider them “in

reverse.” For example, you may wish to ask yourself whether you would

ever work in a job that: is extremely stressful/high-pressure, has a

questionable moral/ethical impact on society, is seen negatively by

others (including those you care about), is extremely boring, is at odds

with your personal beliefs/values, is extremely unpredictable/unstable,

lacks a positive social/interpersonal component, doesn’t pay well, etc.

Chances are that, like most people, you may feel inclined to answer no

to all of these questions (they are deliberately chosen for their extreme

negative connotation). However, it is also likely that you could rank-

order them to be left with the absolute no’s at the top and a couple of “near-maybes” at the bottom; this is a simple and eﬃcient way to

organize your priorities.

- 2. What are my ﬁnancial considerations?

How much does ﬁnancial compensation matter to me, and would this

new role meet my (current and future) ﬁnancial goals? How much do I

need to earn? How much would I need to earn to put up with things I

don’t like? How much pay would I be happy to sacriﬁce for a job that

oﬀers better learning opportunities, a nicer culture, and more inspiring

or motivating challenges? Most people make job and career choices

based on money, but money is a weak predictor of job satisfaction. As it

turns out, there is a big diﬀerence between what people want and what

they actually need in order to be happy with their jobs. At the same

time, not everybody cares about being happy at work, since there are

many sources of meaning in life other than work. In any event, being

honest with yourself about how much pay and compensation matters,

and how much you are willing to compromise or sacriﬁce to go beyond

the minimum level of income you need, should inform your choices.

- 3. What drives me at work?

Am I motivated by power, status, or leadership opportunities? Do I need

to have fun at work? How important is it to have great colleagues?

Does the job or career need to cater to my hungry mind? Does this

role provide a path to those ambitions? There are many models of work-

related values, but they are mostly interchangeable. They also align in

one fundamental assumption: When people pick jobs or careers that

are congruent with their values, they will generally be happier, stay in

the job longer, and perform better. So, if these questions are hard to

answer, look around for potential role models or people you admire,

put yourself in their shoes, and reﬂect on why your aspirational or

ideal self identiﬁes with them. This will help you understand if you are motivated by status, power, inﬂuence, fun, aﬃliation, knowledge,

learning opportunities, and so on.

- 4. How much autonomy do I want or need?

Does this career path give me the freedom to make decisions, take

initiative, or work independently? Will this allow me to act like an

entrepreneur or an intrapreneur? Will I be able to cope with a hands-

oﬀ leader or boss? Am I ready to manage myself? These questions

should help you evaluate whether autonomy and control over your

work environment are priorities for you. Everybody values freedom, but

with greater freedom comes greater responsibility and accountability.

Indeed, freedom can be a curse, because when everything is possible,

and you are free to unlock your potential in any way, shape, or form

you want, you may end up putting a great deal of pressure on yourself

for not achieving more. Many people thrive in more structured and well-

## deﬁned environments, rather than in cultures or environments that

are more informal, unstructured, or “agile” (a common euphemism for

# chaotic).

- 5. What are my intrinsic motivations?

Although this may sound controversial, not everybody expects a great

deal of fulﬁllment from work. That is, while we may be accustomed to

the idea that work and especially careers ought to provide us with a high

dose of purpose, spiritual fulﬁllment, and even a sense of calling, the

reality is that for many people work is just that: work, as in something

they need to do to make ends meet or pay the bills. Being honest

with yourself about this may help you calibrate your expectations and

consider more choices.

To be sure, you may ﬁnd joy, passion, and excitement from activities

and life areas other than work, as many people do. So, here are some

# HBR / Digital Article / 6 Questions to Help You Decide What You Want in Your Next Job

questions that can help you assess the degree to which you need to

be intrinsically motivated by your job and career. How much fun or

enjoyment do I expect from my work, and does this role oﬀer tasks or

projects that I genuinely enjoy? Will this new opportunity bring a sense

## of joy, creativity, or adventure into my daily routine, and how much

am I potentially willing to sacriﬁce (e.g., in terms of money, workload,

career growth, etc.) to get that experience? In fact, how important is the

experience part of the experience I would get? Do I need the journey to

be enjoyable and fun, or am I OK seeing it as a means to an end?

As science shows, if you can match your interests and intrinsic

motivations to a new opportunity, you’ll naturally be more engaged in

the role. And yet, we have known for ages that people diﬀer in their need

for fun vs. capacity for sacriﬁce, something captured by the hedonism-

## to-stoicism continuum. The more conscientious, gritty, ambitious, and

career-driven you are, the more likely it is that you can show resilience

and put up with a job or career that is at the exact opposite end of the

“spoiling you” spectrum. Conversely, if you are in it for the ride, and

speciﬁcally to have fun and a great time while you are on the ride, then

be clear about it with yourself and others.

- 6. How will I grow in this role?

What skills or knowledge do I want to develop, and will this role

provide opportunities to learn and grow? Even if the new job isn’t

immediately an upgrade from my current role, will it amplify and

enhance my experience, expertise, and potential? In essence, consider

if this job aligns with your desire to continuously improve or expand

your expertise. Everybody says they value learning, but the fact of

the matter is that most jobs and roles prioritize getting results and

performing the tasks and duties that are expected, with learning being

a “nice to have” add-on (for those who are performing well already!).

However, some cultures are more centered around oﬀering employees

learning opportunities and even rewarding them for doing so, so be

clear about how important learning is, and whether you would be

willing to sacriﬁce other things to focus on that.

While the above questions are not a comprehensive list, they address

some of the main considerations to assess whether a new opportunity

might be right for you.

To help reﬁne your thinking further, try using either/or scenarios

(vignettes) to help you reﬂect on you career priorities:

# Risk vs. security

- A) I would rather take a chance on an entrepreneurial or

unconventional career path where I can create my own opportunities.

- B) I prefer a stable and prestigious career path with ﬁnancial security

# and clear growth prospects.

# Long-term career goals

- A) I want a career that aligns with my personal values, passions, and

desired lifestyle, even if success takes longer.

- B) My primary goal is to maximize my income and climb the corporate

# ladder as quickly as possible.

# Scoring Key & Interpretation

After completing the self-assessment, count how many times you chose

A and how many times you chose B to determine your career priorities:

- Mostly A’s: You prioritize intrinsic motivations such as fulﬁllment,

## work enjoyment, continuous learning, autonomy, and a positive work

environment. Your ideal career pivot should focus on roles that align

## with your values, oﬀer meaningful work, and foster personal growth—

even if they don’t come with the highest salary or status.

- Mostly B’s: You are driven by extrinsic motivations like ﬁnancial

success, career advancement, recognition, and stability. You’re willing

to make sacriﬁces, work long hours, or endure less-fulﬁlling work

experiences if it means reaching your long-term career goals faster.

Your career pivot should focus on maximizing earnings, prestige, and

# leadership opportunities.

- A mix of A’s and B’s: You have a balanced and ﬂexible career

orientation—valuing both work enjoyment and external rewards. This

suggests that you may need to carefully weigh trade-oﬀs between job

## satisfaction and ﬁnancial success, autonomy and structure, or work-

life balance and career growth. Your next career move should aim to

blend these factors in a way that feels sustainable and fulﬁlling to you.

In short, career choices are complex, and there’s never a guarantee that

you will switch to the right role or job, so the proof of the pudding

is always in the tasting. That said, while the job market and careers

may be hard to predict, there is one part of the equation that is rather

predictable—namely, you. Moreover, a failure to understand yourself

and your needs will rarely lead to good choices, except by accident or

serendipitously. My hope is that the above questions can guide you to

reﬂect on who you are and what you want, and even what you may

need, so that you at least minimize avoidable errors when it comes to

the knowns, which are your values, interests, and personality.
