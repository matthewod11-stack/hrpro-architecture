When you manage a large team, it’s easy to feel as though you spend

more time wrangling people than guiding them. Providing personal

attention and making sure everyone takes responsibility can be tough,

especially when there are so many moving parts. So, how can you put in

place systems and processes that help you manage more eﬀectively?

How can you make sure everyone feels supported? And, what’s the

best way to create an environment where everyone takes initiative and

ownership of their work — even when you’re not in the room?

# What the Experts Say

To be clear: There’s no magic, one-size-ﬁts-all number of direct reports.

It depends on the work you’re doing, the people on your team, and

your career stage. The trouble is, it can be hard to tell when you’ve

reached your capacity. Every leader has a “breaking point,” where the

number of direct reports becomes unmanageable, says Vishal Gupta,

## a professor of management at University of Alabama’s Culverhouse

College of Business. “You’re pulled in a million diﬀerent directions and

always worried that you’re going to miss something,” he says.

It’s a relatively common problem, according to Tiﬀany McDowell,

## principal in the people advisory services division at Ernst & Young and

the author of Strategies for Organizational Design. “More often than

not, managers inherit their teams, and they’re left to try to make do

with what they have,” she says. But while the challenges of leading a

large team are real, there are also positives. “When you have a wide

range of direct reports, you’re not going to be able to micromanage

or get in the weeds,” she says. Instead, you must become a “true

people manager” and learn to trust your team members to give them

agency and autonomy, “which is a strong driver of engagement and

productivity.” Here’s how to do that.

# Delegate decision-making

One of the biggest challenges of managing a large team is keeping up

with the number of decisions and trade-oﬀs that need to be made, says

Gupta. Trying to handle them all on your own can slow everything

down and cause a bottleneck. That’s why you need to “give your team

members as much decision-making autonomy as possible,” according

to McDowell. The key, she says, is to keep the high-stakes decisions

for yourself and delegate the rest. You should still guide and advise

your team members. But giving them the latitude to make their own

decisions will not only increase their productivity, but it will also help

them develop new skills. And you’ll be able to focus on big-picture,

high-level strategy, instead of being bogged down in routine problems.

“It’s one of the most freeing things you can do” as a leader.

Leverage the power of groups

Individual autonomy is critical, but it’s not enough on its own. Teams

need a culture that encourages everyone to hold each other accountable

and learn from one another. “Be intentional about asking people

to collaborate,” says McDowell. “Have your people form teams with

speciﬁc goals, give them the clarity and freedom to accomplish these

goals, and amazing things can happen even without you there.” Say,

for instance, you manage a marketing team of 30 and your job is to

oversee the content they produce. Rather than reviewing every piece

individually, you can create a system of peer review, where senior team

members critique the work of junior members, and everyone gives each

other feedback. Your goal is to “push decision-making into the group as

opposed to having all decisions ﬂow up to you.”

Then, get out of the way

Trust is a crucial part of the equation, says McDowell. Without it, you

can delegate as much as you want, but it won’t result in the outcomes

you’re looking for. “If you give people autonomy, and then swoop in

and take over, they are going to learn helplessness,” she says. It’s also a

recipe for frustration for both parties. Your team members will resent

your meddling and “you’ll be left wondering why no one is taking

# ownership and accountability.”

You need to accept that your reports might make mistakes as they learn.

Gupta recommends starting each day with a short team meeting so you

can get updates and oﬀer guidance. Ask your team members about the

challenges they’re dealing with and how you can support them. Your job

is, “to listen and respond, not to pontiﬁcate,” he says.

Manage up and down Another diﬃculty of leading a large team is balancing your own

professional needs with those of your team. You have to manage

upwards — to provide the right level of detail to your boss to ensure

you and your team members receive the recognition you deserve —

while also coaching your employees and providing feedback on their

performance, says McDowell. It’s a balancing act. She advises taking a

Goldilocks approach. If the issues that consume your day are too small,

you’re being too tactical and are likely interfering. If they’re too big,

you’re not connected to what’s occurring on the front line. “But when

they’re just right you’ll have a pulse for what’s happening on the ground

and you’re able to spend time on longer term strategic priorities and on

mentoring your teams.”

Be mindful of your tone and persona — especially when it comes to how

you interact with your team, says Gupta. “A lot of bosses are good at

managing up but not managing down,” he says. “You don’t have to be

selﬂess, but if your direct reports sense you care more about your own

advancement that’s going to hurt you in the long run.”

# Connect and offer support

The more direct reports you have, the harder it is to give each of them

personal attention. Yes, you’re stretched thin and you’ve got a lot on

your plate, but when you come across as too busy for your employees,

you make them feel as if they don’t matter. “If your subordinates think

you’re too busy for them, you’ll lose your grip and your ability to lead,”

says Gupta. Instead, “you want them to feel that you have time and

energy for them and that you have their back.”

When you’re one-on-one with team members, give them your full

attention. Put away your phone and ignore your notiﬁcations, so you

can be fully present. Celebrate their victories and successes. “Let them

know they’re valued,” he says. McDowell recommends seeking out

development opportunities for people on your team who want to move

ahead. In particular, look for two-for-one opportunities that both help

them grow and free up some of your time. “You’ll get work done that’s

important to the organization and create visibilty for your up and

# comers.”

Think twice before asking for fewer reports

When you’re feeling stressed or overwhelmed, it’s tempting to ask for

fewer direct reports, but it’s important to think through the potential

risks of making that request. “It could send the wrong message to

management,” says Gupta. You might be seen as wanting to step back

from your responsibilities or as incapable of shouldering them, which

could have unintended consequences for your career trajectory, he says.

However, if you can demonstrate that the size of your team is too big for

the kind of work you’re doing or that it poses risks to the organization

— for instance, a nurse with dozens of direct reports — you should “feel

empowered to escalate” the issue, says McDowell. “Articulate what the

challenge is, why change is needed, and oﬀer solutions.”

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Give your team members as much decision-making autonomy as

possible. They develop skills and initiative, and you get time to focus

# on the big picture.

- Leverage the power of groups. Teams need a culture that encourages

everyone to hold each other accountable as well as where people learn

# from one another.

- Be mindful of your interactions with your team; if your direct reports

sense you care more about your own advancement, it will undermine

# your leadership.

# Don’t

- Micromanage — it sabotages people’s motivation. Instead, oﬀer

guidance and support when your team members ask for it.

- Act too busy for your employees — it’s alienating. Instead, be present

and engaged with your team members and oﬀer your support.

- Be too quick to ask for fewer direct reports. It could send the wrong

message about your commitment to your role, and it might impact
