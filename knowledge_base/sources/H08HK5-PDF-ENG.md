## Imagine this scenario: in response to ﬁnancial pressures, your

company has been going through a series of downsizing rounds. With

each round, a larger number of employees on your team are impacted.

Team morale is at an all-time low and you can tell everyone is on

edge. In this latest round, you are tasked with laying oﬀ half your

team, including one employee who recently bought their ﬁrst home

and another employee who is currently on maternity leave. You are

tossing and turning the night before and cannot sleep due to the ﬂood

of negative emotions you have about these upcoming conversations.

You receive a message from your boss asking if you’re ready for the

conversations the next day. You tell your boss that it has been really diﬃcult having these conversations every few weeks and you’re really

not looking forward to doing it yet again, especially considering the

circumstances of the employees on your team. What should your boss

say to you in this moment?

According to our recently published research, the most skillful thing

your boss could do is to express genuine gratitude to you in advance

of this unpleasant task. In a series of studies, we analyzed four years’

worth of emails and conducted interviews with employees in the

## intensive care units (ICUs) of a top-ranked U.S. medical center. We then

## ran two experiments with more than 600 online gig workers across

multiple industries. Our ﬁnding: when you express gratitude to others

before they engage in a distressing task it helps counteract some of

the negative emotions associated with the task. Expressing gratitude early also makes employees more likely to persist through diﬃculty and

bounce back and be resilient following failure.

Our ﬁndings oﬀer insight into ways to provide meaningful gratitude

and create a culture where your employees feel their work is seen,

supported, and valued.

# The Need for Gratitude

Even under the best of circumstances, people yearn to receive gratitude

from their bosses. In a survey of 2,000 employees, 70% reported that

they would feel better about themselves if their boss were more grateful,

and 81% said that they would work harder for a grateful boss. This

research also shows a “gratitude gap”: While employees wish for more

gratitude at work (a place where most of us spend nearly a third of

our lives), they are more likely to receive gratitude almost anywhere

else. Genuine gratitude at work is surprisingly rare, especially from

those in power, and when times are tough.

Despite this, the importance of expressing and receiving gratitude in

the workplace is evident, and some companies have endeavored to

cultivate a culture of gratitude. This has included eﬀorts like launching

Slack channels dedicated to #gratitude or #kudos, and other workplace

mechanisms to encourage inter-employee gratitude for helpful actions

that they’ve taken to further the goals of the business.

According to our research, however, thanking people after they engage

in their tasks does not provoke the same resilience and perseverance as

expressing gratitude before the task begins.

In our initial study, we set out to explore the emotions that employees

experience in high-stress work environments. After examining four

years of employee emails and then interviewing employees at a top

hospital’s ICUs, we found that many employees expressed gratitude

before a colleague took on a challenging task or shift, and that when

they did so it helped the colleague feel more socially connected and

purposeful—and be more resilient and persistent if problems arose.

To further explore the eﬀects of gratitude and its timing, we conducted

two follow-up experiments with U.S. online gig workers. In the ﬁrst,

331 participants were thanked either before or after working on an

unsolvable word-association puzzle. Those who were thanked before

the task reported greater feelings of social worth and willingness to

continue with additional tasks even after failure compared to the group

that was thanked after the experiment.

In the second study we gave 330 new subjects solvable but diﬃcult

geometric puzzles and tested the eﬀects of other positive sentiments,

like hope. Expressing gratitude in advance, we found, was signiﬁcantly associated with social worth, while hope in advance of the diﬃcult task

was unrelated to social worth. Oﬀering gratitude in advance, unlike

other mechanisms we tested, helped counteract the negative emotions

caused by challenging tasks by increasing participants’ feelings of social

worth. Increasing people’s sense of social impact, for example, did not

have this emotionally regulating eﬀect.

# How to Show Thankfulness Meaningfully

Imagine again our earlier scenario when we asked you to imagine you

were tasked with alerting colleagues about layoﬀs. The most tactful

thing your boss could do is to express their genuine gratitude before you begin. Something as simple as, “Thank you for taking on this diﬃcult

task. I understand how unpleasant this is and appreciate you taking this

responsibility so seriously.” Our research found this “thanks in advance”

expression of gratitude works by helping to down regulate the negative emotions associated with the diﬃcult task before it actually occurs and encourages you to stick with it, despite it being extremely diﬃcult and

# unpleasant.

Instead of being a meaningless phrase used to sign oﬀ on an email or

a sentiment that is only expressed after the fact, our research suggests

that intentionally expressing gratitude in advance of a distressing or diﬃcult task may favorably inﬂuence employee behavior. To do so

eﬀectively, our research suggests these four steps can make a diﬀerence:

- 1. Anticipate distress, difﬁculty, and unpleasant emotions. The ﬁrst

step, and most important, is the anticipation of an employee’s experience of distress, diﬃculty, or unpleasant emotions (e.g., anxiety,

frustration). This requires not only being aware of what is going on

in the moment, but also what is likely to happen in the future. Try

to take on the perspective of your employee: what about what they’re being asked to do might be painful or diﬃcult? This awareness and

anticipation can come from a number of places, including your own

prior experience and knowledge that the task ahead will be unpleasant,

the other person’s prior experience the last time they had to engage

in the task (in our example, having layoﬀ conversations), or something

that the other person shares with you directly (e.g., “I’m really dreading

these layoﬀ conversations on Friday”). Rather than hoping it won’t be

that big of a deal, invalidating, or trivializing the situation, you can use

this information to take prescient, preemptive action.

- 2. Show genuine gratitude. Before the employee goes into a diﬃcult

and distressing situation, express genuine gratitude to them. In order

for this expression of gratitude to be eﬀective, it needs to include a

number of features, including being speciﬁcally tailored to the person

## and non-generic, of appropriate intensity, and not too over the top

given the current situation and nature of the relationship—inauthentic

gratitude will not yield desired results. It’s also important to use words

that explicitly describe why the employee’s behavior matters and is

impactful. In expressing genuine gratitude, you should remind the employee that their behavior—even though the situation is diﬃcult

and distressing—has a positive impact in furthering the group or

organization’s goals, and that their contributions are truly valued by

the team and organization. Our research ﬁnds that expressing gratitude

(anticipatory or otherwise) has a positive eﬀect on employees’ sense of

collective social worth, and detailing how it beneﬁts the team can help

# reiterate it.

- 3. Check in after the situation. Check in with the employee after the

situation has concluded. While anticipatory expressions of gratitude

serve an important emotion regulatory function that buﬀers the

negative experience, “thanks in advance,” no matter how heartfelt, does

not completely eliminate the negative emotional experience. Prompt

## the employee with open-ended questions such as, “Tell me about how

it went,” “How are you feeling now?” or “How can I best support you?”

Additionally, these conversations can help you to better understand

your employee, what the pain points of their position are, and can help

improve your ability to provide proactive gratefulness in the future, as

you’ll better understand what about a task makes it most challenging. If

necessary, repeat your genuine expression of gratitude to the employee

after the event. A little gratitude repetition never hurts, especially for

employees who seldom hear it at work.

- 4. Cultivate a culture of gratitude. Our ﬁndings suggest that gratitude

in advance is successful in part because it makes people feel a strong

sense of collective social worth. They believe they are a valued part

of the team and that their contributions to this team are meaningful, even when the tasks are diﬃcult. While it’s important for managers

to give gratitude in advance, supervisors should also encourage their

team to liberally extend gratitude amongst themselves; for example,

expressing genuine gratitude to other team members when they embark

## on a project or new initiative together, or when one team member

does something helpful for another team member. And don’t forget

to express gratitude upwards to supervisors (a new spin on what some

refer to as “managing up” or “caring for the caregivers”). This is likely

to create an even stronger sense of connectedness throughout the

organization, which could further boost employees’ resilience should

they meet obstacles along the way.

According to Gallup’s Global Emotions report, negative emotions are

higher today than they were a decade ago. There’s a lot about work that can be diﬃcult and distressing, and this can contribute to the general

dread that many employees feel about their work, not just on Sunday

night. While many of these challenges cannot be immediately solved,

they can be assessed and acknowledged in advance. One of the most

meaningful ways to acknowledge others’ eﬀorts is to not wait until after

the fact, but to anticipate it. A little “thanks in advance” can go a long

# way.
