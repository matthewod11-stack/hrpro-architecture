Leading the company was never Julie’s* career aspiration. A longtime

employee of an advertising ﬁrm, she’d grown signiﬁcant management

skills and felt conﬁdent within her high-proﬁle operations roles. But

when the board’s external hire for the top job could not adapt to the

company’s unique culture and pace, the chair turned to Julie to step up.

Being promoted to lead after your predecessor fails is often anything

but a victory lap. In fact, a 10-year longitudinal research project on

executive transitions by consulting ﬁrm Navalent found that more than

50% of executives who “inherit a mess” fail within their ﬁrst 18 months

# on the job.

As executive coaches to seasoned leaders, we’ve worked with many who

have rapidly stepped into top roles. Succeeding after your predecessor

fails demands an entirely diﬀerent leadership approach.

Prepare to be surprised.

Time and again, we’ve seen that when an internal leader is promoted to

replace a failed predecessor, the situation is always more broken than

they knew.

Just a week into her new role, Julie was stunned to see ﬁnancial data

she hadn’t been exposed to in her previous position. She was caught

oﬀ guard as trusted relationships began to shift and key business

infrastructure she once believed was solid proved unstable. As she

conﬁded in one of us (Darcy), she feared that the role’s demands

might be beyond her capabilities and that failure could have lasting

# consequences for her career.

In the best of times, leading at senior levels requires a degree of mental

fortitude and emotional labor. Preparing yourself that the state of the

business, culture and operations is likely worse than you already know

will help you remain steady as the truth unfolds.

# Accelerate reflection.

Many times, we’ve found that organizations in trouble haven’t invested

the time to step back and examine the assumptions and beliefs that

created the problems they see today. Getting to a well-rounded picture

of the issues—and publicly acknowledging them—can help streamline

action plans and move faster. Ask yourself:

- What’s broken in the system that my predecessor could not ﬁx?

- Do we have a competency issue, a communication issue, or a control

# issue?

- If we were starting over, free of past assumptions, how would we

# approach things today?

- What stakeholders need to hear from me more often?

- How much time do I have before a small ﬁre becomes a crisis?

- What internal and external support do I need to make sure I meet my

goals while serving the broader organization’s goals?

# Don’t delegate—dig in.

When faced with a business challenge, executive leaders are commonly

advised to delegate. However, a turnaround demands that leaders dive

in, apply their experience and judgement, and restore conﬁdence so

that what they eventually delegate is aligned with where they need to

go.

John*, a newly promoted bank COO who one of us (Jordan) coached,

was astounded at how much was broken in the organization he

inherited. With the clock ticking to ﬁx major problems, it was clear

that his 30,000-foot leadership style was not going to work. Instead,

he took the reins and interviewed people deep into the organization to

understand core bottlenecks and operational issues. As a result, he let

several leaders go and tightly managed hiring and retention until he saw

evidence that critical issues were repaired. After that, he shifted back to

a strategic leadership style and built a team that could execute the work

in the newly improved frameworks.

Be honest in communicating what needs fixing and where you’re going.

When a failed leader departs, people are naturally nervous about what’s

next. They wonder whether the ship can be righted, or whether the

situation is beyond repair.

To retain your best employees amid this uncertainty, you’ll need to

transparently acknowledge the current state of the business and share

## your vision for an inspiring yet believable future state.

- Don’t blame your predecessor. Though it may be tempting to

express frustration about the previous leader, you’ll lose credibility

and damage trust with your team. Stay focused on moving forward and

## vent to external conﬁdants, mentors, or an executive coach when you

# need to.

- Use the power of “and.” The word “and” allows us to align two

seemingly separate thoughts: Things are diﬃcult, and things will be

okay. For example, your recovery story may be “Our business results

have been dropping over the last year and we now have an excellent

plan to turn things around. I’m looking forward to celebrating with you

# at the end of the year.”

- Don’t be afraid to repeat yourself. During diﬃcult times, people

need to hear your core message many, many times to believe it’s true.

Repetition creates consistency and helps people build trust with the

new direction. Resist getting bored with your own words and changing

them up. One CEO Jordan coached posted his three core messages on

his phone to remind him to repeat them in every situation. And one of

Darcy’s clients set up multiple notiﬁcations during the day to keep the

core message top of mind—and to reinforce his own belief that they’d

reach the goals.

Make sure your team is having the right conversations.

Before she unexpectedly became CEO, Julie sat on her senior leadership

team. So how was she so out of the loop about the company’s dire

# situation?

After a few months of reﬂection, Julie realized that the so-called

leadership “team” was not a team at all, but a siloed collection of

individual leaders. “Leadership meetings” had become recitations of

each person’s to-do list, rather than a collective taking action on the

## ﬁrm’s biggest goals, threats and opportunities.

To counter this, Julie instituted a set of facilitated quarterly oﬀsite

meetings intentionally designed to connect her leaders to a set of

broader company challenges—and to connect them to each other. By

providing this space to tackle strategic issues, her team came together

and began to own the success of the business as a whole.

In addition to strong team collaboration, it’s always critical to ensure

you have the right leaders in the seats to participate in strategic

conversations. If sub-par performance has been tolerated, even in just

one part of the business, the organization will not function at its best. If

leadership changes need to be made, make them quickly.

Be patient with yourself.

When John stepped into the COO role, he set a goal to meet with

## employees across every part of the business within his ﬁrst 90 days.

It seemed like a strong plan, but within the ﬁrst month, urgent crises

demanded his attention. Determined to stick to his schedule, he pushed

himself to the brink, losing sleep and becoming exhausted.

It can be tempting to try to address every glaring issue all at once,

but that just isn’t possible. Organizational breakdowns didn’t happen

in a day; they can’t be ﬁxed in a day. We both have seen ambitious

and well-intentioned leaders expect too much of themselves, being

unrealistic with their own capacity. Following a failed leader is hard,

and the last thing the company needs is for you to fail, too. Self-care is

a leadership must, scheduled into the overall plan rather than treated as

# an afterthought.

. . .

Julie and John are just two examples of leaders who successfully

used these strategies after stepping into roles previously held by failed

predecessors. However, many others struggle—some remain stuck,

prolonging their challenges, while others are replaced by frustrated

boards. Worse still, some burn out quickly in what was supposed to be

# their dream job.

These outcomes are avoidable. By embracing the above practices,

leaders can navigate transitions more eﬀectively and get their

# organizations back on track for good.
