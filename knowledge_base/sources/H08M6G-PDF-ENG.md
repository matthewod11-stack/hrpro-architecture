Diverse teams hold diverse perspectives. That’s a given. But are they

willing to share those perspectives? We often observe highly diverse

teams exhibiting patterns of dutiful compliance and stiﬂing groupthink.

How do you change that culture? How do you persuade a team to unlock

its novel, nonlinear, and clashing perspectives to create an incubator

of innovation — and do it in a way that doesn’t result in hard feelings,

anger, or disrespect?

Think about the anatomy of culture this way: If a pattern of shared

behavior is a norm, a collection of norms is a culture. Norms

are the primary building blocks of culture. In working with teams

around the world for the last 30 years, we’ve identiﬁed the norm

## of constructive dissent as the single most important predictor of a

team’s ability to innovate. Constructive dissent is simply a team’s

ability to engage respectfully in the exchange of conﬂicting viewpoints.

While constructive dissent is a learnable behavior, it’s an extremely

diﬃcult norm to develop. It taxes the poise, composure, and emotional

## regulation of team members and often results in intense negative

# emotion and defensiveness.

Teams don’t slouch into a pattern of constructive dissent, but with

deliberate practice they can build and sustain this crucial norm. Here

are eight practical ways to nurture constructive dissent and release your

# team’s full innovative potential:

- 1. Make constructive dissent an explicit goal.

One executive team we worked with had a culture of destructive

dissent: When executives clashed intellectually, they would invariably

clash personally. Because of the destructive nature of their dissent,

they demonstrated a pattern of long periods of superﬁcial collegiality

punctuated with episodes of intense interpersonal conﬂict.

When the CEO called attention to this pattern and said he wanted to

pursue constructive dissent as a goal, there were snickers and sarcasm.

But over time the goal created a new level of peer-based accountability.

The team gradually enforced its own pattern of equal participation

by asking questions, ensuring everyone got a chance to speak, and

listening with the intent of comprehending instead of responding.

They were able to share their opinions more honestly and refrain from

## personal attacks and emotional escalation.

- 2. Establish ground rules and get commitment.

When a team fails to deﬁne its ground rules and terms of engagement,

that lingering ambiguity creates license for individuals to engage in

destructive dissent. You don’t necessarily have to codify the rules

of engagement; many teams develop constructive dissent as a norm

without any kind of documentation. But the teams that do it best

consistently reinforce behavioral expectations.

For example, one team we worked with reinforced ground rules that

included the prohibition of personal attacks, the obligation of respect in

## both verbal and nonverbal communication, and an insistence on good

faith. Another team emphasized avoiding pride of authorship, taking

a time-out if the team begins to generate more heat than light, and a

willingness to suspend judgment about why something might not work

until there’s an opportunity to prototype and test. Once the ground

rules have been established, ask each member of the team to commit to

following them.

- 3. Follow the four-step process of constructive dissent.

Eﬀective constructive dissent follows the following four-step process:

- 1. Generation: Generate ideas, options, and solutions without

# judgment, analysis, or critique.

- 2. Clariﬁcation: Clarify assumptions, logic, evidence, conditions, and

limitations. Demonstrate curiosity through listening and asking

# questions.

- 3. Friction: Challenge ideas, options, and solutions to either improve

or disqualify them. This is where ideas sometimes collide. (As

management consultant pioneer Mary Parker Follett said in the early

20th century, “All polishing is done by friction.”)

- 4. Selection: Select the most promising ideas, options, or solutions for

# further analysis.

When we lay out the above sequence most team members immediately

grasp the paradox of constructive dissent — that it’s vital for unleashing

innovation and yet hard to establish as a prevailing norm.

As we help teams shape constructive dissent into a team norm, we

encourage them to signpost each of the steps as they move through

them. For example, when a team begins a formal session of constructive

dissent, a team member might say something like, “Let’s start with step

one, generation. What ideas do we have?” Once generation is complete,

the team member might announce, “Ok, if we’re done with generation,

let’s move into step two, clariﬁcation. What evidence do we have to

support these ideas?” After the members of the team have exhausted

all pertinent clarifying questions, a team member will signpost the

third step by saying, “I think we’re ready to move into friction. Let’s

challenge the ideas we’ve identiﬁed.” Finally, once all challenges and

contrary points of view have been considered, the team member can

say, “Great, let’s move to the last step of selection. Which of the ideas

we’ve discussed have real potential and should be considered for further

analysis and testing?”

We’ve been amazed at how distinguishing the steps and signposting as they move through them helps teams self-regulate more eﬀectively and

# improves group dynamics.

- 4. Explain how innovation happens at the intersections.

Innovation is typically cross-functional in nature. But often, no one

owns the intersections between functions, nor is anyone an expert

on every intersection, making these environments fertile ground for

dissent and disagreement. When you point this out to your employees,

that knowledge alone can be both humbling and empowering,

motivating them to take a more collaborative approach. As a result,

team members tend to naturally relinquish a mindset of sole authorship

# for one of joint ownership.

For example, one leader we worked with asked their team members to

point out the boundaries of their domain expertise. It was a vulnerable

act that acknowledged the need for collaboration and invited the team

to engage respectfully at the intersections. And another client’s sales

organization would routinely exclude the design and delivery team

from the initial part of sales negotiations, often overpromising delivery

and underestimating costs. After listening to each other’s concerns

and working together at the intersection of the two functions, they

increased the level of innovation in their designs, reduced their delivery

time, and increased both proﬁtability and customer satisfaction levels

# signiﬁcantly.

- 5. Cultivate deep trust and tolerance for candor.

When team members develop deeper personal connections with each other, they tend to gain the courage to speak their minds and oﬀer

unvarnished feedback. Deep trust between colleagues gives them

positive predictability concerning the motives and behaviors of others,

which helps them develop a high tolerance for candor and encourages

them to engage in vulnerable acts of idea generation and clariﬁcation.

Dissent is almost always more easily accepted when fueled by pure

# motives.

One team we saw do this eﬀectively assigned team members to

interview each other using a standard interview protocol with a set

of penetrating questions that quickly moved the relationship from

aﬃliation to something more personal. They assigned team members

to eat lunch with each other on a rotating basis while conducting the

interviews. This practice worked against the natural tendency to split

into groups based on natural aﬃnity.

- 6. Use assigned roles to practice constructive dissent.

Creating constructive dissent as a norm takes more than

encouragement — it also requires practice and accountability. As a ﬁrst

step, you might assign certain members of your team to promote a

contrary point of view once an idea has been shared. As a second step, after diﬀerent points of view have been shared, you might then assign

team members to champion each other’s views.

Another eﬀective exercise is to share an idea publicly and then

challenge your own idea. After modeling that process, have each

member of the team do the same thing: Generate an idea, share the

idea with the team, and then challenge their own idea.

- 7. Lead with inquiry.

In working with teams across demographic and cultural lines, we see a

consistent pattern: When a team member directly rejects or contradicts

another’s point of view, constructive dissent is immediately put at

risk. In team interactions, we call direct and unsympathetic forms of

disagreement “head-on collisions.” Even when team members try to be

## objective and avoid personal criticism, head-on collisions almost always

arouse strong emotions and may provoke defensiveness. The harder the

intellectual collision, the more likely the parties will react with strong

emotions, potentially intentionally or unintentionally sabotaging the eﬀort.

Instead of clashing directly with another person’s point of view, engage

in what we call “soft angle” dissent by leading with inquiry. Use

# questions like:

- Why do you feel that way?

- Have you ever considered such and such? Would you consider another

way to look at this?

- May I share my experience, which may be a little diﬀerent? • If I walk you through a diﬀerent approach, would you tell me what you think?

Finally, always show good faith, and keep in mind how team members

act around an individual who relishes their reputation as a contrarian.

For example, in one traditional manufacturing organization we worked

with, a highly experienced and overbearing individual took on the

self-appointed role of devil’s advocate for any divergent idea that was

suggested. Over time, colleagues and direct reports stopped generating ideas, but for diﬀerent reasons. Highly competent employees found the contrarian behavior oﬀ-putting and a frustrating waste of time. Newer

and less-conﬁdent employees found the behavior intimidating and fear-

inducing. In both cases, employees withdrew, removing themselves

# from the process.

- 8. Model the behavior you want to see from your team.

If you’re the leader of a team, remember that team members learn

primarily from your modeling behavior, through observation and

imitation. Positional power is both an asset and a liability. Be the ﬁrst

mover in the generation of ideas and the last mover in the collision of

# ideas.

Taking charge in a traditional autocratic sense will cause your team

to retrench into self-preservation. Keep in mind that between step 1,

generation and step 3, friction is step 2, clariﬁcation. This is the step

of curiosity, inquiry, and discovery. Model this step carefully. To set an

appropriate tone and pace at the start of constructive dissent, use your

voice wisely and sparingly, then draw conclusions from the results and

set direction for the next steps.

. . .

Unlocking innovation from diverse perspectives is the essence of

constructive dissent. As a norm, or pattern of shared behavior, it

## brings together creative abrasion, social collaboration, and emotional

regulation. If a team can’t ﬁnd a way to engage in constructive dissent,

it will default to preserving the status quo. But if it can, that norm will

unleash the team’s innovative capability.
