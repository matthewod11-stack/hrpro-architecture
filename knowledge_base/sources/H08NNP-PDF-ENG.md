In his short story “The Evitable Conﬂict,” published 75 years ago,

sci-ﬁ writer Isaac Asimov described how machines might run entire

industries. Today, there is mounting evidence that AI can outperform

humans on many individual cognitive tasks. An experiment by a team

from Cambridge University suggests that large language models (LLMs)

can outperform humans in most tasks including product design, cost

# control, and market intelligence.

Impressive though such results are, the studies we are aware of have

all been conducted under artiﬁcial laboratory conditions. Extrapolating

these to real-world conditions is far from straightforward. Executives in

the wild face unframed and shifting challenges, often with insuﬃcient

or inaccurate data.

We wanted to understand: What happens if we take AI out of the lab

into a real company? Over the past year we joined a series of executive

team meetings at Giesswein, an $85 million revenue company based in

Austria, that sells organic, eco-friendly wool sneakers. Our idea was to experiment with diﬀerent ways of integrating AI into their executive

meetings to understand what works and how.

# AI in the Boardroom

Our engagement with Giesswein started in October 2023. We designed three types of interventions and conducted at least two diﬀerent

variations of each to test for replicability. After each intervention, we

conducted follow-up interviews with the two brothers who run the family ﬁrm to gather their perceptions of eﬀectiveness.

The interventions happened during a period when the executive team

decided to make several big strategic moves, allowing us to see AI

at work when the future of the ﬁrm was being forged. The ﬁrm

had decided to outsource production entirely, closing down their

longstanding manufacturing facilities in Austria and transforming them

into a logistics hub. They also decided to sell a sewing factory in

Slovakia and to enter the U.S. market.

Our ﬁrst type of intervention was to over the course of several meetings

simply feed the agenda of the executive team into ChatGPT 4.0 asking

for suggestions on which questions and issues to discuss. The output

was shared with the team during the meeting as each of the agenda

points came up. We also developed prompts to create more speciﬁc

recommendations. For example, when the question of outsourcing was

on the agenda we asked for pro and con arguments. We knew that the

company was already outsourcing some production to China, so we

asked ChatGPT to explore what the company needed to keep in mind

if it wanted to outsource all production. The output was then shared

# during the executive meeting.

In a second type of intervention, we wrote prompts related to points

discussed by the executives during the meeting and then shared the

output. For example, one potential deciding factor in the outsourcing

decision was the underutilization of the production line, which made

ﬁxed costs more of an issue. As we were discussing this live, we

asked ChatGPT to generate a list of alternative products that could be

launched using the same material the ﬁrm already produced. Among

a list of suggestions were woollen blankets, an idea the executives had

previously discussed as well.

A third type of intervention was conducted after executive team

meetings with ChatGPT answering speciﬁc questions the management

team had, for example in regards to market entry options in the U.S.

We tried two versions of this: In the ﬁrst, we engaged in a prolonged

conversation with ChatGPT using our own judgement to guide the AI

tool. In a second version we simply asked executives’ questions without

# further interpretation or iteration.

# Augmentation not Substitution

Overall, our executive board experiments showed that AI could indeed

be valuable in guiding and enriching executive discussions, but only

with actively engaged management.

The unsupervised use of AI did not work well, providing output that was

not speciﬁc enough for the executives to ﬁnd it useful. The suggestions

we received based on simply inputting the agenda or executives’

questions were perceived as commonplace, unsurprising, or clichéd.

In contrast, the supervised applications, augmented by the abilities of a

## human advisor with no special knowledge of the ﬁrm but experience

in developing strategies, was perceived as highly beneﬁcial by the

executives. We observed three speciﬁc implications:

- 1. Ungainliness advantage

It seems counterintuitive, but the biggest advantage of ChatGPT

was disrupting the natural ﬂow of the meetings. We expected the

clumsiness, awkwardness, and delay it introduced to be a major

irritation, but the executives appreciated how it made them stop and

# think.

The team was aware that after decades of working together they were

strongly aligned on many issues and could almost complete each

other’s sentences. They were also aware that their shared experience

and well-rehearsed routines naturally created blind spots. As CEO

Markus Giesswein told us, he agreed to this experiment as he expected

“balanced and structured support, because many decisions in our size

range are made based on gut feeling and emotions.”

ChatGPT’s tendency to give comprehensive lists prompted the team to

consider options they might not have considered, but the real value lay

in the breaking and slowing down of existing patterns of thought and

interaction, enabling the discussion of new elements.

This was most obvious during the discussion over whether they should

close their manufacturing facilities. This was a highly emotional

## consideration for themselves, their employees, and their external

stakeholders, as the plant was located at the company’s headquarters

for more than 50 years. AI helped them to have a more complete, fact-

based, and nuanced discussion.

- 2. Completeness illusion

The breadth of LLM suggestions also had a downside. As the team got

used to the tool pointing them to issues they otherwise would miss, we

observed an emerging reliance on it in order to not overlook anything of

# importance.

For example, in one of the meetings there was a discussion of an upcoming announcement. ChatGPT oﬀered a wide set of factors that

needed to be addressed prior to the announcement, but it omitted

potential legal implications that needed to be considered. Under

usual circumstances, the executives might have brought up the legal

questions, but AI had created the illusion of infallible completeness,

which they had begun to rely on. In this instance, a solution was found

after the fact, but the issue could have easily been avoided with more

# challenge and reﬂection.

This is not the same as the more widely reported issue of hallucination.

AI introduced a welcome broadening of the meeting agenda but one

that was not complete and required critical thinking and challenge to

avoid missing important issues.

- 3. Speed and cost advantage

A ﬁnal set of advantages of bringing AI into these meetings were speed

and cost reduction. Boardroom discussions typically result in questions

that require further research. ChatGPT enabled the team to gather data

and make immediate recommendations, enabling quicker action.

For example, when Giesswein considered the future of the facility in

Slovakia, an important question that arose was the possible cost of

refurbishing the plant if they decided to keep it. ChatGPT was able

to provide rapid and accurate-enough estimations that enabled the

executives to move forward on this issue.

In some cases, the use of AI can also reduce the costs of further

exploration. For example, one of the decisions the team made required

them to issue a press release. In the past, they would have hired

an agency to write and issue the release, but ChatGPT produced a

statement that ﬁt their purpose. This beneﬁt was also apparent when we

engaged ChatGPT in the post-meeting analysis. For example, Giesswein

wanted input on its future product portfolio. ChatGPT generated ideas

and referred to examples from other companies, a task that otherwise

would require a consultant or taking up considerable management time

to create.

## A New Type of Interaction for Executive Teams

So far, much of the conversation on the value of generative AI has

focused on the accuracy of the information it provides. Our one-year

engagement at Giesswein suggests that the value lies elsewhere, namely

in the process of interaction itself. Executives are aware that the tool

will occasionally hallucinate; they are also accustomed to working with

# incomplete or faulty information.

What makes AI a valuable member of the executive team is that it is diﬀerent from humans. This disrupts and therefore broadens

the considerations—in some cases, providing information quickly to

move forward. But for this to work, it needs a human (a critical

thinker but not necessarily an industry expert) to operate the tool. The collective intelligence of the combination of humans and the tools oﬀers

# something new and exciting.
