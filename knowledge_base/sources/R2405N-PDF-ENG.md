You might be surprised to ﬁnd an article about psychedelics in a

business publication. Frankly, I didn’t expect to be writing about them

when I joined Harvard Business Review. But with founders and CEOs

## —such as Whole Foods’ John Mackey and Tesla’s Elon Musk—coming

## forward to credit ayahuasca, psilocybin, and more for their leadership

success, and some research suggesting that the use of LSD is rising

faster among managers than it is among nonmanagers, it’s time to open

# your mind.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Will Psychedelics Propel Your Career?

Psychedelics, which also include DMT, MDMA, peyote, 2C-B, and

salvia, have long been known to alter users’ thought processes,

perceptions, and sensations, often generating hallucinations. In the mid

20th century U.S. scientists eagerly explored their potential to treat

## mental ailments until 1970, when the Food and Drug Administration

declared them Schedule I substances, outlawing them even for medical

use. Today, however, in some two dozen states, there are eﬀorts to

legalize, decriminalize, and study psychedelics. And countries across

the Caribbean, South America, Europe, and Asia permit their use and

# sale.

Perusing the recent literature on these drugs, I hoped to ﬁnd a

consensus about their utility—not as party aids that give short bursts of

euphoria, or as eﬀective treatments for post-traumatic stress disorder,

## depression, addiction, and other conditions (which many scientists

believe they are), but as tools for businesspeople to unleash receptivity,

creativity, and enlightenment. Instead I found a diverse and sometimes

contentious array of opinions regarding what psychedelics can and

cannot do for us.

First, for a little history, let’s turn to Luminous, a series on psychedelics

## from Wisconsin Public Radio’s To the Best of Our Knowledge. In a

May 2024 episode the host, Steve Paulson, brought on the religious

scholar Brian Muraresku to discuss whether the ancient Greeks used

psychedelic wine to ﬁnd God. In previous episodes Paulson explored

## the long-standing use of psychoactive plant-based medicines among

## indigenous communities and 19th-century drug experimentation by

# Sigmund Freud and other psychoanalysts.

Luminous also investigates more-recent research and breakthroughs,

with Paulson interviewing a slew of experts and advocates in the

space, including the neuroscientist Gül Dölen; the director of the Usona

Institute, Bill Linton; and the rocker Melissa Etheridge, who, following

the death of her son from an opioid overdose, became an advocate for

psychedelic therapy to treat addiction.

Like Etheridge, Joanna Kempner, a sociologist, believes that

psychedelics can help save lives, and not just in cases of addiction and

## mental illness. In Psychedelic Outlaws: The Movement Revolutionizing

Modern Medicine, Kempner follows research into whether psilocybin

can relieve cluster headaches. The condition, known as “suicide

headaches” because they can last for weeks or even months, is

described by one study as more painful than stab wounds, kidney

stones, pancreatitis, or unmedicated labor. (Needless to say, work

becomes impossible for those suﬀering from it.) Connected online and

operating illegally, a network dubbed the Clusterbusters grew their

own magic mushrooms, developed their own treatment protocols, and

eventually drew the attention of researchers and policymakers. “The

internet provided the kind of safe, unregulated space…where drug

geeks could create their own repositories for the kinds of…information diﬃcult to obtain elsewhere,” Kempner writes.

Two other recent releases chronicle their authors’ own use of

psychedelics—and the fellow users they encountered on their journeys.

After all, this is a community that values lived experience as much as it

does scientiﬁc studies.

## In Have a Good Trip: Exploring the Magic Mushroom Experience, a

“book informed by trippers and their trip reports,” the nature and food

journalist Eugenia Bone recounts her ﬁrst experience with psilocybin,

which transformed how she perceived her own body; weaves in

research and stories about the power of psychedelics to treat mental

illness; and explains why she continues to use them in moderation.

“I credit microdosing with helping me learn what it feels like when

I am my authentic self, dialed in to the moment, compassionate and

attentive,” she writes. “Now, when I start to overthink or sputter bullshit

—behaviors I believe are rooted in anxiety—I can feel it coming.”

## Another ﬁrsthand account of the transformative beneﬁts of these drugs

can be found in Trippy: The Peril and Promise of Medicinal Psychedelics,

by the journalist Ernesto Londoño, who has worked as an international

## correspondent and as Brazil bureau chief for the New York Times.

He writes that despite his thriving career, he fell into a deep clinical

depression. Initially skeptical about psychedelics, he ﬁnally decided

to try an ayahuasca retreat; he details how it, and subsequent ones,

changed his life for the better. He also investigates the origins of the

drug’s use in the Amazon and discovers that although ayahuasca is sold

as a shortcut to happiness, some indigenous communities believe it

opens a universe where one can access both good and evil energy.

The book I found that most clearly links psychedelics to careers was

## More! The Microdose Diet: The 90 Day Plan for More Success, Passion

## and Happiness, by the former tech and ﬁnance executive and venture

capitalist Peggy Van de Plassche, who claims that despite years of

professional achievement, she was able to ﬁnd true fulﬁllment only

through a combination of journaling, tapping (an anxiety-reducing

technique whereby one taps on parts of the body while holding or

releasing certain thoughts and feelings), visualization, meditation, and

small doses of psychedelics. Hoping that others will follow her lead,

she oﬀers a step-by-step guide. “Since using this regimen myself, I have

never experienced so much ease, freedom and success in my life,” Van

de Plassche writes. “I now let my unconscious mind do the work and

it comes up with way better and faster solutions than I could have

consciously.”

All these books made me ask: Should I take psychedelics to reach

my fullest potential? Although the medical application is compelling,

I’m not convinced that ’shrooms, acid, or ecstasy will bring me mind-

blowing corporate success. Plus, these drugs are still illegal in many

countries and in at least 26 U.S. states, including the one where I live.

But you should decide for yourself: Do you want to take a trip?
