Once, during a workshop, I asked people to close their eyes and

recall where they were when they had their best ideas. Over 80% of

participants said they were in the shower, in bed, jogging, or playing

with their children — anywhere but work. Out of 15,000 people, not

a single person said they get their best ideas on the job. This isn’t a

coincidence; it’s a symptom of how traditional work environments stiﬂe

In fact, a 2023 study found that fun at work had a positive correlation

to creative behavior. Playful leaders inspired their teams to come up

with more original ideas and were more likely to create a positive work

environment. Consider the most creative people: children. What do

children do better than anyone else? They play.

To overcome creative blocks for yourself and your teams, you should

# start with a playful mindset.

# How Play Affects the Brain

Research shows that creativity often involves a dance between the

## brain’s cognitive control network — responsible for planning and

problem-solving — and the default mode network, which lights up

during mind-wandering or daydreaming. In fact, studies with creative

writers and physicists reveal that about a ﬁfth of their most important

ideas occur when they’re mind-wandering, not focused on a speciﬁc

task. This is why spending time in nature or simply gazing out of

a window can enhance creativity; these activities allow the mind

to wander freely, something a typical cubicle-bound workday rarely

# permits.

Think about the last argument you had. As you walked away, what

popped into your head? The perfect comeback, right? But why didn’t it

come to you in the heat of the moment? Because during the argument,

your brain was in overdrive, defending itself. At work, our brains are

similarly overloaded with emails, meetings, reports, training, and so

on. We often don’t have time to think. This is because our brains are

stuck in what science calls the beta state — a state of constant busyness

where creativity is blocked. When you’re in beta, the door between your

conscious and subconscious mind is shut.

By contrast, the alpha and theta states, characterized by slower brain

activity and greater mental relaxation, open that door. When you’re

in an alpha state, perhaps resting after completing a task or taking a

break to meditate, your mind is more receptive to creative ideas. When

you’re in a theta state, you’re likely daydreaming, taking a long drive, or

jogging. In this state, your mind is free to wander, allowing ideas to ﬂow

without censorship or overthinking. This is why those “aha” moments

often occur in the shower, during a walk, or even while brushing your

hair — activities that naturally put you in an alpha or theta state where

creativity thrives. The key to making the jump from beta to alpha or

# theta? Playfulness.

How do we shift from this busy state of mind to a more creative one?

Here are some practical methods to infuse play into your workplace and

# unlock creativity:

- 1. Introduce short, playful activities.

Integrating play into the workplace through quick, silly exercises can

profoundly enhance creativity and innovation. I call them “energizers”:

short, playful activities such as drawing exercises or role-playing games

# that lead to laughter and creativity.

For example, having people draw someone they know without looking

at the paper can generate laughter and help shift participants from a

## busy, conscious brain state (beta) to a more relaxed and creative state

(alpha or theta). I call this exercise “Picasso”: I ask everyone if they think

they can draw like Picasso. No one raises their hand, but after they’re

done drawing without looking at the paper, they look down and see

that they have, in fact, drawn a Picasso-like picture. Laughter typically

# ensues.

The moment laughter is heard, it indicates that people in the room are a

little more relaxed. This state allows for more informed decision-making

while still enabling creative thought processes to ﬂourish. Research has

found that laughter can improve problem-solving by making it easier to

think broadly and ﬁnd connections between ideas.

Historically, innovators practiced activities that helped them access

their creativity. Thomas Edison would fall asleep with a holding a

ball in each hand to wake up with new ideas once he heard it

drop, highlighting the power of the subconscious mind. While this

might seem unconventional, it underscores the importance of creating

environments where employees can tap into their subconscious

# thoughts.

To encourage this kind of creativity in a modern workplace, consider

introducing simple nudges that prompt employees to take short breaks,

whether in person or remotely. For instance, a quick walk, a playful

## question during meetings, or even a ﬁve-minute mindfulness exercise

can help shift their brains into a more relaxed state, opening the door

to innovative thinking. By implementing these playful activities, you

can create a dynamic and engaging workplace where creativity thrives,

leading to breakthrough ideas and solutions.

- 2. Design physical spaces to encourage play.

Creating physical spaces to encourage play is crucial for boosting

creativity and innovation within the workplace. At Pixar, for instance,

Steve Jobs designed the campus around the concept of unplanned

## collaboration, with playful elements throughout the environment to

## promote creativity and spontaneous interactions between people who

wouldn’t normally meet. The campus’s central lobby houses all the

necessities — restaurants, coﬀee shops, merchandise stores, and more

— creating a hub where employees can meet serendipitously, sparking

conversations and new ideas. Speciﬁc rooms, like the one in which

Pixar’s BrainTrust meets to provide feedback on creative work, are

deliberately set aside and designed to signal that they’re safe spaces.

This deliberate playfulness has been integral to Pixar’s continuous

stream of groundbreaking ideas.

Organizations can mimic this model. Of course, not every company

can replicate Pixar’s extensive investment in a new campus, but the

principle can be scaled to ﬁt any budget. For example, transforming

## a boring meeting room into a “laboratory” or “greenhouse” with the

help of local art students can provide a physical signal that the

space is dedicated to nurturing ideas and fostering a playful mindset.

Additionally, organizations can introduce team-building practices

that encourage light-hearted, non-work-related conversations during

meetings. Set aside a few minutes at the start of each meeting for

team members to share something fun, like a favorite hobby or a recent

adventure. These brief moments of connection can help build rapport,

reduce stress, and create a more open and collaborative environment

where creativity can thrive.

- 3. Incorporate playfulness strategically.

Leaders should be intentional about when they use playful techniques,

ensuring they align with the needs of the team and the goals of the

activity. It should be seen as a tool to unlock creativity when needed,

not as a constant state or just a means to an end of greater productivity.

Remember that when you prioritize the well-being of your workforce,

you’ll have far better odds of accomplishing your team’s long-term

# goals.

For instance, it’s important to actually integrate the above suggestions

into routines and at the right junctures to make them habits. Integrating

short, playful breaks into the daily routine can shift employees’

## mindsets from the busy, conscious state of beta to the more relaxed

and creative state of alpha or theta. Additionally, if you’re running

a brainstorm or ideation session, begin with an energizer activity as

people enter the room or immediately after breaks to counteract the

return to a beta state caused by checking emails or other routine tasks.

This approach ensures that playfulness is used eﬀectively to move

between mental states. While life would be fun if we were playful

every minute of every day, productivity requires a balance. By being

intentional about when and how to integrate play, you can cultivate

an environment where employees regularly reach their most creative

states, driving innovation and success in the workplace.

# The Future of Work Is Playful

The cost of not integrating play into the workplace is a return to

business as usual, which is no longer viable in a post-pandemic world.

With 44% of employees surveyed by SHRM in 2024 saying they’re

burned out at work, maintaining a traditional work environment can

be detrimental to both morale and retention. We are now in an era of

business as unusual, where fostering creativity through play, comfort,

and psychological safety is not just beneﬁcial but essential for ongoing

innovation and success. Prioritizing these elements helps to reduce

stress and enhance employee well-being, making your organization

# more resilient and future-ready.

So, let’s pick up a playful mindset. The future of work depends on it.
