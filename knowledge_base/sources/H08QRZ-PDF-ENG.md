Companies can now accrue stunning amounts of intimate data about

their employees’ bodies. Some might collect biometric data such as

ﬁngerprints and retina scans as part of eﬀorts to improve security.

Others, such as Amazon, track and analyze workers’ movements

with artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)–embedded surveillance technologies to

promote safety and productivity in warehouses. Companies might even

go as far as collecting health data, incentivized by the desire to improve

the overall health of the workforce or get discounts on premiums

from health insurers. The technology that facilitates this collection has

gotten both better and cheaper in recent years. Wearables and mobile

devices can count steps, measure heart rates, and provide statistics on

sleeping habits. Through “behavioral biometrics,” cameras can identify

people based on their gait and posture, for instance, and analyze their

# behavior.

All of this data, the argument goes, can create a healthier, more eﬃcient

workforce, and safer, more secure places to work.

While it’s true these practices can beneﬁt organizations, too many

overlook the risks—to both their workers and themselves. However,

according to our forthcoming research, workers also report that this

kind of monitoring can make them feel insecure in their jobs and

harm their physical and mental health. Employee disengagement and

diminished productivity can more than erase any short-term gains.

Recent lawsuits show that the risks don’t end there. Last year,

BNSF Railway settled a $75 million class action lawsuit after tens of

thousands of its truckers argued that the company unlawfully scanned

and stored their ﬁngerprints, violating Illinois privacy laws. The Old

Dominion Freight Line, a truckload shipping company; Speedway, LLC,

## a convenience store and fuel station chain; and Meta Platforms all

settled similar claims that they collected and used the bodily data of

# employees without proper consent.

In this article, we provide guidance for employers to not only collect

such data ethically, but to better understand when not to do it. In

addition, we suggest ways for employees to navigate situations where

their employers require them to participate in bodily data gathering

# eﬀorts.

How intrusive biometric data collection makes employees feel less secure

In our forthcoming research, we primarily looked at how collecting

biometric, health, and other bodily data aﬀects employees’ feelings of

vulnerability and uncertainty regarding the future. “Job insecurity,” as

these feelings are called, is subjective—employees might worry about

## potential layoﬀs, restructuring, or changes in job roles even if no

formal actions have been announced. But job insecurity can have a

high psychological toll, leading to stress, anxiety, and decreased job

satisfaction. The constant worry can distract employees from their

work, lower morale, and reduce overall productivity. Managers may fail

to notice negative impacts on employees because their attention is too

focused on the positive goal of improving organizational metrics.

There are two ways that collecting this sensitive data can drive

these feelings. First, when employees feel a loss of control over their

intimate bodily data, they can feel that their long-term prospects

of gainful employment are threatened. For example, as part of

forthcoming research we conducted a study on U.S. health insurers’

practice of providing discounts to employers when employees agree to

comprehensive physical screenings. On the surface, this seems like a

win-win-win for the insurer, employer, and employees. The insights on

employee health help the insurer better manage their risk exposure,

the employer saves money and potentially sees more productivity, and

employees are encouraged to be proactive about preventative care.

Employees, however, didn’t always feel like they were getting a good

deal—or much of a choice. Those who felt coerced into sharing health

information said that it made them feel like they were giving up control

over their bodily autonomy. Those who didn’t share their personal

data worried they might be seen as not being a team player and

discriminated against as a result.

In some cases, employees organized to ﬁght back. After Yale University

took health data screenings to an extreme by penalizing employees

for not participating, employees ﬁled a federal lawsuit against the

university. The university recently agreed to a large settlement and a

commitment from the university to suspend the penalty for at least four

years. In 2014, Honeywell was sued for mandating that employees and

their spouses participate in health-data collection and screening, or face

## hefty penalties of up to $4,000 annually.

Second, the perceived loss of job autonomy can make employees feel

less secure. After a large sanitation products wholesaler in Ontario,

Canada introduced video surveillance systems to promote safety and

optimize walking routes, warehouse workers told us that they felt a loss

of trust and meaningfulness in their work. While they would usually

take alternate routes to reorganize inventory and to check in on fellow

workers, employees were now worried that not complying with the

suggested walking routes could invite scrutiny or punitive actions.

Regulatory compliance is usually an insuﬃcient measure of whether

data collection may cause harm. The forms of data collection enabled

by technologies that gather biometric data are much more invasive,

intimate, and intrusive than those traditionally covered by data

privacy regulations. While new laws that target how organizations

handle biometric data are being passed—Illinois’ Biometric Information

Privacy Act (BIPA), for instance—regulations are generally still playing

catch up.

Therefore, companies need to ﬁgure out for themselves when, how, and

why to collect this data.

Why does your organization want to collect biometric data?

Can your organization collect bodily data, and do so ethically and

responsibly? Or is the potential for job insecurity too high, making the

upside to the organization not worth the tradeoﬀ? Organizations need to

seriously consider these questions. And they need to be okay with not

implementing a data collection program, or at the very least delaying it

until the fundamental risks of job insecurity are resolved.

Asking why your organization wants to collect data can oﬀer clear

indicators of whether it should. If the organization stands to beneﬁt —for example, through improved operational eﬃciencies or increased

revenue—but employees don’t, chances are high that the program will

produce job insecurity. One-sided data collection programs in these

instances should be avoided.

Consider how the practice of tracking employees’ attention via

webcams, keystrokes, and mouse movement expanded after Covid-19

expanded remote work. Many employers argued that surveillance was

the best way to ensure workers remained productive; the number of

large employers using these monitoring tools doubled to 60% in the ﬁrst

# two years of the pandemic.

While the prospect of surveilling employees to scare them into

remaining productive may be appealing to employers, other research

suggests that these initiatives mostly end up backﬁring through lowered

employee morale. In our forthcoming research, remote employees

broadly reported that these tools negatively impacted their autonomy,

and thus they have worsened feelings of job insecurity. On an

organizational level, these programs incentivize employees to devise

novel ways of subverting webcams and other monitoring systems, and

to focus on tasks optimized for what those systems are looking for,

rather than ones that are beneﬁcial to the company.

There are also speciﬁc kinds of work where data collection is more likely

to cause harm. Our research shows that in industries where employees

collect and process sensitive human data, such as medical diagnostics,

workers reported greater apprehension and feelings of job insecurity

when asked to share their bodily data. There’s a possible psychological

explanation here: Research shows that employees who handle biometric

data come to view the humans who generate it as inanimate artifacts

simply to be worked on. When asked to share their own data, they may

interpret that to mean that they’re now the dehumanized artifacts to

be analyzed and manipulated by their employers. In such industries,

employers may be better oﬀ not introducing biometric data collection

# initiatives.

How to collect biometric data without causing job insecurity

Of course, it is possible for these initiatives to be implemented in a

way that beneﬁts both the organization and their employees—without

threatening employees’ sense of job security. Employers that want

to collect intimate biometric data should consider two strategies to balance improving operational eﬃciencies and preserving employee

# feelings of security in the workplace.

Be transparent about why and how data is being collected.

Openness about the data collection process can help alleviate concerns

around biometric screenings and encourage employees to opt in. This

helps employees retain control over their sensitive bodily data, reducing

feelings of job insecurity for even those employees who choose to opt

# out.

## For example, Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Minnesota, a company we

observed in our research, publishes a simple, reader-friendly document

about its wellness screening program, which is oﬀered to employees of

participating organizations. In it, they explain that their goal is to help

members better track and take ownership of their health, and that they

use the collected data to administer rewards for good health. But they

also explain their own rules around the data: that they will only view

individual data for rewards, not to penalize for any reason. They will

also not share individual data with third parties (including employers),

won’t tell employers which employees participate and which don’t,

and will only operate on aggregated data. They also outline precisely

how human-level data is collected and where it goes, which allows

## for collection of data in a private setting, and anonymization of data

before it is stored. They are also careful to use non-coercive language,

preserving an individual’s choice in deciding whether to participate in

# the program.

The result, we found, is that Blue Cross and Blue Shield of

Minnesota improves their internal risk models; employers receive

greater participation in the biometric screening programs, receiving

program discounts; and employees are equipped with better knowledge

to manage their health outcomes.

# Decouple data collection initiatives from performance assessments and evaluations.

Separating data collection programs from performance evaluations

# protects job autonomy and security.

For example, Caterpillar deployed a system of cameras and sensors to

track the pupil sizes and eye movements of tractor operators to monitor

driver fatigue. The company notes that fatigue leads to nearly two thirds

## of operator accidents and that the implementation of this biometric

data collecting system has signiﬁcantly improved worker safety. Given

the sensitivity of the data being collected, Caterpillar ensures that all

individual data is de-identiﬁed and only retained to improve company

safety—it can’t be traced back to any single driver, so can’t be used in

## performance evaluations or salary or promotion decisions.

As a result, the employee is more likely to keep their autonomy in

performing their work, and there is no implicit expectation to change

their work habits that would aﬀect performance evaluations, preserving

# feelings of job security.

How employees can navigate biometric data collection initiatives

If an organization rolls out a bodily data collection program, employees

have some agency. While navigating directives from senior leadership

can be tricky, respectful discussions early in the process can help

prevent a slow descent into prolonged job insecurity. Here are steps

employees can take.

Seek clarity on the breadth and nature of the data collection—and its role in how performance is evaluated.

Concerned employees should ask management about what kind of

data is collected, how it is being stored, and how the metrics that are

derived from bodily data will inform assessments of job performance.

The organization may have noble intent, such as using biometrics for

employee safety (e.g., the Caterpillar case). Alternatively, collected data

may be used to make decisions on salary adjustments, punishments,

or promotions (e.g., attention tracking via webcams). Either way, it is

important for workers to familiarize themselves with the consequences

of participating in or opting out of bodily data collection, and

understand how the collection initiative would aﬀect their sense of

# control over their bodily data.

# Ask for alternatives.

If workers ﬁnd data collection programs to be overly intrusive, they may

ask for alternative, less-intimate forms of data collection that achieve

the same purpose. CONSOL Energy, a coal mining company, rolled out

a biometric hand scanner to track attendance of its workers. One of its

laborers, Beverly Butcher, asked for an alternative method of tracking

## his time and attendance—traditional punch cards—due to an aversion

to the scanner stemming from his religious beliefs. CONSOL refused,

prompting Butcher to resign and ﬁle a discrimination lawsuit, which he

won. Employees should know that there are legal precedents in their

favor that can help inform discussions with managers.

. . .

## The emergence of novel and more eﬃcient forms of biometric data

collection has the potential to dramatically improve organizational

operations. However, those practices can make employees feel less

secure in their jobs, which is ultimately detrimental to an organization.

Companies should thoughtfully assess why they wish to collect data

## from their employees in the ﬁrst place and then design workﬂows

to implement data collection programs that preserve employee job

security. Employees too can shape the way their organizations collect

their data to help maintain or even enhance their autonomy and

# security.
