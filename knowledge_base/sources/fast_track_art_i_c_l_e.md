Objective: Examine the inﬂuence of employee health management (EHM) best practices on registration, participation, and health behavior change in telephone-based coaching programs. Methods: Individual health assessment data, EHM program data, and health coaching participation data were ana- lyzedforassociationswithcoachingprogramenrollment,activeparticipation, and risk reduction. Multivariate analyses occurred at the individual (n = 205,672) and company levels (n = 55). Results: Considerable differences were found in how age and sex impacted typical EHM evaluation metrics. Cash incentives for the health assessment were associated with more risk reduction for men than for women. Providing either a noncash or a beneﬁts- integrated incentive for completing the health assessment, or a noncash in- centive for lifestyle management, strengthened the relationship between age and risk reduction. Conclusions: In EHM programs, one size does not ﬁt all. These results can help employers tailor engagement strategies for their speciﬁc population.

BACKGROUND AND LITERATURE REVIEW Employee health management (EHM) programs have be- come an accepted strategy to reduce employee health risks,1–5 re- duce health care costs,5 and improve employee productivity and presenteeism.6–8 Although there is growing evidence to support that EHM programs can produce a return on investment (ROI) to the employer,9–13 programsvaryconsiderablyregardingthelevelsofem- ployee participation and the attendant magnitude of health improve- mentand/orROIthathasbeenachievedinanemployeepopulation.14 As the ﬁeld of EHM has matured, several researchers and organi- zations have proposed employee EHM “best practices.”4,15–18 Best practice guidelines vary in how they were developed, with some that are evidence based,2,4,16 others that are conceptual models,17,19 and still others that are based on the consensus of experts.20–22

incentives for program participation, using data to inform program strategy, and tailoring worksite offerings according to the organi- zations’ unique risk proﬁle. Although the similarities between best practices guidelines and the scorecards that accompany them sug- gest that there is a growing understanding of the factors that best predict program success, there is a dearth of evidence concerning which factors are most important and whether these factors vary within or between organizations. Moreover, there is little evidence to demonstrate whether best practices components predict program success when age or sex diversity between or within organizations is considered.

There are various discrete components in a best practices framework, each of which is likely to carry differing weights relative to program effectiveness, but studies to guide program planners in what components are most important are limited. One recent study suggests that health assessment (HA) participation rates, as one in- dicator of success in EHM, are inﬂuenced, in order of importance, by the engagement of senior leadership, health beneﬁts design, and the use of branded communications.24 It is instructive to note that in this same report EHM program leaders were asked to self-assess which program components were most effective in reducing med- ical cost trends and their responses indicated, in order of impor- tance, ﬁnancial incentives, employee communications, and strategic planning carried the most weight. Furthermore, additional analy- sis indicated that one factor—the use of incentives—best predicted successful participation whereas another factor—program-branded communications—better predicted positive health improvements.24 Such ﬁndings indicate that although best practices are growing in importanceandpopularity, muchisyettobelearnedconcerninghow to best apply them toward improving program success.

Best practices guidelines, and the scorecards that accompany them, have been developed to guide EHM practitioners in program planning, administration, and evaluation associated with improved program effectiveness. The primary aim of most such best prac- tices guidelines is to increase the likelihood that the programs will produce population-level health outcomes along with garnering a positive ROI.23 The most widely used best practice guidelines rec- ommend institutionalizing support for EHM programs.4 Such best practices include developing a strategic plan, providing comprehen- sive program offerings, producing robust communications, offering

## Evidence for the Use of Best Practices in EHM

Although there are only a limited number of studies concern- ing how the use of best practices can improve EHM program out- comes, ﬁndings to date suggest positive relationships between some best practices and outcomes, albeit study methods make the research ﬁndings difﬁcult to generalize to other populations. One study, for example, assessed nine program components, each of which was rated high to low according to a company’s ﬁdelity to the compo- nent.Speciﬁcally,companieswerescoredaccordingtosuchqualities as leadership support for EHM, strategic planning, comprehensive communications, and the use of beneﬁts-integrated incentives. Out- comes measured were HA completion rates, intervention enrollment rates,andhealthbehaviorchangeasmeasuredbyarepeatHA.Those companies with the highest ﬁxation indices25 were shown to have signiﬁcantly better program outcomes.4 These study ﬁndings are useful for ratifying best practices components because the unit of analysis was conducted at the company level. Nevertheless, because ﬁndings were derived from a composite index, the respective inﬂu- ences of the program quality metrics were not estimated. Nor did this research assess between-company variations concerning the relative contributions of the various components to program success.

## Analyzing Best Practices in Employee Health Management

practices research in EHM. Still, recent studies offer preliminary evidence that one size does not ﬁt all in developing EHM programs. For example, even though the use of ﬁnancial incentives to increase employee engagement in EHM has become a rapidly growing best practice,26 one study of best practices components found that in- centives have a relatively modest impact if not offered alongside effective communications and within the context of a strong organi- zational culture.27 Seaverson and colleagues27 examined data from 36 employers, representing 560,000 employees and used multivari- ate regression statistics to assess the contribution of incentive value and type in relation to communications strategies and a supportive workplace environment. Using completion of an HA as a depen- dent variable, researchers found that participation rates increased signiﬁcantly when all factors were included in the predictive model. Another similar cross-sectional study of 124 employers with 883,000 employees arrived at a strikingly similar conclusion. Using a multivariate model, Taitel and colleagues28 showed that organi- zations with low communications or cultural supports would need ﬁnancial incentive levels triple that of organizations with high com- munications and culture supports to achieve comparable HA partic- ipation levels.

## Understanding Individual-Level and Company-Level Success

Company-level analysis, for the purposes of describing the inﬂuence of best practices in this article, refers to differences in engagement rates and health improvement outcomes between com- panies. Individual-level analysis means changes occurring within the employee population within companies, but which may be com- pared across companies. The studies described previously afﬁrm the utility of understanding the contributors to EHM success, although they each had methodological limitations that moderate the utility of the ﬁndings. First, company-level analysis based on composite best practices scores offers limited insight into how best practices affect subgroups within these populations. Second, employee par- ticipation in HAs is an instructive outcome of interest but likely provides only modest insight into how best practices components impact other outcomes of interest such as completing more intensive intervention programs or achieving sustained health improvement. Indeed, one recent study suggests that ﬁnancial incentives may di- minish the effectiveness of interventions, perhaps by encouraging program enrollment for those not intrinsically motivated.29

Finally, research is scarce concerning whether company-level best practices variables and outcomes differ appreciably from, or markedly inﬂuence, individual health-related variables and out- comes. Very few studies proffer a structured analysis approach that enables an assessment of the interaction between best practices com- ponents and their respective impact on multiple levels of program engagementatthecompanyorindividuallevelofanalysis.Onestudy examined ﬁve company-level variables, using the HERO Employee Health Management (EHM) Best Practice Scorecard, in collabo- ration with Mercer C(cid:2), along with six individual-level variables as assessed by an HA questionnaire.30 Using employees as the unit for analysis, Grossmeier30 found that engagement in a telephone- based intervention program varied by age and sex. After controlling for other health-related variables, this study showed that age and sex weresigniﬁcantlycorrelatedwiththreelevelsofengagement,includ- ing program enrollment as well as active participation and program completion.Understandingthiscascadeisvital,giventhepreponder- ance of EHM research showing that participation and completion are clearly linked with successful behavior change outcomes.31–33 Sim- ilar ﬁndings were reported in a study that compared EHM outcomes between two companies in different industries.34 In this randomized, controlled trial, sex and age were shown to be differentials of inﬂu- enceinbothrecruitmentandretentionofemployeesintointervention programs.

# Study Purpose

Most of the research on EHM best practices to date has been based on cross-sectional comparisons of companies or on case stud- ies of high-performance companies with EHM programs that have employed best practices components. Most such studies offer sup- port for the merits of using many best practices components, but they provide limited insight into whether these components perform consistently or differently relative to the attributes of the workforce. Furthermore, outcomes of interest in best practices research have been either company-level or individual-level comparisons but have seldom been considered together in analytic models. Also, although several studies suggest that components such as leadership support and the use of incentives are important,27,28,35 there is less empir- ical support for how other best practices such as the use of well- ness champions or biometric screenings relate to improved program outcomes.

This study seeks to advance the development and predictive value of EHM best practices guidelines by examining best practices components in the context of both company-level and individual- level outcomes. We hypothesize that best practice components will have signiﬁcantly different impacts on both the population and indi- vidualemployeesbasedonemployeeattributesofage,sex,andhealth status. We also hypothesize that current recommended best practices components will have varying degrees of inﬂuence on different lev- els of engagement including program enrollment, participation, and successful health behavior change. To test these hypotheses, this study used commonly accepted deﬁnitions of best practices compo- nents for company EHM programs and examined the inﬂuence of each component on registration into a telephone-based health coach- ing program, ongoing participation in the telephone-based program, and health behavior change.

# METHODS

# Study Design

To account for the use of nested study variables, this study re- liedonamultileveldesignthatincorporatedbothindividual-leveland company-level measures. At the individual level, a cross-sectional design that assessed the independent inﬂuence of age and sex on telephone-based coaching program (coaching) enrollment andactive participation in coaching was used. For a portion of the individual- levelanalysis,thecross-sectionaldesignwasextendedtoalongitudi- nal design that incorporated an assessment of behavior change over time. The individual-level models were then analyzed at a granular companylevel,withtheindividual-levelresultsoverlaidontoorgani- zational characteristics that described the health promotion program unique to that organization and the organizational environment of the company because it relates to health and wellness promotion.

# Data Sources

All data for the study were provided by a national provider of EHM programs (Vendor). Three data sources, individual-level HA survey data, employer-level EHM program design data, and individual-level health coaching program participation data, were combined for this study.

Behavior change was measured using a validated HA con- sisting of 47 items, with the survey administered annually as a paper-based or a Web-based format to employees.36 Each employer determined its own HA administration period, typically in conjunc- tion with health beneﬁts enrollment or the start of the calendar year. For the employers included in this study, the baseline HA period ranged from January 4, 2007, through December 31, 2008, and the follow-up HA period ranged from June 1, 2008, through August 31, 2009. At the individual level, the average amount of time between the baseline and follow-up HA was 11.9 months.

Employer-level EHM program design elements were mea- sured using the HERO Scorecard.21 The HERO Scorecard was com- pleted by Vendor program managers assigned to develop and imple- menteachemployer’shealthpromotionprogram.TheEHMprogram design was assessed for employer programs that launched on or after April 1, 2007, and ended before March 31, 2009.

# Number of Individuals*

Individual-level health coaching program participation data were collected as part of the Vendor’s administration of the health coaching programs. Coaching program enrollment occurred during the period when or after employees completed the baseline HA. Enrollment concluded within 150 days of the initial administration of the HA. Coaching program enrollment dates ranged from April 15, 2007, through March 31, 2009.

# Sample

Data from 62 companies were pooled representing 645,115 employees fromvariousindustries.Toreducethelikelihoodthatdata were captured as part of a small company pilot program, companies were removed from the initial study pool if fewer than 50 individuals from the company completed an HA or if essential questions on the HERO Scorecard were missing. Individuals were removed from this initial study pool if they were not aged 18 to 80 years or were missing a baseline HA. These exclusion criteria resulted in a baseline study pool of 392,773 individuals from 56 companies (see Table 1).

From the baseline study pool, additional exclusion criteria were applied as appropriate to each of the three dependent variables. For the coaching enrollment analyses, individuals must have been identiﬁed as being eligible for a targeted coaching program on the basis of the results of the baseline HA and they must have enrolled in the coaching program within 150 days of their baseline HA. The ﬁnal sample for these analyses was 205,672 employees representing 55 companies. For the coaching participation analyses, individuals must have enrolled into the coaching program within 150 days of completing their baseline HA and have not been discontinued from the program as the result of their phone being disconnected or being removedfromtheemployer-providedeligibilityﬁle.Theﬁnalsample fortheseanalyseswas34,504employeesrepresenting47companies. For the health behavior change analyses, individuals must have met the previously stated requirements and have completed a follow-up HA within 12 months of the ﬁrst HA. The ﬁnal sample for these analyses was 17,079 employees representing 36 companies.

# Measures

Three dependent variables—enrollment in the coaching pro- gram, active participation in the program, and behavior change for individuals who enrolled in the program—were created. Information on the program is available in previously published studies.32

An individual was considered enrolled in a coaching program when he or she accepted an invitation from the Vendor to participate in the program. If the individual completed an HA, using the Web- based format, eligible individuals received an electronic invitation to enrollinthecoachingprogramthatwasrendereduponcompletionof the HA. If the individual completed a paper HA, eligible individuals received a print invitation that the Vendor mailed to their home address along with the printed results of their HA. Individuals could enroll by completing the paper enrollment card and returning it in a postage-paid envelope or by calling a toll-free number provided by the Vendor. If an eligible individual did not respond to the Web- based or print invitation, the Vendor completed up to ﬁve outbound telephone call attempts to an individual’s home to notify them of the invitation to enroll in a coaching program.

therefore, eligible for all of the analyses discussed here.

12.7% of the participants completed a total of exactly two calls, whereas 57.2% completed three or more calls. More than one third (36.6%) completed ﬁve or more calls.

Health behavior change was measured by comparing each individual’s baseline HA with his or her follow-up HA taken at least 12 months apart before and after the coaching program. An aggregate measure of behavior change was developed through the following series of procedures. The HA assessed an individual’s ev- eryday health behaviors in nine areas, alcohol use, back care, safe driving, nutrition, physical activity, stress management, tobacco use, weight management, and mental well-being. For each area, an in- dividual was determined to meet or not to meet national guidelines for healthy behavior (see Table 2 for health deﬁnitions of “at risk” for each health area). The number of risk areas that were not within guidelines was summed for each individual. The dependent variable of behavior change was created by subtracting the baseline number of health behavior areas not meeting national guidelines from the follow-up number of areas not meeting guidelines. So if an individ- ual’s health behaviors improved, the behavior change variable was negative. If health behaviors got worse, the variable was positive.

Independent variables were created on the basis of the infor- mationfromeachcompany’sHEROScorecard.Initially,16variables were included in statistical models (see Table 3). For brevity, only the variables that were detected as statistically signiﬁcant contributors of one or more of the three dependent variables will be described. Informationonmeasuresthatwerenotstatisticallysigniﬁcantwillbe provided upon request. Table 4 summarizes how each independent variable was deﬁned and coded from the original survey responses. Four dichotomous dummy variables were created from one HERO Scorecard question about the use of incentives for comple- tionofanHA.Responseoptionsweregroupedasanoncashincentive type if respondents indicated a token noncash reward, intracompany competition, rafﬂes/prizes, or participation on company time. Re- sponses were grouped as cash if respondents indicated a cash or gift card. Responses were grouped as a beneﬁts-integrated incentive if respondents indicated that the company made ﬁnancial contributions to a health savings account, ﬂexible spending account, or health re- imbursement account or if the company offered lower copayments, lower deductibles, or lower employee premium contributions. If an organization used cash or beneﬁts-integrated strategies, they were also grouped into a fourth “cash or better” variable. A similar set of three dichotomous dummy variables was created from another question, which asked about the use of incentives for lifestyle man- agement programs.

Another question on the HERO Scorecard asked whether the organization offered on-site or near-site preventive health screenings or whether they conducted special campaigns to promote screening. Becausenoneofthecompaniesinthestudysampleconductedspecial campaigns to promote screening without also providing on-site or near-site screening, this variable was coded as one dichotomous dummy variable.

# Well-being59

At least some indication of current depression (ie, over past 2 weeks) or reported chronic depression (ie, feeling depressed most of the time).

A question about an organization’s program evaluation strat- egy provided seven response categories: use of participant satisfac- tion data to drive program improvement, use of program participa- tion data for reporting, use of process evaluations to drive program improvement, use of population health risk data to monitor health status improvement, analysis of health care utilization and cost data to identify costly conditions and evaluate EHM program impact on such outcomes, analysis of productivity or presenteeism data, and retention of an independent expert to verify that the outcome eval- uation was conducted in a quality manner. All indicated behaviors were summed to create an independent variable about organizational evaluation practices with values ranging from 0 to 7.

# Data Analysis

Dataanalysisoccurredattwodistinctlevels.Fortheindividual level of analysis, basic descriptive statistics and logistic and ordinary least squares regression models were conducted. For the company level of analysis, bivariate correlations were analyzed in addition to the basic descriptive statistics. All analyses used the SAS package of statistical programs (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).

Of those who enrolled, about 60% actively participated in the program. Over time, the average number of risks reported by participants dropped by about 8% (−0.318/4.051) from the baseline. In the company level of analysis, the proportion male was consistently lower when averaged across all of the organizations included in the study. The average age in all companies was com- parable and the risk proﬁles for employees in all companies were similar. Because averaging the individual-level data within the com- panies captures differences in company recruitment policies, which bylawmustnotdiscriminateonthebasisofageorsex,thevariability of the data at the company level was substantially less than that of the individual-level analysis.

# RESULTS

Analysis was conducted in three phases, each of which was composed of varying numbers of employees and companies from the study sample. Although the study population was large when viewed at its broadest level, as the model requirements became more restrictive, the sample size dropped precipitously. This is manifested most clearly in model 3, the participant behavior change model, where only 17,079 employees in 36 different companies provided sufﬁcient data such that an analysis of participant behavior change could be conducted.

Twosetsofdatafortheindividual-levelmeasuresareprovided (Table 5). The top portion of Table 5 presents the individual-level means and standard deviations for the employees included in each of the three phases of the analysis. In the bottom portion of the table, the same data are presented, but these statistics are based on the aggregate-level summarization of the measures used in the company-level analysis.

For the model that is most inclusive of all employees, the enrollment model, approximately half of all employees included in the study were male. For the different dependent variables in the model, slightly less than one third of all employees enrolled intheprogram.Greaterfemaleparticipationratesweremanifestedin the participation model and the proportion of men enrolled increased in the participant behavior change model. As the models became more restrictive, the average age of the employees steadily increased.

The company-level measures derived from the HERO Score- card are shown in Table 3 and deﬁned in Table 4. There was sub- stantial consistency in the company proﬁles when compared across the different analytical models. The use of incentives to drive par- ticipation in the wellness programs was highly prevalent and nearly all companies provided a cash or better incentive for completing an HA. More than half of companies integrated the incentive into their beneﬁt plan. Use of incentives for lifestyle management was less common, with cash as the most popular option. More than one third of the companies used this strategy to promote participation in the lifestyle management programs, whereas about one in eight companies used a noncash incentive.

Companies tended to offer programs that covered the entire continuum of programs available for wellness initiatives. Nearly two thirds of the companies in this sample offered biometric screening as part of their wellness program. Of seven possible evaluation com- ponents, as assessed in the HERO Scorecard, companies averaged using better than ﬁve of these components. The number of environ- mental supports was slightly lower, averaging about 3 on the 0 to 7scale. The supportiveness of the corporate culture was mid-range, averaging slightly above the mid-point on the 0 to 3 scale, whereas the average score for the wellness champion network index, which was also based on a 0 to 3 scale, was well below the theoretical mid-point.

# Individual-Level Models

When the impact of age and sex on enrollment in wellness programs was analyzed using all 205,672 employees in the data, the models yielded the expected pattern of older age and female sex associated with higher enrollment rates. When this analysis was replicated 55 times, once for each of the companies in the study, on average a similar pattern emerged. But these averages, presented in Table 6, can be quite deceiving, as indicated by the minimums, maximums, and standard deviations of the coefﬁcients. The data are not shown for this level of detail in the table, but for 15 of the companies, the logistic regression coefﬁcient for sex was less than −0.5, meaning that enrollment rates were decidedly lower for men in these companies. For another 14 of these companies, the logistic regression coefﬁcient was greater than −0.15, suggesting only a modest impact on rates of enrollment favoring women. Indeed, for one of the companies, men were more, not less, likely to enroll.

As presented on the lower half of Table 6, in the overall analysis, the effect was not statistically signiﬁcant (β = 0.007). Repeating the analysis 47 times yielded a clearer view and substantially different perspective of the effect of sex on active participation. Although the average sex coefﬁcient across the companies was only 0.034, 11 of the 47 companies displayed a pattern where men were sig- niﬁcantly less likely to actively participate, with effect coefﬁcients less than −0.13. But in 20 of the companies, men were signiﬁcantly more likely to actively participate, with effect coefﬁcients greater than 0.13. Thus, the overall average masks these substantially differ- ent, even contradictory, patterns. A similar, although somewhat less strong, pattern was found in the relationship between age and active participation. Also, older employees generally had higher rates of active participation in health coaching. But for 11 of the 47 com- panies, the effect of age was at least 33% stronger than the average effect, and for another 11, the effect was at least 33% weaker.

A similar pattern was seen with age. Although in general the older the age of the employee, the higher the probability of enrolling in wellness programs, for 16 of the companies a negative effect was noted, meaning that older employees were less likely to enroll. And while, on average, the age coefﬁcient was 0.005, for 15 of the companies the logistic regression coefﬁcient was more than twice as strong. This means that for these 15 companies the rate of change associated with increasing age and increasing participation was at least doubled, with much higher rates of participation than that seen on average.

In terms of participation, the overall impact of sex on whether or not an individual completed a health coaching call was negligible.

Table 7 presents the results for the participant health behavior change models. On average, there was a substantial impact of base- line health risk on subsequent behavior change, with higher baseline risk associated with greater behavior change. Across companies, there was some relatively small variability in the magnitude of this effect.

On average across these companies, men showed a very slight advantage compared with women with regard to behavior change, reducing slightly more health risks than women. But here, too, this modest average reduction advantage masks company-speciﬁc variations. For 6 of the 36 companies, the male advantage vis-a- vis women was ﬁve times more than the average. In four of the

## Analyzing Best Practices in Employee Health Management

companies, women showed an advantage compared with men in their rates of behavior change.

If company-speciﬁc differences are ignored, each additional year of age leads to a modest but statistically signiﬁcant reduction in risks, and that ﬁnding is replicated when the results are pooled and averaged across the 36 company-speciﬁc analyses. But for 9 of the 36 companies, the rate of behavior change was three times as strong, whereas for 8 of the companies there was next to no age effect whatsoever. For seven of the companies, increasing age was associated with risk increases, a ﬁnding counter to the dominant trend in this individual-level study sample.

# Company-Level Models

The individual model results demonstrated considerable dif- ferences across companies in how two very simple demographic characteristics—age and sex—impacted typical metrics used in an- alyzing the impact of EHM programs. This stage of the analysis extended that logic by exploring the extent to which those company differences were systematic and can be modeled on the basis of other company characteristics. In this section, the coefﬁcients that were presented in Tables 6 and 7 were treated as dependent variables in a new analysis based at the company level. The independent variables of this analysis were characteristics of the organization. Speciﬁcally, HERO Scorecard measures (see Tables 3 and 4) were used to ex- plain the variation in the strength of the relationships observed and explore whether or not the HERO Scorecard measures statistically relate to the coefﬁcients obtained for the individual-level measures of age, sex, and baseline risk to impact enrollment, participation, and behavior change in the company-speciﬁc individual-level models.

Because these analyses were performed at the company level, thesamplesemployedintheseanalysesweresmall.Attheenrollment level, there were 55 companies included and at the active participa- tion level there were 47 companies. For the participant behavior change model, 36 companies had the requisite information per the data analysis plan criteria. Because of this, the conventional deﬁni- tion of statistical signiﬁcance was relaxed from P < 0.05 to P < 0.10 to more discriminately examine the between-company variation.

Table 8 presents the results of a bivariate correlation analysis relating the HERO Scorecard measures to the effect coefﬁcients in the enrollment model. Two measures were related to the size of the intercept—a measure that was, in this context, treated as a company’s blended average for enrollment rates while controlling for age and sex—and in both cases the results were counterintuitive. Companies that used noncash incentives to promote enrollment in coaching programs had signiﬁcantly lower rates of enrollment than those who used no incentives. Similarly, companies that offered more environmental supports for health had lower baseline rates of enrollment.

At the individual level, sex had a negligible impact on partici- pation but with substantial variability—in some companies, women were more likely to be active participants, whereas in others, men were more likely to be active participants. Table 9 shows that provid- inganoncashincentiveforcompletingtheHAwasnegativelyrelated to the sex effect coefﬁcient. As such, the impact of these noncash incentives was variable. If men were more likely to participate, then adding a noncash incentive would likely lead to decreased male par- ticipation and equalization of the male–female participation rates. If male–femaleparticipationrateswereaboutequal,thenaddinganon- cash incentive would likely drive female participation rates higher. If women were already participating at a higher rate than men, adding a noncash incentive would likely intensify that difference. A deeper review of the analysis relied on scatter plots of these coefﬁcients (not shown) and concluded that this sex-biased inﬂuence of noncash incentives was consistent across nearly all organizations. In short, in this study sample, noncash incentives were more inﬂuential on program engagement for women than for men.

Only one HERO Scorecard measure, number of evaluation components, was related to the age coefﬁcients in the participa- tion model. Recall from the individual-level analysis that as age increased participation generally increased also, and that again there was variability across companies. Table 9 shows that there was a negative relationship between the number of evaluation components and the age coefﬁcient, suggesting that in an environment where older persons are already more likely to participate, having a com- prehensiveevaluationplanwasassociatedwithreducedparticipation rates among older employees, but in an environment where old and young employees participated at approximately equal rates, having a comprehensive evaluation component was associated with higher participation rates among the younger employees. In environments where younger employees had higher rates of participation, having a comprehensive evaluation component was associated with even higher participation rates among the younger employees. In short, a comprehensive evaluation component may drive greater participa- tion among younger employees.

Table 10 presents the results that relate the HERO Scorecard measures to the effect coefﬁcients in the behavior change model. Two HERO Scorecard measures were related to the intercept in this model, which in this instance may be viewed as the typical behavior change that is expected after controlling for age, sex, and baseline risk. Behavior change was calculated as T2–T1, which means that negative numbers indicated that risks decreased, so a negative coef- ﬁcient was a desirable result in this case. Companies that offered a cash or better incentive for completing an HA typically experienced greater behavior change, whereas more environmental supports were associated with a lower rate of behavior change, or perhaps even a modest health risk increase (health behaviors got worse).

At the individual level, men were typically less likely to enroll and older persons were more likely to enroll, but there was substan- tial variability across companies. None of the HERO Scorecard mea- sures were signiﬁcantly related to the sex variability. Nevertheless, offering biometric screening was signiﬁcantly related to the effect coefﬁcient for age, suggesting that providing a biometric screening option increased the strength of the relationship between age and en- rollment and could help drive higher levels of participation among older employees.

Table 9 presents the results of a bivariate correlation analysis relating the HERO Scorecard measures to the effect coefﬁcients in the participation model. One measure, the number of environmen- tal supports for health, was signiﬁcantly related to the intercept in this model, which again may be interpreted as representing base- line rates of participation adjusting for age and sex. Companies that offered more environmental supports had lower baseline levels of participation.

At the individual level, the relationship between baseline risk and behavior change was consistently negative, with higher levels of baseline risk associated with more behavior change. Companies that offered a noncash incentive for completing the HA saw health risks reduced to an even greater degree than companies without this incentive.

The sex effect at the individual level of analysis was some- times negligible, sometimes favored women, and sometimes favored men. Three HERO Scorecard measures were related to the effect that sex had on behavior change. Offering a cash incentive for complet- ing the HA was related to behavior change subsequent to completing the HA. Speciﬁcally, in an environment where men and women were comparable in their levels of behavior change, a cash incentive for completing the HA was associated with greater behavior change among men. In an environment where female behavior change ex- ceeded men’s, offering a cash incentive for completing the HA was associatedwithequalizingthemale–femaleratesofbehaviorchange, whereas in an environment where male behavior change exceeded

## Analyzing Best Practices in Employee Health Management

women’s, offering a cash incentive for completing the HA was asso- ciated with increasing the male-female differential.

In short, a cash incentive for completion of the HA tended to be more effective in promoting behavior change among men. In contrast, both a beneﬁts-integrated incentive for completing the HA and a noncash incentive for participating in a health coaching program were positively associated with the sex coefﬁcient. This suggests that these incentive models were differentially effective in promoting behavior change among women. An examination of the scatter plots relating the effect coefﬁcients for sex to the sex distributions of the companies provided suggestive evidence that this statisticalinteractioneffectwastiedtothedemographicenvironment of the company.

Five HERO Scorecard measures were associated with the age coefﬁcient in the participant behavior change model. Typically, older employees achieved greater behavior change subsequent to complet- ing the HA. Three types of incentives strengthened that relationship. Providingeitheranoncashorabeneﬁts-integratedincentiveforcom- pleting the HA, or a noncash incentive for lifestyle management, strengthened the relationship between age and behavior change.

A different incentive—a cash incentive for completion of the HA—was positively related to the age coefﬁcient. In an environ- ment where increasing age was associated with lower T2 risks—the dominant case—providing a cash incentive may have served to im- prove behavior change among younger employees or it may have diminished behavior change among older employees.

The presence and strength of a champion network also inﬂu- enced the relationship of age to behavior change. A stronger cham- pion network tended to strengthen the relationship between age and behaviorchangeandtendedtoreduceriskstoanevengreaterdegree.

# A Herd Effect

The ﬁndings concerning the relationships between age, sex, andbehaviorchange,whennotfactoringintheinﬂuenceofbestprac- tices, offer some preliminary considerations for understanding the best practice ﬁndings. If considering only the overall employee pop- ulation, application of study ﬁndings would lead readers to expect that enrollment in programs is somewhat more likely for women and enrollment increases in likelihood among older cohorts. This ﬁnding is similar to that of another study showing that women were more likely to participate in wellness programs38; however, another study showed no signiﬁcant sex differences in enrollment.34 This study’s additional analysis of differences between companies may explain the lack of consistency between it and prior studies because it shows striking differences at the company level, with some com- panies having women and older employees less likely to enroll and others having women and older employees being more than twice as likely as employees in other companies to enroll.

Social learning theory holds that individuals tend to emulate those around them. Perhaps, like the “herd immunity” concept in infection control39,40, there is a threshold for participation rates in organizations where a critical mass of those in an age or sex cohort have effectively created a snowballing level of interest and enroll- ment in programs. Furthermore, this study’s ﬁndings suggest that if a worksite population is already female or male dominated, this herd affect is ampliﬁed. These data suggest that the opposite could also be occurring. Those organizations that do not garner inertia among age and sex cohorts do not end up with average participation rates but rather fall well below average. Hence, it could be that observa- tional learning and modeling within that group, in effect, discourage participation.

# DISCUSSION

This study tested the inﬂuence of the use of EHM best prac- tices components, when considered separately, on the engagement ratesandhealthoutcomesbetweencompaniesandacrossindividuals within those companies. In particular, this study examined whether best practices approaches had differential effects when considering the sex, age, and health status of employees. Given the nascent stage of development and implementation of best practices in the EHM ﬁeld, it is understandable that most scorecards are basically a “one size ﬁts all” assemblage of recommended practices. This study’s ﬁndings draw attention to the more likely reality that one size does notﬁtallinEHM.Notonlydiditﬁndthatbestpracticescomponents, whenconsideredseparately,variedintheirinﬂuenceaccordingtothe age and sex of a population, it also found that some best practices components had a greater inﬂuence on engagement levels and other components had a greater inﬂuence on employee behavior change. When considering how the various best practices components had differential effects on engagement and outcomes, it is instruc- tive to note that the companies in the study were quite similar con- cerning which best practices components they offered. Two thirds offered biometric screening, nearly all offered employees a ﬁnancial incentive for completing an HA and most use multiple channels to communicate program offerings. This ﬁnding suggests that some “best practices” recommendations may be becoming common prac- tice. Though less commonly employed, some employers are now using incentives to encourage enrollment in health coaching inter- ventions. Although building a “culture of health” has become a standard recommendation related to improving EHM outcomes,37 the slow adoption of best practices related to changing the physical or social environment or mobilizing champions may suggest that re- sourcesandtoolstosupportculturechangeareneededorthatcurrent deﬁnitions of what is meant by a culture of health are wanting.

Not adjusting for the inﬂuence of best practices, men were slightly more likely to achieve successful behavior change than women but, again, there is interesting variability between compa- nies. This ﬁnding is partially consistent with another study that found that older participants were more likely to successfully com- plete wellness programs; however, in that study women were more likely than men to have sustained participation and behavior change in the programs.34 Again, further analysis between companies in this study seems to reconcile these inconsistencies and suggests that sex and age differences can be mitigated signiﬁcantly by the company in which the interventions occur. This perspective is explored further in the discussion of the company-level analysis of the inﬂuence of best practices that follows.

# One Size Does Not Fit All

Best practices scorecards are being widely embraced as vital tools for EHM development and planning. As of October 2012, the HERO Scorecard, for example, had accumulated a normative data set based on nearly 800 companies in the United States completing the Scorecard.41 Although this should yield a growing opportunity for a better understanding of the beneﬁts from using best practices guidelines, basing research on established benchmarks can also in- hibit improvement of guidelines given the constraints of current components being assessed and limitations of the rather rudimen- tary deﬁnitions for successful implementation of each component. One worksite-based randomized controlled trial of the effectiveness of differing approaches to employee health promotion showed that health coaching that promoted changes in individual-level engage- ment in health care decision making was more predictive of positive health outcomes than any other program component.42 The study, called “Activate,” compared the differences between a traditional and a consumer-directed approach to EHM.

is noteworthy that changes in activation levels were one of few individual-level variables that signiﬁcantly changed in the Activate study on the basis of both individual-level and

worksite-level consumer activation interventions.43 These changes in consumer health care activation were measured using the “Patient Activation Measure.” This measure is just one example of a measure not included in any of the best practices scorecards currently avail- able. It is likely that there are many more variables that signiﬁcantly relate to improved individual-level and company-level outcomes that are not represented in current best practices guidelines. Similarly, of the variables currently represented in best practices guidelines, there is scant evidence that current deﬁnitions of successful execution of the component have the sensitivity and speciﬁcity needed for robust estimations of program success.

When EHM best practices are recommended, they are usually cast as a set of guidelines that, when taken altogether, will increase engagement and improve population-level health outcomes.19 This study’s ﬁndings suggest that best practices may need to be parsed according to the population’s demographics and risk proﬁle. The study examined the interaction between each best practices compo- nent and subsequent enrollment, ongoing participation, and behavior changeﬁndingtheinﬂuenceofbestpracticecomponentstobehighly variable, particularly when viewed in the context of their inﬂuence on age and behavior change. The ﬁnding that noncash incentives could, under some circumstances, be related to lower overall rates of enrollment, for example, is inconsistent with incentives research to date with nearly all incentives studies showing a linear relationship between the increased use of incentives and the increased program participation.27,28,44

Upon further examination, however, the ﬁndings that incen- tives are more inﬂuential with women and effectively intensify fe- male participation levels suggest not only that one size does not ﬁt all regarding which program components are featured but also re- garding whom to target with which component. Furthermore, that ﬁnancial incentives actually diminished engagement among men highlights the importance of understanding both the positive and negative effects of select program components. In an article exam- ining how ﬁnancial motivation undermines maintenance in health behavior change, Moller and colleagues also found that ﬁnancial incentives and sex interacted signiﬁcantly “such that ﬁnancial incen- tives had a more deleterious inﬂuence among men.”45

Related to this, although this study did not demonstrate a global positive effect from the use of ﬁnancial incentives related to enrollment, it did ﬁnd that companies that offered incentives for completing the HA netted higher overall behavior change rates. This relationship was even greater for the use of noncash incentives (eg, duffel bags or T-shirts) with older persons. This offers interesting insight into the kind of cascade a parsimonious use of best practices components could be designed to produce. Researchers have argued elsewhere that ﬁnancial incentives are most effective when they cat- alyze participation among those ready to change46 but may diminish outcomes for those lacking intrinsic motivation.29 Findings from this studysuggestthattheuseofincentivestoinﬂuencethepathwayfrom initial assessment to successful behavior change outcomes may need to be tailored according to age as well as stage of change, and once an individual is actively participating in a program, risk reductions can be enhanced with minor incentives.

The inﬂuence of biometric screening is a best practices com- ponent where the face validity of this study’s ﬁnding is high and where targeted use of the component is apparent. This study also found that biometric screenings intensiﬁed the positive relationship between higher program participation among older employees. That older employees will beneﬁt more from the teachable moments that a screening can offer could be viewed from the obvious vantage point that older employees are more likely to have clinical metrics outside of recommended standards.47 Nevertheless, younger employees are also routinely found to be outside of recommended ranges so the absence of a similar positive effect on participation for the younger employees suggests that screening is a best practice for increasing

participation in older workforces but other approaches to driving engagement are more effective in younger workforces.

Conducting more extensive program evaluation is a best prac- tices program component that is related to increased participation among the younger employees in the workplace. Although the nature of this relationship is not readily apparent, and indeed this ﬁnding may simply be spurious, it may be reﬂective of the key role program evaluation plays in shaping a program relevant to the needs of the population. It could also suggest that younger employees are more sensitive to and react more strongly to the perception or reality of be- ing monitored. Using best practices speciﬁc to program evaluation involves an iterative process where process, outcome, and impact metrics are continuously reviewed both to provide an assessment of what is working and to inform changes in program design.2 In this context, companies that invest more resources into program evalua- tion may be better able to detect and ameliorate the tendency for less engagement among young employees whom we found in our global assessment of enrollment trends related to age.

For employers evaluating their programs, or researchers who may be working with a smaller number of companies, or have unique data regarding the organizational structure of branches or divisions within a single company, the results of this study suggest that they may want to consider implementing multilevel models such as hi- erarchical logistic regression or hierarchical linear modeling.48,49 Although the large number of companies included in this study would have made that approach unwieldy for this analysis, these are powerfultoolsthatallowtheanalysttocombineindividual-leveldata with organizational-level metrics to better understand the outcomes they are investigating.

As noted previously, deﬁnitions concerning what constitutes best practices in providing environmental supports needed to pro- duce the vaunted “culture of health” may lack the speciﬁcity needed to shape deﬁnitive research conclusions. Nevertheless, improving culture is an accepted best practice in spite of the dearth of re- search concerning what works in improving same.37 This study’s ﬁndings concerning the negative relationship between environmen- tal supports and program engagement seem to contradict common assumptions about the presumed favorable, even vital, interdepen- dencies of same. But here, yet again, it was the analysis underneath this global ﬁnding that may shed some insight into the differential inﬂuence of best practices. This study found that the strength of a champion network, arguably one of the most vital instruments for changing a culture,50,51 was positively related to behavior change, especially among older employees.

# Study Limitations

The large sample size for this study increases the likelihood that our ﬁndings can be generalized to other organizations. Never- theless, an attribute this study sample shares in common is that they were all companies working with a wellness vendor that provided their HA tool and that also offers comprehensive health promotion services. There is little recent data concerning what proportion of companies in America offer EHM programs, much less EHM best practices, but the last such national survey suggested that a small minority of companies take a comprehensive approach to EHM.52 Accordingly, this analysis of best practices may be less relevant to organizations offering a piecemeal approach to employee wellness. Some of the ﬁndings from the study, at ﬁrst blush, seem to contradict conventional assumptions about best practices. We have explained how in some cases the role of incentives or organizational culture may be better understood in the context of organizational demographics.Nevertheless,anotherexplanationthatfallsoutsideof thepurviewofthisstudyrelatestohowbestpracticesinﬂuencemany other aspects of program engagement or outcomes that were not a partofthisstudy’sscope.Forexample,theﬁndingthatenvironmental supports did not increase participation in health coaching should

## Analyzing Best Practices in Employee Health Management

not be interpreted to necessarily mean that environmental supports do not increase the likelihood of participation in countless other wellness intervention opportunities, although that may be the case. The negative relationship could also mean that employees were less drawn to health coaching because the worksite was offering so many other supports for fostering health improvement. Without a more extensive battery of measures of both environmental supports and intervention options, we are unable to fully understand the nature of many interactions between best practices components, engagement, and outcomes.

Finally, our ability to extrapolate the meaning behind the rela- tionships between best practices and program outcomes is substan- tially limited by the current deﬁnitions for each best practice compo- nent and by how the deﬁnitions were interpreted by respondents who completed the HERO Scorecards. Many items in the HERO Score- card used for this study were simply three-point Likert-type scales that may lack the speciﬁcity needed to truly distinguish best prac- tice from what has become standard practice in EHM. Also, many such items were essentially a judgment call by those who completed the HERO Scorecard. For example, “strong leadership support” may have been deemed by one respondent to require active participation in programs whereas another respondent might have considered en- dorsement and communications from key executives as indicative of leadership support. As of this writing, no research had yet examined the interrater reliability of the HERO Scorecard, and hence rater variability might be quite dramatic. Findings from research, similar to this study, will help inform the reﬁnements needed to improve our understanding of what constitutes best practices that appreciably improve engagement and outcomes.

establish cause-and-effect relationships between best practices and program outcomes.

One of our initial motivations for conducting the present re- searchwastouseourﬁndingstodevelopabestpractices“calculator.” Surely a large data set such as we used for this research would pro- vide ample empirical support for a tool with inputs derived from best practices components and outputs that would have predictive value concerning engagement and outcomes. Instead, this study demon- stratesthatthepredictivevalueofscorecardsmaybehighlymitigated by factors that are not yet fully understood or represented in contem- porary guidelines. It follows that best practice component deﬁnitions on the HERO Scorecard may need further reﬁnement. Additional factors that predict success need to be introduced and guidelines need to be accompanied by demographic covariates that mitigate, and are mitigated by, each of the best practices components. This study enumerates empirically derived examples of how best prac- tices components need to be considered separately, perhaps more so than together, to improve their predictive value and strengthen their contribution to the advancement of EHM.

# CONCLUSIONS

Best practices guidelines, and the scorecards designed to as- sess a company’s execution of them, show great promise for support- ing EHM program developers and health promotion practitioners intent on continuous improvement of employee engagement in, and positive outcomes resulting from, the best practices components of- fered. This study offers several considerations that should facilitate the use of the current scorecards and that can inform future develop- ment work on best practices components. First, one size does not ﬁt allcompanieswhenitcomestohowselectbestpracticescomponents can inﬂuence employee engagement and successful health improve- ment. This study showed how ﬁnancial incentives, environmental supports, biometric screenings, and wellness champion networks all perform differently, both positively and negatively inﬂuencing en- gagement and outcomes, according to the demographic proﬁle of a company. Future research is needed to strengthen our understanding of the interaction between a population’s demographics and the role that different EHM program components have in addressing demo- graphic factors. More speciﬁcally, to what extent are enrollment and behaviorchangemitigatedbyrelativelyintransigentvariablessuchas the age, sex, and the health status of the population? Conversely, can best practices components be conﬁgured in a way that exerts enough inﬂuence, independently of mitigating factors, to improve engage- ment rates and health outcomes? Should best practices be “cherry picked” and selected on the basis of a company’s demographic and health status proﬁle?

Second, best practices may work best when they create inertia for select groups. That is, these ﬁndings suggest that there is a herd effectrelatedtoprogramengagementsuchthatwhenaprogramcom- ponent such as a biometric screening or a certain type of incentive is offered, the inﬂuence can have an enhanced impact within demo- graphically similar subgroups.
