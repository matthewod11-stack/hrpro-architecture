We often valorize companies that attempt to innovate in their

industries, because they push the boundaries of what is possible

and, in doing so, achieve extraordinary returns for their endeavors.

Not surprisingly, the vast majority of top performing companies rank

innovation among their top three priorities. But not all ﬁrms beneﬁt

# from their investment in innovation.

## HBR / Digital Article / When to Innovate and When to Imitate

Frequently, scholars and practitioners attribute innovation failures

to the ways companies go about developing and commercializing

innovations. But our research suggests an alternative reason—many

innovation attempts fail because companies do not fully understand

# their positioning in the market.

In this article, we take a step back. Before deciding how to innovate,

we suggest companies ask when they should innovate—and whether it

might make more sense to imitate instead. While less glamorous, for

some companies, imitating the right rivals at the right time can be more

eﬀective and lucrative than attempting to chart an entirely new course.

# When to Innovate and When to Imitate

We’ve developed a framework, based on decades of research, to help

determine whether a company is better oﬀ pursuing an imitation or

innovation strategy. The framework is built on two critical dimensions:

(1) industry maturity; and (2) a company’s position within an industry.

By “position within an industry,” we mean how a company performs

(based on given performance criteria) relative to other players in

the industry. These criteria can vary. For instance, airlines generally

## compete on quality and cost, smartphone manufacturers on processing

## power and design, and software ﬁrms on product reliability and user

accessibility. As part of the process of understanding when to innovate

or imitate, you should determine which criteria matter the most in your

industry or market. Though it might seem like an onerous task on the

surface, do not despair. You can use data that you have gleaned through

market and customer research to determine the attributes or features

customers care about in your industry. You then can assess how your

company measures up against these criteria and where your company

stands compared to competitors. The ﬁgures below help visualize these

comparisons through what we call an “industry cloud diagram.”

# Assess the maturity of your industry

Let’s start by considering the ﬁrst dimension in our framework—

industry maturity—and comparing a nascent or young industry to

a mature industry. In nascent industries, few players exist; as an

industry matures, more players enter, occupying diﬀerent positions in

the market. Whether you should imitate or innovate critically depends

# on the maturity of the industry.

## For instance, in the early 1920s when the automobile industry

was nascent, Ford produced more than 50 percent of all motor

vehicles in the world. By the 1990s, the automotive industry had

matured into a global industry with a plethora of manufacturers.

## These included American giants (Ford, GM, Chrysler); German luxury

## and performance brands (VW, BMW, Daimler-Benz, Porsche); French

## automakers (Peugeot, Renault); Italian manufacturers (Fiat); Japanese

## companies (Toyota, Nissan, Honda, Mitsubishi, Subaru); South Korean

entrants (Hyundai, Kia, Daewoo); alongside emerging players from

## India, China, Russia, and Eastern Europe.

When an industry is nascent, innovating tends to win because many

valuable, unexplored opportunities await discovery. For example,

following the introduction of Ford’s Model T in 1908, GM entered

the market by imitating the Model T’s aﬀordability and reliable

quality. But after unsuccessful imitation attempts, GM decided to

innovate and move into completely diﬀerent territory: by segmenting

the market and introducing colorful cars with neatly designed closed

bodies. The industry was simply too young to standardize around the

Model T; superior designs remained undiscovered, and companies that

pioneered these alternatives achieved remarkable success.

Instead of just imitating Ford, GM was better oﬀ by leapfrogging it—

ﬁnding a new position in the uncharted territory. A similar pattern

played out in the early days of the modern electric vehicle industry.

When Tesla entered the market, most automakers were focused on

building small, practical electric cars that closely resembled existing

gasoline vehicles—essentially imitating the conventional car template.

Instead, Tesla innovated by launching the high-performance Roadster

and, later, the luxury Model S, proving that electric vehicles could be

desirable, fast, and aspirational. By targeting an unexplored segment

—premium, long-range EVs—Tesla leapfrogged traditional automakers

and established itself as a leader, while others were still experimenting

# with incremental improvements.

In contrast, in a mature industry, many ﬁrms have already explored

the landscape and discovered most of the possible products and spaces.

Most of the territory has been charted. Thus, to improve, companies can

imitate those that are in a comparatively better position.

Identify your imitation radius

In a mature industry, it is best to imitate the nearby, better-performing

competitors that sit just ahead of you on the competitive landscape,

that is, rivals within your imitation radius, rather than distant industry

leaders (unless you are the leader).

For example, in the 1980s, South Korean car manufacturers imitated

the Japanese. This imitation allowed Korean car companies to improve

## their performance and move to an equivalent position in the cloud. At

the same time, Lada, a Russian car company, tried to imitate U.S. and

German cars to improve their performance and achieve the success of

these industry leaders. But Lada was too far away from the U.S. and

German companies to succeed. Imitation is a successful strategy when

ﬁrms target competitors that are not too distant and live within their

imitation radius. Lada would have been better oﬀ engaging in a series

of jumps, imitating near competitors in a sequence and then ultimately

reaching the industry leaders. The South Korean car industry thrived in

the 1990s, while the Russian did not.

A similar pattern can be seen today in the gaming industry. Tencent

Games, for example, has strategically invested in or imitated games

developed by close competitors to build its own capabilities. When

Tencent developed Arena of Valor, a mobile game closely modeled

after League of Legends, it targeted a competitor within its imitation

radius. This approach allowed Tencent to quickly gain expertise in the

multiplayer online battle arena (MOBA) genre and achieve rapid success

# in the mobile gaming market.

Answer these questions to guide your strategy

So how should you decide which strategy to pursue? We created this

diagram to help you visualize your decision making. In summary: if

a ﬁrm operates in a nascent industry, the answer is straightforward:

innovate. Conversely, if a ﬁrm operates in a mature industry, its strategy

should be guided by its competitive position. Firms should focus on

## proven models within their “imitation radius,” or the zone of feasible

# catch-up.

It may help to visualize an actual company as you look through this

diagram. ZEISS SMT provides a clear example. ZEISS operates in the

semiconductor manufacturing industry, which is mature. However,

ZEISS is at the very forefront of this industry, especially in extreme

ultraviolet optics. For ZEISS, simply imitating competitors would not

help it stay ahead; there are no better models to copy. Their best

decision would be to innovate and push the boundary further ahead.

## Organizational Strategies for Innovation or Imitation

Once an organization has decided whether to compete through

innovation or imitation, how can they enact their new strategic focus?

While countless mechanisms are available, we concentrate on the

most common and consequential: shaping organizational structure,

recruiting or upskilling talent, codifying routines, and calibrating the

timing of investment behind the chosen approach. The guidance distills

lessons from decades of research—including our own—and patterns we

see repeatedly in practice. Although every ﬁrm operates in a unique

context, we oﬀer a pragmatic starting point for leaders looking to

# translate strategic intent into action.

To encourage innovation

If ﬁrms are looking to leapfrog over competitors or push out the frontier,

there are many strategic changes they can make, including to their

company’s:

- Structure: Firms should work to ﬂatten their hierarchy to empower

cross-functional teams, encouraging autonomy, open communication,

# and rapid experimentation.

- People: Concentrate on hiring to enhance creativity and idea

# generation.

- Routines and Processes: Consider developing new routines that help

establish ﬂexibility and cooperation.

- Time: Focus on a long-term orientation, as innovation can take time.

To imitate successfully

If a company is looking to pursue imitation, they should make

somewhat diﬀerent changes to their organization, including to their:

- Structure: Adopt clear roles and standardized workﬂows that

accelerate the imitation and adaptation of proven practices.

- People: Hire from target ﬁrms or competitors to access insider

# knowledge and practices.

- Routines and Processes: Consider developing new routines that

## allow for enhanced market search and research.

- Time: Focus on shorter-term orientation to eﬃciently catch up to

# competitors.

Innovation is often seen as a badge of honor—bold, visionary, and

transformational. But the reality is more complex: many ﬁrms invest

heavily in innovation only to produce meager results. Our research

and framework suggest that before asking how to innovate, managers

should ﬁrst ask whether innovation is the right strategic move at all.

By understanding your ﬁrm’s relative position in the industry, you can

make more informed choices.

If you’re in a nascent industry or near the performance frontier,

innovation may be necessary to break new ground. But if you’re in

a mature industry, imitation may be the faster path to performance

gains. Imitation is not failure. It is strategic adaptation. Knowing when

to imitate can save resources, reduce risk, and accelerate impact. The

challenge for managers is to diagnose where they are and then conﬁgure

the organization accordingly. Whether the answer is innovation or

imitation, success depends on aligning structure, talent, routines, and

# timing to the task at hand.
