## Alongside meetings, job interviews, and even social events, layoﬀs

have entered the virtual era. It was, after all, inevitable. In a recent

McKinsey study, 35 percent of respondents reported that they were able

to work remotely full time. Logic follows that when someone works

remotely, they can be laid oﬀ remotely, too.

But this doesn’t give managers and company leaders a pass on handling

the matter without sensitivity and compassion. In fact, it means the

opposite. As familiar as most of us now are with platforms like Zoom

and Webex, expressing emotion and reassurance on them does not

come easily for many of us. This is problematic as so much is at stake

when employees are being laid oﬀ.

If your team is preparing to announce layoﬀs virtually, calculated

preparation for your executive team is critical. This isn’t just

another Zoom meeting; this is an announcement that aﬀects people’s

livelihoods and the future of your organization. Not only do

executives risk losing the conﬁdence of remaining employees and other

stakeholders, but they could also make headlines for heartless “Zoom

## ﬁrings” and face backlash on social media.

## Yet, with the proper preparation, an executive can eﬀectively and

compassionately address layoﬀs online. Here’s how your team should

prepare for and deliver the virtual announcements.

# Block out rehearsal time.

Layoﬀ preparation should not be rushed. Skimming a script that has been written by a communications team is not suﬃcient preparation.

Yet too often, this is what I see executives do. Instead, remember the

elementary school mantra: practice makes perfect.

Once the announcement date is on the calendar, block out rehearsal

time, ideally a few days before the announcement. Use this time to

make sure the messaging is written and approved by legal several days

before the announcement, and that you have ample time to review the

script, make any changes, and read through it several times.

You may think you don’t need that much time to prepare — but you

do need it. You must be comfortable with the material to come oﬀ as

conﬁdent, calm, and trustworthy. You also need time to break down the

talk into bullet points and know exactly what to convey at each point.

If you are going to read a script or use a teleprompter, you’ll need

several rehearsals before audiences will trust your delivery as authentic.

Alternatively, you can secure Post-It notes to your computer monitor or

place a second monitor behind the camera with bullet points to stay on

# point.

Visualization exercises are key.

It’s diﬃcult to deliver a message online, where you don’t have a

physical audience to make an emotional connection with. To create that

emotional connection on Zoom, you’ll need to visualize the audience.

To do this, think about the following:

- Where is the audience watching from? Home? The oﬃce?

- Who’s with them? Their families? Colleagues?

- What will they feel as they hear the news?

- What are their immediate concerns?

- What will they ask that I can address right away?

- What fear can I alleviate?

You might take this a step further by creating “avatars” who represent

key employees, such as a 45-year-old father of three kids or a 63-year-

old woman nearing retirement. You can pretend you’re talking directly

to these speciﬁc employees, refer to their fears, and attempt to alleviate

# them.

Watch your body language.

Body language is important. Your audience will be watching for signs

that you’re nervous. If you play with your wedding ring, move your

glasses, touch your face, scratch your beard, or shift or swivel in your

chair, they may take this as a sign that they shouldn’t have conﬁdence

in you. Instead, to appear more engaged, try leaning toward the camera

# just a bit.

Many executives have been coached not to use their hands when

speaking. This is terrible advice, as our hands help to convey emotion

and passion. If we’re restricted from using them, we can appear stiﬀ.

Particularly pertinent to this conversation, when we keep our hands out

of view, it can suggest we’re hiding something. For all these reasons,

you should feel encouraged to use your hands naturally when you’re

# speaking.

Look directly at the camera.

Getting the camera shot right is also crucial. The camera should be

at eye level. If the camera is lower than your face, you will look

overbearing. If the camera is too high, you will look meek. While

speaking, look straight into the camera — not at the individual audience

members appearing in boxes on the screen. This allows you to maintain

# eye contact with every employee.

The exception to this rule is if you take questions after the

announcement. In this case, you should look into the computer monitor

at the employees while they’re asking questions. This is natural and will

help you “read the room.”

Remember to breathe.

It’s understandable to be nervous in a meeting like this; you’re probably

bringing in a lot of your own emotions and you might feel angry or

embarrassed. It’s important to remember to breathe. Not only will it

help you do your job, but anxiety can dramatically alter one’s voice. To

project strength and conﬁdence, it’s essential to try to counteract this

# through proper breathing.

Before you begin your announcement, take a deep belly breath that

engages the diaphragm and expands your stomach. Do it again after the

ﬁrst two or three sentences. And keep doing it. Without these breaths,

you won’t get full lung capacity, and the words at the end of your

sentences may get cut oﬀ as you run out of breath. This will make you

# sound less conﬁdent.

Supporting employees when they need it most.

Layoﬀs are never easy; they’re even harder when you’re doing them

right, by thinking about the people who will be impacted by job losses and insecurity. Adding in to the mix the diﬃculties of virtual

communication makes it even harder.

Yet, with the proper preparation, mindset, and body language, your leadership team can deliver diﬃcult news eﬀectively and

compassionately. When you deliver the message well, former employees

will feel supported and respected. Meanwhile, the remaining employees

will feel motivated to keep working because you made them trust the

company is going in the right direction.
