Workplace anxiety is on the rise. Starting in the fall of 2022, layoﬀs

began in the tech industry and started spreading more widely. These

cuts, paired with continued uncertainty about the economy and the

future of work, have left employees understandably skittish.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: Remote Workers Are More Anxious About Layoffs

Over the past year at Humu, we’ve analyzed employee engagement

## survey responses and behavioral data from more than 80,000

employees. In a recent study, 89% of human resources leaders told

us that their teams have recently voiced concerns about job security,

leadership changes, or reorgs. Anxiety also seems to be driving what

employees want most: Half of workers prioritized job stability over both

# a higher salary and career growth.

But what struck us most were the notable diﬀerences between the

responses of in-person and remote team members. Remote employees

were 32% more likely to feel anxious in the wake of news about layoﬀs

and were far more concerned about getting a new manager during a

reorg. And 67% said this anxiety had an impact on their productivity. People who go to the oﬃce at least some of the time — whether that be

hybrid or fully in person — were 24% less likely to say that uncertainty

has impacted their productivity over the past six months.

It makes sense that employees who spend less (or no) time in person

with leadership, their manager, and their team might lose out on an

## important social buﬀer against workplace stress.

But the answer is not to force everyone back into the oﬃce. Our research

shows that people really want remote opportunities: 50% of employees

say that remote work is a top priority for them in their next role, while

only 4% would seek out fully in person work.

So how can organizations continue to oﬀer the ﬂexible work

arrangements top talent wants — and mitigate anxiety among remote

workers? The key is to train managers to foster a strong sense of

## inclusion within their distributed teams.

Creating the conditions for wellbeing and productivity in a remote or hybrid setting can initially seem diﬃcult. Managing a dispersed team

requires diﬀerent skills than some managers may have used before,

which might make it seem harder. But with focus and practice, it gets

# easier.

Here are ﬁve ways managers can reduce anxiety — and boost

## performance — among remote and hybrid workers.

Put chit-chat on the agenda.

When everyone works in the same oﬃce, it’s easier to get to know one

another while making small talk in the kitchen or walking to and from

meetings. Because remote workers don’t have access to these casual

collisions, building relational trust in a distributed setting requires

# structure.

An easy way to combat aﬃnity distance, or the emotional separation

that can crop up between remote team members, is to dedicate the ﬁrst

ﬁve minutes of team meetings to a shared ritual. Have everyone say

something they’re excited about or try “High, Low, Ha,” where each

## person talks through one highlight from their week, one low point, and

one thing that made them laugh.

Our remote team at Humu kicks oﬀ meetings by asking something light-

hearted and easy to answer — and we rotate whose responsibility it is to

come up with the question. We’ve bonded over prompts like “What food

is underrated?” and “You have ﬁve seconds to grab an object. Then share

with the group what it is and why it’s in your home.” These activities

make work relationships feel less transactional and create a social buﬀer

# against unnecessary anxiety.

# Create cross-functional connections.

Dispersed employees tend to lack shared context, from body language to

shared kitchen snacks to inside jokes. They also often have less visibility

into what’s happening across teams, which can lead to confusion and an

“us vs. them” attitude between functions.

Managers should look to build bridges with other teams in their

organization. Try to create opportunities for remote employees to work

on cross-functional projects (people tend to feel closest to the people

they work with the most) or connect your team members to people

from another department for informal chats. You might say something

like, “Tracy, Kim’s expertise is related to what you’ve been focusing on.

Why not set up time with her this week to get her thoughts? Happy

to make the intro.” You can also regularly host colleagues from other

departments at your team meeting to talk about their work, how your

teams partner, and what they’re excited to learn from your reports.

Finally, make it a priority to take notes during important meetings

and share them, either in a folder or summarized in a public channel.

Among hybrid and virtual teams, careful documentation is especially

important in boosting performance and trust.

Make a list, and check it twice.

It’s easy to fall into the “out-of-sight, out-of-mind” trap when you don’t

have much in-person time with your team. In other words, you’re more

likely to reach out to the people you’ve worked with the longest or who

speak up the most in team meetings. This bias can lead you to measure

and reward access rather than performance.

To combat this bias, when you’re evaluating who to delegate work to

or who might be best suited for an exciting opportunity, don’t just

go with the ﬁrst person who pops into your head. Write down every

single person on your team. Carefully review your list and consider

each individual’s strengths and areas where they might need (or want)

development. Then make a more informed, intentional decision.

Think carefully about how you use 1:1 time.

Our research shows that 49% of employees feel anxious before 1:1s with

their manager. These meetings oﬀer a great opportunity to intervene

and try to alleviate your team’s anxiety, but you might need to

reconsider how you run them.

Do you ask check-in questions (think: “How can I best support you?” or

“Is anything unclear or blocking your work?”) and seek input from your

reports? You can do a lot to calm an insecure employee by saying, “Your

skills are very unique and important to this company, and I value your

opinion and expertise. What do you think of this?”

If you focus your 1:1s on status updates, you miss out on a valuable

opportunity to better understand and support your people. Worse, you

inadvertently send the message that you only care about pressing tasks

and to-do’s, which can leave your team feeling expendable and stressed.

Think about whether there are alternative channels (think email or

Slack threads) in which you can get status updates.

Reflect on how you show up as a manager.

As a manager, you have an outsize impact on how employees feel

in their day-to-day–and on what they feel safe sharing. A big part of

your job is to create an environment in which each team member feels

comfortable being genuine and ﬂagging concerns.

# Ask yourself:

- Are members of my team asking questions or surfacing issues?

- When I communicate a decision, do I also share why and how it was

made?

- Have I ever opened up about what I’m feeling to a direct report?

If you’re only getting positive feedback, especially when things are

uncertain and employees are undoubtedly feeling anxious, you should

be concerned. Aim to provide more transparency where you can, and to

set the tone for conversations by sharing what you’re experiencing. You

don’t need to suddenly become an open book, but saying something as

simple as, “I know there’s been a lot of change lately, and that can be

stressful. I’m feeling it, too,” can go a long way.

By focusing on the actions outlined above, managers can connect

## remote and hybrid team members to each and to the larger

organization, making them feel more included and less anxious.
