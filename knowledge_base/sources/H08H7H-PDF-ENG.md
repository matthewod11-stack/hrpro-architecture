Increasingly, employers are rolling back the remote work arrangements

instituted during the Covid-19 pandemic. Companies such as Starbucks,

## Walmart, Google, JP Morgan Chase, and Amazon have called employees

back into the oﬃce — some even mandating a ﬁve-day-a-week return-

# to-oﬃce (RTO) schedule.

When announcing this change, leaders often say they are doing so to

enable collaboration that can only happen in person. When Starbucks’

former CEO Howard Schultz called for his employees to return to

their oﬃces for at least three days of the week, he said the decision

was motivated by work that demanded “the kind of thinking, daring

collaboration, [and] courageous conversations that cannot be done on

Teams calls, or in just pre-scheduled meetings.”

Behind statements like Schultz’s is a strong body of research

in communications and social psychology that provides evidence

supporting the notion that remote communication is less rich than in-

oﬃce communication. And some management research suggests that

employees who primarily work remotely tend to have less trusting and

## less close relationships with their coworkers.

Yet the decision to bring employees back into the oﬃce is not a simple

one. Other research shows — and many employees came to realize during the pandemic — that productivity and performance do not suﬀer

when working remotely. Further, employees are actually happier and

less likely to leave their jobs when they have remote or hybrid work

# arrangements.

As management researchers, we were perplexed by the RTO mandates.

If leaders believe that in-person collaboration is essential to strong

work relationships and thus organizational success, how do we make

sense of ﬁndings that remote work does not decrease productivity and may also oﬀer additional value to organizations? To investigate this, we

questioned the widely-held assumption that interacting remotely hurts

# coworker relationships.

Journal, draws upon archival, ﬁeld, and experimental studies to

examine how the glimpses of coworkers’ nonwork lives seen through video calls aﬀect relationships. We found that these virtual interactions

can make employees see each other as more authentic, human,

and trustworthy — all qualities that lead to stronger personal and

professional bonds. Our work provides a more balanced view into the

inﬂuence of remote work on how employees relate with each other. We draw upon our ﬁndings to oﬀer research-backed suggestions to

managers grappling with the potential beneﬁts — and costs — of RTO

# mandates.

How working from home provides a window into coworkers’ worlds

## While much of the research on remote work and coworker relationships

assumes that remote work makes coworkers feel more distance from

each other, we examined another possibility: We tested whether remote

work makes coworkers feel closer by allowing them to learn nonwork

## information about each other in a new way.

Drawing on previous research, including our own, that explores how

and why learning nonwork information about coworkers beneﬁts

relationships, we theorized that working from home makes it more

likely that coworkers will learn about each other in three important

# ways:

- 1. They will learn more nonwork information about each other.

- 2. They will learn information about each other that is seen as being

shared in less intentional ways.

- 3. Because they are working in video meetings, they will learn this

## nonwork, unintentional information about each other in a more

vivid, dynamic way — visually, auditorily, etc. — than if they were

to tell each other this information when in an oﬃce.

Imagine for example that a colleague’s toddler bounds into view during

a video meeting, vividly bringing attention to that colleague’s role as a

parent. We hypothesized that learning about a coworker’s nonwork life

in this unintentional and vivid way would lead employees to see their

coworkers as more authentic, trustworthy, and human, thus motivating

them to invest in that coworker both personally (i.e., friendship) and

# professionally.

In our ﬁrst study, we sought to examine employees’ real-life experiences

regarding what they learn about their colleagues when working from

home. We asked 286 full-time, U.S.-based employees to describe a time

when they were working from home and learned something new about

their coworkers. What did they learn? How did they learn it? How did it

make them feel about their colleague?

We also systematically analyzed online comments related to remote

work and interpersonal relationships, including 8,150 on Reddit, 5,772

## on Twitter, 14,625 on LinkedIn, and 40,551 comments across 10 news

stories related to interpersonal learning. We found that employees

learned a variety of nonwork- and work-related information, including

how their coworkers parent, what their coworkers do in their free time,

and what their coworkers’ religion or political values are.

Building on this qualitative study, we designed experiments to test

our hypotheses. We asked 1,244 full-time, U.S.-based employees in

one study and 413 in another study to watch a simulated video

meeting alongside a new virtual “coworker” and to collaborate with this

coworker on a task during that meeting. Over the course of the call,

participants learned various work and nonwork information about their new colleague in diﬀerent ways. For example, some participants learned

that their coworker had a dog or child because the dog or child ran into

the room during the meeting. Others learned that their coworker had a

dog or child because they were told so by the coworker.

When we analyzed our data, we found that when employees learned

information about the coworker that was more vivid (visual or auditory),

perceived as unintentional, and nonwork-related — all ways of learning

that are more likely when working from home — they were more likely

to invest in their personal (i.e., pursue friendship) and professional (i.e.,

pursue future work collaborations) relationships with that coworker. We found that eﬀect was largely driven by seeing that coworker as more

# trustworthy, authentic, and human.

# Considerations for Managers

Based on our research, we oﬀer suggestions to help managers think

through the when’s, why’s, and if’s about bringing employees together

# in-person:

Change your mindset about how remote work affects coworker relationships

It’s easy to assume that working from home does not beneﬁt employees’

relationships with each other because it’s been the prevailing narrative

since the inception of remote work. Our research shows that this

mindset isn’t necessarily true. Taken together with accounts of

employees leaving their companies when being forced to return-to-

oﬃce, this mindset may actually harm your employees’ loyalty to your

organization. Thus, the ﬁrst step in thinking about when and why

employees should be together in-person is to push back against this

prevailing mindset and instead, think through how working remotely

may beneﬁt your employees’ relationships in ways that being in the

# oﬃce cannot.

## Lean into the relational potential in your remote business practices

Once you have changed your mindset, you can start to see remote work

## as a generator of employee relationships rather than as an impediment.

Our research shows that over video meetings, coworkers can learn

new nonwork information about each other in ways that beneﬁt their

relationships more than the traditional ways employees learn about one

another in the oﬃce (e.g., by telling each other about themselves or even

connecting on social media).

Based on our research, we suggest two ways you can easily start tapping

## into the relational potential of your remote business practices:

- 1. Role model ways that show (rather than just tell) nonwork

related information. For example, you might unblur your own

video meeting background. This is an easy way to make your

employees see that doing so is not only accepted but encouraged.

Through this modeling, you are encouraging employees to unblur

their backgrounds and let coworkers get a glimpse into their real life

in a less ﬁltered way. For example, an employee who rock climbs

might just leave their rock-climbing gear hanging behind them, rather

than scurrying to put it away and tidy the camera view.

- 2. Create spaces for your employees to vividly share nonwork

related details with each other. This might mean carving out some

time during team meetings to introduce team members to each other in a diﬀerent way. Provide a prompt — what is a favorite song, band,

food, experience — and allow the conversation to ﬂow between your

employees, encourage them to show beloved books or souvenirs.

You can increase the vividness of this sharing by creating a team

## playlist of favorite songs or a space to share photos of experiences

outside of work.While our research shows that a curated experience

like this may be less impactful than learning nonwork information in

an unintentional way, members of our author team have published

other research that shows that learning any nonwork information can

be a good thing for both your personal and professional relationships.

Focus RTO strategies on tasks and the types of relationships you want to build

Now that you have seen the relational potential in your virtual business

practices, you can rethink your RTO plans. We suggest that there are two

questions to ask yourself:

- 1. Does the work need in-person interaction? Given that our research

shows that working remotely can beneﬁt coworker relationships,

the narrative that bringing people back to the oﬃce to beneﬁt

relationships does not tell the full story. Instead of focusing your

RTO strategy on the people side of bringing people back together

in person, focus your strategy on the work itself. What would

interactions between employees look like to best support the work

that needs to be done? If it is a brainstorming session that requires

liveliness that you think can only be captured in-person, then perhaps

you want to bring people together in-person to create that spark. If

it is a working session that requires everyone to be on their laptops,

that task may be better done remotely. The last thing you want is

employees commuting into the oﬃce to spend their day logging into

video meetings with colleagues just down the hall. It is important

to recognize that not all tasks require in-person collaboration, and

that working-from-home can provide beneﬁts that being in the oﬃce

simply cannot provide, for both coworker relationships and beyond.

Our main point is that your return-to-work strategy should center on

how your employees relate to each other in terms of what is best for

# the work itself.

- 2. What type of relationships do you want your employees to build?

While our research showed that individual coworker relationships

can beneﬁt from interacting virtually when working from home,

we recognize that managers might also want to build relationships

between groups of people or between people who may not interact

via video meetings; for example, employees who do not work with

each other regularly. If you are thinking about a strategy for the latter,

merely being in the oﬃce every day is unlikely to build the strong

relationships that are desired. When people are in the oﬃce, they

tend to interact only with those who are situated physically close

to them. Indeed, one of our experiments showed that sharing can

be vivid and perceived as less intentional when learning in-person

as well. Think about a very intentional and strategic return-to-oﬃce

strategy where you focus your in-oﬃce time on “moments that

matter” that elicit the type of learning about coworkers – learning

that is vivid, seen as unintentionally shared, and about nonwork

# information.

. . .

Our research shows that the decision to RTO can’t solely be about

building better and stronger relationships because working from home

can beneﬁt coworker relationships in ways that working in the oﬃce

cannot. Thus, while there is a certain magic to being in-person that

we haven’t yet ﬁgured out how to fully replicate virtually, there is

also a magic to working-from-home —perhaps being able to switch the

laundry while you learn new information about your coworkers. This is

a magic that many employees have felt and are not happy about losing,

suggesting that managers may want to be strategic in their RTO policies

and capitalize on the upsides of working remotely.
