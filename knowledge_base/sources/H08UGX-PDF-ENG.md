Why Leaders Should Bring Their Best Self—Not Their Whole Self—to Work Being authentic isn’t always the same as being effective. by Tomas Chamorro- Premuzic

Few corporate mantras have spread more widely—and aged worse—

than the exhortation to “bring your whole self to work.” Initially coined

to promote psychological safety and inclusion, the phrase has since

morphed into a rallying cry for radical transparency and unchecked

self-expression. While often well intentioned, this advice becomes not

just misguided but actively dangerous when applied to those in senior

# leadership roles.

For frontline employees, some degree of unﬁltered authenticity may be

harmless, if not welcome. After all, it is generally better to identify with

your work persona than to experience a Marxist sense of alienation.

But the C-suite is not group therapy, nor a live TikTok session. The

higher you climb, the more your personal whims, biases, and blind

spots can reverberate across the entire organization—and the more

essential it becomes to maintain a clear boundary between what your

role demands and who you are “deep down” (which, incidentally, may

be hard to understand even if you endure decades of psychotherapy).

## Power Makes People Weird (and Uninhibited)

As I illustrate in my forthcoming book, Don’t Be Yourself: Why

## Authenticity Is Overrated (and What to Do Instead), decades of

psychological research studies show that power diminishes inhibition,

weakens empathy, reduces self-control and any sense of obligation to

others, and ampliﬁes the toxic traits leaders already possess. Dacher

Keltner’s “power paradox” shows how those who rise through prosocial

behaviors often abandon them once they’re in charge. When combined

with the modern cult of authenticity, the result is a boardroom version

# of a reality television show.

Authenticity is the modern leader’s favorite cologne: applied heavily,

performed loudly, and often confused for actual depth. Some executives

have turned “no ﬁlter” into a leadership style, sharing impulsive

thoughts on everything from economic policy to workplace culture, as if

billion-dollar decisions were shower epiphanies. Others have embraced

a cult-of-personality approach, mixing spiritual jargon with corporate

jargon, hosting barefoot meetings, and launching co-living ventures

that blur the line between oﬃce and home. These utopian setups,

## complete with curated aesthetics, communal kitchens, and wall-to-wall

motivational quotes, sell the illusion of connection while engineering

curated loneliness under the guise of community.

Even the more polished types aren’t immune. Some CEOs broadcast

## their philosophies on capitalism, climate, and company values like

corporate shamans, while micromanaging team channels with fatherly

fervor. Others conﬂate personal ideology with brand identity, pouring

politics, marketing, and ambition into a single, steaming cup of

performative leadership. These aren’t just magnetic personalities,

they’re evidence of a larger phenomenon: When personal branding

eclipses professional discipline, organizations are left with a front-row

seat to their leader’s inner monologue. And the rest of us often have no

choice but to listen.

## Why Boundaries Between Leaders’ Personal and Professional Identities Are Crucial

Being authentic isn’t the same as being eﬀective. In fact, psychological science suggests that the most eﬀective leaders are anything but

unﬁltered. Here are four key, evidence-based reasons why boundaries

between personal and professional identity are critical in the C-suite:

- 1. Oversharing dilutes authority.

Leaders are not paid to process their feelings in public. Their job is to

## project clarity, competence, and conﬁdence—especially under pressure.

Emotional vulnerability can be humanizing in small, controlled doses.

But regular oversharing creates confusion, erodes credibility, and can

even undermine organizational stability. To be sure, no leader will

convince people they are worthy of following if they regularly engage

## in inappropriate self-disclosure, particularly on social media.

Tim Judge’s seminal meta-analysis found that leaders who frequently

display negative emotions are seen as less competent and less stable. Moreover, this study found that the most eﬀective leaders are agreeable

## (polite), conscientious (self-controlled), and curious (more interested in

others than in treating others like an audience). While some expressions

of emotion may build rapport, too much transparency blurs the line

between leader and peer, diminishing the professional distance that

## inspires (rational) conﬁdence and respect.

In short, if you’re feeling overwhelmed, call your therapist—not an all-

# hands meeting.

- 2. Personal values can be divisive.

The modern executive is increasingly expected to take public stances

## on everything from geopolitical crises to cultural controversies. But as

NYU’s Alison Taylor argues in her brilliant book Higher Ground, such

moral grandstanding often backﬁres, sowing division rather than unity.

Values, by deﬁnition, are polarizing. And while it’s tempting to think

that leaders should be moral compasses, the workplace is not a church,

and employees are not a congregation. When a CEO speaks out on

contentious issues, they may win applause from one faction but alienate

another. This is especially problematic in global organizations, where

ideological diversity is the norm, not the exception.

A more productive approach is to lead with values that are universally

## applicable in a professional context—like fairness, transparency, or

respect—rather than parading one’s personal beliefs about every news

headline. You don’t need to tweet your virtue to lead virtuously.

- 3. Emotional intelligence is a form of impression management.

Authenticity is often conﬂated with honesty. But in leadership,

what matters more is emotional intelligence: the ability to manage

your own emotions and inﬂuence the emotions of others. Ironically,

emotional intelligence requires a great deal of inauthenticity—at least if

authenticity means expressing your unﬁltered self.

## Meta-analytic research conﬁrms that emotional intelligence and

impression management are conceptually and empirically intertwined.

In fact, the best leaders are those who act like skilled performers,

calibrating their tone, demeanor, and message to ﬁt the moment. This

isn’t manipulative; it’s professional.

Being true to yourself sounds noble until your “true self” is irritable,

arrogant, or impulsive. Your colleagues are not responsible for enduring

your mood swings, no matter how real they are. Leadership is a

performance. The stakes are too high for improv.

- 4. Everyone has a dark side—best keep it contained.

Every personality has a shadow. Known in organizational psychology as

the “dark side,” these are traits like narcissism, paranoia, or aggression

that may emerge under stress or pressure. They can be adaptive in

# moderation, but toxic in excess.

Unfortunately, power tends to unmask these traits. The more senior

your role, the more license you have to indulge your worst instincts,

unless you’re actively managing them. Studies suggest that many

executives display dark side traits, such as being overly bold (a

euphemism for psychopathic) or self-important (to the point of being

narcissistic). That doesn’t mean they’re evil. But it does mean their

natural impulses need to be tightly regulated. Indeed, 40% of leaders

score high enough on one or two dark side traits to risk derailing their

careers (and the careers of the people they manage).

Your whole self includes your biases, your pettiness, your need to win

arguments at dinner. At home, that might be tolerable (if you’re lucky,

but we should feel sorry for those who put up with it). At work, it’s an

HR nightmare. Boundaries aren’t repressive; they’re responsible.

## Practical Ways to Set (and Keep) Boundaries at Work

So what’s a leader to do? The goal is not to be robotic or disingenuous

(though, contrary to popular belief, that is often a sign of leadership

competence), but to be strategic about what you reveal, and when.

Research shows that authenticity, especially in leadership, is less a

ﬁxed trait and more an attribution—something others perceive rather

than something objectively measurable. People tend to judge leaders as

authentic when they display consistency, predictability, and empathy—

qualities that signal coherence between words, actions, and presumed

# values.

## Ironically, however, this perception often results not from uninhibited

self-expression, but from deliberate self-regulation. Leaders seen as most “authentic” are usually those who invest signiﬁcant eﬀort

in managing impressions, curating their emotional displays, and

suppressing their less-admirable impulses. In this sense, authenticity

becomes a sophisticated form of method acting: a performance honed

over time to embody the version of oneself others ﬁnd believable and

trustworthy. Here are ﬁve practices that can help:

- 1. Curate, don’t conceal. Eﬀective leaders don’t suppress their identity; they select the parts that

serve the mission. Sharing a personal story that reinforces a company

value? Smart. Venting about your divorce in a town hall? Not so much.

- 2. Regulate before you relate.

Self-awareness and self-control are prerequisites for leadership

competence. Before reacting, pause. Before responding, breathe.

## Especially in high-stakes moments, composure communicates strength.

- 3. Model values, don’t perform them.

Skip the performative LinkedIn posts. Digital virtue signaling may get

lots of likes and shares, but it is a meaningless strategy for improving

your business performance and risks backﬁring unless you have the

actions and facts to back it up. Instead, let people infer your values from

how you behave. A consistent record of ethical decision-making says

# more than a dozen tweets.

- 4. Protect your personal life. Executives are not obligated to be “on” 24/7. Protect your oﬀ-hours, avoid oversharing online, and model work-life boundaries that others

can emulate.

- 5. Choose empathy over ego.

Great leaders make others feel seen. That means listening more than

talking, asking more than telling, and holding space for perspectives that diﬀer from your own. This aligns with the powerful science of

listening at work, especially for leaders.

The Job Isn’t to Be Yourself. It’s to Be Useful.

Leadership is a role, not a right. It demands discipline, foresight, and

the humility to recognize that your feelings are not the organization’s

moral compass. In an age that gloriﬁes mindless authenticity, the most responsible leaders are those who spend a great deal of eﬀort and

attention on harnessing a positive professional reputation—one that is

## more representative of their best self than their authentic, real, or whole

# self.
