As an unprecedented number of people began working from home

## during the early months of the Covid-19 pandemic, my HBR colleagues

and I wondered what this shift would mean—and what core aspects of

the oﬃce might survive.

We reached out to Jennifer Magnolﬁ Astill, a leading researcher on

the evolution of workspaces and human-machine collaboration, to put

these changes into perspective. Five years later, we did the same thing,

but with a slightly diﬀerent aim. Now that we’ve seen half-a-decade of

remote and hybrid work take form, what have we gained? What have we

lost? And what do we really need oﬃces for?

My conversation with Magnolﬁ Astill helped me put into context where

RTO mandates are going wrong, why in-person connection is still

important, and what kinds of work are best done face-to-face. This

interview has been edited for clarity.

We ﬁrst interviewed you back in 2020 about the shift to remote

work brought on by Covid-19. It’s been ﬁve years: What aspects of

this shift were along the lines of what you thought might happen?

What aspects surprised you?

When we last spoke, I expected that we would see a fast and widespread

adoption of digital tools across industries and that this would expand

## our collective notion of an “ideal” workplace.

As we now know, the adoption of digital tools by the mainstream

workforce became a norm during the pandemic (think of Zoom’s 326%

growth in the year 2021 alone). Since then, the communication patterns

they enabled as part of daily work have also had lasting, long-term

# impact.

Speciﬁcally, the use of these tools at scale has resulted in a structural

## shift in the mainstream deﬁnition of “workspace”—namely, the

## individual’s speciﬁc work environment and the tools and resources that

are used to do the work. Prior to 2020, the idea that work could happen

anywhere was largely associated with tech and younger workers; it

was something not strictly necessary and thus somewhat theoretical

for many organizations. In ﬁguring out how to enable successful work

from anywhere during the “forced work experiment” of the pandemic,

organizations learned ﬁrsthand what this shift in workspace dynamic

would entail in concrete terms. The new knowledge developed in

this process changed perceptions and enriched our notions of what a

workspace could be. For many, this wasn’t just a response to a moment

in time, but an experience that shaped workplace culture entirely. A

point of no return, as we said last time.

Two outcomes, however, have surprised me.

The ﬁrst was people reconsidering the value they placed on their work,

their time, and how to spend both. The second was the exacerbation

of something younger adults and teenagers were already experiencing,

which extended to other generations: isolation. Studies have repeatedly

shown a high correlation between time spent on screens or social media

and an increase in rates of depression and perceived isolation—the

levels of which by 2023, the U.S. Surgeon General termed a public health

# crisis.

Why is this important for how we understand workplaces today?

The workplace is at its core a relational construct. It isn’t just an

oﬃce building or a digital network linking colleagues and work data.

It’s both and more. As a marketplace, its two important currencies

are productivity and social capital. As a social community, the critical

component is trust, which informs communication, collaboration, and

cohesion in work teams and sense of belonging to the organization.

The pandemic acted as a magnifying glass—it brought into view edge

conditions that were not really part of the mainstream world of work prior to it. It allowed us to experience the impact (and trade-oﬀs)

of “work from anywhere” enabled by technology. It also allowed us to experience ﬁrst-hand the impact (and trade-oﬀs) of constantly

interacting in the digital space as the primary mode of connection with

# others.

This second issue is particularly important and complex. While the

success of organizations in the future will largely depend on their ability

to integrate technology, particularly human work with machine work,

into all aspects of business (consider the emergence of the CAIO role or

the recent advances in gen AI), there is a lot more that needs to be done

to build and sustain the social connections and social fabric of our work

communities. The challenge for companies is in balancing the very real

## beneﬁts of a more technologically-connected human workforce with the

long-term impact that technology has on people and how they relate to

# one another.

This reminds me of something you often hear from CEOs about

why employees need to go back to working in oﬃces at least a

## few days a week, if not entirely: the importance of face-to-face

collaboration. (Amazon is a recent case.) Is that the only way to

truly connect with others? Or, can remote or hybrid work enable

# those connections as well?

There are certain aspects of work, like collaboration, learning,

socialization, creative problem-solving, and complex decision-making,

that are optimized by being in the same space with others. These

experiences have a direct impact on reinforcing the social infrastructure

of a group or organization over time and increases levels of solidarity

## and cohesion in teams, both essential elements of group performance.

My own experience studying high-performing technology teams (i.e.,

in robotics competitions) has shown that when facing a particularly

complex problem to solve, teams almost instinctively organize

themselves to work together in physical proximity in order to integrate

diverse perspectives faster and to better achieve innovative solutions.

In other words, to win. To be sure, over the entire lifecycle of a

robotics project, many activities can be workspace agnostic, with work

happening anywhere. And team members’ social bonds are fostered and

maintained through various points of connectivity which we now would

call hybrid—both online and in-person experiences. But what holds

the team together throughout is a shared mental model of achieving a

# higher collective goal.

This is where we need a reframe, as many leaders in organizations are

ﬁghting an uphill battle in the “return to the oﬃce” debate. The variable

to focus on is time—this is not so much how many days to be in an oﬃce

each week, but rather the stability and growth of an organization as a

# work community in years ahead.

So, some amount of in-person collaboration and workspaces are key for both solving speciﬁc problems and vital for the long-term

# culture of a company?

Yes, and it’s useful to remember that solving this was less complex

before the pandemic. For example, ﬁve years ago, technology

organizations would ask me, “How do we make our oﬃces perform

better for the future workforce?” The industry’s own history had

shown that if you took two tech companies, with Company A having

## a mediocre workspace and Company B with a space speciﬁcally

designed for optimizing interaction and collaboration, Company B

would outperform A. There are ways to manipulate the design of an

oﬃce for certain goals and it’s possible to measure this performance.

## But the importance of the physical space as the stage for social

interaction was never in question prior to the pandemic, so much so

that, historically, tech oﬃces have been beautifully designed with iconic

features, perks, and incentives to attract/retain talent, setting the “ideal

## oﬃce” standard for younger generations across industries.

## The challenge that many companies, and tech in particular, face

## today renders this historical fact as almost a secondary consideration.

Organizations are striving to ﬁgure out how to get people back in the

oﬃce in a way that isn’t transactional (“I do my job and I go home”)

or stiﬂed by negotiating complex and legitimate points of friction (“I’m

a senior leader, I’ve earned the right to work from home” or “I’m a

young worker and very proﬁcient with technology so I can be productive

from anywhere,” etc.). It’s hard to create a shared value proposition

in returning to the oﬃce that is compelling or enticing enough when

compared to the radical ﬂexibility that working from home allows.

So, today, you might decide to bring people back to the great workspace

in Company B, but if 1) the social contract has changed; 2) individuals

(particularly younger workers) haven’t experienced the value of IRL

## work experiences for their own professional and personal growth; or

- 3) workers aren’t connected to a higher collective company goal, then

the space won’t necessarily come to life. It may objectively be a great

physical workspace, but the environment will feel lifeless.

In other words, oﬃce perks mean something diﬀerent today,

and simply adding them back won’t solve companies’ biggest

workplace challenges alone.

Correct. Collaboration, innovation, or serendipitous interactions don’t

happen as a function of the physical space. Physical space can either

enable or inhibit certain outcomes, but it isn’t the cause. On its own,

a workspace can inspire through beauty and can even elevate your

aspirations (think of the symbolic value the corner oﬃce had for older

## generations), but obviously so can many other environments outside of

# the oﬃce.

My research with technology teams has often shown how even an

environment that for all intents and purposes would not seem to be

suited, let alone designed for work (think of startups in garages or early

makeshift coworking labs) can become veritable innovation hubs. What

## transforms even a mediocre physical environment (Company A) into a

thriving space for innovation is the people in it and what brings and

keeps them there—together.

## After the pandemic, and its impact on our epidemic of loneliness

and isolation, it seems timely to acknowledge that we need to make

a signiﬁcant investment in rebuilding the social fabric and social

infrastructure of our organizations ﬁrst, or at least in parallel with evaluating eﬀorts for the return to the oﬃce. In this respect, the physical

workspace is seen as a unique tool to be strategically leveraged in

enabling that long rebuilding process.

What are your recommendations for the role of physical

# workspaces in this rebuilding?

First, for hybrid work contexts, I would encourage the use of the

physical oﬃce to align with project development phases for teams,

instead of a set number of days a week for the entire work population.

Prior to the pandemic, most remote/distributed teams considered it good practice to have yearly team oﬀ-sites: in-person gatherings that

focused the collective group’s activities around a speciﬁc purpose

that also strengthened the overall group’s bonding and socialization.

Something similar often happens at conferences, where the physical

experience of the event brings together the group of attendees as a

community, and the yearly rhythm of the event creates expectations of

future points of connection and goals. In a similar way, it is possible to

envision the use of a corporate oﬃce as an element that is introduced

## at critical points in the lifecycle of a project, speciﬁcally when the

team would beneﬁt most from continuous periods of focused in-person

# collaboration.

For example, envisioning and planning at the beginning, and testing

and launch at the end of a project, are such moments for an R&D

initiative. This could entail organizing the team’s work to take place in

the oﬃce for these phases as four to six continuous weeks of ﬁve days a

week, transitioning back to remote or hybrid work when certain phases

are completed. Envisioning the use of workspace over a 12 month cycle, for example, aﬀords managers longer lead times for structuring

collaborative team initiatives and gives employees more agency in

planning their work time in and out of the oﬃce. When scaled across

teams, this sets up a rhythm to the use of the workspace as a tool

supporting critical moments during team projects, while increasing the

## use of the real estate asset across the organization.

Second, I would encourage organizations to prioritize the utilization

## of in-person work in work functions with the highest potential for

increasing social connection and social capital across the organization.

In my experience, these include enabling complex problem-solving and

## cross-generational learning and upskilling.

Because interactions in the physical world require that we bring

our whole physical person to them, they also allow for richer

## knowledge exchange—many more channels of input and output if

you will, like non-verbal cues and communication, body language,

## physical proximity, voice levels, nuance of expressions, etc. And

as we know, complex problem-solving and decision-making in

organizations increasingly happens through being able to integrate diﬀerent perspectives while evaluating diﬀerent angles of a problem (represented by diﬀerent voices and diﬀerent data streams). Physical

space has historically had a vital enabling role in these moments,

at least in tech. Whether known as informal “campﬁre huddles” in

young competition teams, “war rooms” for startups, or “situation

rooms” in more formal technology oﬃces, these types of collaborative

environments set the stage for stakeholders to gather and share

specialized and multidisciplinary data, leading to better group problem-

solving and decision-making.

## In large organizations in particular, a version of this critical form of

knowledge transfer is cross-generational learning. This is particularly

important when younger workers bring a new set of technical skills

and fresh perspectives, and more established workers bring industry

know-how and life experience, all valuable aspects of innovation. Similarly, in the context of upskilling and ongoing learning, diﬀerences

in communication and learning preferences between younger and older

generations creates higher opportunities for both increased knowledge

transfer and new knowledge development when these activities take

# place in a physical collaborative space.

In rebuilding the social infrastructure of organizations, these two work

functions—complex problem solving and cross-generational learning

—present high potential for bonding when they are shared, real

## world experiences, and thus warrant strategic consideration after the

pandemic. Research suggests that building relationships with people

outside of your group, as well as connections between people of diﬀering power status in a community, are associated with improved

community health. The same can be applied to the health and strength

of a work community. The return to the oﬃce after the pandemic, in its various forms, oﬀers leaders the opportunity to reﬂect deeply on

the long-term culture and work community that will be required to

accomplish their organizations’ goals.

To close, one of the big questions we asked you in 2020 was: What is

an oﬃce for? How would you answer that question today?

My overall position on the role of the oﬃce hasn’t changed—the

physical environment has a unique role to play in enabling human work

and endeavor. I know, however, that I would answer this question a bit diﬀerently today than I did ﬁve years ago.

Something I came across during the pandemic comes to mind now.

The writing was from a British educator from the late 1800s and, to

paraphrase, it noted the importance for children to explore and play

outdoors in nature as means for learning. The text described a young

child picking up a pebble from a stream and observing it at length,

holding it in his wet hands, rubbing its smooth surface with his ﬁngers

—all the while, below his own awareness, drawing a connection between

the object of his focus and the cold water, the current around his ankles,

the sound of the rushing brook, etc. The author instructed that in future

years, when the child would be old enough to be taught the abstract

concept of “erosion,” he would pull from his memory the experience by the stream and form a qualitatively diﬀerent and richer relationship to

the idea of “erosion” than had he learned the formal concept alone.

Being the mother of a young child, the simple example struck a personal

note back then. And as a researcher, my work over the years has

repeatedly conﬁrmed the lasting validity of this idea. I think it’s fair to

say we’ve all had similar experiences at work, perhaps during a summer

internship or our ﬁrst jobs, when the concepts we had learned in a

classroom suddenly came to life when we experienced them “in the real

world,” as we commonly say, with others.

Looking ahead, the oﬃce—the physical workspace—will continue

to have an important role to play for the future of organizations,

particularly for those leveraging the integration between human work

and machine work. Of course, we have evidence that it is possible

to meet and even exceed productivity goals by working exclusively remotely. Similarly, we have a better understanding of the tradeoﬀs for

individuals and groups over time when it comes to remote work. We

now have new knowledge and a clearer picture to help advance more

# informed decisions.

But ultimately, humans are relational beings. We discover aspects of

ourselves in relation to others, and we learn to make sense of abstract

concepts from our experiences of interacting in the world with others.

When I think of abstract ideas like stewardship, empathy, integrity,

leadership—all characteristics of great organizations—I can’t help wondering what the tradeoﬀs would be for future leaders and future

organizations without, to use our example, “pebble-in-the-stream”

experiences shared with others.
