All leaders—from new managers to seasoned executives—must

delegate tasks to free up time and attention for the big-picture work

their more-senior roles demand. This is an axiom; indeed, delegation

is one of the ﬁrst skills typically required of new managers. But both

## my experience and my research show that leaders too often ﬁnd

themselves mired in the details of their teams’ eﬀorts, with debilitating

## HBR / Magazine Article / Why Aren’t I Better at Delegating?

Failure to delegate well produces three bad outcomes. First, a relatively

expensive employee (you) is doing work that could be done more cost

eﬀectively and probably better by a lower-paid team member who is

closer to the customer or the operations. Second, your team is likely to

become frustrated at micromanagement, and stagnant from the lack of

real responsibility, undermining your leadership pipeline. And, ﬁnally,

you stay mired in your old work, which prevents you from focusing

## on the critical strategic planning, cross-functional networking, people

management, and self-development work your organization needs you

to do to stay ahead of the competition. Being less eﬀective at these vital

parts of your job will almost certainly limit your chances to advance as

a leader—and will make it less likely that you’ll succeed in your current

# role.

## For example, one CEO—formerly the CTO of his company—continued

to give his old engineering team detailed instructions about how

to improve the user experience on its app long after he had been

promoted. His successor as CTO, who was now closer to the latest

usage data, often had to push back on the CEO’s instructions, wasting

everyone’s time (problem #1). The CEO also continued to prioritize the

software engineers’ tasks—for example, asking for ﬁxes to small issues

## on the landing page ahead of more-fundamental back-end bugs—which

further irritated the team (problem #2). Lastly, he couldn’t then ﬁnd

enough time to do his new job—communicating the strategy to the

wider company and meeting and developing his new leadership team—

which meant its members couldn’t make eﬀective decisions about their

## own priorities without his continued involvement (problem #3).

Most leaders I work with understand that they need to delegate, but

they don’t always know how to distinguish between the work they

should be doing and the work they should be handing oﬀ. And even

when they get that determination right, they often fail to follow

through. Consider, for example, the thousands of managers who have

taken my leadership development programs at London Business School

and the MIT Sloan School of Management. They leave these programs

committed to delegating more, but when my team and I follow up with

them six months later, about a third admit to still being bogged down in

# lower-level tasks.

Recently, we surveyed this group to ﬁnd out what was tripping them up.

From their stories, we realized that many needed a refresher on which

tasks to retain and which to give to others. A how-to on that is outlined

below. But we also identiﬁed four challenges that stop even those who

know how to delegate from doing it successfully: an addiction to the

dopamine hit of easy productivity, a disinclination to reject requests

for help, a desire to meet their own bosses’ or clients’ unmanaged

expectations, and a misunderstanding of what “work” should mean for

a manager. Drawing on research and my own two decades of experience

advising senior leaders, I’ve developed concrete recommendations for

overcoming each challenge.

# Deciding What to Delegate

Before you can successfully delegate, you need to learn to diﬀerentiate

between the work you should keep—and, indeed, do more of—and the

work that is better left to a team member. My advice is simple: When

considering any meeting, task, or responsibility, always ask yourself,

“Am I the best and cheapest person to get this done?” If the answer is no,

delegate the work and give the person you’re handing it to the context

needed to succeed.

Context-setting includes explaining why the work needs to be

done (following an organizational strategy, entering a new market,

onboarding a client, or investing in a project, for example); the results

the person or group is expected to deliver; the deadline for the work;

and how people should behave (with one another, other colleagues,

clients, and others) to get it done.

By contrast, activity-based work—including making decisions about

what work to do to achieve the company’s or team’s goals—should be

your team members’ responsibility. That’s because their time costs less

than yours, they typically have more on-the-ground insight to drive

good choices, and they’ll be motivated to do the job well when given

autonomy and accountability. Case study research I conducted from

2011 to 2013 showed that leaders’ strategic initiatives were more likely

to succeed when they made the desired outcomes clear but left the

# execution decisions to their teams.

When a managing director in a large global bank I worked with used

this “best, cheapest” test to consider her portfolio of work, she ended

up ceding 40% of her meetings and 25% of her tasks to the directors

and VPs who reported to her. She found that everyone was happier:

clients, because her team was just as strong as her on most issues

and more responsive than she had been; her employees, because

they enjoyed the exposure, development, and career progression; and

the managing director herself, because she could reﬂect, learn, and

ultimately contribute to a high-visibility strategy project that she hadn’t

previously had time for.

# Overcoming the Four Challenges

Even leaders who understand what work to delegate and how to hand it

oﬀ with skill still struggle against four challenges.

- 1. The dopamine hit of personal productivity. MRI brain scans show that

when humans accomplish something, our brains release a tiny hit of

dopamine that produces feelings of pleasure, motivating us to take on and complete diﬃcult tasks. Unfortunately, activity-based work oﬀers

more-regular dopamine hits than context-setting does. Many leaders in

our study said that they miss having lists of discrete to-dos to check oﬀ

each day. What’s more, context-setting is cognitively taxing, especially

for those new to it, creating a dopamine deﬁcit. So managers just

learning to delegate will feel a craving for those old hits. Ultimately,

leaders need to accept that their work will yield fewer and less frequent

chemical rewards associated with productivity. But there are ways to

avoid feeling their absence so strongly:

Create different types of checklists. Activity-based work might be easier

to break down into to-dos, but it’s possible to do the same for your

context-setting work so you can get dopamine hits there, too. For

## example, during each internal meeting or client onboarding, track

that you’ve (1) explained why you’re having it, (2) outlined what those

assembled need to achieve, and (3) described the behaviors that will

help you meet that collective goal. You can also make lists of tasks to

# delegate and tick those oﬀ one by one.

Routinize good practices. Putting routines in place with others can make

the work of managing, including delegating, easier. For example, you

## might structure all of your one-on-ones around a list of questions, such

as, What is your most pressing challenge right now? What steps are you

taking to overcome it? What’s one thing I can do to support you? In

group meetings, make a habit of asking every person attending to give

an opinion so you have a window into how each might contribute to the

# work at hand.

Reframe your purpose. Instead of chasing quick dopamine hits, train

your focus on longer-term goals. Remind yourself that you are helping

your organization to scale by staying out of activity-based work, and

you’re encouraging your employees to grow by giving them more

# responsibility.

I once coached a junior partner at a law

ﬁrm whose senior leaders wanted her to

# manage more and larger transactions. But

she struggled to do so, admitting that she

preferred “the short-term deal deadlines,

‘urgent’ client calls, and ‘emergencies’

where [she] could put out ﬁres and be a bit

of a heroine.” After adding context-setting

checklists to her routine, creating a system

to let junior members make more and

## better contributions to client meetings, and

reminding herself that it was their time to

shine, she was able to embrace her

managerial role and delegate more often and more successfully.

- 2. Employees’ requests for help. Some leaders embrace context-

setting but get derailed when team members come to them asking for

assistance or buy-in for their decisions. Questions like “What should

we be working on?” and “What’s the priority client this month?” drag

managers back into the activity zone. Of course, you shouldn’t just turn

employees away. But you need to redeﬁne how you help by limiting

## yourself to the right kind of guidance and involvement. Follow these

# steps:

Re-explain the context. Prompt your team member to recall the key

points of context. “Let’s remember why we’re doing this, what outcomes

we need to deliver, and how we need to show up diﬀerently.”

Give the work back. Refrain from giving explicit advice: “So given that

context, what do you think the priority is?”

Teach with examples, not answers. If the response shows that your team

member lacks the knowledge or experience to make a good decision,

explain how you made similar decisions in the past and what you

learned. Then prompt your team member to think about how those

lessons might apply in this situation.

Establish accountability and support. End the conversation with, “Let me

know how that goes and when you’d like to check in with me again.”

Your team may not respond well to this approach right away. Some

people will not yet trust that you want them making all the activity-

based work decisions and so may be reticent to take them. But if you

keep at it, over time you’ll discover who is willing and able to exercise

good judgment and who isn’t.

Consider a tech company senior manager whom I recently coached.

In the weeks following her promotion, members of her team still

came to her with questions, pulling her back into the work she’d

tried to delegate. But once she learned to recognize these as requests

for activity-based help and responded appropriately, her employees

learned to take more responsibility. She recounted the story of one

direct report who asked which project to prioritize that month:

onboarding a recent acquisition onto the group reporting system or

improving the working capital cycle. “In the past I would have given

him my answer,” she said, “but instead, I reminded him why we

were working on these projects and the outcomes each one needed to

deliver.” Although he was initially surprised that she didn’t just tell him

what to do, he made his own decision—to focus on the onboarding,

because it was part of the critical path for the project, and other people

could handle improving the working capital cycle. Both were happy

# with the decision.

As she consistently declined to join her team’s activity zone, the

stronger players stepped up to take on more work, and even the more

reticent ones started trying harder to make better decisions without

# additional input.

- 3. The boss’s or client’s expectations. Some leaders are pulled back into

the activity zone not by the people below them in the org chart but by

those above. It’s not unusual to have a boss (or a client) who expects

you to know every detail about the work being done on a project.

My research ﬁnds that this is a particular challenge in sectors where

the consequences of failure are high (such as public utilities, mining companies, and hospitals). Combating this challenge is also diﬃcult in

organizations that are culturally hierarchical, where pushing back on

the boss isn’t acceptable. But all leaders need to manage up. You can

take steps to ask your boss to hold you accountable for outcomes rather

than expecting you to be involved in all the activities that will deliver

them. Here’s how:

Start small. First, choose the outcomes that are most likely to be

achieved and seek permission to fully delegate those activities. For

example, one director of a research lab told her boss she planned to

provide oversight but not dig into the details of work in the area she

had previously run because she already had a good understanding of

what her team could do without her and of the risks involved. When she

delivered well on those goals, her boss began to trust her decisions to

# delegate elsewhere.

Be accountable. Encourage your boss to hold you to your promised

outcomes. As one leader in our survey explained, “I made it clear [my

manager] could ﬁre me if I didn’t deliver….Before that conversation, I

think he felt like it was all on him, whereas now he realized it was all on

me, and we were both happy with that.”

Give visibility to team members. Bring your direct reports into as many

## senior-level conversations as possible so that your boss or client sees

that they have a strong command of the details. For example, a senior

lawyer I worked with always gave her team members key roles in client

meetings. As a result, her clients grew more comfortable not having her

# on routine calls.

Over time, target the more complex work. Finally, wean your boss from

dictating your level of involvement in the details of larger projects. As

the head of operations in a major public utility put it: “I couldn’t have

started with the big, complex stuﬀ. But now, with my team established

and the trust built, I have more credibility when I say, ‘They’ve got

this.’”

- 4. A limited deﬁnition of “work.” Ultimately, what derails many leaders

from eﬀectively delegating is their belief that real work is activity-based.

For example, a star lawyer who had been appointed head of his ﬁrm’s

M&A practice described how doing deals for clients still felt more

meaningful to him than managing his team to do the same. This

challenge is especially problematic for people who are skilled at highly

technical work that constitutes a part of their identity. My research

found that lawyers, surgeons, research scientists, and salespeople have

the most trouble delegating, in part because they’d achieved seniority

## through their individual subject matter expertise and activity-based

work—rather than their ability to lead teams and delegate. Training

yourself to place more value on managerial work, including handing oﬀ

key tasks, can be hard. But a few approaches can help:

Recognize your limits. There is only so much work you can personally

produce. A surgeon, for example, can perform a ﬁnite number of

operations a day. If she is to treat more patients and make more money,

she must coach and teach others to operate at her standard in her stead.

## The same scaling principle applies in many other functions from sales

to R&D to marketing. The biggest successes are accomplished by teams,

# not individuals.

Decide if you really want to manage. Global business culture gloriﬁes

leadership, but if you love doing, managing others might not be right for you. Coming to terms with this can be diﬃcult but rewarding. For

example, even as the newly appointed head of the M&A practice worked

to learn new skills in delegating and leading teams, he realized he still

preferred doing deals, and so he suggested that leadership consider

making a change. The ﬁrm—which had simply promoted its best M&A

lawyer to be practice head—gave the role to a lawyer who wasn’t as

proliﬁc a dealmaker but who actually wanted to manage. The law

ﬁrm let its star go back to what he loved doing and was best at, and

celebrated him for it.

Spread the mindset. Encourage others in your organization to buy into

the value of context-setting work as well. If you’re a middle manager, be

proactive about not just delegating to your reports but also volunteering

to take work that you know you can do oﬀ your boss’s plate. If you’re

a senior leader, help your peers understand that managers doing less

activity work and more context-setting is the best way for all of you

to deliver at scale. And use your position to build systems that reward

# people for this kind of contribution.

The C-suite executives at an insurance broker I know realized that

their long-term success depended not on hiring more brokers at

ever-increasing salaries but on developing leaders of brokers, who

could teach their direct reports to improve and build teams. To do

this, the company began to reward senior brokers who demonstrated

collaboration and coaching skills. In part because of this approach, the

business units that adopted it boasted year-on-year organic growth rates

that surpassed those of their competitors.

# Be Patient

Even for leaders with the best of intentions, overcoming these

challenges will take time. When you’re new to context-setting, you will

crave the dopamine that activity-based work has long provided you.

Team members will invariably ask questions, and some will struggle to

stop themselves from frequently checking in or resisting when you hand

decisions back to them. Bosses and clients may question how much you

delegate until you’ve proven your decisions are sound. And your own

beliefs about the value you bring to your organization will be tricky to

shift. However, eﬀective delegation is one of the most important skills

for any leader to learn. If you stick with it, you’ll get so much more out

of your team members—and yourself, as a developer of talent and as a

# big-picture, strategic thinker.
