In the face of political, economic, and technological uncertainty,

business leaders are often reluctant to take bold action. Some freeze, too

overwhelmed to make decisions. Many hunker down, hoping to wait out

the chaos. Others retrench, trying to protect their organization’s future

and their careers. However, research shows that the old adage is true:

Fortune favors the brave, not the cautious.

This is what my colleagues Nitin Nohria and Franz Wohlgezogen and I

found more than a decade ago, when, during the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis,

we examined how 4,700 public companies had navigated the three

previous recessions. We discovered that about 9% were able to emerge

## from each downturn in stronger shape than before, not just because

they thoughtfully cut costs but also because they simultaneously

took calculated risks to invest in growth. Without intending to, we

documented the signiﬁcant diﬀerence that courage makes in business.

Since then, I’ve been investigating what drives courageous behavior. In

challenging circumstances, why do some leaders make daring moves

while others hesitate? Philosophers as far back as Socrates, Plato,

Aristotle, and Mencius pondered whether bravery was an innate virtue

or could be taught. Modern-day scientiﬁc research, spanning the ﬁelds

of psychology, sociology, economics, neuroscience, and healthcare,

conﬁrms the latter view, showing that many types of people, including

those who didn’t previously consider themselves brave, can be just

that when the situation calls for it. And yet few studies have sought

to understand how individuals can become more courageous—until

now. Over the past several years, I have surveyed existing social

and natural sciences scholarship, collected and analyzed leadership

## stories—some through archival research, others through more than

200 detailed interviews—and distilled the insights into a playbook for

anyone looking to be more intrepid at work.

# Bravery as a Choice

I deﬁne courage as a willingness to take bold, risky action to serve a

purpose that you perceive to be worthy, usually in the face of an abiding

fear. It can involve accepting a physical challenge, making yourself

emotionally vulnerable, risking social or economic standing for your

moral beliefs, or publicly championing new and unorthodox ideas. And

as Nelson Mandela famously said, it is not the absence of fear but

# triumph over it.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Now Is the Time for Courage

Many experts argue that, in work and business settings, the best

way to overcome anxiety about uncertainty is risk management. As

professor Kathleen K. Reardon has written, courageous action is really

an “intelligent gamble” based on “careful deliberation and preparation”

that includes weighing risks and beneﬁts. Indeed, when considering

decisions like whether to fund a new business, undertake a merger or

acquisition, or switch jobs, it’s sensible to do a cost/beneﬁt analysis

to reduce the odds of negative outcomes and mitigate their potential

consequences. People have long used these tools to eﬀectively manage

and even proﬁt from risk. But as research by the late economist Frank

Knight has shown, they aren’t enough to help us behave boldly in

situations where we can neither identify all the potential dangers

we face nor estimate their chances of materializing. Under volatile,

## uncertain, complex, and ambiguous (VUCA) conditions, when possible

outcomes are unknown, most people feel a loss of control, triggering

fear, which often leads to paralysis (the so-called freeze response) or

retreat (ﬂight). Brave leaders, by contrast, are able to reclaim their

# agency and ﬁght.

And there are many examples of those who have: political leaders

## like Mandela and Ukrainian president Volodymyr Zelensky; decisive

CEOs such as BlackRock’s Larry Fink and Chanel’s Leena Nair; scrappy

## entrepreneurs, from the legendary Steve Jobs to the lesser-known

Aloke Bajpai of India’s online travel agency Ixigo; and even everyday

employees and citizens, like Facebook whistleblower Frances Haugen,

former US Airways pilot C.B. “Sully” Sullenberger, and the Taj Hotel

staﬀ members who risked their lives to help guests during a 2008

# terrorist attack in Mumbai.

In my research I found that individuals like these develop courage in

ﬁve ways: They create positive narratives, cultivate conﬁdence, take

small steps to boost their comprehension of the challenges they face,

make connections, and stay calm, employing a variety of techniques to

do each.

At a moment when 76% of S&P 500 companies are citing “uncertainty”

in their earnings calls (up from 37% in the three months prior, according

to FactSet), these strategies are especially critical. What’s more, any

leader can learn and deploy them to become more courageous.

# [ Strategy 1 ]

# Create a Positive Narrative

The stories we tell have an enormous inﬂuence on our sense of self,

our understanding of the wider world, and our ability to behave

courageously. There are three ways that the leaders I studied crafted

narratives to either lessen their fear or overcome it.

Go risk hunting. The ﬁrst tactic is identifying and mitigating the

challenges and threats you face. The point is not to reduce risk to zero

(often an impossibility) but to shift how you perceive the unknown so

that it becomes less daunting and you feel more capable of conquering

the chaos. Risk hunting helps recast the world in a more orderly light,

thereby emboldening you to move forward.

Larry Fink, cofounder of the asset management ﬁrm BlackRock, has

built his entire career and business around this approach. He tasked

his ﬁrst hire, Charlie Hallac, with developing a comprehensive risk-

assessment platform, later dubbed Aladdin, which has since become

the gold standard among ﬁnance professionals. But even in the absence

## of such sophisticated tools, leaders like Fink obsessively search for

signals in the noise around which they can build a positive story that

will inspire action. For example, in this year’s annual letter, he pointed

to clear opportunities for matching uninvested capital (the $25 trillion

sitting idle in banks and money market funds in the United States alone)

with government and corporate needs (an estimated $68 trillion for

## public and private infrastructure projects around the world over the

next 25 years). Such data points—along with more detailed analysis—

gave Fink and his management team the conﬁdence to pursue three

## big acquisitions in late 2024: Global Infrastructure Partners, a ﬁrm with

$170 billion in assets invested across more than 100 countries; Preqin, a

private market data ﬁrm; and HPS, a leading manager of private credit.

Find a moral quest. Another tactic is to recast your work—including

any risky decisions or actions you might take—as the heroic pursuit

of values that you or your organization holds dear. Scholars have

found that when people are inspired by their moral principles to act

courageously, they feel a greater sense of belonging and self-worth and

overcome their fears more easily.

Consider how Haugen, an engineer, explained her decision to release

internal Facebook documents showing that the company’s products

were damaging teen mental health, failing to curb misinformation, and

fomenting violence. As she told a reporter, “I did what I thought was

necessary to save the lives of people…who I think are being endangered

by Facebook’s prioritization of proﬁts.” By leaning on her personal

values, she found the courage to quit her lucrative job and share what

she knew. Helena Foulkes, former president of CVS Pharmacy, and her

team also gave moral reasons for their 2014 decision to stop selling

cancer-causing tobacco products, which sacriﬁced $2 billion in sales

and risked a consumer and investor backlash. “We had a lot of debates,

and we didn’t all see eye to eye…because it’s a very scary thing to

walk away from that size of business,” she recalled. But “we had 25,000

pharmacists working for us at the time….For all of them and us, to be

working for a company which had made such a bold move really created

# a sense of pride.”

## HBR / Magazine Article / Now Is the Time for Courage

Call upon your faith. Many leaders also draw on their belief in a higher power to ﬁnd courage in diﬃcult circumstances, with a narrative that

says, “I have encountered adversity, but I can appeal to God (or fate,

or luck, or the universe) to emerge victorious.” Some people disparage

such thinking as magical or irrational, but researchers tend to see it

as adaptive, an important way of coping. For example, studies have

shown that entrepreneurs spend more time praying than most people

and are more likely to believe in an engaged, responsive God who takes

a personal interest in them. Other research has shown that the belief

that we will have good luck increases our sense of agency, which can help us face up to our fears and embrace more-diﬃcult challenges.

Several successful U.S. company founders—Cadbury’s John Cadbury,

## Standard Oil’s John Rockefeller, Walmart’s Sam Walton, and Aﬂac’s Dan

Amos—were or have been very public about the role their Christian

faith played in helping them navigate the uncertainty of entrepreneurial

life. Consider, too, former PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi, who kept a statue

of the Hindu god Ganesha, the remover of obstacles and facilitator of success, in her oﬃce. “There are times when the stress is so incredible…

then you close your eyes and think about a temple…and suddenly you

feel, ‘Hey, I can take on the world.’ Hinduism ﬂoats around you and

makes you feel somehow invincible,” she told The Times. That mindset

no doubt emboldened her to pursue a purpose-driven shift to more-

healthful products during her tenure, despite also having to deal with

# the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis.

# [ Strategy 2 ]

# Cultivate Confidence

Conﬁdence comes from self-eﬃcacy, which the late Stanford

psychologist Albert Bandura described as “what you believe you can

do with [the skills] you have under a variety of circumstances.” The

courageous people I studied beneﬁted from having developed deep

competence in their everyday work, which made them feel better

equipped to grapple with complex and ambiguous challenges. They also enhanced their sense of self-eﬃcacy using three key tactics.

Train deliberately. To be conﬁdent in any role, you must study

and apply best practices until they become second nature, allowing

you to perform at your best even under pressure and amid change.

In sales, that might mean knowing how to pitch clients, nurture

relationships, and close deals; in tech, having a deep understanding of

both engineering and product design; in HR, studying psychology and

developing a playbook for sensitively handling any kind of employee

emergency. Your training might not teach you how to respond to every

crisis, but it should leave you feeling like a seasoned expert in your

domain, who has the knowledge, skills, and fortitude to get the job done

and the responsibility to do it.

For example, C.B. “Sully” Sullenberger’s pilot training didn’t include a

unit on what to do when a midair collision with a ﬂock of birds causes

both of a plane’s engines to fail. However, when that happened to his

January 2009 US Airways ﬂight, Sullenberger was able to safely land

the aircraft on the Hudson River. “As it turned out,” he later told the

journalist Katie Couric, “my entire life had been preparation to handle

# that particular moment.”

Other cases in point include former Federal Reserve chairman Ben

Bernanke, whose academic career studying the Great Depression

positioned him to help manage the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, and GE’s CEO,

Larry Culp, whose deep knowledge of lean manufacturing practices,

forged by a 25-year career at Danaher, including 13 as its chief executive,

enabled him to execute a complex turnaround at the industrial giant.

Even at lower levels of an organization,

training can bolster courageous action.

# Consider the Taj Mahal Palace employees

who stayed at their posts during the

## several-day terrorist siege of the hotel in

- 2008. All had previously gone through an

extensive 18-month onboarding to ensure

that they would not only perform their jobs

## expertly but also adhere to the Taj Hotel

culture of putting guests ﬁrst. Throughout

the attack, they fell back on that training,

identifying themselves as stewards of the company and its customers,

whom they bravely calmed and tried to protect.

Assemble a large tool kit. Courageous leaders have a broad array of

metatools—ways to think, solve problems, and stay resilient—that allow

them to tackle novel situations. For instance, when asked about the

bravery it takes for astronauts to travel to and live on the International

Space Station, NASA’s Terry Virts noted that the organization’s boot

camp teaching mental endurance is as useful as its technical and

physical training. For CVS’s Foulkes, an important individual tool was

empowering her people through delegation, while a key team one was

transparent debate—that is, “having really deep conversations about

paradox and complexity…allowing people to share…what they’re excited

about and what they’re nervous about…[and] taking those competing

emotions and ﬁnding something new and diﬀerent as a creative

# solution to that internal tension.”

Focus on what’s in your control. When you’re facing challenges from

outside forces, it’s important to ﬁgure out where you can have an

impact. That might mean breaking down a big challenge—like how to

cope with shifting tariﬀ policies—into smaller ones, like improving your

ability to quickly change suppliers and to tweak pricing. Or it might

mean simply ensuring that you’re getting the fundamentals of your

operations right. In the world of sports, this strategy is often described

as focusing on process, not outcomes. Although you can’t predict how

your opponent will perform or the ﬁnal score of any game, you do

control your preparation, the energy you bring to the court or ﬁeld,

and how closely you adhere to your playbook. As the legendary college

football coach Nick Saban used to tell his players, “We’re not going to

talk about what we’re going to accomplish. We’re going to talk about

how we’re going to do it.”

Business leaders who have employed this back-to-basics approach

include former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz, who led the coﬀee

## chain through the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis, competitive pressures, and

a social media ﬁrestorm by refocusing his teams on the core café

experience; and former Lego CEO Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, who turned

that company around by prioritizing its mission of fostering creativity

through its brick building sets. Or consider how Bajpai, cofounder of

Ixigo, navigated numerous near bankruptcies at the startup: “There

have been at least four times…when we ran out of money. Most

companies would have shut down, but in each situation the founders

invested back in and went to survival salaries. Investors helped with

some bridge money. Many [employees] took deep salary cuts. Most

importantly, we [kept] shipping some of the most innovative products

in the world.” Instead of getting overwhelmed and giving up, the people

at the agency recommitted to serving their customers, and eventually

the business thrived.

# [ Strategy 3 ]

# Take Small Steps

Many people equate bold action with big moves. But the leaders and

organizations I studied took small steps into murky environments

before making leaps, deploying a strategy that Karl Weick calls

sensemaking. Making small moves like this helps you gradually gain

more clarity about your situation. You let go of the need for a perfect

plan and open yourself to possibilities, trusting that the path will

emerge as you proceed.

Evaluate objectively. The initial catalyst for sensemaking is often a

disruptive event that creates uncertainty. While your instinct might be

to freeze or ﬂee, you must instead practice mindfulness, staying attuned

## to both the external situation and your own emotional response so that

you can look at both more dispassionately. Ask questions like, What

am I facing here? Whom can I call in to help and advise me? What

immediate steps can I take to better understand what’s going on?

When the 2011 tsunami hit nuclear plants in Fukushima, Japan,

destroying equipment and threatening catastrophic meltdown, Naohiro

Masuda, the Daini site’s supervisor, and his team managed to save their

facility by quickly evaluating the damage and calibrating their response.

As 55-foot-high waves battered a plant designed to handle only up to 17

feet of water, they gathered around a whiteboard, writing down data on

the situation and analyzing what could go wrong and how best to stop it.

Let meaning emerge. Next, scour the environment for any information

you can get your hands on—even small, seemingly insigniﬁcant cues

—and assemble them into an interpretation. What patterns do you

notice? How does what you’re seeing relate to other situations you’ve

encountered in the past? Create hypotheses and then choose the one

that seems most plausible. Continue to collect information and then

build, reﬁne, or adjust. “Sensemaking is not about truth and getting

it right,” Weick and his coauthors have observed. “Instead, it is about

continued redrafting of an emerging story so that it becomes more

comprehensive, incorporates more of the observed data, and is more

# resilient in the face of criticism.”

With the main control panels down at the Daini plant, Masuda

sent team members out on a dangerous mission to inspect damaged

equipment in person. Based on the information they gathered, they

hypothesized that the plant’s cooling system had lost power, so they

would need to bring in materials to ﬁx it and ﬁnd an alternative energy

# source.

Interpret in motion. Next you act on your hypothesis, exposing yourself

to new cues that enable you to press on or reconsider and pivot. The key

is to take steps that keep your options open—creating what executives

at Amazon call “two-way doors,” which you can walk through but also

back out of if necessary. Avoid becoming too conﬁdent in your initial

interpretation. Stay curious as new information emerges, and be willing

to take equally small steps in a diﬀerent direction.

Initially, Masuda and his team sought to draw power from the one

building on the property that still had it, but the technical challenges

proved too great, so they decided to use the plant’s one functioning

generator and shifted their work from one reactor to another after

determining that the latter was in a more precarious state. They took

small steps, observing, learning, and iterating, and ultimately averted

disaster, while the other Fukushima plant unfortunately did not.

# [ Strategy 4 ]

# Find Connection

Contrary to popular wisdom, there are few lone heroes. Courage is a

team sport, and behind every brave leader, there is usually a group of

## less visible—but extremely important—supporters, as well as an array

of constructive critics, including employees and customers. I found that

bold leaders connect with others in three ways.

Turn to allies for an emotional boost. We all want to feel loved and

respected. If you’re facing uncertainty, that kind of support becomes

even more important. When you surround yourself with people who

think that you have what it takes to be bold, you start to believe it yourself. Relationships also aﬃrm people’s identities—for example

## as citizens, employees, or leaders—as well as their obligations to

others, making them feel more duty bound to act. The brave leaders

I encountered often had great mentors they could turn to in moments

of struggle. Others were able to ﬁnd courage by simply imagining what

their allies expected they would accomplish.

Consider Nair, who was the chief human resources oﬃcer of Unilever

before taking the helm of Chanel. She told me that when people

questioned her competence as a woman in the workplace or as an

HR (that is, “soft skills”) leader, she would remember the conﬁdence

that female family members, whose own ambitions had been stiﬂed,

instilled in her. “They would say things like, ‘Let Leena get the

opportunity. She’s intelligent. She’s talented.’” She also told me about

a conversation she had with her longtime mentor, Nooyi, about a new

job Nair felt she wasn’t ready for. The former PepsiCo CEO advised her

to think not about her limitations but about the key strengths she could

bring to the role, which gave Nair the push she needed to take it.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Now Is the Time for Courage

Access resources. Your connections can provide tangible help,

including money and manpower—a safety net that will allow you to

feel more in control and thus more courageous. The investors who

gave Ixigo’s Bajpai bridge funding are a good example. So are two

organizations that Haugen turned to for support when releasing the

information she had about Facebook: eBay founder Pierre Omidyar’s

Luminate and the nonproﬁt Whistleblower Aid. Your network can also

oﬀer knowledge that can help you make sense of chaos and surmount

obstacles. As Nooyi said in an interview with McKinsey, “You can’t

know everything about everything. Bring in the expert. Let them coach

you….Sitting down one-on-one and learning everything there is to learn

is a good thing.”

Accept feedback. When taking any kind of risk, it’s critical to surround

## yourself with not just cheerleaders but also constructive critics who

will honestly assess how you’re doing. When you allow others to judge

your choices and point out contradictory signals, you’ll have more

conﬁdence in your ultimate course of action. So ﬁnd people willing to

discuss and then validate or challenge your narratives, interpretations,

and competencies. Knudstorp, for example, emphasized the importance

of candid customer feedback at Lego; one of his slogans was “Listen

to the complainer.” Likewise, GE’s Culp is known for taking and

encouraging “gemba walks,” a practice in which managers go to the

factory ﬂoor to hear directly from frontline employees.

# [ Strategy 5 ]

# Stay Calm

Psychologists have closely analyzed “emotional regulation,” the ability

to inﬂuence your own feelings and experiences, particularly in

moments when your “freeze, ﬂee, or ﬁght” response is triggered.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Now Is the Time for Courage

Speciﬁc moves can help you mute or diminish fear, make it pass more

quickly, or change how you experience and express it.

Practice self-care. To make good decisions in trying times, leaders

need adequate sleep, nutrition, and hydration. You can’t think clearly if

you’re running on fumes. As Nair, whose ﬁrst three years at Chanel have

been marked by brave bets on sustainability and philanthropy, recently

said: “Invest in your physical and mental well-being. You have to put the

oxygen mask on yourself to have the energy to play all the roles that you

do.”

Embrace rituals. One tried-and-true way to reduce anxiety amid

uncertainty is to seek comfort in the familiar and predictable.

Courageous leaders rely on small, personally meaningful physical or

mental rituals to center themselves. Ancient warriors from the Japanese

Samurai to the Nordic Vikings had prebattle rituals. Apple founder

Steve Jobs had a simple daily routine: Every morning, after making

his bed and showering, he looked at himself in the mirror and asked,

“If today was the last day of my life, would I be happy with what

I’m about to do today?” Some entrepreneurs wear a lucky sweater or

recite a certain mantra before each investor or client pitch. Bernanke

followed his predecessor Alan Greenspan’s practice of always facing the

clock at Fed meetings. Other executives, such as Schultz, rely on regular

# meditation.

Reframe the situation. You can preempt or limit your fear response by

redeﬁning what uncertainty means for you and your organization in

the long term. Consider what pessimistic, realistic, and optimistic views

might look like. With this technique, you can fully acknowledge the

dangers you face while also tempering your reaction to them.

In Fink’s annual letter, he practiced reframing, writing: “We have lived

through moments like this before. And somehow, in the long run, we

ﬁgure things out.” Foulkes has done the same throughout her career:

“My brain sometimes goes to what could go wrong, and I think that’s

good [business school] training, but I also think it’s important to ask

ourselves, ‘What could go right?’” And just as the thriving companies

in my 2008 study with my coauthors saw recessions not as existential

threats but as opportunities, Ixigo’s Bajpai reframed the Covid-19

## outbreak as another unexpected crisis that would, of course, force him

to conserve cash yet again—but also push the company to explore new

areas of growth, including acquisitions to build its presence in train and

bus travel, which laid the groundwork for its successful IPO last year.

. . .

As the pace of change and disruption accelerates, courage—or the lack

of it—can make or break careers, organizations, and society. That’s not

to say leaders should take outsize risks. But most of us tend to be too

# cowardly, not too reckless.

I’ve come away from my hundreds of interviews with executives,

## entrepreneurs, employees, coaches, and more convinced that bravery

is a skill that everyone in business today must learn and teach to others.

We can all use these strategies to improve ourselves and to shape the

beliefs and actions of the people around us. Indeed, to make progress

## on big problems like climate change, economic inequality, and political

polarization, we need to coalesce around a kind of collective courage.

A bit more boldness will go a long way.
