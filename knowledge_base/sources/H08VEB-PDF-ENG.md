Despite decades of research proving their value at work, emotions

remain one of the most undervalued—and misunderstood—resources

available to leaders. Too many leaders still believe that emotions

distract from execution, cloud judgment, or hinder good decision-

making. Others believe that so-called “negative emotions” harm

relationships, or that showing emotion makes you seem weak or

# unprofessional.

While these myths and misconceptions may seem harmless, they

## undermine leadership eﬀectiveness and team performance by

encouraging the suppression of emotions, at a signiﬁcant personal and

organizational cost. Over time, ignoring and suppressing emotions can

result in burnout, erode mental and physical health, dampen morale,

hinder teamwork, and even impact ﬁnancial results.

In today’s team-based and emotionally charged workplace,

understanding and managing emotions at work eﬀectively is no

longer optional. Emotions are central to every interaction—connecting

us in our humanity, serving as powerful tools of persuasion and

inﬂuence, and oﬀering vital cues about our environment. Ignoring them

squanders valuable opportunities and can often lead to real problems.

And as AI takes over more analytical tasks once owned by leaders,

emotional intelligence remains one of the few uniquely human skills—

and a critical one for navigating today’s complex workplace.

Yet, most leaders haven’t been trained to work with emotions, making

emotional territory feel awkward, risky, or “oﬀ limits.” While programs

to help leaders develop EQ abound, many leap too far ahead. They

often focus on applied behaviors, teaching leaders how to demonstrate

empathy or navigate conﬂict. However, true emotional intelligence isn’t

about scripted actions. Rather, it’s built on recognizing, exploring, and

strategically using emotional data.

Here are four simple practices you can use immediately to enhance your

## emotional skills—and, in turn, your well-being and eﬀectiveness.

# Notice

Noticing emotions is the ﬁrst step to accessing and leveraging the

valuable data they hold. Start by tuning into subtle cues that are already

there but frequently overlooked.

Emotions often show up in our bodies, behaviors, and energy before

we register them consciously. Tune into the physical sensations in your

body as you move through your workday. For example, if you notice

## your jaw clenching, heart quickening, or tight shoulders, these can all

be early signs of stress, anxiety, or anger. Also, pay attention to your

behaviors: Are you talking more than usual or withdrawing? Diving into

work or putting things oﬀ? Your responses can point to underlying

emotions. Finally, track your energy. If you feel a sudden drop or

unexpected surge, there’s likely an emotion just under the surface.

Just as we have “tells” that we can learn to notice and read, other people

are also constantly oﬀering cues to their emotions. Facial expressions,

tone of voice, body language, and behavior all transmit emotional data

you can observe.

Pay attention to body language—our bodies often broadcast what

people aren’t saying aloud. Is your coworker leaning in or pulling away?

Making eye contact or avoiding it? Watch for any inconsistencies. If a

colleague says, “everything’s ﬁne” with a ﬂat tone or a forced smile,

that mismatch between their words and expression is a sign they’re

not “ﬁne.” Emotions also show up in changes from someone’s baseline

behavior. For example, if a normally engaged team member suddenly

grows quiet, that’s worth noticing. These shifts don’t tell you exactly

what they’re feeling, but they signal it’s time to get curious.

# Name

Emotional concepts aren’t innate—they’re learned through

socialization, education, and culture. Strengthening your ability to

identify and articulate complex feelings starts with expanding the

number of emotion words you know.

A richer emotional vocabulary allows you to describe how you feel

more precisely, which increases self-awareness and helps you respond

more eﬀectively. Labeling your feelings more speciﬁcally can also help

you reduce distress and reactivity, improve decision-making, manage

stressful interactions more eﬀectively, and enhance your ability to both

# read and express emotions.

To build your vocabulary, don’t settle for vague labels like “mad, sad,

or glad.” Instead, seek more speciﬁc words to describe your feelings.

For example, if you’re upset, try to pinpoint it: Are you frustrated,

resentful, or provoked? If you feel good, ask yourself: Is it joy, relief,

conﬁdence, or some other feeling altogether? This extra precision builds

emotional clarity. Emotion wheels, lists, and mood tracking apps are

widely available and can be helpful tools for expanding your range.

In conversation, go deeper than surface level. Instead of stopping at

the usual “How are you?” “Fine,” ask questions that invite the person

to oﬀer more nuance. For example, you might say, “What kind of ﬁne

are we talking about? Is that ﬁne as in ‘steady and good’ or ﬁne as in

‘holding it together?’” These small nudges for speciﬁcity invite deeper

## connection and useful insight into others.

# Need

Many of us grew up hearing messages like “Big girls don’t cry,” “Man

up,” or “Don’t be so sensitive.” Over time, we learned to treat certain

emotions as weaknesses and push them aside. But emotions aren’t good

or bad. Rather, they are data that oﬀer us valuable insights, giving us

## clues about our needs, values, boundaries, and the people around us.

Research shows that seeing emotions as helpful makes us more likely to

attend to them, boosting our well-being and ability to manage them in

ourselves and others. Noticing and validating someone else’s emotions

builds psychological safety, strengthens trust, and supports better

problem-solving. Logic helps us think, but emotion drives connection,

# motivation, and action.

To reveal the wealth of information that your emotions oﬀer, do the

following. After you notice and name your feelings, reﬂect and ask

yourself: What message is that emotion trying to send me? What does it

## reveal about what matters to me, my needs, or my values?

## Extend that same curiosity towards others’ experiences and emotions. If

someone on your team seems a little withdrawn or “oﬀ,” resist the urge

to ignore it or make assumptions. Instead, ask a gentle, open-ended

question like: “I’ve noticed you haven’t been participating as much

in team meetings lately. How have you been feeling about things?”

This simple inquiry signals care and can surface insights that might

otherwise stay buried.

Emotions are messengers. When you inquire into them, you can

uncover new insights that improve both your results and your

# relationships.

# Normalize

Leaders who normalize emotional expression—both the positive and the diﬃcult—help build teams that are more creative, eﬀective at

solving problems, and resilient. When you model emotional honesty in

a grounded and intentional way, it signals safety and builds trust.

This does not mean baring your soul. In fact, oversharing can

undermine your credibility and destabilize your team. The goal is to

show a little humanity and demonstrate that having a full range of

emotions is normal and allowed.

There are small ways to do this. During crunch times, you might say: “I

know things are hectic. I’m feeling stressed too—but we’ll get through

it together.” Acknowledging a shared “negative feeling” can help create

calm and show your team you’re in it with them. During one-on-ones

or team meetings, ask questions that prompt people to reﬂect on their

state of mind, like: “What’s one thing you’re feeling good about, and one

thing that’s weighing on you?” You might also share a past challenge

you’ve faced in your life or career to show you’ve been through hard

# things, too.

When people feel safe naming what’s real, it beneﬁts their health, team

performance, and the culture you’re trying to build.

The best leaders don’t hide their emotions or overlook others’. They

notice, name, get curious, and normalize them. The more you value

and explore emotions, the healthier, more resilient, and eﬀective you

will become. And as AI takes on more technical tasks, your ability to

navigate the emotional will set you apart. Emotions aren’t a weakness;

they’re your most powerful leadership advantage.
