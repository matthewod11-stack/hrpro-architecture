These days businesses are facing more change than ever. And the

strongest predictor of whether a company can transform in the face of

change is its ability to hire, develop, and retain the necessary talent,

according to research from Bain & Company.

In theory, this should be the moment for the chief learning oﬃcer to

have a prominent seat at the table to help the executive team shape

organizational strategy and upskill employees to align with future

# needs.

But a series of recent interviews I conducted with 25 chief learning

oﬃcers (CLOs) suggests a disconnect: Almost half of them said they felt

only “somewhat connected” to their CEO’s top priorities. This aligns

with a recent report from LinkedIn that found that only 58% of learning

and development professionals feel as though they have a “seat at the

# executive table.”

What can these CLOs learn from their colleagues who feel more closely

connected to their company’s strategy? My interviews identiﬁed ﬁve

distinct practices they can adopt.

Apply an agile approach to developing learning programs.

Most companies take far too long to develop large workplace learning

programs. LinkedIn’s recent report found that between 2022 and 2024,

fewer than 5% had made it to their ﬁnal phase. These delays are likely to

increase the gap between workplace learning and strategic priorities —

and increase frustration among business stakeholders.

To speed up, some companies are adopting a more agile approach

to L&D programs, in which cross-functional teams of designers,

content developers, and business stakeholders collaborate on learning

experiences that are continuously improved with feedback and testing.

Standard Chartered is one company that’s adopted this approach.

Its L&D team went from having dedicated account managers serving

each line of business to having multidisciplinary teams who are more

able to “grasp all the creative possibilities” for a given learning need,

according to Dr. Amelie Villeneuve, the bank’s global head of learning.

## As a result, the relationship between business stakeholders and the

learning function has improved. According to Villeneuve, her business

stakeholders now participate in a “diagnostic conversation with our

team” instead of simply ordering learning programs from a menu. “This

enables us to have much more strategic conversations.”

When PwC wanted to encourage its employees’ adoption of AI, an agile

approach helped CLO Leah Houde respond to the business priority

much faster. “In the ﬁrst six months we operated in sprints,” she

explains. “We didn’t know what would be coming and didn’t want to

have to re-do a year-long strategy.”

Even if adopted partially, an agile approach can help speed up

production. “We’ve got small and agile teams within the business who

can turn things around on a dime,” says Mike Kosiarek, vice president

of learning and development at Navy Federal Credit Union. “Now, we

partner with those teams to increase capacity when we need to take

something to enterprise scale.”

Design workplace learning around strategic priorities instead of roles.

Most workplace learning focuses on training people for individual roles

and functions. Training Magazine’s annual survey found that only 28%

of training went to categories deemed as “function-agnostic,” such as

## management, executive, and communication training.

Some CLOs I spoke to say their companies are beneﬁting from

rethinking the focus on roles, particularly when the company needs to

# move quickly in a new direction.

skills and mindsets.” For example, one program, focused on

digitalization, is made available to all employees. While a more

traditional approach would have built individual training programs

for each function, the current digitalization program covers a range

of topics, including digital enablers, patient proﬁles, digital marketing,

automation in production, and more. According to Mantoni Macaire,

this approach is delivering far greater impact: “We see a 46%

## improvement in participants’ ability within our bespoke ‘digital

acumen’ skill set,” she says. “Even more impressively, the number of

digital experiments is up 85%, which we take as a direct proxy for

# business impact.”

L’Oréal has practiced a cross-functional approach to learning for nearly

a decade. In 2015, then-CEO Jean-Paul Agon committed the company to

shift e-commerce revenue from single-digit percentages to 20% of total

sales. This required a massive shift in the mindset and skills of leaders.

To achieve this, L’Oréal launched a leadership simulation called the

“wine game,” in which leaders from general management, marketing,

## sales, supply chain, ﬁnance, and legal come together for two days to

learn how to sell wine online. The game takes place on real platforms,

teaching leaders about digital ads, web analytics, customer experience,

and brand positioning. CLO Nicolas Pauthier credits this program with

playing a signiﬁcant role in achieving L’Oréal’s ambitious e-commerce

goals. In 2023, L’Oréal’s revenue from e-commerce was 27% of total

# sales.

Design learning experiences that encourage application.

However well their workplace learning programs are conceived or

designed, CLOs will only be able to have a meaningful impact on

strategic priorities when participants actually apply new skills and

# behaviors.

New formats for workplace learning can make it easier for this

application to happen. For example, as part of a program to increase the

adoption of AI tools, PwC launched a hybrid learning initiative called

“prompting parties.” These facilitated virtual events were designed

to help partners and employees experiment in a guided, hands-on

environment. Super users of ChatPwC, the ﬁrm’s internal AI tool, led

these sessions, in which participants tested various AI prompts and

learned how to apply AI as an integral part of their everyday roles.

“In the ﬁrst six months, we focused on building a base of knowledge

and interest and comfort”, said Houde. Within the ﬁrst month of the

AI enablement program, the ﬁrm received more than 400 requests for

additional prompting parties, underscoring the demand for interactive,

# practice-based learning.

Standard Chartered used “brain training games” to get employees to

practice new behaviors and integrate what they learned into their daily

work. These are two-minute tasks designed to build habit and reduce

reaction time. They can be used to enhance product knowledge, explain

acronyms, or build functional skills. For example, a brain training game

on data analysis rapidly shows random examples of clean and “dirty”

data sets, prompting the user to spot errors or make choices that help

them more quickly evaluate the quality of the data they work with.

According to Villeneuve, “We’ve delivered over 86 internally built brain

training games and we’ve been able to prove that many of these new

methods improve productivity, product knowledge and speed to desk

radically.”

## Move from participation-based KPIs to outcome-based KPIs.

CLOs must be able to show that their eﬀorts have a positive impact on

the metrics that matter most to their companies. And yet, according to

LinkedIn, only 30% of L&D professionals measure this.

One more outcome-based approach is to focus on productivity metrics that quantify improvements in speed and eﬀectiveness. For example,

the CLO of a large luxury goods company described a learning initiative

that was designed to boost sales from online channels. The program

played out over eight months and included webinars, project work, and

self-paced material, culminating in a two-day hackathon to identify

solutions for a speciﬁc challenge the business was facing. One team

focused on improving the search bounce rate, a crucial measure of the

number of people who arrive on a product’s website from a search

engine and then leave quickly. The lower the bounce rate, the more

likely the customer will buy something. Four months after the program,

the company saw a signiﬁcant improvement in the bounce rate, easily

justifying the cost of the training program.

Another approach is to apply a longitudinal perspective. Nestlé assesses

## the impact of its long-running leadership development program on

participants’ long-term career progression. The company created a

talent and performance dashboard that tracks performance, promotion

rates, and turnover. Within two to three years, participants in the

leadership development program have generally moved to a more

complex role, and their direct reports have higher promotion rates,

according to Andreina González, Nestlé’s global learning partner.

The CLOs I spoke with also noted the importance of regularly reviewing

learning KPIs with stakeholders. James Fulton, the head of Pine Street,

Goldman Sachs’ leadership development practice, says his team “has

a clear set of 18 KPIs which we review every two months with the

# president of the ﬁrm.”

# Create new work routines and structures.

All the CLOs I interviewed agreed that it was “very important” to be

connected to their CEOs’ top initiatives. Some are doing so with the help

of fresh work patterns that require regular interaction between the L&D

# function and business stakeholders.

At Novo Nordisk, Mantoni Macaire’s team has established a steering

committee for each strategic capability development initiative. “We take

a global approach,” she describes. “For example, in the digitization

initiative, we not only partnered closely with our chief information

oﬃcer, we made sure to get the key business unit heads on board. The

steering committee ensures that what we develop is relevant for all key

# stakeholders.”

At METRO, a leading wholesale operator headquartered in Germany,

Sangeeta Pandey, SVP of global talent & organizational development,

makes it a priority to visit the company’s stores worldwide. Her goal is to

build strong relationships with key executives and gain ﬁrsthand insight

into business needs. “During country visits, I rarely spend more than

half a day in the oﬃce,” she explains. “Instead, I focus on connecting

with employees at all levels, engaging with customers, and visiting

stores, depots, warehouses and platforms.” This hands-on approach has

enabled her to build the relational capital necessary to bring leaders

## together for candid discussions about development needs.

Goldman Sachs has made a more formal tie between learning and

strategic priorities. Its Pine Street practice supports its senior-level

employees and undertakes senior succession planning. Fulton, its head,

reports directly to the president of Goldman Sachs, reﬂecting the

strategic importance of developing the ﬁrm’s leaders.

is more critical than ever. CLOs who adopt these practices will be able

to help their organizations adapt successfully by being more tied to
