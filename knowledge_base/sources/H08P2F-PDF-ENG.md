Risks from “forever chemicals”—a term for per- and polyﬂuoroalkyl

substances (PFAS), a group of industrial chemicals that are extremely

diﬃcult to break down—are accumulating. It’s estimated that the

drinking water of 200 million people in the United States contains them

in quantities above the safe limit and that 99% of Americans have them

in our blood. Less well-known: They are widely found in the air and dust

in our buildings because of the products we buy.

Companies that use forever chemicals today may soon ﬁnd themselves

to be in the same situation as those that routinely used asbestos, lead

paint, or PCBs in the past. These substances were once celebrated and

widely used until we realized that they posed very serious and wide-

ranging risks to human health and the environment. Billions of dollars

in lawsuits and eventual regulatory bans led to their decline and the rise

of substitutes, but their toxic legacy lives on decades later due to their

durability. Forever chemicals are on this same trajectory: More than 30

state attorneys general are already suing manufacturers; 3M, the biggest

producer, just settled a $10 billion lawsuit; and some environmental

lawyers are predicting an onslaught of further litigation.

Manufacturers of products containing forever chemicals have been put

on notice. But nearly every organization buying products that contain

forever chemicals can also get ahead of this issue now.

Here’s a primer on forever chemicals and advice on what your

organization can do to help reduce risk to your employees and

customers, as we’ve done at Harvard University and seen at other

## companies including Google, Kaiser Permanent, and Meta.

# Why Forever Chemicals Are Dangerous

Five years ago, one of us (Joseph Allen) coined the term “forever

chemicals.” The name uses the initials of ﬂuorine and carbon, whose

bonds serve as PFAS’ building blocks, and describes their deﬁning

feature: because these chemical bonds are the strongest in organic

chemistry, they don’t ever fully break down.

The strength of these bonds imparts some very useful properties. Put

a coating of forever chemicals on a product, and not much—oils,

stains, water, or food gunk—gets through, which is why they have

long been used to make non-stick pans, ﬁreﬁghting foam, and stain-

resistant and water-repellent furniture fabrics, paints and coatings,

carpets and ﬂooring, wallboards and insulation, food packaging, and

# outdoor clothing.

But because they’re largely indestructible and migrate out of products

or are released into the environment, PFAS can be found in water and

## soil around manufacturing facilities, airports and ﬁrehouses, in sewage

sludge used on millions of farms, and even in the Arctic, the middle

of the ocean, and rainwater. We also ﬁnd forever chemicals in air and

dust inside every type of building, which is one of the ways—along with

contaminated drinking water and food — that they enter our bodies.

Once in our body, forever chemicals can wreak havoc. They are linked to

increased risk of kidney and testicular cancer. They may also impact

weight gain; for example, a study by colleagues at Harvard found

## that, among women in a weight-loss program, those with higher levels

of forever chemicals were faster to regain pounds lost. Some forever

chemicals are associated with total cholesterol levels and LDL (the

bad cholesterol), both of which are potential causal risk factors for

cardiovascular disease. These chemicals can interfere with our immune

systems, with studies showing lower vaccine eﬃcacy in children with

higher levels of them, and our reproductive health, altering menstrual

cycles and reducing sperm quality.

Despite the accumulating awareness of the risks, remain on the rise

## globally. In the United States, Environmental Protection Agency (EPA)

regulations currently cover only forever chemicals in water—and only

# six of the more than 10,000.

# A Healthier Materials Playbook

So forever chemicals are toxic, they’re widely used in buildings, are in

our bodies, and regulation alone isn’t solving the problem. However,

getting forever chemicals out of your buildings isn’t hard or costly.

## Over the past decade at Harvard University, more than 50 major capital

projects covering more than 5 million square feet of real estate on

our campus—plus many interior renovation projects—have followed a

simple, two-part playbook. And along the way, we’ve collaborated with

several major corporations that are working toward the same.

- 1. Demand transparency.

When your organization buys products for its buildings, manufacturers

seldom provide an ingredient label like you get with food. And those

that do provide building materials labels rarely, if ever, indicate whether

they contain forever chemicals. As a result, we’re essentially ﬂying

# blind.

To truly understand what risks you’re taking on, you need to know

exactly what’s in your wall and ﬂoor coverings, furnishings, and

workplace accessories. So, the ﬁrst step in our playbook is simply to

get an ingredient list for every product you’re adding. You might do

the same for those already purchased, though we realize that ﬁnancial

realities might prevent you from replacing items before their end-of-life.

If that’s the case, simply focus on the future. Tell your suppliers that you

## want Health Product Declarations for any new building products you

# buy.

- 2. Avoid the entire class of forever chemicals (and other known toxic chemicals). Next, tell your suppliers you want to purchase products guaranteed to

contain no forever chemicals. Don’t just specify particular well-known

forever chemicals to avoid, like PFOA or PFOS or others that have been

put on a “red list.” (Recall that there are more than 10,000 forever

chemicals, so limiting one or two won’t address the problem.) Tell them

you don’t want any of them.

This is to avoid what has been termed “regrettable substitution,” where

## a potentially toxic but less scrutinized chemical cousin to a well-studied

one is used as a replacement. This “class-based” approach—treating

## forever chemicals as a large group, rather than one-by-one avoidance—

will help you to future-proof your decisions.

When building or renovating buildings on Harvard’s campus, we

ﬁrst focused on 14 major categories of interior products, such as

carpeting and furniture. Interestingly, we found that swapping in

forever-chemical-free alternatives had no downsides: It did not lead

to increased costs, did not delay project timelines, or result in worse

# product performance or aesthetics.

We’ve even done side-by-side tests in highly traﬃcked areas of items like sofas with and without forever chemicals. Our cleaning staﬀ

indicated that those without forever chemicals were easier to clean

because stains were no longer getting trapped below the forever

# chemical coating.

We’re making these changes across campus when we renovate or

replace products, and the materials are holding up well. We don’t

need to replace them any earlier than we did the versions with forever

chemicals. Moreover, we’re sourcing from many of the same suppliers

and brands we always have, and they’re able to meet our requirements

# largely without added costs.

As for the health impact of these changes, our studies have found that

spaces reﬁtted to follow our playbook had nearly 80% lower levels of

forever chemicals in the dust compared to spaces that were renovated

# earlier.

There’s more to do, however. Forever chemicals are also in electronics

## and cabling, food packaging, and cleaning and outdoor products on

campus. We’re looking at these categories now and having success

indoors, but, so far, ﬁnding forever-chemical-free exterior products has

been challenging and in some cases signiﬁcantly more expensive.

Forever chemicals are also in things outside of our control, like the

clothing people wear and products they bring into the buildings. We

can’t reduce everyone’s exposure everywhere in their lives, but we can—

and feel an obligation to—do our best in the spaces that we control with

measures grounded in peer-reviewed science.

We’re also investigating other chemical classes of concern beyond

forever chemicals based on established science, including ﬂame

retardants, antimicrobials that make health claims, and plasticizers

# such as phthalates.

We hope our approach can serve as an example for other organizations

that might be confused about how to start addressing forever

chemicals. There are still no science-based third-party certiﬁcations

indicating which products are free from all forever chemicals, nor are

companies 100% aligned on what they’re asking from manufacturers. But harmonization eﬀorts are underway, and tens of millions of

dollars are already ﬂowing toward the purchase of healthier materials,

prompting manufacturers to innovate. Shaw Industries, for example,

recently introduced durable, resilient ﬂooring that does not contain

## forever chemicals, or chemical ﬂame retardants, or antimicrobials, or

# phthalates or PVC.
