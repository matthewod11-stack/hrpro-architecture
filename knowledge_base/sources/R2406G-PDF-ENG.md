The Spotify app knows what you want to hear. It uses AI to process a

vast array of your engagement data, including the songs, podcasts, and

audiobooks you’ve listened to, when you listened to them, and what led

you to them. Its library is tagged by genre, era, tempo, mood, and a long

list of other characteristics. The tags allow Spotify to collate playlists

based on your listening habits. The app is always learning, constantly

running micro tests with user groups. Spotify attributes a large part

## of its success to its personalized recommendations—its user base and

revenues have both increased by 1,000% in the past decade to more

## than 600 million users and $14 billion, respectively.

Despite investing heavily in technology that could make

personalization easier, faster, and smarter, most companies struggle to

achieve Spotify’s degree of personalization. In a BCG survey of 5,000

global consumers designed to gauge the eﬀectiveness of personalized

recommendations, two-thirds of respondents say they have recently

experienced a recommendation that was inappropriate, inaccurate,

## or invasive. Despite such negative experiences, more than 80% of

respondents say they want and expect personalized experiences.

Business leaders aren’t responding quickly enough. A BCG survey of

more than 1,400 global C-suite executives found that 85% of business

leaders plan to increase spending on AI in 2024. But most of that is

earmarked for cost-saving initiatives rather than personalization. That

is a mistake. We believe that personalization will be the most exciting

and most proﬁtable outcome of the emerging AI boom—but only for

companies that make it a strategic focus.

Unfortunately, most companies lack a clear understanding of what

great personalization should look like. We attempt to remedy that

problem in this article. Drawing on decades of work consulting on the

personalization eﬀorts of hundreds of large companies, we have built

the Personalization Index. This metric, a single score from 0 to 100,

measures how well companies deliver on the promises they implicitly

make to customers when they personalize an interaction.

To be clear, personalization isn’t as simple as automatically plugging

customer names into emails. True personalization requires creating

experiences at scale, which get ﬁne-tuned with each successive

interaction and empower customers to get what they want—faster,

cheaper, or more easily. Doing so requires delivering on ﬁve implicit

promises that shape customers’ expectations: empower me, know me,

reach me, show me, and delight me. We’ll describe how the components

of the index are based on these promises and show businesses how to

assess their own Personalization Index score.

# Building the Personalization Index

To develop the index, we surveyed 200 marketers, acted as mystery

shoppers to observe how companies delivered experiences across

channels, and performed a ﬁnancial analysis of the impact of

## personalization on companies’ growth and shareholder returns. We

developed, tested, and reﬁned the index’s rubric internally at BCG

and in our work with hundreds of clients. It uses objective questions,

which allows scoring to remain consistent, whether the assessment was

conducted by someone at BCG or by clients themselves.

Our research uncovered a set of performance drivers for each

component of the Personalization Index. Let’s look at each one in turn

and examine how personalization leaders—companies that score in the

top quartile of the index overall and excel in at least one area—are

getting it right.

# Sample Personalization Self-Assessment

Know me • Does customer data live in a single repository?

- Is customer data integrated throughout our other marketing systems?

- Do we have high-quality identity resolution in place?

Reach me • Do we conduct A/B testing on our personalization efforts?

- Have we deployed a next-best-action deci-sioning or product

# recommendation engine?

- Do we automate customer segmentation?

Show me • Do we offer tailored experiences on a 1:1 basis for every customer? 10:1?

100:1?

- Are we able to conduct personalized experiences or campaigns quickly

from ideation to launch?

- Do we use gen Al to automate the production of marketing collateral?

Delight me • Do organizational or technological impediments keep us from measuring

# progress on personalization?

- Do we run weekly tests related to personalization?

- Do we implement improvements on a weekly or more frequent basis?

Empower me. Personalization leaders start by asking: How can I make

the customer’s experience better by personalizing it? They understand

customers’ unique needs at every step of their journey and decide

how personalization can best help them. This is the most important

component of the Personalization Index. To determine this score, we

use mystery shopping activities and customer surveys to assess the level

and quality of personalization that companies are delivering.

A leader in this area is SonderMind, a mental wellness company.

of adults in the United States today struggle with mental health. It can

be confusing to navigate the various treatment options, so SonderMind

set out to empower its users to ﬁnd help more easily. SonderMind’s

app personalizes patient journeys on the basis of interactive experiences

that assess 12 brain functions (such as mental-processing speed and

a predisposition to anxiety and depression), and patients log their

progress against goals they set. While protecting individual patient

privacy, the app learns from the experiences of its many users and can

suggest simple actions for each user to take (in addition to connecting

with a therapist)—for example, practicing a meditation exercise or

keeping a diary of one’s feelings. It also arms therapists with tools to

develop the optimal treatment plan, based on anonymized data about

what has worked for similar patients. The result has been a win-win:

## lower costs for insurers and better outcomes for patients.

Know me. Personalization leaders win their customers’ trust; they are

granted permission to securely collect their data and use insights

culled from it to improve the customer experience. Here, we look at

the number and depth of digital relationships a company has with

customers and its ability to retain them. We also look at the maturity

## of its customer data management and identity matching.

Spotify is one of a dozen or so large brands that have an average of

upwards of 600 million monthly users. But personalization leaders

don’t have to be the largest in their categories to deliver on this

## promise. Sweetgreen, a newcomer to the restaurant business relative

to the largest chains, illustrates this point well. Right from its start,

in 2007, it invested in building digital relationships with customers. It

launched a mobile app in 2013, ahead of many large restaurant chains,

and progressively added features such as mobile ordering, delivery,

personalized oﬀers and challenges, and a loyalty program to drive

digital engagement. Sweetgreen stands out not only in terms of its

in terms of engagement: Customers who use its digital channels order

## order salads at one of its brick-and-mortar locations.

Reach me. Having the data to know the customer is not enough.

Leaders use AI to identify triggers to reach out, such as when a

customer browses online or makes an inquiry. Moreover, they invest

in orchestrating touches across channels and use smart frequency

management to ensure that their touches are coordinated, not

overwhelming. To assess an organization’s maturity in this area, we

examine the sophistication of its targeting intelligence, how advanced

its experimentation capabilities are (as measured by the volume, speed,

and scale of its experiments), and how well it orchestrates actions across

# channels.

Karen Knorr’s series India Song digitally combines interiors of religious and secular significance with images of animals to interrogate notions of hierarchy and heritage.

Although Cisco focuses primarily on B2B customer experiences, it

turned to personalization to enable its account teams and customers to

navigate its ever-growing range of products and services. It recognizes

that every client has a diﬀerent context and that clients’ situations

can change rapidly. So it combined a wide range of data sources

across the company, including product use, service requests, marketing

## interactions, and even external triggers such as ﬁnancial news.

Coordinating all this data has made Cisco a personalization leader. Its

sales team knows whom to contact, when, and about what, and comes

armed with relevant content and demos. Because Cisco’s sales and

marketing teams are closely linked, customers get coordinated exposure

to content that supports their needs and that opens up sales dialogues.

Leveraging data on interactions around the world, Cisco uses AI models

to understand the appropriate level of engagement for each account and

to suggest the right timing to approach contacts. The models also make

recommendations that marketers and salespeople can act on. Adoption

of these tools quickly accelerated as salespeople found they could grow

their account portfolios without losing momentum with their existing

# key accounts.

Show me. Personalization leaders build and manage robust content

libraries that they tailor to the unique needs of each customer—while

staying true to their brand voice. To do this, many are leveraging

generative AI tools to create content. To evaluate companies on this

promise, we looked at how sophisticated their content creation and

management capabilities were and how well they personalized text,

## images, and videos for individual customers.

The global jewelry brand Pandora thrives by sparking customer interest

with inspirational content. As part of its strategy, it uses AI-generated

content to tailor its messaging to each customer and cut cycle times

## for certain types of content creation from 12–14 months to a mere

10 days. The company learned that personalizing the background and

model image for each individual—and coordinating how the customer

## sees those images across emails, websites, and other ads—substantially

improved conversion rates.

Delight me. Personalization leaders adopt agile ways of working to

accelerate the testing and learning that improve the intelligence

behind each customer interaction. As noted earlier, true personalization

requires that the quality and value of customer experiences be

continually ﬁne-tuned. Our research shows that the delight me promise

is the hardest to deliver on. It requires relentless experimentation.

learning you capture and feed into your AI engines, optimizing

what you can deliver at increasingly granular levels. This level of

personalization requires technology, but it also requires new operating

processes that marry AI with organizational intelligence. Therefore, we

measure the speed and scale of the company’s test-and-learn process,

## the sophistication and automation of its measurement, and how the

organization is set up for personalization—for instance, the prevalence

## of cross-functional agile teams, a clear owner of the initiative, and

# committed funding.

Many of the personalization leaders that set the bar in this area are

digital natives. DoorDash runs hundreds of micro-experiments in its

app, testing things such as improvements in add-to-cart and product-

substitution recommendations. It has designed its app and its tech

infrastructure to quickly run and measure such experiments, and

it operates agile teams that act on the learnings to improve each

# personalized digital experience.

Instead of competing on manufacturing scale, companies are competing on the scale of customer interactions and on the speed at which they learn from interactions.

More-traditional companies often fail a few times before they manage

to emulate these approaches. We recently worked with a large U.S.

bank that had created a team charged with breaking down silos to

deliver greater agility throughout the company. But all it did was

create yet another silo. We disbanded it and replaced it with a cross-

functional “agile” pod, made up of in-house representatives from

## marketing, analytics, IT, creative, data science, and engineering. The

participants had the authority and the budget to take meaningful

action. They were tasked with a common goal of increasing the speed

of testing. Within two months they cut the bank’s traditional 12-week

campaign-development process down to three days. Capitalizing on that

drastically shorter cycle time, they launched hundreds of new tests,

exponentially increasing their rate of learning. Those actions cut the

bank’s credit card churn rates in half and doubled the rate of converting

# leads into new active card members.

As those examples illustrate, getting personalization right has many

components, but a marketer who is reasonably familiar with the

company’s personalization capabilities can complete a reliable self-

assessment with a 15-minute survey. A full assessment can be done in a

couple of weeks. We believe that it is worth your time and eﬀort.

# The Power of Personalization

The nature of competition is changing. Instead of competing on

manufacturing scale, companies are competing on the scale of customer

interactions, by building up their loyalty programs, app registrations,

authenticated website users, and reasons to interact across the

customer journey, to name a few examples. They compete on the speed

at which they learn from interactions by testing variations in every

interaction. They also compete on their ability to use their learning to

tailor the customer experience by having cross-functional teams that

constantly experiment with new experience designs, content, timing,

channels, and the like. Here are several high-level takeaways from our

research into personalization that can help businesses move forward.

Personalization leaders can be found in every industry. Across the 12

industry segments we reviewed, companies today score, on average,

only 49 on the Personalization Index. The average score of companies

in the top decile is 72. Unsurprisingly, the index leaders tend to be

## other early movers in the personalization space, such as Starbucks and

Sephora. But we found leaders in almost all sectors.

We have already highlighted some in media (Spotify), healthcare

(SonderMind), restaurants (Sweetgreen), B2B technology (Cisco),

## fashion (Pandora), and delivery services (DoorDash, a digital native).

The diﬀerences within sectors are more pronounced than those across

## sectors. In addition to digital natives, the food, drug, and mass retail

sectors also rate highly as a group—not surprising, given the data-rich

loyalty programs, high purchase frequencies, volume of touchpoints,

## and number of products in those sectors, all of which enable companies

to collect more data in less time. Although companies in more

highly regulated industries, such as insurance, ﬁnancial services, and

healthcare, tend to score lower on the index, some ﬁrms in those sectors

have leapfrogged their competitors.

Advanced personalization generates lots of revenue. Companies that

put personalization and AI at the center of their customer strategy

are growing 10 percentage points faster than personalization laggards

and six points faster than companies on average (see the exhibit

“Better Personalization Leads to Faster Growth”). The data shows that

personalization leaders have more digital customer relationships, and

their customers spend 30% more than customers as a whole in their

category. The root cause of this diﬀerence is that their customers engage

three times as often (not just by transacting but also pre- and post-

purchase) as do the customers of their competitors. As a result, the

leading companies generate more data and insights on which to base

future personalized interactions.

Scaling personalization across customer interactions is crucial.

the beneﬁts of detailed data in every interaction. When we examined

the link between customer satisfaction (measured by a company’s Net

Promoter Score) and the Personalization Index, we observed a positive

correlation. For every 10 points higher that a company scored on the

index, its Net Promoter Score tended to increase by an average of seven

points. The levels of customer satisfaction at companies that score low

on the index vary widely. Indeed, some companies with exceptional

## service and value don’t rely on personalization—think of a low-cost

retailer known for its private-label quality or a no-frills airline known for

## on-time arrivals. However, the relationship between index ranking and

customer satisfaction is clearest among personalization leaders. All top-

scoring companies in the Personalization Index had NPS scores above

30, and only companies with high index scores had NPS scores above

- 40. By building personalization programs that scale up, companies can

truly stand out among the world’s best and achieve the highest levels of

# customer satisfaction.

Personalization leaders deliver superior value creation. We examined

## the value creation track record of personalization leaders over time. The

top quartile of companies in the Personalization Index outperformed

not only the laggards but also the market index over three, ﬁve,

and 10 years. The performances of the leaders and the laggards were

## already markedly diﬀerent before 2020, but the Covid-19 pandemic

accentuated the gap. One dollar invested in a personalization leader

would have yielded three dollars after ﬁve years; the same investment in

a personalization laggard would be worth only 50 cents.

These results show that companies that successfully execute

personalization at scale are growing faster, delighting their customers,

and creating superior value as they capture share from competitors.

personalization leaders and laggards by sector and taking into account

the size of each sector, we estimate that a $2 trillion prize is waiting to be

captured across industries by personalization leaders.

## Voya Financial Keeps the Promises of Personalization

One company that’s realizing the potential of personalization is Voya

Financial. Recognizing that employee beneﬁts were becoming a no-

win commodity game, Voya’s leaders set out to diﬀerentiate the

ﬁrm. They positioned it as a partner that would improve how its

clients’ employees managed their ﬁnances while delivering superior

economics for employers. To do that, they focused on pulling together

a complete ﬁnancial picture for registered users—including their

## retirement plans, personal ﬁnancial activity, and healthcare beneﬁts.

Voya examined how people make ﬁnancial decisions and discovered

numerous opportunities to be a better partner. If it could get a

more complete picture of customer ﬁnancials, executives realized, it

could dramatically improve its ability to inform customers about their

situations and recommend options.

Voya’s leaders started by recognizing that most people don’t really

understand how their disparate ﬁnancial relationships ﬁt together.

Their research showed that few people had thought through how their

healthcare costs were likely to aﬀect their ﬁnancial plans, or why their

retirement and personal savings should have diﬀerent goals and get

diﬀerent tax treatment. So they ﬁrst focused on bringing together all the

data, educating their members, and providing a single app, My Voyage,

where members could see and add to their ﬁnancial proﬁles.

The top quartile of firms in the Personalization Index outperformed not only the laggards but also the market index over three, five, and 10 years.

Then Voya experimented with new customer experiences that

were driven by personalization. When customers gave Voya a full

picture of their ﬁnancial portfolios, the company quickly produced

recommendations for rebalancing the portfolios for optimal health,

even if it meant money would be moved out of Voya accounts. By being

objective, Voya built trust, and members felt encouraged to add more of

## their accounts outside Voya into the app.

Next Voya built a “test engine” to relentlessly experiment in order

to learn how best to encourage members to take a useful action,

such as increasing their retirement contributions, setting up a health

savings account, or moving personal savings into an account with better

interest rates. The company started with its own employees, working

through the execution issues and building its base of data. Then it

scaled up those eﬀorts and continually learned from its experiments.

AI capabilities helped spot which members would beneﬁt, helped set up

the cells for testing multiple variables, and generated creative variants

for the program team to consider.

Taken together, these personalization eﬀorts contributed to not only

## a growth in accounts and double-digit revenue growth but also

widespread accolades. Voya was named one of the “Most Trusted

## Financial Services” brands by Newsweek in 2023 and one of the “World’s

# Most Ethical Companies” by Ethisphere.

# Calculating Your Index Score

Now that we’ve proved the power of personalization, we’ll help you

determine your company’s index score.

personalization you deliver to your customers in each step of their

journey across all your channels. Because delivering on the ﬁrst promise

of personalization, empower me, is the most important, this score makes

up half the Personalization Index score. To determine your score,

identify the steps of your customer’s journey and the channels where

personalization truly matters and can make the experience better,

faster, or more convenient. (That will depend on the categories you play

in, your customers’ expectations, and how well your competitors are

personalizing.) Then look at what real customers recently experienced

and evaluate whether you are personalizing “fully 1:1,” “extensively,”

“moderately,” or “not at all,” and assign yourself points accordingly.

Know me (10 points). Measure the number and quality of the digital

customer relationships you have relative to the total customer base in

the markets you serve. Ask yourself how easily you can contact these

## customers across channels and how advanced your data management

practices are. For example, how do you handle data governance? And

have you built a customer-360 database leveraging universal customer-

# identity matching?

Reach me (10 points). Measure how ﬁnely tuned your targeting

models are. Are you using automated experimentation and machine

learning to optimize the next best action for your customers and

orchestrating across channels? Leaders leverage machine-learning AI

## solutions while laggards pull customer-targeting lists manually, with

# limited segmentation.

Show me (10 points). The length of time it takes you to launch a

personalized campaign is a good barometer of your company’s maturity

on this dimension. (Laggard organizations take 12 or more weeks, but

leaders take a few days.) It is also worth assessing how advanced your

automated content creation and management capabilities are. Leaders

leverage well-tagged content libraries and the latest gen AI solutions,

paired with automated content creation processes, whereas laggards

manually create each campaign, with little reuse of assets.

Delight me (10 points). Measure how well and how quickly you can test,

learn from, and improve the customer experience. Diagnose whether

you have organizational or technological impediments to measuring

progress on personalization and implementing improvements on a

weekly or more frequent basis. Leaders learn 10 times as fast as laggards

do; they run hundreds of experiments and turn around improvements

in days, while laggards take many months to achieve the same feat.

And ﬁnally, be accountable (10 points). After you’ve assessed your

performance on the ﬁve implicit promises, ask yourself whether your

organization has a senior leader who is accountable for personalization,

with P&L responsibility and a cross-functional mandate. In the large

companies we studied, we have often found this to be what makes the

diﬀerence between success and failure in personalization. That’s why

having such a senior leader in place is worth the ﬁnal 10 points on the

# index.

# Lessons from the Leaders

Personalization leaders follow a playbook to deliver on each of

the ﬁve promises of personalization, starting with how to empower

the customer. Senior executives looking to accelerate their own

personalization eﬀorts can follow that playbook no matter how mature

their current personalization eﬀorts are. We have found three areas of

focus that make the diﬀerence between success and failure.

Rethink leadership roles and set a clear vision. Because

personalization is such a cross-functional eﬀort, its mandate must come

from the CEO, and the C-suite should rally around a shared strategic

vision. Every C-suite executive should explicitly support the vision

and be accountable for delivering on it. The CFO, for instance, must understand the business case. The CDO (chief digital oﬃcer) needs to

be accountable for the digital experience. The CMO must instill agile marketing practices. The chief data and analytics oﬃcer (CDAO) needs

to build robust platforms and intelligence. The COO needs to rethink the

processes required to deliver a personalized customer experience, and

the general counsel must champion responsible personalization and AI

principles in partnership with the CDAO. The CIO needs to prioritize

and deliver on the right technology investments in constant partnership

with the business, and so on. Ultimately, as we explained in “Customer

## Experience in the Age of AI” (HBR, March–April 2022), small agile teams

comprising many of these functions need to deliver on each wave of

# personalization use cases.

Secure the personalization foundation. The Personalization Index,

paired with your strategic plan, will quickly highlight the gaps in your

foundational capabilities. The key to success is prioritizing how to

address those gaps and tying the upside and investments associated

with each to the overall business case. Personalization leaders also

apply the principles of smart integration. (For more detail, see “What

## Smart Companies Know About Integrating AI,” HBR, July–August 2023.)

They recognize that not everything has to be built internally, and the

integration of the parts is just as important as the selection of the right

components. In our experience, personalization can be largely self-

funding, even in the initial years, when the right trade-oﬀs are made.

As the teams deliver concrete business value, larger investments can be

funded and the partnership between ﬁnance and a personalization team

becomes even more important to ensure that a portion of the gains are

regularly invested back into personalization eﬀorts.

Compete on speed. Ultimately, personalization depends on the speed

and scale of learning. Hence every organization should ask itself

how teams could rethink processes to learn 10 times as fast. Many

organizations are still working in eight- to 12-week campaign cycles.

Three to ﬁve days is possible in every industry. Even companies

that have cut their cycles down to days have a hard time taking the

learnings forward quickly and enhancing the next customer interaction.

Automation of speciﬁc areas (enhancing content, for example, or

## HBR / Magazine Article / Personalization Done Right

For several decades companies have been gradually improving

their ﬁnancial performance by tapping the range of capabilities

that can power personalization. We are now at a tipping point:

Brand-diﬀerentiating personalization is not only possible but will be

essential for competitive success. With the availability of new AI

tools, a company’s ability to embed personalization capabilities in its

operations has increased dramatically.

As the Personalization Index shows, there is a marked diﬀerence

between the leaders—who are reshaping their value propositions and

go-to-market approaches through personalization—and those who are

just using basic tech tools to bombard prospects with impersonal

messages. Tomorrow’s winners are already using AI to unlock

personalization’s potential, and they are building new sustainable

advantages along the way. The time for delivering growth with AI-

enabled personalization is now.

Mark Abraham and David C. Edelman are the coauthors of Personalized: Customer Strategy in the Age of AI (Harvard Business Review Press, 2024), from which this article is adapted.
