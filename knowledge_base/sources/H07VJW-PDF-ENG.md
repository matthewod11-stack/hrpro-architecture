Effective communication has never been more critical in our rapidly

evolving world, where every conversation, negotiation, meeting, or

pitch could impact our personal and professional success. We are much

In this article, I will present a three-question structure that I believe

## serves as an indispensable tool for various scenarios, from impromptu

interactions to crucial business presentations, but ﬁrst let’s start with

why having a structured approach is so useful.

# The Value of Structure in Communication

A structure provides a roadmap, a logical connection of ideas that

guides both the communicator and the listener. Think of it as a carefully

crafted story or a well-designed recipe. And the beneﬁts of using one are

# many:

- Clarity: A structure eliminates ambiguity, ensuring that your message

is straightforward and easy to understand and follow.

- Retention: Ideas presented in a structured manner are more likely to

be remembered, making your communication more impactful.

Our brains are actually designed to encode and remember structured

# information.

- Persuasion: A logical structure builds your case point by point,

facilitating persuasion by guiding your audience through a reasoned

# argument.

- Eﬃciency: Structure saves time and mental energy, simplifying

## complex ideas into digestible, actionable points.

- Reduced anxiety: Having a predeﬁned structure can signiﬁcantly

lessen communication anxiety, as you already know how to convey

what you need to say and you are less likely to forget your content.

# The “What, So What, Now What” Framework

Much like the Swiss Army Knife, known for its versatility and

reliability, this structure is ﬂexible and can be used in many diﬀerent

communication situations. The structure is comprised of three simple

# questions:

- What: Describe and deﬁne the facts, situation, product, position, etc.

- So What: Discuss the implications or importance for the audience. In

# other words, the relevance to them.

- Now What: Outline the call-to-action or next steps, such as taking

questions or setting up a next meeting.

This structure not only helps in organizing your thoughts but also

serves as a guidepost for your audience, making the information easier

to follow and act upon.

# The Framework in Action

What does this structure look like in practice? Here are three examples:

- 1. Introductions

Introductions can often ramble and confuse. Using this structure can

help you be clear and set expectations for what is to come.

When you’re introducing someone:

- What: I am honored to introduce Dr. Clark, who is here to discuss her

# insights into attachment theory.

- So What: Her work has changed the way many people go about

making daily decisions. I am certain you will think diﬀerently when

you leave here tonight.

- Now What: Without further ado, join me in welcoming Dr. Clark.

When you’re introducing something:

- What: I am excited to introduce the latest version of our product. In

this release we’ve added many usability enhancements and improved

# our speed.

- So What: Now our clients can more easily complete their tasks and

# save time and money.

- Now What: When you leave this conference session, please install it

# today.

- 2. Answering a question

Questions are a great opportunity to use this structure. For example,

imagine a job interview where you are asked: “Why are you qualiﬁed for

# this job?”

- What: I have over 12 years of experience in customer-facing

work, addressing challenges such as migrating to new systems and

implementing new processes.

- So What: These previous experiences will help me provide your

customers with high-quality results, while also assisting you to

streamline your deployment process.

- Now What: I’m happy to have you discuss my qualiﬁcations with some

# of my former clients.

- 3. Giving feedback

I often coach clients who need to provide constructive feedback to use

this structure. For example, you have a colleague who failed to complete

# his report on time.

- What: I’ve noticed that your report was not submitted within our

# agreed-upon timeframe.

- So What: This puts us at a disadvantage for practicing our pitch and

might jeopardize our client meeting.

- Now What: I need for you to complete this report by tomorrow

morning. Please let me know what I can do to assist you.

communication situations, ensuring that your message is not just heard

# but internalized and acted upon.
