The success of diversity initiatives — which are designed to address

social inequities and ensure that all employees are treated equally

— depends on the support of those in positions of structural power:

which is to say, managers. But even those managers who generally

support diversity initiatives often deny the existence of problems at

their own organizations and therefore resist such initiatives. Consider

the response of Marc Benioﬀ, the CEO of Salesforce, when two of his

executives, both women, told him that the company was paying men

and women unequally. Benioﬀ later recalled his response during a 60

# Minutes interview with Lesley Stahl:

Benioff: I said, “That’s not possible here.” You know, it’s — it’s not

possible. Stahl: Why was it impossible?

Benioff: It’s impossible because we have a great culture here. We’re —

we’re a “best place to work.” And we don’t do that kind of thing. We

don’t play shenanigans paying people — paying people unequally. It’s

unheard of. It’s crazy.

Benioﬀ isn’t an anomaly in exhibiting that kind of denial. In 2020, when

Michelle King, the director of inclusion at Netﬂix, interviewed 72 senior

executives about the pay gap between the sexes, the majority of them —

men and women alike — told her that at their organizations everybody

has “identical opportunities, workplace experiences, and career paths.”

Given how much time and money companies are now investing

in diversity initiatives (estimated at up to $15 billion by 2026), it’s

vital that they understand what’s behind this kind of denial, so

that they can better overcome it and put their money to good use.

Practitioners, academics, and the popular press have tended to identify

two explanations. Some managers, they argue, behave this way because

they’re part of a privileged demographic group (usually white men), and

diversity initiatives threaten their hegemony. Other managers do so,

they argue, because they’re members of politically conservative groups

that are opposed to the initiatives on ideological grounds.

There’s surely something to both of those explanations. But we’ve

recently conducted a series of studies that suggest a diﬀerent and

perhaps more powerful explanation. Managers are resisting diversity

initiatives, we’ve found, because … they’re managers.

# “Not Here” Bias

Why would that be a problem?

Because managers identify with their company, in ways that lead them

to consider the company’s good traits to be reﬂections of themselves.

As a result, maintaining positive views of the company becomes vital

to their sense of themselves, at times warping their perspective. This

phenomenon, often referred to as motivated reasoning, is common. If

you’re a sports fan, you know it well: Calls made against your team tend

to be “bad.” Calls in your favor tend to be “good.”

In the context of the workplace, motivated reasoning prevents managers

from recognizing problems in their own organizations even though they

can easily recognize them in others. This form of bias, which can be

called a “not here” bias, is precisely what Marc Benioﬀ exhibited in the

example cited above — he couldn’t believe that inequity was possible

“here,” at his company. To be fair, his reaction was natural. After all,

who wants to be responsible for a department or group where inequity is

# an issue?

In our research, across multiple studies, we asked respondents to

indicate to what extent they believed inequity was a problem. In one

survey, managers reported that inequity was 13% less of an issue in

their workplace compared to non-managers. In a diﬀerent survey, we

found that managers scored only 2% lower than non-managers when

rating inequity in other workplaces — but when rating it in their own

workplace, they scored 17% lower.

Such diﬀerences have consequences. In a third survey, we found that

because managers tended to diminish the importance of inequity as

an issue in their own workplaces, they were 19% less supportive than

non-managers of diversity initiatives that were intended to address the

# problem.

# What to Do?

This poses an obvious challenge. Managers are the ones who have the

power to implement and enforce diversity initiatives, but because they

don’t recognize the extent of the need for these initiatives at their own

organizations, they are less supportive of them.

To overcome that challenge, we recommend three courses of action, all

rooted in ﬁndings that have emerged from our research.

# Challenge default positive views.

In one experiment, we divided a group of managers into two and then asked half of them to describe a typical day in the oﬃce and half of them

to recall speciﬁc instances of inequities there. They were then asked

to allocate a percentage of a hypothetical budget surplus to a diversity

initiative. Those managers who were asked to recall inequities ended up

saying they would allocate 30% more funding to diversity initiatives.

(The eﬀect was less pronounced among non-managers, where the

question led only to a 10% increase.) Such diﬀerences occur, we believe,

because asking managers to recall speciﬁc inequities challenges their

motivated reasoning — it’s harder to maintain a positive view of your

workplace when you’re forced to confront its inequities.

That’s precisely what happened to Marc Benioﬀ at Salesforce. When

told that inequities existed at the company, he denied it was possible.

But, after his executives confronted him with speciﬁc examples, he

acknowledged the problem and committed several million dollars to

the alleviation of gender-based discrepancies. Salesforce has since then

also adopted another eﬀective strategy for addressing inequity: data

dashboards, which record examples of inequities in compensation,

## development opportunities, promotions, and performance ratings.

Organizations looking to garner support for diversity initiatives can

require managers to engage with such data or examples on a regular

# basis.

Consider your “not here” bias.

In another study, we had participants read a short article describing

our research on a “not here” bias, and then we asked them to describe

the inequity in their workplace. Compared to a control group, we found

that these managers rated inequity in their workplace as 10% higher

(as opposed to 3% higher from non-managers). This suggests to us that

regularly asking managers to reﬂect on how the “not here” bias applies

to their workplace can help them apply the same standards they use for

# other companies to their own workplace.

Redeﬁne what it means to be “good.”

Our research suggests that managers view their workplaces as equitable

because they want to have positive views of their organization — and

in their minds, “good” workplaces are those where inequity doesn’t

exist. Such an outlook makes acknowledging inequity hard, even for

people who believe in working against it. The solution here is to work to

deﬁne a “good” organization diﬀerently — that is, as one that actively

identiﬁes, acknowledges, and combats inequity. Such a change can help

managers align their perceptions and actions with their organization’s

# diversity goals.

## Can managers perceive inequity in their own workplaces? Our research

suggests that they often can’t — and that those with the power to

implement initiatives designed to address inequity are therefore less

likely than others to see the need for such initiatives. To address
