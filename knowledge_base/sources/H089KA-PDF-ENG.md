The underrepresentation of women of color in technology continues to

be a persistent issue. “While 27% of computing roles in the U.S. market

are held by women, just 3% and 2% are held by African-American and

Hispanic American/Latina women respectively,” according to a research

report from Accenture. And “women overall leave tech roles at a 45%

higher rate than men.” Given these dismal statistics, tech companies

must invest in ensuring women of color are retained in the workplace.

# HBR / Digital Article / Breaking Down Barriers to Belonging for Women of Color in Tech

Previous research has focused mainly on the biases women of color in

tech experience, so I decided to look at workplace belonging speciﬁcally.

In February 2023, I launched a survey of 230 randomly sampled U.S.

## women of color in technology as part of my dissertation research.

From March to April 2023, I subsequently conducted 12 interviews

with women of color in technology with diversity in position, tenure,

role, ethnicity, company, and location. Each participant was assigned

a pseudonym to protect conﬁdentiality. The goal of the study was to

measure the level of workplace belonging reported, the top belonging

contributors and detractors, and to identify recommendations to

increase it. Here is what I found.

The average self-reported sense-of-belonging score was mediocre at best.

On average, women of color survey participants ranked their sense of

belonging a 6.7 out of 10, approximately 1.6 points lower on average than

their peers, based on extrapolated data from comparably.com.

Participant scores ﬂuctuated according to ethnicity but were not

statistically signiﬁcant due to a low sample size. Asian or Paciﬁc

Islander women reported the highest sense of belonging, with an

average score of 7.2 and a median of 8.0. Hispanic or Latina women

scored lower at 6.5 on average, and a lower median at 6.0. Black

women scored slightly lower with an average of 6.3 and median at

7.0. However, there may be a correlation with ethnic representation as

Asian women comprise 7% of technology professionals with the highest

belonging scores in comparison to Black (3%) and Hispanic/Latina (2%)

representation, according to Zippia’s women in technology statistics.

The twelve participant interviews yielded higher scores generally, with

Black women interviewees indicating an average score of 6.7 and mixed-

race women a higher average of 8.6. Hispanic and Latina women came

in at a 4.3 average, lower than among those surveyed. Catalina, a Latina,

commented on her company’s internal data, “I feel like…we are the

forgotten minority, especially in tech, where there’s not a lot of us…

[Latinos are] a small piece of the pie.”

## Interestingly, the only notable factor in both the survey and interview

participants was that sense of belonging scores increased over time as

participants remained at their current company. Andrea, who scored a

9.0, is a people manager and not in an executive-level role. Her 16 years

of tenure at the same company have given her tremendous credibility.

“I’ve been [here] for so long that others tell me I belong when they

talk to me,” she stated. “They’re looking to me to tell them about the

company… Because I’ve been there for so long, I have felt a greater sense

of belonging over time.”

Peers and coworkers are the top positive contributors to their sense of belonging the workplace.

All interview participants and 73.6% of survey respondents stated

## peer-based relationships as the highest-ranking contributor to their

# workplace sense of belonging.

Peer-to-peer relationships foster a sense of empathy, security,

psychological safety, and shared community. Adriana expressed, “When

you get to know someone personally and they share their trials,

tribulations, experiences, that [is] positive for your sense of belonging

regardless of their background. You get to that level of intimacy where

you get to know a person for who they are.”

Another interviewee, Jenny, shared how much she values developing

relationships with her peers outside of work by spending weekends

together and going on trips. “A lot of those moments culminated to me

belonging… we are friends, not just coworkers,” she said.

And another interviewee, Tahirah, discussed her experience when

incidents of police brutality were in the news. “[My peer] was very vocal,

and very supportive. She shared a personal story. And, that made me

feel more comfortable with talking to her about my cultural identity.”

ERGs were also cited by 92% of interviewees as a safe space for women

of color in technology to thrive. Tahirah shared, “In the Black ERG…

we talked about HBCUs we may have attended. She also described her

experience in her company’s Justice ERG. “Anytime there’s an issue

with the police [and] when the abortion laws came down, we had an

outlet where people actually understand you.”

Everyone in the workplace can make an impact on belonging today,

whether you are in a position of power or not.

Organizational culture is the biggest detractor from their sense of belonging in the workplace.

Participants expressed that organizational culture was the largest

detractor to sense of belonging at 42.4% for survey respondents and

92% of interviewees. Pay and compensation along with promotion

opportunities followed closely after.

When diving deeper into organizational culture, the examples

participants gave demonstrated when the environment or the company

was working against them. Stacey shared her sentiments: “There are

a lot of politics. A lot of white men in positions of power that would

discredit you and talk over you.” Katie expressed similar challenges. “I

was constantly interrupted in meetings, or when giving a presentation;

I would be interrupted with no apology or explanation … it felt like

a hostile work environment,” she said. “I don’t think the perpetrators

knew they were being hostile. They didn’t know any better, and I didn’t

feel safe speaking up. I had a lot of anxiety there. It was not [a] culture ﬁt

because I realized what I was up against.”

Ninety-two percent of interviewees identiﬁed lack of representation as

their largest cultural detractor. Despite diversity hiring programs at

technology companies, women of color still aren’t seeing much of a

shift; the lack of representation makes them feel like outsiders. “There

[are] a lot of bros,” Vanessa highlighted. “You don’t see yourself well

represented.” Tahirah echoed the same sentiment, “Until February,

there was one other woman of color on my team… so I never felt I

had an identity with my team.” Adriana summarized her company’s

demographics: “It’s 90% white men.”

How can leaders support women of color to increase sense-of- belonging?

I posed this question to my interviewees and survey participants and,

as it turns out, workplace belonging for women of color can be achieved

if leaders implement the following recommendations — and it doesn’t

take a huge budget to start. Their responses boiled down to three

priorities, which I call PSA: peer-based relationships, sponsors, and

# accountability.

- 1. Invest in programs that foster peer-based relationships.

Companies should invest in programs that foster peer-based

## relationships, whether organically or more structurally. Interview

participants highlighted onboarding buddy programs, hosting cross-

functional events, ERGs, and mentoring programs.

Companies that may not have ERGs due to their size or budget can

## leverage smaller social events or informal networking opportunities.

Stacey shared a simple idea to foster organic relationships. Her

company pays for lunch delivery; everyone orders at the same time and

then everybody eats together. “Not necessarily [to] talk about work, but

[to] be able to sit and eat together organically,” she shared.

Companies can also provide access to externally facing community

organizations to foster belonging. Monique spoke about a non-proﬁt

## organization, Management Leadership for Tomorrow (MLT), which

focuses on upward mobility for talent of color and provided her access

to a network in which she belonged: “I had that core group [where] I

could [say] I need help. And that was the safety cocoon, how to [get

access] into certain things that [I couldn’t] get access to, but because I

had a friend, they [said] just come.” Providing a list of credible external

organizations with a point of contact can be a critical resource for your

# women of color employees.

- 2. Enable sponsorship and mentoring opportunities.

Interviewees and survey participants expressed that sponsorship is vital

## for career advancement and belonging — though only a few mentioned

that they had sponsors.

Enabling and growing solid sponsors and mentors in the workplace

can serve as counterspaces to combat negative experiences of

microaggressions, biases, and favoritism. Counterspaces are conceptual,

ideological, or physical settings that promote the psychological

wellbeing of individuals who experience oppression. Sponsors can also

## draw on their power, network, resources, social capital, and inﬂuence to

advocate for, recommend, and protect their protégés.

Stacey, a COO at an EdTech company, has had many sponsors who

believed in her and made her more visible within the organization.

Monique had executive-level Black women sponsor her and others, and

they would create inclusive bubbles for Black and Latina women within

the organization. And Catalina described how she met her sponsor at an

event, and he eventually hired her. She observed that CEOs and C-suite

level sponsors do not have much time to sponsor, and recommended

## women of color seek support from the middle layer of management.

- 3. Hold leaders accountable for “walking the talk.”

All of the interviewees said that leaders need to be more accountable

## with follow-through, speciﬁcally on budget and resources.

Francesca emphasized the importance in investing in ERGs: “People in

ERGs are doing extra labor for no extra pay…I ﬁnd myself [volunteering]

at night; it’s more of a passion project.” Monique suggested presenting

ERG leaders with compensation for extra work time or to switch their

role. Katie commended her company for its ERG support: “There can be

ERG lead burnout, but they realize it’s not people’s full-time job. And

they have put full-time resources towards making sure all the ERG stuﬀ

gets attended to, which is reassuring. They’re walking the talk.”

In addition to investing in ERGs, research participants encouraged

investments in pipeline-building programs to increase representation

and trust as well as more trainings. Andrea explained, “Some

mandatory training can be very eﬀective [because] it tells me leadership

values this enough that we are going to make all of our employees do it,

and that we all need to have this knowledge.” Monique added, “Make it

mandatory … You gotta sit through it, and maybe one thing will land on

your ears.” She hopes someone will learn to do better and say, “I never

knew that.” If possible, the company should set aside designated time

# for this training.

Leaders also need to demonstrate through their own individual actions

and advocacy that they want women of color to feel they belong.

Monique expressed how incredible her VP was in sending individual

emails to every person who joined his organization. Every gesture

during the onboarding period sets the tone for workplace belonging.

Whether making ﬁrm commitments within their organizational goals

or sponsoring an ERG, leaders need to take decisive action to increase

sense-of-belonging, particularly at the individual manager level. “Give

managers incentives to ensure they’re valuing and representing folks,”

Vanessa recommended. “There’s not [enough] transparency; it ends up

being people they trust the most who are handed opportunities and

## promotions.” Systematizing fairer and equal distribution of projects that

lend visibility could help promotion across the board.

Each company needs to factor in its own ability to deliver before making

commitments, and if your company isn’t excelling in representation,

you can still make a diﬀerence with your workforce. “Start where you

are,” Monique stated candidly. “Don’t go for the gold. If you’ve got two

Black women in your organization, start where you are.”

Lastly, don’t underestimate the impact you can make and how critical it

is for women of color to feel like they belong. As one survey participant

wrote, “Belonging gives sense to my work . . . [I] can contribute more

without fear of making mistakes or being ostracized. It’s not everything,

but it is close to it.”
