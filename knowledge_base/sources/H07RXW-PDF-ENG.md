An RV rolling through a parking lot in Louisville, Kentucky, does not

normally turn heads. But this case was diﬀerent. The geometric beige

patterns that typically adorn RVs had been boldly wrapped over by the

corporate colors and logo of GE Appliances (GEA). And the RV was

driving not into a public lot, but onto the tarmac of GEA’s corporate

## headquarters during a company-wide event.

# HBR / Digital Article / Is Organizational Hierarchy Getting in the Way of Innovation?

In its nearly 120 years of existence — having built everything from

air conditioners, refrigerators, and washing machines to microwaves,

ovens, and trash compactors — GEA had never intentionally targeted

the RV market. Its products were made for stationery use in homes, oﬃces, and commercial spaces.

The RV was a rallying cry from two GEA employees to change that. They

saw a promising growth opportunity for the company. RV ownership in

the U.S. had been steadily growing for over a decade and the employees

felt GEA’s experience building and selling appliance technology — such

as air conditioning, refrigerators and microwaves — could translate into

a competitive position for the company to sell AC units, refrigerators,

and other appliances into the RV market. They had created what

GEA, and its parent company Haier, call a “microenterprise” — a

small, autonomous business unit, comprised of a handful of internal

entrepreneurs, who are able to take action on ideas they are passionate

about that they think could become valuable businesses.

That the employees had the autonomy within their role to take this kind

of action is surprising enough. But perhaps even more astonishing is

the fact that they didn’t need to go through arduous steps standard in

most organization to get permission, like putting together a business

case or detailed ﬁnancial projections for their idea. They just got on with

it, starting small, with the company providing just enough funding to

allow them to start testing their idea.

This approach is just one of many examples of decentralized

organizational models that GEA, and a growing number of other

companies, are adopting — models that run in direct conﬂict with the

## hierarchical tendencies of nearly most companies today.

In this article, we explore why and how these new models are surfacing,

looking speciﬁcally at how emerging technologies have created a

tipping point for the shift to more competitive alternatives to the

traditional ﬁrm. We share the ﬁndings of our research, which looks at

the move towards decentralization and identiﬁes the key characteristics

of one the most successful and promising models. And we provide

practical advice on how companies who want to keep ahead of the curve

can start adapting their organizational designs.

# The Rise of New Organizational Models

Over the past few decades, there has been much debate about the

demise of traditional hierarchical structures. The consensus appears to

be that while bureaucracy still has a place in some circumstances, it is

increasingly becoming less ﬁt for the needs of today’s businesses.

So, what exactly brought us to this point? Technology has, of course,

been a major factor. Robotics, automation, and 3D printing are enabling

companies to develop and launch new products faster and more

## economically, and in ever smaller quantities than before.

## Further, the broader adoption of the internet of things (IoT) to

## produce data, blockchain and APIs to share data, and analytical and AI

capabilities to understand the data, are enabling companies to test both

## product and internal ideas more rapidly, frequently, and with lower cost

# and risk.

Much of the attention around these advances has focused on the

new possibilities they are opening up in the market. But the internal

organizational implications are at least as profound. New and emerging

technologies are making it possible for organizations to evolve into

new ways of organizing and acting by pushing the boundaries of what

technology can enable. But this potential will only be realized if ﬁrms

are prepared to adapt and embrace them enthusiastically.

Historically, organizations have attempted to do this by experimenting

## with a range of alternative approaches: a team of teams (small

independent teams with an overarching umbrella team), an open

## organization (communities of people with a common purpose and no

top-down hierarchy) and Holocracy, to name a few. But most have

proved inadequate, with no clear front runner emerging.

Our research shows, however, that the deﬁning design elements

of a winning new organizational model are coming into focus:

RenDanHeYi, or a version of it, which was introduced by Haier.

This organizational philosophy and system is composed of several

innovative characteristics, including the breaking of large hierarchical

units into “microenterprises” (MEs), turning support functions into

proﬁt centers that must sell into the enterprise rather than cost centers,

and relating to employees as intrapreneurs.

Companies who embrace four elements of this approach in particular

are signiﬁcantly outperforming their peers. GEA, for example, has

doubled its business organically in the last four years, according to

GAE CEO Kevin Nolan. We believe we are on the brink of a seismic

shift, where companies are waking up to the fact this new model oﬀers

them the opportunity not just to adapt, but to substantially replace

## their hierarchical, bureaucratic perspective with something radically

# diﬀerent.

## The Four Elements of the New Organizational Model

Over the past eight years, we have been conducting a research study

## into the barriers within organizations to internal innovation and the

## emergence of new organizational models that address these barriers.

Over the course of the study, we spoke to over 150 employee innovators,

discussed the topic with around 100 heads of strategy from mid-to-

large enterprises. These enterprises include ﬁnancial services, media,

technology, pharmaceuticals, real estate, professional services, NGOs,

education, and infrastructure ﬁrms. Most are large ($1 billion to

$60 billion revenue), and about 20% are mid-sized ($100 million to

$900 million revenue). We interviewed around 20 of today’s leading

## authorities on this topic (Rita McGrath, Michael Tushman, and Martin

Lindstrom to name just a few). And we conducted a quantitative survey

of around 500 mid-level managers and interviewed experts on the key

deﬁning characteristics of Haier’s RenDanHeYi model.

Two clear, overarching messages emerged from an in-depth analysis of

# this wealth of data and interviews.

First, that ﬁrms are gradually becoming less centralized — although

their evolution towards decentralization has been a slow and nonlinear

# process.

Second, there is clear and statistically signiﬁcant evidence to show

that companies who use elements of a looser RenDanHeYi model

outperform their peers in terms of entrepreneurial activity, the ability

to attract and retain top talent, and ultimately ﬁnancial performance.

This research also brings into focus four clear characteristics of these

organizations, most of which replace their traditional hierarchy. These

characteristics are:

- 1. Treat employees like intrapreneurs

- 2. Work in smaller independent units (MEs) rather than business units

- 3. “Manage” MEs with decentralized marketplace structures rather than

centralized authority

- 4. Let MEs choose which support services (e.g. R&D, ﬁnance, IT) to work

# with

We describe these four characteristics below, the advantages they bring,

and some examples of how forward-thinking organizations are applying

# them.

# Treat employees like intrapreneurs.

Our research showed that ﬁrms whose employees feel they are treated

more like intrapreneurs enjoyed a level of entrepreneurial intensity

## — the frequency and degree of innovation and risk that employees

undertake — that was nearly 3x higher than their peers. They were

also more likely to outperform their competition (1.4x) and were better

and recruiting and retaining top talent (1.6x). Treating employees like

intrapreneurs can involve rewarding proactive behavior, encouraging

them to get close to customers, and celebrating ideas and even failed

# attempts at innovation.

You only have to look at examples from corporate history to see how

much potential has been missed by companies who have failed to

give their employees the freedom to explore new opportunities. As an

employee at HP, Steve Wozniak, for example, proposed the design that

would become the ﬁrst Apple computer and was turned down all ﬁve

times. How much more valuable would HP be today if it had given

# Wozniak a greenlight?

Embedding an intrapreneurial culture doesn’t always have to mean

the constant pursuit of new product ideas. MacMillan Learning, for

example, recently held an innovation competition, where they invited

employees to enter innovative projects they had been working on over

the past year. More than 200 employees engaged with the competition,

entering 46 projects — which helped to reinforce the message that

staﬀ were in fact already acting as internal intrapreneurs and, because

most of the ideas were internal process and organizational innovations,

entrepreneurial action need not always be market-facing.

## Work in smaller independent units rather than larger traditional business units.

## In RenDanHeYi, employees group together in microenterprises, which

can range in size from ﬁve to 20 employees, to innovate around speciﬁc

opportunities or challenges. GEA, for example, launched 14 MEs while

its parent, Haier, is organized into thousands.

Our quantitative research showed that ﬁrms that adopt this type of

organizational model were able to unleash greater entrepreneurial

behavior (1.5x), achieve better ﬁnancial performance relative to peers

(1.3x), and were better at recruiting and retaining top talent (1.2x). When

a group of Haier employees saw an opportunity to provide a one stop

cooking solution for consumers, for example, they banded together

to form their own microenterprise. The resulting Internet of Food

microenterprise now covers everything from designing and installing

“smart” cookers and fridges that recognize their owners, to providing

precisely timed recipes and allowing users to interact with each other

# via smart screens on their cooker hoods.

## “Manage” MEs with decentralized marketplaces instead of centralized authority.

Our ﬁndings conﬁrm that empowering units and teams to act with

autonomy and make their own decisions is a powerful driver of

entrepreneurial intensity. Firms that do this enjoy over 2x higher

entrepreneurial intensity rates. They are also 1.5x better at recruiting

and retaining top talent and enjoy a more marginal, but signiﬁcant

## advantage in ﬁnancial performance (1.3x).

Dutch healthcare provider Buurtzorg, for example, has been able to

provide better patient care by oﬀering its nurses a high degree of

autonomy. Small, self-managed teams of nurses are able to work with

patients in the way they think best, based on professional standards, with a back-oﬃce IT and support system around them to free them

from paperwork and bureaucracy. A recent KPMG study showed that by

adopting this model of care, Buurtzorg has been able to halve the hours

of care it delivers, while at the same time achieving high patient and

# nurse satisfaction scores.

Give MEs an option to choose which support services to use.

This is perhaps the most interesting and radical characteristic of the

model. In hierarchical models, it is assumed that business units use

the shared services provided by the company in order to create cost

advantages — think IT, ﬁnance, R&D, etc. GEA CEO Nolan refers to these

support functions as internal monopolies which need to be broken up because they “can easily within a company become like a ‘post oﬃce,’

where they feel there is no competition. There’s a [sense of] entitlement:

[because they are] going to deliver the mail for everyone, [the business

units] have no choice.” Instead, he says, they should “have to ﬁght for

their business every day. They have to improve, they have to be the

# best.”

What would this new approach to support services look like in practice?

Let’s say a particular microenterprise is not happy with the support

it is getting from their IT department. Because all departments are

microenterprises, there are multiple IT microenterprises to choose

from. They compete with autonomy for internal clients. The initial

microenterprise can even decide to contract with an external, third-

party IT service provider, if they so choose. And if a supporting ME is

not competitive enough to win internal clients, its budget is eﬀectively

reduced or cut not because a centralized authority decided to cut it, but

because they couldn’t succeed internally.

# HBR / Digital Article / Is Organizational Hierarchy Getting in the Way of Innovation?

Our quantitative research shows fewer companies are adopting this

practice compared to the other characteristics, perhaps because this

implies a broad organizational redesign. But those who do enjoyed

## far higher levels of entrepreneurial intensity (2.1x) recruitment and

## retention (1.6x) and more marginal but signiﬁcant advantage in

# ﬁnancial performance (1.3x).

# How to Implement the Four Elements

It’s simplistic to think that the right approach to adopting a new

organizational model is the same for each company or each area of your

company. In some situations, hierarchical models will maintain the

advantages they have enjoyed for hundreds of years. And even where

a less hierarchical model is likely preferable, the degree to which you

implement an alternative model will vary. To design the right approach

for your speciﬁc case, consider taking three steps:

- 1. Decide where to consider implementing a new organizational

# approach

- 2. Decide how deeply to implement and initiate ﬁrst actions

Decide where to consider implementing a new organizational approach.

Sometimes, a more entrepreneurial, decentralized approach is not the

best option. When you are building complex technology components

on which rockets, airplanes, and spacecraft depend — components you

designed, built, and tested to achieve extremely low failure rates —

you don’t want your engineers improvising. You instead want them

following detailed, prescriptive checklists.

So, the ﬁrst step to implementing our ﬁndings is to decide where you

should consider implementing them. The most promising candidates

will be those a) most impacted by emerging technologies and b) those

## which beneﬁt from higher levels of entrepreneurial behavior. You can

prioritize the top candidates by asking two questions:

- 1. Are advances in technology likely to open up new, more competitive

approaches to organizing eﬀorts?

- 2. Does entrepreneurialism (e.g., testing new approaches, working with

# agility) lead to success?

You can think of these as a two-by-two matrix:

Depending on where an area of the business sits on the matrix, you may

want to embrace a diﬀerent approach.

For those on the bottom left, maintaining a traditional, centralized,

hierarchical model probably makes the most sense. Think of the

engineers manufacturing missiles or airplane propulsion systems.

On the bottom right, you may want to encourage more

## entrepreneurialism, but not necessarily through tech-enabled changes.

Rather, focus on traditional organizational tools like reporting

## structures, culture, storytelling, and hiring.

On the top left, where you want the advantages technologies oﬀer but

do not need or want more entrepreneurialism, you may implement a

digital products approach. For example, you might build an algorithm

to dictate which candidate a recruiter should give a larger signing bonus

# to.

On the top right, you’ll ﬁnd areas that are the most ripe for opportunity

by using a new organizational model.

As you can see from this matrix, two reasons we are seeing more

experimentation of new organizational approaches are that a) new

technologies are advancing the matrix upward and b) the need

for entrepreneurial behavior is increasing as the pace of change is

accelerating across many sectors, pushing the matrix to the right.

Decide how deeply to implement and initiate ﬁrst actions.

Once you decide where to implement a new approach, consider

implementing the four elements in a sequence of four stages:

# HBR / Digital Article / Is Organizational Hierarchy Getting in the Way of Innovation?

- 1. Treat employees like intrapreneurs

- 2. Break down large units into smaller teams (MEs)

- 3. Allow management of these smaller teams to be governed by

internal supply and demand rather than centralized authority(e.g.,

rather than centralizing all budgeting decisions, let microenterprises

reinvest a portion of the proﬁts they generate)

- 4. Give these smaller teams freedom in deciding what central functions

# (e.g., HR, IT, R&D) to work with

This ﬁrst step — treating employees like intrapreneurs — can be

implemented with a change management or cultural transformation

eﬀort. Such eﬀorts are not easy but there is already much known

about how to do this. Using proven tactics such as rituals, leadership mirroring, storytelling, role titles, awards, oﬃce design, language, and

symbols, a focused, coordinated eﬀort can shift culture remarkably

# quickly.

Step two — breaking down units into microenterprises — can get

complicated, as you must rethink reporting structures to pull smaller

units out of larger units. But there is a good chance that your IT

department has already implemented some form of smaller team-based

approach having adopted “lean” or “scrum” approaches — and as

those IT teams have interacted the business side, they too have started

shifting toward teams at least as regards speciﬁc projects. Product and

marketing teams may already be reorienting toward “growth teams”

popularized by tech companies like AirBNB, Meta, and Uber. What is

left to do is evolve such project teams into permanent team structures.

Step three — allowing management of small teams to be governed

by a marketplace — adds an additional layer of complexity as you

must untangle and redesign budgeting processes and performance

## management systems, as well as shift culture and leadership behaviors.

This may seem a daunting task, but the ﬁrst step is relatively

straightforward: ensure that ﬁnancial accounting practices allow

the enterprise to measure the individual ﬁnancial performance of

product and customer segment teams. Some industries, such as

consumer-packaged goods, are already structured to do so. They

typically break down proﬁt and loss by customer segment (a customer

that buys a particular brand, through a speciﬁc channel, and in

a deﬁned geography). But other sectors, like banking, may require

some untangling. Because they tend to track ﬁnancial performance by

product (e.g., mortgages or wealth management) rather than customer (aﬄuent, retired, etc.), value-destroying conﬂicts can emerge. A second

step here is to start decentralize reinvestment so that teams get to keep

more of the value they generate.

Finally, step four — giving smaller teams freedom in deciding what

central functions to work with — requires cutting deeper into your

organizational norms to redesign functional departments that have long

operated essentially as utilities and cost-centers into entrepreneurial

proﬁt-centers. This involves applying steps 1, 2, and 3 above to your

# support functions.

To do this, ﬁrst involve them in the wider cultural change eﬀort so

they too start seeing themselves as intrapreneurs. Second, restructure

support functions into a team structures, which may feel less alien than

one might expect because many of them — HR, Finance, R&D, and,

to a lesser extent perhaps, legal — are likely already organized into

teams that support speciﬁc business teams. For example, the general

counsel of one major media company structured her organization into

dedicated sub-teams that support radio, broadcast TV, streaming, etc.

Third, adjust ﬁnancial reporting to start creating separate proﬁt and

loss statements for each team and, what seems the biggest leap for

companies considering this step, to allow business teams to determine

to which support teams they want to work with. As a result, instead

of using political levers to ask for better service (such as asking the

head of legal to replace the lawyer supporting their team), the head of

a microenterprise is given the direct authority to choose to spend their

budget on a diﬀerent support team (or in this case, a diﬀerent legal

# team).

. . .

The technologies that are coming to the fore are not only transforming

the way ﬁrms go to market, but are also forcing companies to

rethink the very way they operate. Bureaucracy — with its deﬁning

## characteristics of hierarchy, clear lines of authority and division of

labor into specialties — has been the dominant method of coordinating

human eﬀort over the past several centuries. But as IoT, AI and data

analytics, blockchain, and a collection of related technologies take hold, new, more open models are emerging in some areas as more eﬃcient

# alternatives.

Our research shows many of the organizations adopting elements of

such open structures are experiencing higher levels of entrepreneurial

behavior, are proving better at attracting and retaining top talent,

and delivering superior ﬁnancial performance as a result. We also

believe that there is a danger that those who don’t adapt will get left

behind. Strategy thought leader Martin Reeves points out, for example,

## that in our new data-driven, tech-enabled world, competitive advantage

decays about 10 times faster than previously, making it imperative

for companies to keep up with the game. And futures specialist Mark

Esposito says ﬁrms that have not yet investigated new technologies

need to be aware they are becoming ubiquitous, and if they don’t get on

board, they will get left behind.

Evolving into a new organizational model is not easy. It involves

unlearning and deconstructing management norms, processes,

structures. But our research suggests a company need not embark on

an across-the-board transformation to start seeing the beneﬁts. The real

opportunity is to embrace the organizational power of new technologies

and implement the more decentralized models they make possible

## selectively in areas of the organization where new technology and/or

## non-hierarchical models oﬀer a more competitive approach.
