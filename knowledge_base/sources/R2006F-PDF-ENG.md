Apple is well-known for its innovations in hardware, software, and

services. Thanks to them, it grew from some 8,000 employees and

$7 billion in revenue in 1997, the year Steve Jobs returned, to 137,000

employees and $260 billion in revenue in 2019. Much less well-known

are the organizational design and the associated leadership model that

have played a crucial role in the company’s innovation success.

When Jobs arrived back at Apple, it had a conventional structure for a

company of its size and scope. It was divided into business units, each

with its own P&L responsibilities. General managers ran the Macintosh

## products group, the information appliances division, and the server

products division, among others. As is often the case with decentralized

business units, managers were inclined to ﬁght with one another, over

transfer prices in particular. Believing that conventional management

had stiﬂed innovation, Jobs, in his ﬁrst year returning as CEO, laid oﬀ

the general managers of all the business units (in a single day), put the

entire company under one P&L, and combined the disparate functional

## departments of the business units into one functional organization.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Apple Is Organized for Innovation

The adoption of a functional structure may have been unsurprising

for a company of Apple’s size at the time. What is surprising—in

fact, remarkable—is that Apple retains it today, even though the

company is nearly 40 times as large in terms of revenue and far more

complex than it was in 1998. Senior vice presidents are in charge of

functions, not products. As was the case with Jobs before him, CEO

Tim Cook occupies the only position on the organizational chart where

## the design, engineering, operations, marketing, and retail of any of

Apple’s main products meet. In eﬀect, besides the CEO, the company

operates with no conventional general managers: people who control an

entire process from product development through sales and are judged

according to a P&L statement.

Business history and organizational theory make the case that as

entrepreneurial ﬁrms grow large and complex, they must shift from

a functional to a multidivisional structure to align accountability

and control and prevent the congestion that occurs when countless

decisions ﬂow up the org chart to the very top. Giving business unit

leaders full control over key functions allows them to do what is best

to meet the needs of their individual units’ customers and maximize

their results, and it enables the executives overseeing them to assess

## their performance. As the Harvard Business School historian Alfred

Chandler documented, U.S. companies such as DuPont and General

Motors moved from a functional to a multidivisional structure in

the early 20th century. By the latter half of the century the vast

majority of large corporations had followed suit. Apple proves that

this conventional approach is not necessary and that the functional

structure may beneﬁt companies facing tremendous technological

# change and industry upheaval.

Apple’s commitment to a functional organization does not mean

that its structure has remained static. As the importance of artiﬁcial

intelligence and other new areas has increased, that structure has

changed. Here we discuss the innovation beneﬁts and leadership

challenges of Apple’s distinctive and ever-evolving organizational

model, which may be useful for individuals and companies wanting to

better understand how to succeed in rapidly changing environments.

# Why a Functional Organization?

Apple’s main purpose is to create products that enrich people’s daily

lives. That involves not only developing entirely new product categories

such as the iPhone and the Apple Watch but also continually innovating

within those categories. Perhaps no product feature better reﬂects

Apple’s commitment to continuous innovation than the iPhone camera.

When the iPhone was introduced, in 2007, Steve Jobs devoted only

six seconds to its camera in the annual keynote event for unveiling

new products. Since then iPhone camera technology has contributed to

## the photography industry with a stream of innovations: High dynamic

range imaging (2010), panorama photos (2012), True Tone ﬂash (2013),

## optical image stabilization (2015), the dual-lens camera (2016), portrait

mode (2016), portrait lighting (2017), and night mode (2019) are but a

# few of the improvements.

Apple leaders need deep expertise, immersion in details, and collaborative debate.

To create such innovations, Apple relies on a structure that centers

on functional expertise. Its fundamental belief is that those with the

most expertise and experience in a domain should have decision rights

for that domain. This is based on two views: First, Apple competes in

markets where the rates of technological change and disruption are

high, so it must rely on the judgment and intuition of people with deep

knowledge of the technologies responsible for disruption. Long before it

can get market feedback and solid market forecasts, the company must

make bets about which technologies and designs are likely to succeed in

smartphones, computers, and so on. Relying on technical experts rather

than general managers increases the odds that those bets will pay oﬀ.

Second, Apple’s commitment to oﬀer the best possible products would

be undercut if short-term proﬁt and cost targets were the overriding

criteria for judging investments and leaders. Signiﬁcantly, the bonuses

of senior R&D executives are based on companywide performance

## numbers rather than the costs of or revenue from particular products.

Thus product decisions are somewhat insulated from short-term

ﬁnancial pressures. The ﬁnance team is not involved in the product

road map meetings of engineering teams, and engineering teams are

not involved in pricing decisions.

We don’t mean to suggest that Apple doesn’t consider costs and revenue

goals when deciding which technologies and features the company

will pursue. It does, but in ways that diﬀer from those employed by

conventionally organized companies. Instead of using overall cost and

price targets as ﬁxed parameters within which to make design and

engineering choices, R&D leaders are expected to weigh the beneﬁts to

## users of those choices against cost considerations.

In a functional organization, individual and team reputations act as a

control mechanism in placing bets. A case in point is the decision to

introduce the dual-lens camera with portrait mode in the iPhone 7 Plus

in 2016. It was a big wager that the camera’s impact on users would be suﬃciently great to justify its signiﬁcant cost.

One executive told us that Paul Hubel, a senior leader who played a

central role in the portrait mode eﬀort, was “out over his skis,” meaning

that he and his team were taking a big risk: If users were unwilling to

pay a premium for a phone with a more costly and better camera, the

team would most likely have less credibility the next time it proposed an

expensive upgrade or feature. The camera turned out to be a deﬁning

feature for the iPhone 7 Plus, and its success further enhanced the

# reputations of Hubel and his team.

It’s easier to get the balance right between an attention to costs and the

value added to the user experience when the leaders making decisions

are those with deep expertise in their areas rather than general

managers being held accountable primarily for meeting numerical

## targets. Whereas the fundamental principle of a conventional business

unit structure is to align accountability and control, the fundamental

principle of a functional organization is to align expertise and decision

# rights.

Thus the link between how Apple is organized and the type of

innovations it produces is clear. As Chandler famously argued,

“structure follows strategy”—even though Apple doesn’t use the

structure that he anticipated large multinationals would adopt.

Now let’s turn to the leadership model underlying Apple’s structure.

# Three Leadership Characteristics

Ever since Steve Jobs implemented the functional organization, Apple’s

managers at every level, from senior vice president on down, have

been expected to possess three key leadership characteristics: deep

expertise that allows them to meaningfully engage in all the work

being done within their individual functions; immersion in the details

of those functions; and a willingness to collaboratively debate other

functions during collective decision-making. When managers have

these attributes, decisions are made in a coordinated fashion by the

people most qualiﬁed to make them.

Deep expertise. Apple is not a company where general managers

oversee managers; rather, it is a company where experts lead experts.

The assumption is that it’s easier to train an expert to manage well

than to train a manager to be an expert. At Apple, hardware experts

## manage hardware, software experts software, and so on. (Deviations

from this principle are rare.) This approach cascades down all levels of

## the organization through areas of ever-increasing specialization. Apple’s

leaders believe that world-class talent wants to work for and with other

world-class talent in a specialty. It’s like joining a sports team where you

get to learn from and play with the best.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Apple Is Organized for Innovation

Early on, Steve Jobs came to embrace the idea that managers at

Apple should be experts in their area of management. In a 1984

interview he said, “We went through that stage in Apple where

we went out and thought, Oh, we’re gonna be a big company, let’s

hire professional management. We went out and hired a bunch of

professional management. It didn’t work at all….They knew how to

manage, but they didn’t know how to do anything. If you’re a great

person, why do you want to work for somebody you can’t learn anything

from? And you know what’s interesting? You know who the best

managers are? They are the great individual contributors who never,

ever want to be a manager but decide they have to be…because no one

else is going to…do as good a job.”

One current example is Roger Rosner, who heads Apple’s software

application business, which includes work-productivity apps such

## as Pages (word processing), Numbers (spreadsheets), and Keynote

## (presentations) along with GarageBand (music composition), iMovie

(movie editing), and News (an app providing news content). Rosner,

who studied electrical engineering at Carnegie Mellon, joined Apple in

2001 as a senior engineering manager and rose to become the director

## of iWork applications, the vice president of productivity apps, and

since 2013 the VP of applications. With his deep expertise gained from

## previous experience as the director of engineering at several smaller

software companies, Rosner exempliﬁes an expert leading experts.

In a functional organization, experts leading experts means that

specialists create a deep bench in a given area, where they can learn

from one another. For example, Apple’s more than 600 experts on

camera hardware technology work in a group led by Graham Townsend,

a camera expert. Because iPhones, iPads, laptops, and desktop

computers all include cameras, these experts would be scattered across

product lines if Apple were organized in business units. That would

dilute their collective expertise, reducing their power to solve problems

# and generate and reﬁne innovations.

Immersion in the details. One principle that permeates Apple is

“Leaders should know the details of their organization three levels

down,” because that is essential for speedy and eﬀective cross-

functional decision-making at the highest levels. If managers attend

## a decision-making meeting without the details at their disposal, the

decision must either be made without the details or postponed.

Managers tell war stories about making presentations to senior leaders

who drill down into cells on a spreadsheet, lines of code, or a test result

# on a product.

Of course, the leaders of many companies insist that they and their

teams are steeped in the details. But few organizations match Apple.

Consider how its senior leaders pay extreme attention to the exact

shape of products’ rounded corners. The standard method for rounding

corners is to use an arc of a circle to connect the perpendicular sides

of a rectangular object, which produces a somewhat abrupt transition

from straight to curve. In contrast, Apple’s leaders insist on continuous

curves, resulting in a shape known in the design community as a

“squircle”: The slope starts sooner but is less abrupt. An advantage of

hardware products without abrupt changes in curvature is that they

produce softer highlights (that is, little to no jump in light reﬂection

along the corner). The diﬀerence is subtle, and executing on it isn’t

## simply a matter of a more complicated mathematical formula. It

demands that Apple’s operations leaders commit to extremely precise

manufacturing tolerances to produce millions of iPhones and other

products with squircles. This deep immersion in detail isn’t just a

concern that is pushed down to lower-level people; it is central at the

# leadership level.

Having leaders who are experts in their areas and can go deep into

the details has profound implications for how Apple is run. Leaders

can push, probe, and “smell” an issue. They know which details

are important and where to focus their attention. Many people at

Apple see it as liberating, even exhilarating, to work for experts, who

## provide better guidance and mentoring than a general manager would.

Together, all can strive to do the best work of their lives in their chosen

# area.

Willingness to collaboratively debate. Apple has hundreds of specialist

teams across the company, dozens of which may be needed for even

one key component of a new product oﬀering. For example, the dual-

lens camera with portrait mode required the collaboration of no fewer

## than 40 specialist teams: silicon design, camera software, reliability

engineering, motion sensor hardware, video engineering, core motion,

and camera sensor design, to name just a few. How on earth does Apple

develop and ship products that require such coordination? The answer

is collaborative debate. Because no function is responsible for a product

or a service on its own, cross-functional collaboration is crucial.

When debates reach an impasse, as some inevitably do, higher-level

managers weigh in as tiebreakers, including at times the CEO and the senior VPs. To do this at speed with suﬃcient attention to detail

is challenging for even the best of leaders, making it all the more

important that the company ﬁll many senior positions from within the

ranks of its VPs, who have experience in Apple’s way of operating.

However, given Apple’s size and scope, even the executive team can

resolve only a limited number of stalemates. The many horizontal

dependencies mean that ineﬀective peer relationships at the VP and

director levels have the potential to undermine not only particular

projects but the entire company. Consequently, for people to attain and

remain in a leadership position within a function, they must be highly

# eﬀective collaborators.

That doesn’t mean people can’t express their points of view. Leaders are

expected to hold strong, well-grounded views and advocate forcefully

for them, yet also be willing to change their minds when presented

with evidence that others’ views are better. Doing so is not always

easy, of course. A leader’s ability to be both partisan and open-minded

is facilitated by two things: deep understanding of and devotion to

## the company’s values and common purpose, and a commitment to

separating how right from how hard a particular path is so that the diﬃculty of executing a decision doesn’t prevent its being selected.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Apple Is Organized for Innovation

The development of the iPhone’s portrait mode illustrates a fanatical

attention to detail at the leadership level, intense collaborative debate

among teams, and the power of a shared purpose to shape and

ultimately resolve debates. In 2009 Hubel had the idea of developing

an iPhone feature that would allow people to take portrait photos

with bokeh—a Japanese term that refers to the pleasing blurring of a

background—which photography experts generally consider to be of the

## highest quality. At that time only expensive single-lens reﬂex cameras

could take such photos, but Hubel thought that with a dual-lens design

and advanced computational-photography techniques, Apple could add

the capability in the iPhone. His idea aligned well with the camera

team’s stated purpose: “More people taking better images more of the

time.”

As the team worked to turn this idea into reality, several challenges

emerged. The ﬁrst attempts produced some amazing portrait pictures

but also a number of “failure cases” in which the algorithm was unable

to distinguish between the central object in sharp relief (a face, for

instance) and the background being blurred. For example, if a person’s

face was to be photographed from behind chicken wire, it was not

possible to construct an algorithm that would capture the chicken wire

to the side of the face with the same sharpness as the chicken wire in

front of it. The wire to the side would be as blurred as the background.

One might say, “Who cares about the chicken wire case? That’s

exceedingly rare.” But for the team, sidestepping rare or extreme

situations—what engineers call corner cases—would violate Apple’s

strict engineering standard of zero “artifacts,” meaning “any undesired

or unintended alteration in data introduced in a digital process by an

involved technique and/or technology.” Corner cases sparked “many

tough discussions” between the camera team and other teams involved,

recalls Myra Haggerty, the VP of sensor software and UX prototyping,

who oversaw the ﬁrmware and algorithm teams. Sebastien Marineau-

Mes, the VP to whom the camera software team ultimately reported,

decided to defer the release of the feature until the following year to give

the team time to better address failure cases—“a hard pill to swallow,”

# Hubel admits.

To get some agreement on quality standards, the engineering teams

invited senior design and marketing leaders to meet, ﬁguring that

they would oﬀer a new perspective. The design leaders brought an

additional artistic sensibility to the debate, asking, “What makes a

beautiful portrait?” To help reassess the zero-artifacts standard, they

collected images from great portrait photographers. They noted, among

other things, that these photos often had blurring at the edges of a face

but sharpness on the eyes. So they charged the algorithm teams with

achieving the same eﬀect. When the teams succeeded, they knew they

had an acceptable standard.

Another issue that emerged was the ability to preview a portrait photo

with a blurred background. The camera team had designed the feature

so that users could see its eﬀect on their photos only after they had been

taken, but the human interface (HI) design team pushed back, insisting

that users should be able to see a “live preview” and get some guidance

about how to make adjustments before taking the photo. Johnnie

Manzari, a member of the HI team, gave the camera team a demo.

“When we saw the demo, we realized that this is what we needed to do,”

Townsend told us. The members of his camera hardware team weren’t sure they could do it, but diﬃculty was not an acceptable excuse for

failing to deliver what would clearly be a superior user experience. After

## months of engineering eﬀort, a key stakeholder, the video engineering

team (responsible for the low-level software that controls sensor and

camera operations) found a way, and the collaboration paid oﬀ. Portrait

mode was central to Apple’s marketing of the iPhone 7 Plus. It proved

a major reason for users’ choosing to buy and delighting in the use of

# the phone.

As this example shows, Apple’s collaborative debate involves people

from various functions who disagree, push back, promote or reject

ideas, and build on one another’s ideas to come up with the best

solutions. It requires open-mindedness from senior leaders. It also

requires those leaders to inspire, prod, or inﬂuence colleagues in other

areas to contribute toward achieving their goals.

While Townsend is accountable for how great the camera is, he needed

dozens of other teams—each of which had a long list of its own

commitments—to contribute their time and eﬀort to the portrait mode

project. At Apple that’s known as accountability without control: You’re

accountable for making the project succeed even though you don’t

control all the other teams. This process can be messy yet produce

great results. “Good mess” happens when various teams work with a

shared purpose, as in the case of the portrait mode project. “Bad mess”

occurs when teams push their own agendas ahead of common goals.

Those who become associated with bad mess and don’t or can’t change

their behavior are removed from leadership positions, if not from Apple

# altogether.

# Leadership at Scale

Apple’s way of organizing has led to tremendous innovation and success

over the past two decades. Yet it has not been without challenges,

especially with revenues and head count having exploded since 2008.

As the company has grown, entering new markets and moving into

new technologies, its functional structure and leadership model have

had to evolve. Deciding how to organize areas of expertise to best

enable collaboration and rapid decision-making has been an important

responsibility of the CEO. The adjustments Tim Cook has implemented

in recent years include dividing the hardware function into hardware

engineering and hardware technologies; adding artiﬁcial intelligence

and machine learning as a functional area; and moving human interface

out of software to merge it with industrial design, creating an integrated

# design function.

Another challenge posed by organizational growth is the pressure it

## imposes on the several hundred VPs and directors below the executive

team. If Apple were to cap the size or scope of a senior leader’s

organization to limit the number and breadth of details that the leader

is expected to own, the company would need to hugely expand the

number of senior leaders, making the kind of collaboration that has

worked so well impossible to preserve.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Apple Is Organized for Innovation

Cognizant of this problem, Apple has been quite disciplined about

limiting the number of senior positions to minimize how many leaders

must be involved in any cross-functional activity. In 2006, the year

before the iPhone’s launch, the company had some 17,000 employees;

by 2019 that number had grown more than eightfold, to 137,000.

Meanwhile, the number of VPs approximately doubled, from 50 to 96.

The inevitable result is that senior leaders head larger and more diverse

teams of experts, meaning more details to oversee and new areas of

## responsibility that fall outside their core expertise.

In response, many Apple managers over the past ﬁve years or so have

been evolving the leadership approach described above: experts leading

experts, immersion in the details, and collaborative debate. We have

codiﬁed these adaptions in what we call the discretionary leadership

model, which we have incorporated into a new educational program

for Apple’s VPs and directors. Its purpose is to address the challenge of

getting this leadership approach to drive innovation in all areas of the

## company, not just product development, at an ever-greater scale.

When Apple was smaller, it may have been reasonable to expect leaders

to be experts on and immersed in the details of pretty much everything

going on in their organizations. However, they now need to exercise

greater discretion regarding where and how they spend their time and

eﬀorts. They must decide which activities demand their full attention to

detail because those activities create the most value for Apple. Some of

those will fall within their existing core expertise (what they still need

to own), and some will require them to learn new areas of expertise.

Activities that require less attention from the leader can be pushed

down to others (and the leaders will either teach others or delegate in

cases where they aren’t experts).

Rosner, the VP of applications, provides a good example. Like many

other Apple managers, he has had to contend with three challenges

arising from Apple’s tremendous growth. First, the size of his function

has exploded over the past decade in terms of both head count (from

150 to about 1,000) and the number of projects underway at any given

time. Clearly, he cannot dive into all the details of all those projects.

Second, the scope of his portfolio has widened: Over the past 10 years

he has assumed responsibility for new applications, including News,

Clips (video editing), Books, and Final Cut Pro (advanced video editing).

Although apps are his core area of expertise, some aspects of these—

among them editorial content for News, how book publishing works,

and video editing—involve matters in which Rosner is not an expert.

Finally, as Apple’s product portfolio and number of projects have

expanded, even more coordination with other functions is required,

increasing the complexity of collaborating across the many units.

For instance, whereas Rosner is responsible for the engineering side

of News, other managers oversee the operating system on which it

## depends, the content, and the business relationships with content

## creators (such as the New York Times) and advertisers.

To cope, Rosner has adapted his role. As an expert who leads other

experts, he had been immersed in details—especially those concerning

## the top-level aspects of software applications and their architecture that

aﬀect how users engage with the software. He also collaborated with

managers across the company in projects that involved those areas.

But with the expansion of his responsibilities, he has moved some

things from his owning box—including traditional productivity apps

such as Keynote and Pages—into his teaching box. Now he guides and

gives feedback to other team members so that they can develop software

applications according to Apple’s norms. Being a teacher doesn’t mean

that Rosner gives instruction at a whiteboard; rather, he oﬀers strong,

often passionate critiques of his team’s work. (Clearly, general managers without his core expertise would ﬁnd it diﬃcult to teach what they don’t

know.)

The second challenge for Rosner involved the addition of activities

beyond his original expertise. Six years ago he was given responsibility

for the engineering and design of News. Consequently, he had to

learn about publishing news content via an app—to understand news

publications, digital advertising, machine learning to personalize news

steep learning curve to acquire new skills. Given how demanding this is,

only critical new activities should fall into this category. Over six years

of intense learning, Rosner has mastered some of these areas, which are

# now in his owning box.

As long as a particular activity remains in the learning box, leaders

must adopt a beginner’s mindset, questioning subordinates in a way

that suggests they don’t already know the answer (because they don’t).

This diﬀers starkly from the way leaders question subordinates about

activities in the owning and teaching boxes.

Finally, Rosner has delegated some areas—including iMovie and

GarageBand, in which he is not an expert—to people with the requisite

capabilities. For activities in the delegating box, he assembles teams,

agrees on objectives, monitors and reviews progress, and holds the

## teams accountable: the stuﬀ of general management.

Whereas Apple’s VPs spend most of their time in the owning and

learning boxes, general managers at other companies tend to spend

most of their time in the delegating box. Rosner estimates that

he spends about 40% of his time on activities he owns (including

collaboration with others in a given area), about 30% on learning, about

15% on teaching, and about 15% on delegating. These numbers vary by

manager, of course, depending on their business and the needs at a

given time.

The discretionary leadership model preserves the fundamental

principle of an eﬀective functional organization at scale—aligning

expertise and decision rights. Apple can eﬀectively move into new areas

when leaders like Rosner take on new responsibilities outside their

original expertise, and teams can grow in size when leaders teach others

their craft and delegate work. We believe that Apple will continue to

innovate and prosper by being organized this way.

Apple’s functional organization is rare, if not unique, among very large

companies. It ﬂies in the face of prevailing management theory that

companies should be reorganized into divisions and business units as

they become large. But something vital gets lost in a shift to business

## units: the alignment of decision rights with expertise.

Why do companies so often cling to having general managers in

charge of business units? One reason, we believe, is that making the change is diﬃcult. It entails overcoming inertia, reallocating power

among managers, changing an individual-oriented incentive system,

and learning new ways of collaborating. That is daunting when a

company already faces huge external challenges. An intermediate step

may be to cultivate the experts-leading-experts model even within

a business unit structure. For example, when ﬁlling the next senior

management role, pick someone with deep expertise in that area as

opposed to someone who might make the best general manager. But

a full-ﬂedged transformation requires that leaders also transition to a

functional organization. Apple’s track record proves that the rewards

may justify the risks. Its approach can produce extraordinary results.
