Soren, an executive in charge of the archives at a global arts institution,

was told that he needed to deliver immediate cost savings and

that layoﬀs were likely. Rather than thinking narrowly and simply

demanding budget cuts from his direct reports, Soren convened a

meeting with his department to discuss the broader question of its

# purpose and sustainability.

The team’s conversation led to the recognition that there were

overlooked assets in the archive that might be used for a new

program. This idea eventually led to a top-line contribution of tens of

millions, and reductions in workforce were avoided. In contrast, other

departments in the institution simply moved forward with cycles of

layoﬀs which reduced morale and led to burnout.

For the last few years we have been researching two modes of

attention that people use at work: doing mode, in which people

pay narrow attention to a speciﬁc task in order to control, predict and get it done eﬃciently; and spacious mode, in which people

pay attention more expansively, without hurry, making them more

## receptive to relationships, interdependencies, and possibilities—like

Soren’s approach to cost-cutting. Spacious mode leads to critical

beneﬁts in the workplace, such as gaining insight into challenges,

thinking strategically, spotting opportunities, building relationships,

and sparking joy and motivation.

Unfortunately, we’ve found that spacious thinking is regularly

suppressed in favor of doing mode in organizations. This is hardly a

surprise. We are living in a time of cultural obsession with productivity

and achievement across all spheres of life. Our research—which has

included a global survey of more than 3,000 employees, ongoing

## discussions with 50 global professionals, and interviews with leaders

and those they lead—shows that employees looking to excel worry that shifting into spacious mode can be interpreted as a lack of eﬃciency

or urgency. As a result, it feels career-limiting, and like it requires

permission from a manager, so few employees do it regularly.

While all employees have some agency to shift to spacious mode,

leaders play a crucial role in making it more accessible at work because

they can legitimize it as a good way to spend precious time (or not).

## HBR / Digital Article / The Best Leaders Encourage “Spacious Thinking”

In this article we’ll show how leaders often unknowingly discourage

spacious thinking on their teams, and what they can do to help instead.

# How Leaders Get in the Way

Leaders and managers are the key to encouraging spacious thinking

because their behaviors signal what is acceptable. Too often, managers

are narrowly focused on achieving the next short-term deliverable

which means their teams are stuck in doing mode too. And though the

team’s to-do list gets ticked oﬀ, there is no way of knowing whether

those to-dos were the right ones, no space for a team to grow, no joy or

interest to discover what is possible. This can suck the life out of a team.

One senior manager we came across in our research was infamous in

her organization for her catchphrase: “Be clear, be quick, be gone.”

In our conversations with her team and colleagues, it became clear

that less-conﬁdent employees kept quiet around her and declined to

raise complex, important challenges that would require inquiry and

# exploration.

You may think that, unlike this manager, you already engage in spacious

mode, so you don’t need to worry. But leaders tend to overestimate

how spacious their own behaviors are. For example, our research has

shown that the more senior we are in a hierarchy, the more we think

we are open to hearing others, when we are really not. Similarly, in our

## experience facilitating meetings, leaders almost always underestimate

how much airtime they take up.

Leaders also tend to mistakenly believe that it’s easy for their direct

reports to move into spacious mode without permission—or that it

would be easy to ask for that permission. This is driven by “advantage

blindness,” which can cause those with higher standing in a hierarchy

to underestimate the power they hold and the impact it has. Therefore

leaders overestimate how approachable they are and how able those

lower on the hierarchy are to choose their own course of action.

# How to Encourage Spacious Mode

To give employees permission to spend time thinking, learning,

innovating, and collaborating, you’ll need to rethink how you

communicate and which behaviors you reward. For example, Toni, a

regional manager at a large U.S. retailer we spoke with during our research, counted herself lucky: “My chief people oﬃcer has a real sense

of spaciousness around her and the way she shows up. I feel like I’ve got

a lot of permission and protection from her in my role.”

## Our research points to three behaviors of leaders and managers who

enable their teams in this way:

Focus on ideas instead of tasks. One of us (Megan) was working

with a CEO who wanted his senior team to focus more on the bigger

picture rather than day-to-day operations. Through their conversations,

he realized that in his meetings he almost inevitably focused ﬁrst

(and often solely) on quarterly results. To expand the team’s thinking,

Megan suggested that he begin some meetings by asking, “What hasn’t

gone well over the last few weeks, and what have you learned from

that?” or “How have you developed your team recently?” Over time, the

team’s conversations naturally began to shift more toward group-wide

perspectives that bolstered their learning and development.

Our survey showed that many employees feel that tasks are consistently

prioritized over more spacious topics. They ranked learning, values,

purpose, creativity, and relationships as topics they’d like to talk to

their managers about above tasks. Managers need to structure meeting

agendas in a way that includes these spacious-mode topics.

Bring in novelty. We often meet in the same places, follow the same

agendas with the same people, and assume that the same process can

meet any number of diﬀerent outcomes.

It’s almost heretical to suggest that a meeting doesn’t have to end

with actions to add to our already over-stuﬀed to-do lists. However,

other outcomes might be far more important. For example, at a

recent meeting at a life sciences company, participants told one of

us (John) they found it “cathartic and hopeful” that the agenda had

been speciﬁcally designed to be an inquiring conversation rather than

their usual action-focused drills. In the weeks following the meeting,

participants’ senior leadership reported feeling an increase in the team’s

energy to the point that they felt comfortable shifting away from their

usual directive control. As a result, speed of decision making ramped

up and the market agility that had been espoused came to life, as

staﬀ in the U.S. and Europe felt trusted to use their own judgment in

co-ordinating their work.

External facilitators and invited guests can bring in fresh ideas and

perspectives. For example, diﬀerent venues can inspire diﬀerent sorts of

conversations: a walk-and-talk or meeting outside might engage a more

open mind than the goldﬁsh bowl of a glass-walled meeting room in the

# bowels of a building.

One manager we worked with bought his team a new book every

quarter, which focused on a diﬀerent sector or a broader industry-

or society-wide issue, and then put some time aside to discuss what

they’d read together. Other executives encourage their teams to get out of the oﬃce to experience the world as their customers do. When

they do, the teams explain to us that these eﬀorts help them to

bring the wider context back into view, and that leads to valuable

conversations about strategy and purpose. Encountering novelty jolts

them to course-correct, keeping on track with customer demands rather

than losing sight of those amidst shorter-term tasks and targets. The

conversations also strengthened relationships in the teams, through

sharing experiences and listening to diﬀerent viewpoints.

Value and reward spacious mode. Typically people who are visibly

busy and get things done get rewarded. While there is nothing wrong

with this—certainly doing mode is vital to high-performing teams—it

needs to be complemented with recognition of team members who

listen, explore, challenge, and invite the rest of the team to look up and

# around.

Elaine was introduced to us by her peer, Ben, who had recommended

we speak to her for our research. He noted that in the high-pressured

transformation project they were leading, Elaine had, on several

occasions, challenged the team’s viewpoint in a meeting and forced

them to consider alternative courses of action. At the time, he reﬂected,

there was some frustration in the team at being held up, but the team

agreed that the decisions they ended up making in the spacious mode

that Elaine had brought into the conversation were wiser than those

they had been about to make while in doing mode. Elaine and Ben’s

manager recognized this not simply by complimenting Elaine, but by

spending time explaining how her attention had beneﬁted the program.

After this, when the team faced an important, adaptive challenge,

they were more comfortable in pausing to examine and challenge key

# decisions.

Spacious mode might be hard for you to see as a manager. Consider

how your biases might play into this: The same behavior that in

one employee may be labeled as annoying, wasteful and lazy, when

practiced by someone else (especially someone who is already more

powerful) can be seen as strategic and evidence of their readiness to

continue moving up the managerial hierarchy. If you are dismayed to

see a team member step back from doing mode, ask yourself whether

they’re actually engaged in spacious mode.

We have created managerial and organizational norms which over-

privilege doing mode and hide the value of spacious mode. But only

when insights from spacious mode guide teams’ actions in doing mode

can leaders be sure that team members are focused on doing the

right work in the right ways. There needs to be a rebalancing of the

relationship between these modes if organizations are to thrive and

# perform.
