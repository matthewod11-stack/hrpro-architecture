Kofﬁ and Yao Assoua and their driver stood together in the back of the

arrivals hall at Félix-Houphouët-Boigny International Airport. Though

trying to maintain their dignity, the two brothers occasionally rose on

their toes to see over the heads of the crowd. Koﬃ’s daughter, Aminata —or “Amina,” as they aﬀectionately called her—was coming back home

to Côte d’Ivoire, and they were hoping to oﬀer her a role in the family

# business.

The brothers had started Assoua Group in 1988 as a trading company

## with particular expertise in sugar and other bulk commodities. In

the early 2000s they had expanded into importing cement and

eventually into mining limestone and manufacturing cement. That

energy-intensive operation led them, several years later, to build their

own power plant to produce electricity. With revenues above $600

million, Assoua Group had become one of West Africa’s most successful

# conglomerates.

Koﬃ and Yao had visited Aminata twice in Paris, where she had started

her job in the strategic planning oﬃce of a global energy company 10

months ago, after earning her MBA at INSEAD. This was her ﬁrst visit

home since graduation. The trio had set up monthly Zoom calls while

Aminata was in business school, and the brothers had been thrilled

with her increasing interest in Assoua Group. They had even shared

historical ﬁnancials and business plans with her while explaining

all the various elements of the enterprise. But Aminata had been

noncommittal about coming home. So they were delighted when she

had suggested several months earlier that she visit to discuss some ideas

for the company in person. And now, after such a long wait, suddenly

there she was, in a tailored linen suit and a white silk shell. As she

walked toward them, smiling and conﬁdent, her father was struck again

by how much she resembled her late mother.

“Ma chérie!” Koﬃ exclaimed, giving her an enthusiastic hug.

“Don’t forget to hug me, too,” Yao said, his arms outstretched and a huge

# smile on his face.

As they moved toward the exit, Koﬃ felt a wave of relief and relaxation.

“Amina,” he said, “we have a whole week planned for you. We are

going to take you to see all the operations of the company, meet all the

## division heads, and meet with some of our key bankers and partners.”

His daughter interrupted him. “Papa, it’s Aminata now,” she said,

tilting her head toward the driver to make clear how she wanted to be addressed in front of company staﬀers. “And that’s very kind. But before

we do all that, I would like a morning with you both to introduce some

ideas I have for Assoua Group.”

“Of course,” Koﬃ replied.

“Yes, my dear,” Yao echoed. “Whatever makes you happy!”

# A Very Direct Proposal

Once they had settled at a table in their favorite restaurant in the

Plateau district of Abidjan, Aminata started to share the real reason

for her visit. “Papa and Uncle, I know you would like me to return

home. It’s clear what a great company you have built and how you worry

about your legacy. But here’s my problem,” she said with uncommon

directness. “I’ve made a life in Europe. I’m respected for my talents and accomplishments, and I’ve just been oﬀered a substantial new position

with P&L responsibilities. It would be a step backward to return to

# Assoua as a trainee.”

Koﬃ and Yao glanced at each other.

“It would be even harder for me to return if we were restricting

Assoua’s growth by not taking advantage of the amazing assets that

you have assembled,” she continued. “Here is what I propose: I’ll join

the company, but only if it’s as COO. And I’ll take that position with

## proper equity and compensation, of course, but also with the explicit

understanding that we will quickly expand two of our core businesses.”

“But what about Ibrahim?” Koﬃ said, referring to Ibrahim Coulibaly, his and Yao’s long-serving deputy. “He’s already COO.” 1

“We can oﬀer him a diﬀerent role,” Aminata replied. “Perhaps chief

operations adviser, to support my onboarding. Of course, you’d have

to accept that he will be a ﬂight risk once it becomes clear that I am

coming back.”

Yao and Koﬃ were stunned. They had never imagined such a blunt

conversation with Aminata. They had assumed that her role would

evolve over months or years. They sat silent as she produced a laptop

from her briefcase and opened up a slide presentation.

“Here are the two places where we should push,” she said. “We have the

capital and we have the management team. It’s time to launch the next

# phase of Assoua Group.”

## The ﬁrst slide read, “Backward Integration into Sugar Farming.”

Although Assoua Group still imported raw sugar from Brazil, Koﬃ and

Yao had purchased 70,000 hectares of land in the Zanzan District of

their country a decade earlier but had dithered over whether to develop it.2

“This is an obvious ﬁrst move,” Aminata said. “We know the market

price because we’re already importers and distributors. Demand is

consistent for sugar, and the major capital investment was the purchase

of the land, which we’ve completed. This will provide jobs for thousands

of local farmers. We have the land and the climate to grow our own food

and nutrients—there’s no need to keep importing them.”

“Well, that’s a very interesting idea,” Yao began. “One that you know

we’ve toyed with.”

“Uncle, please may I ﬁnish?” Aminata said, interrupting.3 She clicked to the next slide.

“We should also become an independent producer of electricity for

sale to Côte d’Ivoire Énergies. We’re already generating power—why

not expand and sell to the grid? The operating costs will be very low

once the project is built—and we may ﬁnd follow-on construction opportunities such as power lines. This region is desperate for power.” 4

The trio sat in silence. “Well, what do you think?” Aminata ﬁnally said.

“Do you have a slide showing how you plan to phase these enormous

transformations?” Koﬃ replied. His brother still seemed stunned.

“No,” Aminata said. “I suggest that we do them both at once, starting

next ﬁscal year. I have already modeled out exactly what investments are required and how to staﬀ up. I want to come home and run the

expansion as the COO. This is a major life decision for me—and this is

what it would take for me to move back.”

# Why All or Nothing?

Koﬃ and Yao met for nine holes at Abidjan’s Ivoire Golf Club. They were

joined by Jean-Louis Kouamé, a former boarding-school classmate and

now a senior magistrate. It had been 10 days since Aminata’s ultimatum,

and the two had promised her an answer by the end of the month,

# before the next board meeting.

“You have raised a bright child,” Jean-Louis said after hearing about

# Aminata’s presentation.

“Yes, perhaps too smart,” Koﬃ said. “We have major concerns about her

plans—and about the way she told us about them.”

“How so?” Jean-Louis asked with lawyerly dispassion.

“Well, take sugar farming,” Yao replied. “We are a trading company.

What do we know about agribusiness? About the science of seeds and

soil? We have the land, but we’ve never done anything with it because

it’s totally isolated—we’ve been waiting for infrastructure to grow up

around it. We’d have to ﬁnd farmers to work the ﬁelds and build roads to

transport the sugar. It’s an enormous undertaking. And we’d be exposed

to drought and heat, which are getting worse with climate change.”

“What about her other idea, of selling power to the grid?” Jean-Louis

inquired.

“I’m not against it,” Koﬃ said. “I suspect we could get very favorable incentives and tariﬀs from the government, which has made reducing

the country’s power deﬁcit a priority. But Yao is very uncomfortable

with the scale of the investment.”

“Yes,” Yao said. “Power generation is about more than simply setting

up a few generators and connecting to the grid. We’re talking about

substantial infrastructure, ongoing maintenance, complex technology.

It’s just not our business. And the government may cap the retail price

for electricity. We could end up being paid less than our costs, meaning

we’d never recoup our capital investment.”

“I also can’t bear the thought of possibly losing Ibrahim,” Koﬃ said,

grimacing. “He’s been a loyal deputy for years; he knows the business

inside out. I’ve always assumed that Aminata would run a business division under him after Yao and I retired.” 5

“It seems your daughter was raised to have grander ambitions than

that,” Jean-Louis said. “And as much as you care for Ibrahim, he is not

your child; Aminata is.”

“But why does it have to be all or nothing?” Yao asked, sighing deeply

as his brother got ready for a tee shot. “Why can’t she just try one of the

## two expansion ideas ﬁrst as a division head?”

“Perhaps she knows this is the only chance she has to negotiate with

you, because this is the only time she will have a credible walk-away

threat,” Jean-Louis said. He looked searchingly at his two friends. “May

I ask you to consider what would happen if Aminata came home and

was successful? The agribusiness would help provide food security and good jobs for our people.6 Producing power for the grid would help industrial productivity and improve the quality of life for Ivorians. Your

daughter could become a national hero.”

“That’s true,” Koﬃ said. “But may I ask you to consider what would

happen if she failed? We’d have to leverage the business for a

transformation of this scope. Apart from wiping out the value of

the company, it would turn Assoua Group into yet another “désastre

africain,” which the Paris papers love to write about. We’ve worked our

whole lives to make sure that doesn’t happen.”

# An Important Turning Point

The three paused as they ﬁnished on the ninth green.

Jean-Louis broke the silence. “We served our country by building

our careers in our new nation—by showing that Africans can become

successful and wealthy without colonial patronage. The next generation

wants more. They want to contribute directly to nation building. Who

are we to stand in their way?”

“I don’t know,” Koﬃ said. “This seems like an important turning point

in her life. I want her to succeed, and I want our company to succeed.

What she’s proposing—it feels like an MBA thesis, not a real plan. She

hasn’t spent any time paying her dues or getting to know the company

on the ground. Her plan is ambitious and risky, especially for a new

executive who has never worked in Africa. I just don’t know if that is

right for Assoua, for Aminata, or, for that matter, for the nation. I don’t

know what we should do.”

## Question: Should Koﬃ and Yao greenlight Aminata’s plan?

# Case Study Classroom Notes

- 1. The “merit or inherit” dilemma vexes many family businesses. Research

has shown that professional management, given the right conditions, can produce better results than a family-only structure. What advantages do you see in each approach?

- 2. What are the risks and opportunities of buying land as a future

# investment?

- 3. Aminata wants to be professional and respect familial courtesy. Could

she improve her presentation style?

- 4. Côte d’Ivoire exports power but faces power deficits, especially when drought lowers water levels at its hydropower dams. Rationing often impairs industry. Millions of Ivorians have no access to electricity.

- 5. Some studies suggest that exposure to a family business creates

pressure and feelings of inferiority, making a potential successor more likely to leave the company. Others posit that it transmits positive parental values. Which outcome seems likelier to you?

- 6. A weak transport infrastructure, low harvests, and farmers’ limited

access to both capital and markets mean that Côte d’Ivoire is a net food importer.

HBR’s fictionalized case studies present problems faced by leaders in real companies and offer solutions from experts. This one is based on the HBS Case Study “BUA Group” (case no. 222-062), by John D. Macomber, Pippa Tubman Armerding, and Wale Lawal.

A version of this article appeared in the September–October 2024 issue of Harvard Business Review.

## The Experts Respond: Should Koffi and Yao greenlight Aminata’s plan?

## Ladi Balogun is the CEO of FCMB Group, based in Nigeria.

Aminata brings interesting ideas to the table, and

Koﬃ and Yao should allow her to pursue them.

But they should persuade her to do so as the head

## of a new-ventures arm, not as the chief operating

oﬃcer. In that tailored role she would have an

opportunity to develop and test her proposals on a manageable scale.

She could begin with projects that would demonstrate results quickly

without the necessity for signiﬁcant investment. For instance, she could

be allocated a small portion of the 70,000 hectares that Assoua already

owns—perhaps 10%—to make a start with the sugar farming project.

Although Aminata may feel ready to be a COO, my experience suggests

otherwise. As an executive who was educated in the United States

and Europe and subsequently returned to lead a business in Africa, I

believe that on-the-ground experience and time to earn the respect of

one’s compatriot colleagues is essential. In the absence of those factors,

Aminata would no doubt face considerable resistance from Assoua

Group’s workforce and possibly even troublesome attrition.

If they are to succeed in persuading Aminata to scale back her plans

and aspirations and take a lesser role, her father and her uncle will need to oﬀer her the promise of signiﬁcant investment in the projects

she advocates, a clear path for growth, and a competitive salary.

That amount should be as close as possible to what she now has an

opportunity to earn in Paris, with the potential for greater rewards if

her initiatives prove successful and can be proﬁtably scaled up. Those

inducements might help her align her personal ambitions with the

company’s strategic goals.

How Aminata responds to the oﬀer will be important. If she continues

to push for immediate large-scale changes, Koﬃ and Yao might

consider exploring alternative ways of keeping her involved in the

family business. For instance, should she decide to continue pursuing

her career in Paris, she could take a seat on the board—or accept a

role as adviser to the directors. In either capacity she would have an

opportunity to conduct in-depth research and consult industry experts

in order to develop a more sophisticated business case for her ideas

## about sugar farming and power generation.

All those who are involved in this negotiation must endeavor to be

patient. If Aminata is to be smoothly integrated into Assoua Group,

the process should be strategic and carefully phased. A clear road

map should be drawn for scaling up the projects she advocates—if the

smaller initial versions prove successful—and for gradually giving her

# more leadership responsibility.

This approach would safeguard the company from undue risks and would more eﬀectively leverage Aminata’s fresh perspectives and skills.

Cyrille NKontchou is a cofounder and managing partner of Enko Capital, based in South Africa.

Koﬃ and Yao should reject Aminata’s plan—gently

—and at the same time try to steer her to

a diﬀerent, more rewarding role within Assoua Group. Aminata is

clearly eager to make bold moves, but she seems to be channeling her

## energies toward high-risk opportunities of the past rather than

capitalizing on the growth potential of tomorrow. For instance, although

Africa’s resources are so abundant that it shouldn’t need to import food

products, the practice continues because smaller local farms are

struggling to compete against enormous plantations abroad that beneﬁt

from economies of scale. To have any hope of success with sugar

farming, Assoua Group would need support from the government in the form of price controls and tariﬀs—protective measures that tend to be

politically unpopular because they increase the cost of food.

Similarly, Aminata’s proposal to expand into power production is

fraught with complexity. The proﬁtability of such projects in Africa depends on a consistent and aﬀordable fuel supply—preferably in the

form of natural gas. If the government ﬁxes the retail price of electricity,

Assoua Group won’t be able to absorb any fuel price ﬂuctuations. What’s

more, ﬁnancing could be challenging: Local pension funds typically

avoid such high-risk investments, and overseas investors are likely to

demand extensive safeguards in order to protect their capital.

There is a precedent for Aminata’s playbook: Aliko Dangote, the

founder of Dangote Group, the largest conglomerate in West Africa,

became the continent’s richest person through cement manufacturing,

petroleum reﬁning, and commodity trading. His success stemmed not

## only from business acumen but also from intervention by the Nigerian

government to shield his ventures from international competition and

create a market environment conducive to growth.

Considering these factors, I would advise Koﬃ and Yao to persuade

Aminata that, should she choose to join them as a leader in Assoua

Group, she and the company would be better served by her putting

## her MBA training, European work experience, global perspective on

business, and fresh thinking on Africa to work in sectors that align with

the fourth industrial revolution—such as digital technology, telecoms, and e-commerce. Those areas oﬀer higher growth potential, are better

suited to her skill set, and will give her a bigger platform to innovate

and drive change. And conﬂict with the current COO, Ibrahim, would be

avoided, because he could run the legacy business while she focused on

what’s next for the company.

If she declines this oﬀer, so be it. As a business leader and a father

preparing for my own children’s education, potentially including

overseas studies, I empathize with Koﬃ and Yao. We hope to see our

kids return and contribute to their homeland, but we must also be

open to letting them ﬁnd success abroad. Africa is a signiﬁcant exporter

of labor, and humanity beneﬁts immensely from its diaspora. Thus,

although we cherish the prospect of family continuity in our businesses,

we must also embrace the next generation’s choices of paths that

might lead them to have greater impact beyond our borders—and our

# expectations.
