found that companies where executives have an average tenure of

ﬁve years or more outperformed on revenue, customer experience,

and other key metrics, as compared to companies with less tenured

# executive teams.

Retaining senior executives, though, is increasingly diﬃcult. More than

half (56%) of the executives surveyed by Gartner said they are likely or

extremely likely to leave their current role in the next two years. More

than one-quarter (27%) said they are likely or extremely likely to leave

in the next six months. Even more troubling, established executives—

## those essential to high performance—are nearly 40% more likely to

## leave in the next two years than new executives.

Organizations looking to mitigate executive turnover and maintain

performance must focus on three key actions:

- 1. Identify what’s driving executive dissatisfaction in your organization.

Historically, executives have cited retirement and burnout as the

key factors behind their decision to leave. Although these remain

important, they’re not the only—or most important—drivers of

executive turnover today. In fact, only 17% of executives in Gartner’s

October 2024 survey who anticipate leaving their organization in the

next two years plan to retire. Burnout factors like work-related stress,

work-life balance, and mental health concerns only ranked 5th, 6th and

7th respectively for executives with a high intent to leave (those who are

actively looking for new jobs or plan to do so within the next year) out of

# 10 surveyed factors.

Today, we’re seeing many executives are simply looking for new

challenges. Overall, executives cite growth-based concerns, including

career advancement opportunities (ranked 1st in the October 2024

survey), misaligned organizational culture (ranked 2nd), higher

compensation (ranked 3rd), and lack of job satisfaction (ranked 4th),

as reasons for leaving their current role.

To head oﬀ potential turnover, organizations must accurately diagnose

the source of executives’ dissatisfaction. This is best accomplished by

having the CHRO partner with the CEO to understand what is going

## well—and less well—with individual executives.

# Speciﬁcally, CHROs should:

- Encourage the CEO to ask about executive satisfaction and growth

## goals in one-on-one meetings and other informal settings.

- Look for outward signs of dissatisfaction, such as pushback against

## team decisions or an abrupt change in an executive’s communication

## style, particularly during unscripted moments.

- Demonstrate empathy to executives who may have concerns and

encourage them to raise them with the CEO.

- Empower the CEO with insights on the broader C-suite climate, being

careful to anonymize individual concerns to preserve conﬁdentiality.

- 2. Develop retention criteria.

Executive retention eﬀorts can be costly, particularly if executives are

being courted by a competitor. Moreover, not all executives contribute

# equally to organizational performance.

Targeting retention eﬀorts can ensure organizations don’t overspend to

retain less essential executives. There is no single “right” criteria to use

when deciding which executives to try and retain, rather the CHRO and

CEO should select what best ﬁts their organizational priorities, goals,

and strategy. Examples of potential criteria include:

- High performer retention. An emphasis on keeping higher

performing executives may be the best approach to maintaining

overall performance, but it is often the costliest as these executives

have more exit options.

- Critical capability retention. Executives who have capabilities that

are critical to organizational success, such as technical acumen or

institutional knowledge, may be costlier to replace.

- High potential retention. Focusing on retaining executives who can

## drive future growth versus those responsible for past performance

can result in a win-win for the executive and organization as these

executives may also be those most interested in growth opportunities.

- 3. Create a multi-channel retention strategy.

Armed with a better understanding of what their executives want and

need, as well as which executives they want to retain, organizations can develop targeted retention eﬀorts.

Often the ﬁrst impulse for the CEO and board of directors is to increase

compensation for dissatisﬁed executives. While this may guard against competitive outside oﬀers, it will be less eﬀective in keeping executives

who have other reasons to move on.

A multi-channel retention strategy that targets a wider range of executives’ expectations and needs will be more eﬀective than a simple

compensation-based strategy. Moreover, as it hinges on coaching and

other low-cost activities, it may also be more eﬃcient.

The CHRO is key in both conceptualizing and implementing this

multi-channel strategy. Speciﬁcally, the CHRO can mitigate concerns

executives have around growth opportunities and culture by:

- Taking on the role of career coach. CHROs are well positioned

to connect executives to both internal and external development

resources. As a peer executive, they can do this in a way that is tailored

# to executives’ unique needs.

- Strengthening CxO-CEO relationships. CHROs can help their

colleagues build trust with their CEO in order to assuage

concerns about individual growth or ease conversations about new

# opportunities.

- Supporting mental health and work-life balance. Executive

burnout remains a challenge at many organizations, and CHROs can

help peers identify sources of work stress and encourage usage of

## mental health and work-life balance beneﬁts.

. . .

As the adage goes, past performance is no guarantee of future

results, particularly in a continuing VUCA environment. Although

organizations have performed surprisingly well amidst the volatility of

the past ﬁve years, they risk future performance by ignoring anticipated

executive departures. Understanding and then implementing these

three strategies can help organizations staunch executive turnover and

ensure that they have the executive team needed to drive performance

# today and into the future.
