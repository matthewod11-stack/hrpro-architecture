Born six years after the U.S. Civil Rights Act hastened desegregation,

Brown became a debate champion and class president at her mostly

white high school. In her college applications she declared her intention

to be the ﬁrst Black female Supreme Court Justice. After earning

undergraduate and law degrees from Harvard and then working for

nearly three decades as a lawyer and a judge, in 2022 she made good on

that goal. Her new memoir is called Lovely One.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Life’s Work: An Interview with Ketanji Brown Jackson

HBR: From segregation to the Supreme Court in one generation is a big leap. I know you beneﬁted from the broader U.S. civil rights movement, but how did your family’s approach to education and work hasten that progress?

## Jackson: Their experience in the segregated South—being Black people

who were actually physically separated from the broader community—

made my parents really interested in having me participate. So if there

were swimming lessons, my mother put me in them. If I could give a

speech or say a poem at the youth fair, she wanted me to do it. The

mentality was: Here’s a chance for our daughter to do everything we

couldn’t do, and we’re going to prepare her for this world of opportunity.

My family also focused on education. My grandparents didn’t have

much themselves, but they understood that it was the key to success, so

they worked to put their children through college, and then my parents

became educators. These ideas of self-determination, self-conﬁdence,

and the ability to do what you want to, now that you are no longer held

back, motivated them to set high expectations for me and encourage me

to achieve them.

You’ve said that as one of only a few Black students at your high school, you felt “conspicuous.” Did that help or hurt you?

A little of both. It probably helped more than hurt because I was

memorable. Going into these classrooms or debate tournaments as one

of a handful of students of color, with an unusual name, and then also

knocking it out of the park after a lot of hard work meant that people

remembered me. It did take fortitude to not feel daunted by being

diﬀerent. But I just decided that I would put all my eﬀort into being

as good as I could be in those realms. When you’re diﬀerent, you can

either shrink from it and try to make yourself small or say, “I’m going to

# use this to my advantage.”

You write a lot about defying expectations, but many women and people of color say that those who do that can get pushback. So how did you defy in a way that didn’t make people defensive?

I’ve never thought about it in those terms. Maybe part of it is that in

the early 1970s and through the mid ’80s our society, having just turned

the corner from an era of segregation, was interested in responding to

those prior circumstances. Not only did my parents want to make sure

that I had opportunities and was taking full advantage of them but my

community was also very open to inclusion and encouragement. Most

people I came into contact with growing up genuinely wanted me to

succeed, so I don’t recall encountering any sort of direct pushback.

Your favorite extracurricular was debate, but you focused on the dramatic performance categories and you later starred in musicals at Harvard and aspired to Broadway. Why did you choose law over the arts?

My father went back to law school when I was little, so the seeds of

that being a career goal or track were planted very early. I thought the

law was fascinating and consequential. And as much as I loved the

arts, I always really wanted to do work that I thought would have a

direct impact on society. I was also good at writing. So I saw the legal

profession as a way to combine my skills, interests, and desire to make a

diﬀerence, and I thought I could channel whatever talents I’d developed

# as a speaker and a performer into it.

As you entered Harvard Law and then your career, how did it feel to again be one of a few Black women in those white-male-dominated environments?

It wasn’t easy. But in college I had formed a community with some Black

women who became my good friends, and we all ended up going to the law school too. Having a close-knit group during that diﬃcult training

together was a comfort. By that time I was also in a serious relationship

with my then boyfriend, now husband, and I had his support. I fell back

on the skills for coping and survival that I had developed early on. Of

course, as a young lawyer, I sometimes felt as though my contributions

to meetings and discussions were not taken as seriously as some of my

colleagues’, but I managed.

When you saw that kind of unfairness or bias, how did you respond?

In my view, you have to pick and choose your battles. It’s not that

you don’t see or know that these things are happening. The question

is, how much time and energy do you have to invest in responding to

this particular circumstance? It may be worth it. But it may also be

the case that recognizing the unfairness, which happens at all kinds

of levels and in all kinds of ways in the workplace, will be taking you

away from the task at hand in a way that won’t be beneﬁcial. So you

have to assess—“I see that, I know that, and I’m going to choose to set

it aside right now because I have more important things to worry about

or to focus on”—versus responding every time. The way in which my

parents navigated the world was very instructive for me. People who had

lived through the society they did could have been devoured by a rage

that would have made it impossible for them to proceed. Instead they

turned, and pivoted, and did what they needed to do, and that made all

# the diﬀerence in my life.

After law school you moved on to clerkships, including one at the Supreme Court, which took a lot of stamina. How did you manage that early part of your career?

It was hard, but I expected it to be. The Supreme Court clerkship was

literally a 24/7 kind of job. But I kept saying to myself, You can do

anything for a year. And cases come to the Supreme Court because they are diﬃcult and extremely consequential—addressing issues that

aﬀect an enormous number of people in very signiﬁcant ways— so our

baseline is that the work will be very challenging and the spotlight of

public attention will be very, very hot. All that creates pressure, which

you then have to balance with self-care. But your commitment is to do

your best to serve your justice and the institution, and it’s going to take

pretty much everything you have for that period.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Life’s Work: An Interview with Ketanji Brown Jackson

Your stint in corporate law was uncomfortable. Why?

I was pregnant when I entered it, and the uncomfortable thing was

being thrust immediately into wanting to perform at the highest level

as a new employee in this environment but at times feeling as though

I wouldn’t be able to do that once my daughter was born. Someone

had to get home to relieve the nanny, and my husband was a surgical

resident at Mass General at the time, so more often than not, that person

was me. It was an identity crisis. I had built my professional brand

around being a hard worker, staying however long, doing whatever was

necessary, and not being able to do that was very, very challenging. I

also felt inadequate in the parenting realm because I had to go to work

and wasn’t there for my baby.

How did you resolve that conﬂict?

I ended up shifting from the big law ﬁrm and trying diﬀerent things.

I went to a small mediation ﬁrm. I went to the government. When

my kids were a bit older, I went back into big law, but ultimately

got on the Sentencing Commission, an agency of the judiciary that

helps set sentencing policy for federal judges. The schedule was much

better. Doing work that I considered to be meaningful was also helpful.

When I felt like I was really making a diﬀerence, the sacriﬁces on the

motherhood front felt more worth it.

How have you and your husband managed the push and pull of two high-powered careers?

My husband has always seen this as a partnership. He is so self-

sacriﬁcing in parenting, caring for our household and my career. Early

on, when we were ﬁrst married, before we had kids, we would take

turns. He took some time oﬀ in the residency to do research in DC so

that I could work at the law ﬁrm I wanted. Then I went back up to

Boston so that he could ﬁnish his residency. One of us would step back

to let the other do what was needed for work. And that’s the way we have

managed our lives ever since. Now, during the Supreme Court term,

when I am focused on that, my husband steps up and does much more

of the housework, setting up dinners, picking up the girls, et cetera.

When he has busy times with his practice, I try to step forward.

You hesitated to apply for a federal judgeship. What was holding you back, and how did you move past it?

A lot of complicated factors were swirling. One was our home. When I

said to my dad, “I might have this opportunity, but we just found this

house, and we love it and don’t want to move,” he said, “What are you

talking about?” Because I had always wanted to be a federal judge, and it

was just a house. Aside from that, I was nervous because I had been an

appellate lawyer in practice, so my expertise was not in trial work, which

was the judgeship I had the opportunity to apply for. So would I even get

it? If I got it, could I do it? I knew it would be a steep learning curve, and

the girls were still little, so did I have the time? Would I be good enough

to do the job in the way that I had come to expect of myself? Ultimately

I made what I now think could be considered the right decision, but

I did hesitate. I had found a comfortable life in the place I wanted to

be and was happy with it. The question was whether I should just stay

where I was or stretch and move to this more uncertain terrain.

Given rising political polarization and the balance of power on the Supreme Court after President Trump’s appointments of three justices, did you ever think twice about wanting that nomination?

Not about seeing it as an amazing opportunity despite the balance of the

## Court or the challenges that would most certainly arise in our current

political environment. I also felt well prepared to do the job, having

served at the two prior federal levels and been a Supreme Court clerk.

This was, in a way, my wheelhouse in terms of skills and preparation.

The scariest part was suddenly being thrust into the limelight and the

# conﬁrmation process.

How did you handle the scrutiny, particularly during those contentious conﬁrmation hearings?

I tried to prepare my family to make sure we understood what was

coming and were ready. Of course, being a mom, if my girls had said,

“We don’t want to be put through that,” then I would not have gone

for it. But they were very supportive. And the White House was very

helpful. There’s vetting to pick people who can withstand that kind

of pressure. And if nominated, you’re put through intense questioning

to practice how to respond in a way that is most informative and not

emotional and to not take it personally. The advice was: “You can either

be upset or you can be a Supreme Court Justice.” That’s the work.

What are your views on the current debates over lifetime federal judicial appointments and a Supreme Court ethics code?

I’m not going to comment on political issues currently being evaluated.

But I am optimistic in that the debate is emblematic of democratic

engagement, which is positive. We have people who are focused on,

thinking about, and talking about this. As a branch of government, we

answer to the people. As judges, we are public servants. And it is up to

the people to determine what the structure and form and function of the

courts should be. As for the ethics code, it’s an interesting topic that has

recently come to the fore, and the Court has now adopted its own code,

which is generally modeled on what the lower courts do.

How do you and the other justices engage as colleagues? What do you do to make sure it feels like a good workplace, even when you’re disagreeing on big issues?

Well, a part of the Court’s tradition is having lunch together. Pretty

much every day the Court is sitting, which is a lot during the term, and

any day that we have a conference or a meeting where we discuss cases,

it’s bring-your-own to the justices’ dining room. That really does help

# with collegiality.

You clerked for judges with different management styles. You described one as a master nurturer, another as meticulous and scholarly. What kind of leader are you?

I try to draw from both sets of qualities. I am very warm and open

with my staﬀ. I have a small group that works directly for me, my law

clerks and my assistants, and we do fun things together. I try to be a

nurturer in that sense. But I also ensure that we are doing the work

necessary to lay out my opinions in a clear and thorough fashion. I

have pretty high expectations for the drafts that we generate, and I’m

a very substantial editor of the opinions coming out of my chambers. I

work very, very hard to prepare for arguments, to ask questions that I

think will be meaningful in helping understand the issues and shape the

debate. So I do think that I exhibit a number of qualities of my former

bosses—hopefully the best qualities. But you’d have to ask my staﬀ what

they think!
