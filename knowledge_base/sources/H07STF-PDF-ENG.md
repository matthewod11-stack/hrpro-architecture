For most of us, reinvention—of our careers and ourselves—is an

extremely tall order. As London Business School professor Herminia

Ibarra notes, you might know what you don’t want to do any more but

be unsure what you actually do want to do next. People “don’t know how

to search when they don’t know exactly what they’re searching for,” she

says.

Much more important than trying to ﬁgure out the next career step is

thinking more broadly about your possible selves, and then exploring

several of those possible selves simultaneously. This is where having

a diverse network helps a lot. And while most of us hate networking,

Ibarra has tips on how to become better at that too.

For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR

editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Ibarra, a proliﬁc author who is

an expert on career transitions, to discuss:

- How to transition smoothly and successfully from one career to

# another

- Being authentic in the workplace without limiting your own growth

# and evolution

- How to break out of insular networks to truly connect with those

who can link you to new opportunities.

Two of Ibarra’s books are coming out next month in updated editions:

## Working Identity: Unconventional Strategies for Reinventing Your Career

## and Act Like a Leader, Think Like a Leader.

ADI IGNATIUS:

# Herminia, welcome.

HERMINIA IBARRA:

# Thank you so much.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

ADI IGNATIUS:

I want to talk a lot about career transitions, but I want to give a little

context ﬁrst, and I know your view is that this is an era of constant

career reinvention. Why do you think that’s so?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

I’ve been studying career reinvention for over 20 years now. The ﬁrst

edition of Working Identity was 20 years ago, and the trends just keep

accelerating. If anything, we are reinventing ourselves and reinventing

# our careers more.

There’s four things that are contributing to this. We’re living longer and

longer, and as we live longer, we don’t want to have a long slide from

age 40, because we could easily be working another 40 years. We want to

make the most of it. That’s one.

Two is technology. I don’t have to say much about that, but it is

changing everything. It is disrupting jobs. It is creating new jobs. It’s

allowing us to work from anywhere. It creates a very interesting context

for being able to reinvent yourself.

The third one is our companies, organizations, our workplaces: they are

constantly disrupted too. That creates opportunities, but also creates

challenges. We’ve seen a huge wave of layoﬀs recently in the tech world

for example. Now people in the ﬁnancial sector are struggling with high

interest rates and what that means for their products, and the list goes

on. We don’t stay in jobs as long as we used to, either by choice or by

necessity as we are asked to leave them.

And the fourth of the trends, and this one’s been going a long time,

is that what we expect out of a job has changed a lot. It used to be

providing a stable living. [Now] we want everything from our jobs.

We want passion, we want purpose. We want self-fulﬁllment. We want

ﬂexibility. We want so much from them, and we are increasingly

impatient, and wanting to move on if we don’t get those things.

ADI IGNATIUS:

If career reinvention, if the need for reinvention, is such a standard

aspect of the contemporary business world, why are we having so much

trouble still trying to carry it out?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

That’s the one thing I’ve learned, it’s really hard. It’s really hard, it takes

longer than people think. A couple of things. One is that most people

know what they don’t want to do anymore, but they don’t know exactly

what they want to do instead. And since they don’t have the answer,

and I’m going to come back to this, they don’t know what to do. They

don’t know how to search when they don’t know exactly what they’re

searching for. So that’s one.

Another one is, what we do is who we are. It’s such an important sense,

it’s a part of our identity. And even losing a job that we didn’t like is a

huge loss, because it was what we did, it was the people we spent time

with, it was what structured our time. We built up to that. We invested in

that. The sense of psychological loss is a big barrier.

The last is that increasingly, particularly from mid-career on, when we

change careers we’re moving into something diﬀerent. It’s not a linear,

more-of-the-same at a higher level. It’s something diﬀerent. And those

transitions, I call them under-institutionalized. What I mean by that is

that the steps are not clear, you don’t know how long it’s going to take.

You’re not doing it with other people in lock step. It’s not clear who the

role models are.

If you want to be a partner in a law ﬁrm, you know what the steps are. It

might be hard, but you know what the steps are and the timeframes. If

you’re a lawyer who wants to be, say, an entrepreneur in the arts, that’s

## under-institutionalized. There isn’t particularly an educational program

that you go to. Diﬀerent people move into that in very diﬀerent ways. It’s

not clear. It’s more uncharted. It’s unclear how to go about it.

ADI IGNATIUS:

So I want to come back to the ﬁrst point you talked about, which is that

we’re not that good at ﬁguring out what our possibilities are. I identify

with that. Most of the jobs I’ve had, somebody has come to me and said,

would you like to do X? And even when it’s a career shift, it’s like, I

didn’t think of it, somebody else did. It’s worked out ﬁne, I love my job.

But there’s a lack of agency that I think a lot of people feel in terms of

getting control what I want to do with my work life, with my career. Is

there advice on how to think clearly about possible next steps?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

I’ve got loads of it. One of the things is, we’ve got to get away from

thinking that if you don’t know the answer, if you don’t know the goal or

the target career, you should just wait and reﬂect until you’ve ﬁgured it

out in your head. That’s actually not how we ﬁgure it out.

It’s great when people come to you with propositions. It can be

dangerous too because sometimes those things are too close to what

you were doing already. And if you do want to make a change, they may

not be the best ﬁt.

Much more important than trying to ﬁgure it out is to experiment. And

instead of thinking, “What’s the one ideal job for me?”, [ask], “What

might be 10, or what might be six organizations, or what might be ﬁve

diﬀerent pathways I could take?” And start exploring them in parallel,

# simultaneously.

You learn as you go along. Sometimes the things you thought you

wanted don’t pan out to be. Or you dream them to be, for example.

Sometimes it’s harder and it takes longer. You’ve got to do something

# else in parallel.

The ﬁrst clear bit of advice and way of doing this successfully is to come

up with a list of possibilities. I call them your possible selves. And start

exploring one, two, ideally more than one, in parallel.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I had a conversation with a headhunter at one point, and they were

asking me about my job. I told them it ticks all my boxes. I feel

good about it. I feel like I’m doing something important. And I said,

“Everyone feels that, right?” And the person said nobody feels that.

If you’re in a situation like that, you’re very lucky. I’m interested

about the extent to which people feel satisﬁed in their work. How

much satisfaction can we expect from our work? It’s work and it’s not

necessarily our life, although it’s a part of it.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

From your experience and research, how many of us feel generally

satisﬁed in our jobs? Is it the norm or do we have to accept something

# less?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

The general surveys show a lot of dissatisfaction. That comes and goes,

there’s periods of that and there’s sectors. It’s important to think that a

job is not monolithic. I love my job, it ticks all my boxes too, but there’s

parts of my job I really don’t like, that feel like grunt work. There’s parts

I love, and every job is like that. It is a matter of proportion. It’s by and

large, are you mostly doing the things that you ﬁnd fulﬁlling?

There are lots of people out there who are not satisﬁed. They may have

been, but over time, either they have changed or their organization

has changed, or the people with whom they work have changed, and

they’re no longer happy about those elements. They don’t feel as

challenged. They don’t like and respect the people they work with. They

don’t align with the organization’s mission. All of those things create a

dissatisfaction. And my sense, from talking to my students, from doing

my research, is that there’s a lot of people who are dissatisﬁed out there

# today.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I want to build on that with a question that’s come in from Hassam

in Rotterdam. How do you envision the evolution of the “employee

experience” in a world increasingly dominated by hybrid work models?

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

HERMINIA IBARRA:

I do not have a crystal ball. I don’t know. All I know is that organizations

are still trying to ﬁgure it out. They’re still playing with diﬀerent ways

and trying to understand the employee experience. But that’s a question

I can’t answer.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Alright, here’s another question, this is from Ellie from Switzerland.

How should we think about the balance? If you switch careers, you

jeopardize some of the seniority you’ve built up, and the beneﬁts and

positives that you’ve accrued. How can we avoid that or how can we

think about that trade oﬀ?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

That’s another big question, am I going to have to start at the bottom? Or

is there a way not to do that? It depends on what you go on to do next,

# right?

One person I’ve been interviewing extensively over the last couple years was chief compliance oﬃcer at her organization, and she’s become

a documentary ﬁlmmaker. She had to start at the bottom, as an

apprentice. It depends.

Other people move into something that’s more adjacent, maybe doing it

more entrepreneurially. And they don’t have to, they can really leverage

the skillset and the experience that they’ve had, albeit in a very diﬀerent

role and setting. It depends a lot.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

People try to solve this by going back to school, and that can help a lot

by rounding you out. But what everyone forgets is that it’s not always up

and up. So you’re seeing, “Okay, I’m here. If I make a change, I’m going

to be here. Whereas I can continue moving up,” and that may well not be

# the case.

The world is changing, jobs are disappearing, and if you’re not happy

and productive in what you’re doing, the curve could well be declining

too, and you’ve got to take that into account.

ADI IGNATIUS:

The other topic that seems to be on everyone’s mind is AI. We’re always

wondering if technology will take our jobs. And sometimes it does.

With generative AI, we’re all asking about it with a heightened sense

# of concern.

Are you thinking about this, how this changes or accelerates everything

you’re thinking about?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

We’re thinking about it as an institution at London Business School. I’m

trying to use it as much as I can. I’m interested in how it’s changing

people’s jobs.

From my perspective, what I’m interested in is how it’s going

to transform how people work together. Who does what? What

organizations emerge? We don’t know the answers to those questions.

We know we need to be asking big questions about alignment with

values. We know, from the whole wave of digital transformation, that

there’s the technological part, but then there’s the whole other part,

which is how it’s used. Is the organization able to use it? Are people

able to adapt and make the most of it? All of those things remain to be

seen. But certainly, it is worth experimenting with, keeping an eye on it,

studying, asking the good questions.

ADI IGNATIUS:

So here’s a question related to technology. This is from Bhaskaran in

Bangalore. Bhaskaran says that after working for 21 years in HR they

decided to move to a smaller organization, expecting it to be nimble,

agile and all that. It turned out to be highly toxic. Bhaskaran longs for

a new role and organization, but has this constant fear of uncertainty.

How does one deal with this inevitable fear of uncertainty when one is

thinking about making a move?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

Completely understandable. Unfortunately, often the process of making

a career change can be one step forward, two steps back. Now you’ve

learned something, and I think part of what you’ve learned is that you

need to really research much more carefully the context you’re going

to, and get a ﬂavor of them as much as you possibly can. Now you’ve

learned to inquire much more about culture, to talk to the people, to

research the organization. All of that is really important.

It’s one of the reasons why, in studies I’ve done, oftentimes the

uncertainty of “I don’t know what I want, I don’t know how long this

is going to take,” starts to get at people. And then all of a sudden an

option comes up, an oﬀer, with this smaller, more nimble ﬁrm, and it’s

the savior. So they take it, because otherwise they’re still in the throes of

“What am I going to do?”, without researching it as much as they might.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

Without really asking, “What matters to me?” It’s really important to

# make time for that.

In any case, you’re out of there. And so, by necessity, you’re going to deal

## with uncertainty, but maybe research a bit more carefully.

ADI IGNATIUS:

We’re talking about two things. One is how to think about a career

transition moment, how to be proactive and smart about that. But then,

alright, you’ve made the move. How do you transition successfully into

# this new role?

I’d love to hear you talk a little bit more about that. We’ve made

the move from Company A to Company B. How long should we give

ourselves? How tough should we be on ourselves? Should we read The

First 90 Days? How do we transition successfully?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

The First 90 days remains the Bible on that topic. What he says to

start with, which also goes to the previous question, is the ﬁrst 90 days

actually starts way before, with doing your homework and talking to

people and ﬁnding out the stakeholders. There’s this lovely idea about,

I think it’s the ﬁve conversations that you need to be able to have

with your boss or whoever your key stakeholders are about what the

expectations are about how you’re going to be measured, about the key

topics, so that you’re going in recognizing the interdependence between

## your success and that of other people in the organization.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Let’s shift gears to talk about authenticity, another topic that you have

researched and written a lot about. Most conversations that I have about

leadership at some point evolve into a conversation about the need for

total authenticity at work. My sense is you have a more complicated take

on all this. How should leaders think about the authenticity question?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

This total authenticity stuﬀ drives me nuts. What is total authenticity?

Is it to say whatever crosses your mind? Is it to dress how you might

dress at home on a Sunday to go take a walk in the park? What does that

mean? I think there’s a lot of ﬂuﬀ in all of this. What’s the deﬁnition of

authenticity? Is it a trait? Is it an outcome, a process of learning about

yourself and trying to be as much yourself as possible?

I don’t think it’s a trait. I think it is a process of learning. We want to be

authentic. Nobody likes a fake. Nobody follows a fake. It’s bad for your

mental health. I’m all for it.

The question I ask is how can you deﬁne authenticity in a way that

doesn’t condemn you to being as you always have been? We grow, we

evolve. We’re multiple. We have diﬀerent facets, diﬀerent aspects of who

we are that play out. And we need to be able to express that complexity

and also ask, “What does it mean to be authentic when I’m learning?”

It’s great when it’s habitual behavior. You know how to do that. But

when you’re learning, you haven’t ﬁgured it out yet. People tend to

confuse habitual behavior with authenticity. The minute they’re out of

the comfort zone, “Oh, that’s not really me. I’m not so authentic.” The

comment usually is, “That’s not me.” Well, it’s not you now and you

haven’t tried it. And sometimes trying these things that help you to

learn, they feel inauthentic. And if that’s the price of learning, I think

it’s well worth paying it.

ADI IGNATIUS:

When some people talk about being authentic at work, I think they want

to be open about who they are, their personal life, maybe their sexual

orientation. If they have a kooky sense of humor, they want to be able to

bring that. On the one hand, absolutely, you need to learn new skills and

soft skills and hard skills. But people feel they would derive a deep sense

of happiness if they could be “authentic” at work in the ways that I was

talking about.

HERMINIA IBARRA:

For me, that’s much more about a sense of belonging and being able to

ﬁgure out, “Do I belong here or do I have to hide what’s important about

me in order to be eﬀective here?”

Back to bringing your whole self to work: workplace relationships are

relationships. And in relationships, people get to know each other. And

the minute that you meet somebody, you do not tell them everything

about you, your personal life, professional life, strengths, doubts,

anguishes, all this. You don’t do that. You get to know people.

It’s very important that we treat authenticity in that way. We’re building

relationships. And as we build relationships, we want to be able

to disclose. Self-disclosure is what builds relationships. That’s really

important, but it’s not about in every moment being able to broadcast

everything about myself in a way that doesn’t respect the building of

# relationships at work.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I think some of it is generational. My generation tended not to broadcast

everything. I think some of the subsequent generations are more

comfortable with that, expect that, and are comfortable with that.

And part of the intergenerational workplace dynamic is all of us being

# comfortable with that.

HERMINIA IBARRA:

The other thing about the complexity is that in the workplace we’re also

assessing each other for potential. Who’s going to do well, who’s going

to advance? We talk a lot about authenticity in the context of being able

to be vulnerable and to express vulnerability. But vulnerability doesn’t

get coded the same way when it’s expressed by a man versus a woman,

or assertiveness doesn’t get coded the same way when it’s expressed by a

Black person versus a white person. All of these complexities come into

play, which we really need to take into account because we each want to

put our best foot forward and be able to accomplish our goals within the

organizations where we work.

ADI IGNATIUS:

What is the ideal proﬁle of a leader in 2023? What are the skills or

experience you think matter most?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

You guys at HBR have been putting out the headlines on this, and

there’s a very common drumbeat, and it’s been on for a while, which is

about the importance of soft skills and people skills. We’ve been talking

about that for a long time. The pandemic accelerated that, and really

all the complexity of leading today, because ultimately what we’ve seen

in a really deep way is that the problems organizations face, they’re big

problems. They’re adaptive problems. That means there isn’t a simple

solution to them, and you need to harness everyone’s energy and brains

and hearts in order to solve them.

You really have to be able to get people on board, get them to tell you

what they think, get them to work outside their comfort zones, and all

that requires a set of people skills that most managers today who are

successful and who get to the top haven’t necessarily developed because

they have been rewarded for delivering results in any which way.

Delivering results is still important. What ends up happening is as

people get more senior and they start to look promising, they get a

lot of nudges, which is, it’s really time now to think about how to

cultivate this other side, which has more to do with how you connect

with people, how you bring out the best in them, how you create a

context in which there is psychological safety. All of that has become

much more important, not because it’s nice to have, but because the

requirements for learning in our organizations have become so much

# greater.

ADI IGNATIUS:

From your research, is your sense that many leaders have those skills or

that very few do?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

I’ve got a couple diﬀerent bases of knowledge on this. One is

the executives that I teach. They’ll all say, “I’m great at getting

accountability and driving results, and I’m a bit of a micromanager

and my coaching skills are not so great.” That’s my most common

proﬁle. As you probably know, we worked on this with a couple of

colleagues from Spencer Stuart, which led to an article last year, “The

Leadership Odyssey” in HBR, where we were able to use Spencer

## Stuart’s recruitment data for the C-Suite.

The way we framed it is most of the executives in succession processes,

candidates, had plenty of developmental opportunities when it came to

these people skills. We ended up having a look at how it is that they

come to recognize that it will really stand in the way of what they want

to accomplish if they don’t develop these skills and how they go about it.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One topic I want to make sure we speak about is networking.

Networking seems simple enough, but a lot of us struggle to even start to

build eﬀective and meaningful networks. Do you have thoughts on how

to do this better?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

A quick ad: a brand new article on HBR yesterday on the challenges of

networking as an executive. What is it that makes it particularly hard for

senior people to network who have their own challenges?

Anyway, this topic is of endless fascination to me, Adi, because I started

working on this in the 80s when I was doing my PhD research, and have

been following it since.

The headline is most of us are bad at it. Most of us are bad at it. Some

people are very good, but most of us are bad, and you can look to

social psychology to explain a big share of the why. The big share of the

why is that the way we are built, we are drawn to spontaneously build

relationships with people who are like us and with whom we bump into on a regular basis because their oﬃce is next door.

The way I summarize it is the mechanisms are similarity and proximity.

That’s what builds our networks. We’re narcissistic and lazy. We like

people like us. It’s easier to talk to them, and since we don’t have a lot of

time, we’re going to get to know the people who are easy to get to know

because they’re next door.

That means our networks are insular. They’re not good. They don’t help

us get new jobs. They don’t help us step up to bigger roles.

We’ve got to work on it, but working on it is really aversive too, and

you’ve published some great research on how that works. It makes us

feel a little bit dirty, a little bit disingenuous, a little bit utilitarian, using

people when we approach building relationships in a more strategic

way. It gets in the way of our sense of meritocracy. It gets in the way of

our sense of self-reliance, but we know from my research and that lots

of other people are vital for getting jobs, changing careers, and being

eﬀective and innovative as a leader in the roles which you have already.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Any tips on how to build a network that isn’t the person in the cubicle

# next to you?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

The tips are all really simple. Make an eﬀort, join a project, take

a course, use an extracurricular activity, make referrals, connect to

people, speak at events.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

Don’t do all of it all at the same time, but pick a few things. The thing

is we don’t make time for it because, just like in your example, you’re

waiting for stuﬀ to come to you. These are things that you need to take

the initiative on, but it’s very easy.

A great one is to just pick a few people you’ve lost track of, connect to

them, write to them, say, “Hey, I’m thinking about this. It’d be great to

catch up with you and have a conversation about it. How about it?” Very

easy to do. It’s just that we don’t.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I want to come back to one thing you talked about, which was constant

learning, constant adaptation. I think a lot of us are trained to get that

next job, and then we have it and we bring our old selves.

I thought it was interesting that you’re saying we need to continually

evolve and that authenticity is an elastic concept in that sense.

OK, we’re in a role as a leader, middle manager, whatever. How do we

adapt? How do we evolve? How do we not just get stuck in that routine

that we bring from day one? How do we keep evolving?

HERMINIA IBARRA:

There’s a life cycle to all of this. One thing I would say is you’ve just

started a new role. I wouldn’t worry about reinventing yourself. You’ve

been hired for who you are. Exploit that and make sure to connect to

the stakeholders and everything else, but you’re not looking to reinvent

yourself here. You’re really looking to leverage everything that you bring

# to that role.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Think Strategically About a Career Transition

What people forget is that expectations of you change quickly, and

environments also change quickly. The danger point is really more like

a year or two or three, depending on how fast-moving your situation is,

when you think you’ve got it covered, but people have stepped up in

their expectations of you or the environment has changed a lot.

What becomes really important here, the main thing I say to people is,

think about how you’re deﬁning your job, where you’re spending your

time, what you’re allocating time to, and can you think of it more as

a portfolio in which some slivers of your time you’re going to spend

learning new things, exploring new things, getting involved in projects

that give you a more strategic view of the organization, something

adjacent to what you normally do, but something that really allows you

to keep expanding the frontier as opposed to settling into a comfort

zone that’s going to make you much more vulnerable to the what-got-

# you-here-won’t-get-you-there phenomenon.

Working your network, people get comfortable. There’s a set of usual

suspects that you keep turning to, no fresh blood, and you become very

# insular in your views.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Herminia, we’re out of time, but I want to really thank you for being on

the show. It’s great to see you again and great to connect.

HERMINIA IBARRA:

# Thank you so much, Adi.
