marked by three echoes thatunderlie our interactions with each other:감사합니다. 죄송합니다. 사랑합니다.“Thank you. I’m sorry. I love you.”We say thank you because we believe that there is much to begrateful for. We say I’m sorry because we can always do better andbe better therefore it is our duty to find, in every situation, ourfaults and our own wrongdoings. And we say I love you becausewe, the small community that went through imperialistic

colonization, unwanted wars, and much foreign intervention,must look out for each other. Even in tough times, I was raised toempathize with others and to try to see the good in people.A renowned poet and essayist in Korea, Jung Min Cho, says in hispoem,

Human Is Gift, that those three echoes “cause miracles,”but when we don’t use them, they “become difficult anduncomfortable to use.”When I moved to the U.S. as a young adult, I heard a differentperspective. “

Stop apologizing,” my peers and professors said tome. “As women, we’re socialized to reflexively apologize from ayoung age, sometimes simply for taking up space. It’s a habit thatneeds to change.”I understood what they were saying: As women, we shouldn’thave to apologize for existing — in any space — but at the sametime, I wondered: Is the apology really the problem? Has sayingsorry ever hurt someone, made someone feel excluded, ordestroyed a community or relationship?While the topic is culturally nuanced, I do believe that having thecourage and compassion to make a

genuine apology is a distinctlynoble quality, no matter your gender. Can you not think of a timewhen you wished someone would just say sorry? Have youexperienced the healing an honest apology can bring?Apologizing is a complex and remarkable ability, one thatrequires

deep reflection, self-awareness,

empathy, and courage.Aren’t all those things we wish we saw more in the world today?

Now, when I’m shut down for saying sorry, specifically for sayingsorry because I’m a woman, I respond: “I don’t see my ability toapologize as a weakness. I think the world might be a kinder placeif people learned from us—the women who are brave and skilledenough to say sorry.”I ask you to consider this point of view. Maybe it’s time more of us

start apologizing—for the big and the little things—so there canbe less heartache, more reconciliation, and quicker restoration.When you have to cancel last minute on a friend, say sorry so theyknow you care about and consider their time. When you talk oversomeone in a meeting, say sorry so they know you value theirwords and ideas. When you hurt someone’s feelings, evenunintentionally, say sorry, because speaking the truth withcompassion can help them understand where you’re comingfrom. You can both gain closure and move on.Kindness and compassion are not things to be ashamed of. As wemove into the new year, I challenge us all to show more of them toourselves, and to each other. The world will be better for it.Recommended Reads
