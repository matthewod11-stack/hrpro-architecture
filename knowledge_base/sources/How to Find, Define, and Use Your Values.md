more conversations, the first group often realizes that they dohave some ideas about their values, and the second group realizesthat their values are mostly just a list of words without substance.Both reactions are valid — it’s not easy to have clarity around yourvalues. After all, the importance of identifying and using themisn’t emphasized in our society. Most of us aren’t taught how to dothis type of self-reflection in school. You likely won’t be asked toidentify your values for any job. And your employer will probablynever base your annual performance reviews on how you usethem.That doesn’t mean finding, defining, and knowing how to useyour values isn’t important. There is so much power inunderstanding what your values are — they can help you makedecisions, guide your career, and even live a happier life. Thesesteps can guide you in thinking about your values in anintentional way.Step 1: Find Your ValuesYour values aren’t hiding. Even if you haven’t vocalized them,they’re a reflection of the most important aspects of your life.Here’s how to pull those ideas to the forefront:1) Reﬂect on what’s important to you. “Values” is just a label weuse to contain the things that are important to us. Ask yourself:What do I care about the most in the world? Make a list with asmany things as you can think of. Your list should reflect what isimportant and personal to you, not what others (your family,friends, peers) may expect from you.

Honesty is critical at this stage. Try to sum up your ideas in as fewwords as possible. (You’ll expand and further define your valueslater.)

Some examples may include: family, money, comfort,friends, career, time, freedom, optimism.2) Review the list and pick your top three values. You’re probablythinking, But they’re all important! While they all might bedesirable, some are certainly more important to you than others.Again, honesty is key. If you’re struggling to select three, you canchoose two or four values instead. The number isn’t important —the intent here is to keep the list as short as possible.3) Rank your values. Once you have your top values, reflect on ifthey have equal meaning to you, or if you’re able to rank them.There is no right or wrong approach here. But your answer shouldtell you something about how important these different elementsare in your life.Remember: This isn’t a one-time exercise. It might take a coupleof weeks or months to stabilize your top values. Take the time toreflect and revise. When I did this exercise myself, it took mealmost a year to find and stabilize my values. Gradually, I realizedthat “happiness” and “fairness” are essential to me. Later, I added“freedom,” which was so engrained in me that I could not identifyit as quickly as the others. Keep an eye out for values that mayemerge or become important to you over time.Step 2: Deﬁne Your ValuesNow that you know your values, it’s time to define what theyreally mean to you in your own words. While you can look for thedictionary definition of your values, the answer probably won’t bethere. It’s important to come up with your own definition.

For example, with my value of freedom, there are many ways todefine it. Here is how I define it versus how one of my clientsdefines it:

My deﬁnition: Ability to do whatever I want, whenever I want,and however I want it. This applies at the macro level (e.g.,travel) and micro level (e.g., mental freedom).

My client’s deﬁnition: I want to have independence in myactions and decision-making and not be micromanaged.Same value, but two very different definitions.At first, you may be tempted to write long paragraphs for each ofyour values to justify or explain them. But try to keep yourdefinition as short as possible — you want to be able to easilyremember your values and how you define them. Just onesuccinct sentence will do. A test you can use to see if you’re on theright track is to ask yourself: If somebody were to wake me in themiddle of the night and ask me to define my values, could Ianswer?As you work to define your values, don’t be discouraged by thebroad nature of the words or let others influence your perspectiveon what they mean to you. When I declare that “happiness” is oneof my values, sometimes people roll their eyes. “That’s an emptyword,” they’ll say, or, “That’s too general.” But for me, this wordhas a crystal-clear definition: Happiness is the joy in the processof what you are doing.Big words, but precise and personal definitions.Step 3: Use Your Values

You’ll know you have identified your values and truly definedthem once you find yourself looking at the world around youthrough the framework of your values.This is where you’ll really start to see the power of knowing yourvalues. It simplifies decisions and actions. It can give you couragewhen you think you don’t have it. It can guide you and provideyou with valuable insights.Here are some examples of values in action:

If one of your values is fairness, this can guide you when youneed to give constructive feedback to a colleague or a directreport. It wouldn’t be fair to avoid confrontation when youknow the feedback would be helpful for them to know. It’s fairto be honest with them and give them a chance to improve orremedy the given situation.

If one of your values is optimism, you can better approachchallenging situations with a glass-half-full attitude. Did younot get the job? That’s ﬁne — you were able to practiceinterviewing and make some new connections. Are youoverwhelmed by a busy schedule? You’ll be OK — look at howmuch you’re learning from these new experiences.

If one of your values is family, that can help you make decisionsregarding your career or where you’d like to live. If you getoﬀered a job that would allow you to move closer to yourparents, you can feel excited in taking it over one based acrossthe country. If you’re wondering if you should quit your job thathas poor work-life balance, you can do so conﬁdently knowingit would give you more time to spend with your loved ones.

At first, it might be challenging for you to connect your dailyexperiences to your values, especially as they evolve and solidifyover time. One way to practice using your values is to reflect on asituation that’s frustrating you. Ask yourself: What is lurkingbehind my frustration? Is one of my values not being met?Another way you can practice is by reflecting on situations thatbring you joy. Which of your values is being fulfilled by thatactivity?Don’t expect to get clear on your values in one day. It will taketime. Depending on your journey, your values might stay constantover time or might change based on new events and information.Check in with yourself on a yearly basis to make sure you’re still intouch with the things that are most important to you. Andremember: This exercise will only help you if you’re 100% honestwith yourself.When will you know if you have deeply held values? When you’reunwilling to compromise on them.
