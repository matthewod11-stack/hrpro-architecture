Before the Color Labs photo-sharing app was launched, in 2011, its

developers raised $41 million from Sequoia Capital, Silicon Valley

## Bank, Bain Capital, and other investors—an extraordinary amount for

a startup that hadn’t even released a product. In less than a year, the app

surpassed one million downloads on Apple’s App Store. But its success

was short-lived. Users began complaining about Color Labs’ lack of

features, technical problems, and poor user experience. But, rather than

tweaking the app to address those issues, Color Labs remained focused

on signing up more users. Usage plummeted. By December 2012—and

## with $25 million of funding capital still unspent—Color Labs’ investors

and board members voted to cease operations.

Where did Color Labs go wrong? Most analysts concluded that its

massive early funding worked against it, creating pressure for the

company to scale up quickly instead of reﬁning the product. To put

it another way, Color Labs shifted too quickly from experimentation to

exploitation—and its large early investment probably played a major

# part in that.

The company’s failure illustrates that when startups receive funding can have as big an impact on innovation as how much funding they get does.

Some research has shown that ﬁnancial constraints can beneﬁt startups

by forcing them to be scrappy and resourceful. But other studies on the

eﬀects of startup capital have gotten conﬂicting results, and researchers

don’t fully understand exactly how or why the timing and size of ﬁrst

investments inﬂuence a venture’s subsequent moves.

decided to study this issue, they opted to focus speciﬁcally on how early

funding aﬀected ﬁrms’ ability to develop unique technical innovations. “We wanted to conduct this research because we were always baﬄed

by prior studies that said being constrained is actually very good for

startups,” says Roche. “How can not having a lot of cash be a good

# thing?”

Using data from the market research ﬁrm PitchBook and the data

analytics company BuiltWith, Ketkar and Roche recorded information

on 11,853 U.S. tech companies (most of which were creating apps

and websites) founded from 2010 to 2019. First they identiﬁed when

each company’s earliest funding arrived and how big the round was.

Then they set out to analyze how those factors inﬂuenced subsequent

# innovation.

To measure how innovative companies were, the researchers looked

at how unconventional the combinations of technologies used to

make each startup’s product were compared with those of other

ﬁrms in its industry. For instance, a ﬁrm using Microsoft Azure (a

## cloud provider), Amazon RDS (a relational database), and Tableau

## (data visualization software)—components of a popular tech stack—

would be considered more conventional and less innovative than

a ﬁrm combining lesser-known products such as DigitalOcean,

CockroachDB, and Metabase. The researchers say companies using

more-novel technology combinations tend to create more-innovative

and -functional products. Previous research had measured innovation

using metrics such as patent ﬁlings, but because ﬁling a patent is a

cumbersome process and many startups never seek patent protection,

the ways ﬁrms combine technologies is a more relevant measure, the

researchers say, noting that breakthrough products such as the iPhone

came about primarily from combining existing technologies in novel

# ways.

The researchers drew several conclusions from their analysis. First,

the later that startups receive their ﬁrst round of funding, the more

likely they are to keep experimenting after the money arrives. Second,

startups that receive a bigger investment use more technologies after

cashing the check but combine them in less unusual ways, signaling

reduced experimentation. Last, the track record of the investors

(including whether they exited past investments through IPOs or

acquisitions by other ﬁrms) aﬀects how much companies continue

experimenting after launch, and the timing and size of the ﬁrst

investment can impact how long a startup survives.

“Although earlier (and/or higher) availability of funding may ease

survival pangs during a ﬁrm’s infancy, it also may diminish the need to

## experiment and search for technological combinations that constitute

an innovative product,” the researchers write. “This situation also may

preclude ﬁrms from developing innovation-oriented capabilities early

in their lifecycle and thereby stymie later innovation as well.”

Roche recommends that entrepreneurs who build products using

technology ask the following questions before taking on a new investor:

Does the investor share your appetite for experimentation? Startups

that wait, or are forced to wait, to accept funding aren’t constrained

by investor oversight and the need for immediate success, Roche says.

They can test and pivot without having to prove viability or growth

potential. Experimentation then becomes part of the company’s DNA,

which ultimately propels ﬁrms to be more innovative. “Firms that don’t

accept early funding can aﬀord to wait and experiment until they ﬁnd

the innovation that separates them from the competition,” Roche says.

Roche recommends ﬁnding an investor who values experimentation

and tolerates risk as much as you do. Early investment from large

institutions that demand immediate or short-term ﬁnancial results will

# likely cease or limit experimentation.

Is there a strategic ﬁt? Roche advises startups to consider the investor’s

preferred exit strategy, whether it be acquisition, IPO, or allowing

the startup to keep growing as a proﬁtable, stand-alone company.

The investor’s ultimate goals can signiﬁcantly impact the startup’s

growth trajectory and operational decisions. Investors seeking a near-

term IPO are more likely to push for quicker results over constant

# experimentation.

Startups should also consider how hands-on investors will be. Do

they want to select the technology you use? Or are they content to

provide strategic guidance? How innovative your company becomes

is ultimately dependent on how open it is to change. Micromanaging

investors can close ﬁrms oﬀ to it.

Has the investor helped other innovative startups? Roche advises

entrepreneurs to think about a potential investor’s reputation,

## capabilities, and possible inﬂuence on the company’s direction.

Experienced tech investors have probably worked with resource-

constrained startups that must balance growth against innovation.

They are more likely to encourage experimentation and scrappiness

than ﬁrst-time investors or investors who don’t have experience with

# technology companies.

“The experience and approach of investors can signiﬁcantly impact

a startup’s ability to remain ﬂexible, innovative, and unconventional,

even when they receive large amounts of funding,” says Roche. “Who

you allow to invest in your company is a strategic decision that can stop

# innovation in its tracks.”

## “A Large Investor Would Have Cut Their Losses”

Josh Walker is the cofounder and CEO of Sports Innovation Lab, a Boston-

based AI company founded in 2017 that provides fan intelligence, insights,

and analytics to brands and sports properties. He recently spoke with

HBR about the company’s early struggles and how they drove his team

to innovate. Edited excerpts of that conversation follow.

What was the original idea for Sports

# Innovation Lab?

Initially, we focused on evaluating and

teaching sports organizations about

# various technologies, such as wearables

and immersive media. Our business model

revolved around offering memberships

# to clients. But during the pandemic, we

faced significant challenges. We lost 30%

of our clients from March 15 to March 16,

# Bryan Derballa

- 2020. We then pivoted to hosting virtual

events to maintain engagement with our

## market through a period of uncertainty for

the sports and entertainment industries. The events were opportunities

for clients and prospects to ask us about specific sports technology and

how sports organizations approached and used technology in a broader,

categorical sense. We were surprised to learn that our clients needed

insights into fan demographics and behaviors more than they needed to

understand sports technology. So, we shifted our focus to investing in fan

data to help our clients make more-informed decisions about marketing,

## engagement strategies, and technology investments.

How did your choice of early investors give you flexibility to pivot like

# that?

We wanted to find the right relationships at the earliest stages. We weren’t

focused on how much money we could raise; we wanted people we knew

and people who knew us. Our first investor was a family friend who

gave us about $500,000 in seed capital to get the company started. Our

second investor had a personal relationship with me and my cofounder

(and Harvard alum), Angela Ruggiero. This investor provided the first million

dollars of our second round of funding in 2021, following the pandemic.

Both investors were betting on the founding team rather than the specific

product we were building or the technologies we were using. When you

have personal relationships with investors, they tend to trust you. They care

about your ideas. Our early investors believed in our team. They trusted

us enough to follow us down the path we decided to take to better our

# business.

Did the shift in business model pay off immediately?

No. This was a significant change in our business model, and it took

some time. Even back then, our chief technology officer was experimenting

with things like building a ChatGPT for sports. He was scraping research

articles and modeling pattern recognition so that we could surface the most

relevant information for our clients. We didn’t have a way to monetize it

while he was experimenting with it, but we knew that data analysis, AI, and

pattern recognition would all be important for the future of our business.

Wouldn’t a heavily funded Sports Innovation Lab have come to the

# same realization?

We may not have made it to that point. A large investor would have cut

their losses. They are more willing to write a company off if it doesn’t

have a track record. In our case, we lost a third of our clients early in

our company journey. A massive investment firm would not have had the

patience to continue investing with us after that. But because we had

strong relationships with our investors, they stayed with us until we turned

# the business around.

What advice would you give innovation-focused startups seeking early

# investments?

First-time entrepreneurs should be cautious about taking large amounts

of capital too soon. Avoid a high valuation without revenue to back it

up. This can create significant pressure to deliver rapid growth and big

returns. It also results in equity dilution for your founding team and early

investors, which reduces your control over the company’s direction. High

valuations also create unrealistic expectations from investors. This can

lead to increased scrutiny and pressure, potentially causing management

changes or strategic shifts that may not benefit your company. I suggest

seeking substantial investments only after you have proven your ability to

# sell and renew contracts.
