## Paul, a high-level executive in a technology company, former

university professor, and expert in his ﬁeld, attended a prestigious trade

conference. Paul prides himself on having a learning mindset and felt at

home surrounded by leading industry experts. He was eagerly engaged,

asking questions about the latest trends and technologies to broaden his

understanding and take in the expertise around him.

However, a fellow attendee’s offhand comment during a break caught Paul oﬀ guard: “Your questions are great. It reminds me of my early

days when everything was a learning opportunity.” They were making

an assumption — that Paul was a beginner rather than a seasoned

# professional.

The comment triggered a moment of introspection for Paul. He realized

that his approach, meant to demonstrate openness and a desire to

learn, might cast shadows on his perceived experience and authority.

Recalling similar reactions at various gatherings, Paul confronted a

paradox: Could his learning mentality, while enriching his knowledge,

inadvertently diminish his stature in the eyes of his peers?

Although it’s widely accepted that good leaders are good learners, a

learning mentality can also have a darker side. If not carefully managed, it might lead to a perception of decreased eﬀectiveness, less expertise, and lower eﬃciency.

The results of Paul’s 360-degree feedback provided the conﬁrmation he

needed to realize that his learning mindset, although well intentioned,

had cemented a perception of a person who was indecisive, passive

aggressive, and less competent. When I asked his stakeholders what that

looked like, the answer was unanimous: He asks too many questions.

So, how can you keep your learning mentality from getting in the way of

your growth and tarnishing others’ perception of you?

## The Unintended Consequences of a Learning Mentality

Like Paul, many leaders with an ingrained learning mentality are

## sometimes oblivious to the signals their frequent question-asking sends.

Here are three ways stakeholders might misperceive your inquisitive

learning behavior:

- 1. Decreased effectiveness Eﬀective leaders are expected to foster collaboration and productivity within their teams. When a leader’s learning approach appears to be overbearing or overly inquisitive, it can be perceived as less eﬀective.

A leader’s constant questioning can also make team members feel

scrutinized and judged, leading to a defensive posture rather than an

## open and collaborative one and ultimately harming innovation and

# collaboration.

- 2. Undermined expertise

Leaders need to exude conﬁdence and demonstrate their expertise

to maintain their authority in a subject matter. In corporate cultures

where conﬁdence is equated with having answers, a leader’s persistent

questioning can be perceived as a lack of self-assurance in their

# expertise.

In Paul’s case, his well-intentioned eﬀorts to learn and gain insights by

asking questions without providing context gave the impression that

he lacked expertise. Paul tended to pose overly broad questions (for

example, “What are the current trends in our industry?” or “How do

you see our product evolving?”) without explaining his reasoning or

connecting them to a speciﬁc challenge or opportunity. His questions

lacked depth, and it’s depth that gives authority and credibility.

- 3. Lower efﬁciency Eﬀective leaders must balance learning with decisive action to maintain eﬃciency. Constantly questioning and seeking more information can

be perceived as indecisiveness and delay decision-making. Trying

to understand and learn all angles might lead to analysis paralysis, harming both eﬃciency and career advancement.

## How to Shift Others’ Perception of Your Learning Mentality

Your learning mentality should be the catalyst for your personal growth

and development — not a reason for others to question your leadership.

For your inquisitiveness to be viewed as an asset, it should be perceived

not just as mere learning, but as a way to gather knowledge, add value, communicate eﬀectively, and make decisions quickly.

Here are ﬁve strategies to ensure your stakeholders’ perception of you

# aligns with your intentions.

# Communicate purpose and context

Providing context for your inquiries and sharing your learning goals can

help prevent misinterpretations. Clear, strategic communication is key

to managing this learning mentality challenge. Before asking questions

in meetings or discussions, brieﬂy explain your rationale and what you

hope to achieve. This will position your questions as purposeful and

# strategic.

Instead of: Asking questions without context, providing stakeholders

the opportunity to wonder about your intentions and react defensively…

Try: Always disclosing your intentions and context. For example, “I’m

asking this to understand how I can align my actions with yours and

ensure I consider your point of view.”

Integrate learning with execution Eﬀective leaders tie new skills and knowledge directly to achieving

results. You must balance the pursuit of knowledge with the imperative

of action. By tying what you learn to speciﬁc work your team does, you

add depth to your contributions and instill a sense of conﬁdence in your

ability to deliver results.

Instead of: Discussing new knowledge and skills broadly with your

team, potentially causing confusion about whether and how your team

should put them to use…

Try: Focusing on speciﬁc aspects of your new knowledge or skills that

are directly relevant to a project’s success. In team meetings, share

insights from your learning that directly impact the project’s next

steps, emphasizing how this new knowledge streamlines execution and

# decision-making.

# Demonstrate expertise with conﬁdence

The way you position your questions signiﬁcantly impacts how people

perceive your knowledge. Framing your inquiries to reﬂect what you

know will signal conﬁdence in your expertise. Thoughtfully craft

questions to make your knowledge visible to others while helping

them connect with and build upon your insights. You’ll not only

demonstrate your expertise but also foster meaningful engagement and

# collaboration.

Instead of: Asking basic questions, such as “How do you see Y evolving

over the next year?” or undermining your own expertise by prefacing

remarks with “This might be a simple question, but…”

Try: Posing the question in a way that highlights your deep

understanding of the subject and contributes value to the discussion.

For example, “Considering trends A and B in Y, how do you see Y

evolving over the next year?”

# Be decisive

To reassure stakeholders of your competence and leadership

capabilities, it’s critical to display conﬁdence in your knowledge and

decisiveness in your actions while signaling an open mind and inclusive

leadership style. After soliciting input and exploring options, set a self-

imposed deadline to act promptly. Share your thought process and

the reasons behind your decisions to underscore your leadership and

decisiveness, even as you continue to value learning and input from

# others.

Instead of: Continuously seeking more opinions and delaying

decisions, causing the team to feel uncertain and question your

# decisiveness…

Try: Listening to the team’s input and self-imposing a deadline to make

a decision. For example, announce, “I will consider all your feedback

and make a ﬁnal decision by Friday at noon.” Then, clearly decide

the implementation strategy and explain your thought process: “After

evaluating all the options and considering your valuable feedback, we

will proceed with Strategy A because it aligns best with our goals

and resources. Here’s how we will implement it…” This approach

demonstrates your decisiveness and conﬁdence, instilling trust and

# clarity within the team.

Foster a culture of shared learning

Cultivate an environment that values learning as a collective endeavor

rather than a personal pursuit. This approach can mitigate perceptions

## of overambition or competition and enhance collaborative inﬂuence.

Encourage team learning sessions where knowledge and insights are

shared openly. Recognize and reward contributions to the team’s

learning, making it clear that everyone’s individual growth is valued

and beneﬁts the group.

Instead of: Asking learning questions during regular meetings, which

can disrupt the ﬂow and focus of the meeting and put team members on

the defensive or cause them to question your meeting preparation…

Try: Introducing a monthly learning session where team members are

encouraged to present on something new they’ve learned, related or unrelated to their current projects. You kick oﬀ the ﬁrst session. For

example, “I’ve recently explored how X can improve our workﬂows,

which might seem daunting at ﬁrst, but here’s how it can be practically

applied…” This method promotes a supportive atmosphere for learning

and sharing, enhancing the team’s cohesion and collaborative spirit.

. . .

A learning mentality is undoubtedly a valuable trait for personal and

professional growth. Yet, as we’ve explored, it can have a dark side.

Every strength, if overused, becomes a liability. By positioning the why

behind your learning, you can shift how people perceive your most

valuable leadership strength. After all, the world belongs not to those

who know the most, but to those who learn the fastest. Embrace a

balanced approach to learning and execution to ensure that your quest

for knowledge enhances your leadership and drives success.
