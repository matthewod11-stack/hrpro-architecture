# Team Leaders Need Better Data, Faster

They’re the ones who have the real power to change things. by Marcus Buckingham

## Study performance inside any organization and one ﬁnding leaps

out at you. It’s one of those revelations that is at once obvious and

surprising, the sort of discovery that’s as clear as day, and yet makes

you realize that you’ve never seen it written about in the business press.

This discovery is range—that is, variation in performance between two

teams in the same organization doing precisely the same kind of work.

Whether that performance is measured as per-person productivity,

## quality, employee engagement, customer satisfaction, accidents on

the job, or lost workdays—and even if you study highly controlled

## environments, such as retail or manufacturing, in which each “team”

has been carefully constructed to do exactly the same job in exactly the

## same way—you still ﬁnd signiﬁcant range in the performance metrics.

Books such as The Toyota Way and How Google Works lead us to believe

that organizations are monolithic—they have one business model, or

one company culture, and this model and this culture explain why

certain organizations are successful and others aren’t. But while, on one

level, you know that it must surely feel diﬀerent to work at Pixar than

## in, say, the federal government, on another more personal level, you

know that your day-to-day experience of working is forged locally, by

the actual activities of your own job, by the support of your teammates,

and by the feelings of purpose, progress, and personal success created in

your team. And of course, the creator of all of these feelings is your local

# team leader.

Your team leader is the one who makes the diﬀerence. If your

organization wants high performance and engagement—or, for that matter, collaboration, innovation, quality, eﬃciency, and agility—then

these things are created in the context of a team and a team leader, or

they are not created at all. This variation in team-level data reminds us

that the most important decision an organization makes on any subject

is not strategy, marketing messaging, or capital allocation. It is who you

make team leader. As goes the team leader, so goes everything.

Intuitively, we all know this. Many of us have worked for a great

company with a rotten boss, and, sadly, seen the rotten boss trump

the great company. So you might have thought that our people systems

—those tools and processes that address performance and engagement

inside an organization—would all focus on serving the team leader. And

yet they don’t. Look closely and you realize that our entire suite of

people systems misses its most important audience.

Take employee engagement as an example. Engagement happens, or

fails to happen, in the context of a team. The company can provide

the support and the tools, but the actual experience of working in a

company is in the hands and mind of each team leader. It is surprising

then to see most employee engagement programs deliver survey data

in the following sequence: ﬁrst the data go to HR, where they are

poured over, vetted, and cleaned; then they are presented to senior

management where patterns are explained and improvements over the

previous year celebrated; and then ﬁnally, oftentimes months after

the data were collected, they are cascaded down to team leaders …

where, inevitably and justiﬁably, the data are dismissed as too stale,

## too abstract, the broad organizational patterns irrelevant. Even some

of the newer self-serve survey tools, which allow data to be collected

and shared more frequently, are still designed to deliver that data to the

## organization’s executives and the HR function.

If we are interested in actually building engagement in our

organizations, rather than merely measuring it year over year, then we

need to redesign our system so that it delivers real-time data to the right

# audience: team leaders.

The same applies to performance management. As with engagement

## systems, the intended audience for most performance management

systems is the organization, not the team leader. The organization’s

goals are set at the beginning of the year; these goals are then

segmented into “buckets,” which are cascaded down through the

ranks. Team leaders throughout the organization are required to place

## their own personal goals into one of the required buckets, their team

members do the same, with completion percentages and ratings handed

out during the year. In theory, this nested-goals approach is sensible,

## in that in oﬀers the promise of perfect organizational alignment. The

reality is quite diﬀerent. In reality, each individual team member’s goals

are so darned individual, so speciﬁc to each team member’s strengths,

needs, and oft-changing circumstances, that team leaders struggle to

place one team member’s actual goals into one of the static buckets,

let alone to record reliably their completion percentage. The result is

a kabuki-like process in which everyone goes through the motions of

alignment, but none of it addresses what is most pressing to team

leaders: namely, how to get actual work done with a speciﬁc team

# member in the real world.

Moving forward, performance management systems should be designed

to address the practical concerns of team leaders. Once broad

organizational priorities have been communicated, the team leader’s

chief concerns are simply: a) what are the strengths and capabilities of

each team member? and b) how can I focus each person on the right

outcomes this week, and the next? It will be a challenge to design tools

that are simple, agile, and ﬂexible enough to support team leaders in

answering these questions, but it will be impossible if we don’t keep in

mind whom the tools are actually for.

Challenging though it may be, the wonderful thing about designing

performance and engagement tools for the team leader is that they will

be constantly in use, and as a result will generate real-time and reliable

data from within the team. This is the brass ring for any organization

—to be able to see, right now, which teams are most productive and

engaged, and which aren’t. At present it lies beyond our grasp. Our

once-a-year ratings and surveys, deployed by and for the organization,

provide no insight into what is going on inside each team. Ask the

senior executives in your organization: “Today, which are our most

productive and engaged teams?” They are forced to guess. They have no

## data, no real-time and reliable measures of team-level performance and

engagement, no line of sight into what’s happening inside their most

## important organizational units—the teams.

This blinkered approach is a risky way to run a business. And it doesn’t

have to be this way. Design your tools expressly for team leaders, and

suddenly your organization will see.
