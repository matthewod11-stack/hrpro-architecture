There is a large group of employees at nearly every company that have

much to contribute to organizations, but may need thoughtful policies

to thrive. Supporting this group is integral to DEI, loyalty, and retention

goals, and yet few companies even track their status. The group I’m

talking about is caregivers.

## HBR / Digital Article / 5 Things Employers Get Wrong About Caregivers at Work

They are the fastest growing workplace identity group, and they make

up around 73% of the workforce. “Caregiver” is a broad term on purpose

— it includes parents, those caring for elderly family members, and

those supporting a sick or disabled child, sibling, or spouse. Through my

work as a journalist and consultant on caregiver issues in the workplace,

I see again and again that companies have serious blindspots about

their caregiver population and regularly make assumptions that can

undermine their stated values and goals — along with their bottom line.

Here are ﬁve big misconceptions I’d like to debunk in order for

companies to better understand the realities of their employee

caregivers so that they can make smart policies to support them.

Myth #1: School and childcare are “back to normal.”

Employers need to better understand the huge logistical care challenges

that employees may be facing daily. Before the pandemic, childcare

facilities were expensive and hard to ﬁnd, and public school was

completely out of sync with the realities of working parents. Sadly,

things are now far worse for everyone, making it harder than ever to

solve the care jigsaw puzzle.

## According to The Center for American Progress, 88,000 workers have

left the daycare industry since the start of the pandemic, in large part

due to low pay. For example, in North Carolina the entire state is

deemed a “childcare desert.” In some areas of the state, waitlists for an

## infant daycare spot average around one year, and for every 100 children

born, there are less than 20 licensed daycare spots.

But staﬀ shortages aren’t just an issue for daycares catering to

children under ﬁve. In addition to teacher vacancies, public schools

are experiencing huge problems with the support staﬀ that enables the

school system to provide safe custodial care. According to Axios, about

88% of schools nationwide are dealing with bus driver shortages, which

makes transportation unreliable and leads to long route times when

the buses do show up. After-school care is facing similar struggles. This summer, EdWeek predicted “a perfect storm of funding and staﬃng

crises” for after-school programs. This prediction bears out. In my city

of Durham, North Carolina, there were over 700 kids on the after-school

## waitlist at the start of the 2022 school year.

Employers must understand that employees who rely on private

daycare and public school to do their jobs are facing near constant,

## unpredictable care conﬂicts through no personal fault of their own.

For a single mom of a 6-year-old who could only get after-school care

Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, the requirement that everyone come into the oﬃce Tuesday and Thursday, no exceptions, could send her looking for a new job. And expecting an oﬃcial clock-in time at 9 AM for

remote workers may unnecessarily penalize the dad who, at a moment’s

notice, must rush across town to drop his kids oﬀ at school because the

bus never came to get them.

Not supporting employees through the hardship of the current care

landscape and its unpredictability can lead to more burnout and

attrition. Evaluating ﬂexibility and hybrid policies through a caregiver

lens is helpful, and providing access to backup care services can ease

# some of these ongoing stressors.

Myth #2: All it takes to have “inclusive care policies” is giving dads paternity leave.

Workplace family leave policies have evolved a lot over the last decade,

## with more gender neutral language and the inclusion of same-sex

parents and adoptive and foster parents, which are all wonderful

changes. However, family leave policies often laser focus on welcoming

a new child, when they instead should be much broader to include other

kinds of caregiving needs beyond those of brand new parents.

A 2019 Harvard Business School report on caregiving found that while

welcoming a child was a top caregiving reason people left their jobs,

next on the list was caring for a sick child (49%) or managing a child’s

daily needs (43%). A third of people who left their position due to

caregiving cited eldercare as the reason, and almost 25% cited an ill

or disabled family member. The lack of supportive policies around a

range of caregiving life events can be costly for companies. According

to The Council on Aging, “70% of caregivers [who do eldercare] suﬀer work-related diﬃculties due to their dual roles…annually, employees

lose up to $3 trillion in wages and beneﬁts while employers lose $17-33

billion due to absenteeism and turnover.”

Creating paid family leave policies that can be used for a broad set of

reasons, including supporting family members’ physical and mental

health needs, and encouraging people to use the beneﬁt can help

improve loyalty, reduce burnout, and save on costly turnover.

Myth #3: Those who choose flexible work are less interested in advancement.

New data shows that women, people of color, and caregivers are more

likely to want to choose forms of ﬂexible and remote work. According

to Lean In’s 2022 State of Women in The Workplace report, “Only 1

in 10 women want to work mostly on-site, and many women point to

remote and hybrid work options as one of their top reasons for joining

or staying with an organization. Women of color and women with

disabilities are about 1.5 times as likely to experience demeaning and

‘othering’ microaggressions when they work mostly on-site as opposed

to mostly remotely.”

In order to more fairly and accurately value all employees, we need

to examine some of our ingrained biases. A pre-pandemic study from Stanford randomly assigned employees to be in oﬃce or remote. Those

working oﬀsite were actually 13% more productive, but they were

promoted half as often. Proximity bias is very real, with a recent study

from the Society for Human Resource Management showing that 42%

of supervisors confess to sometimes forgetting about remote workers

when assigning tasks. If companies are not actively training managers

on these issues and working to support remote workers, their talent

pipeline will become an open drain of women, people of color, and

# caregivers.

Myth #4: Caregiving isn’t talked about much at our office, so it must not be an issue.

Many people are not comfortable sharing about their caregiving

responsibilities in the workplace because they are worried about being

penalized professionally. Only 56% of caregivers report that their

work supervisor is even aware of their caregiving responsibilities. The

## Deloitte University Leadership Center for Inclusion report, Uncovering

Talent, reveals that 61% of all employees minimize their identities

that make them “diﬀerent” in some way, which can look like silently

struggling through a frantic work week while your child’s daycare is

closed due to Covid, or saying to coworkers you are going to the dentist

when you are really driving your father to his chemo appointment.

Unfortunately, mothers in particular are right to be concerned that their

family responsibilities might be held against them. Anti-mom bias has

been long-rampant in the workplace.

The best way for leaders to create more transparency around caregiving

is by starting to talk about it themselves. If you leave early on Thursdays

because you lead your child’s Scout troop, rather than just having

the time blocked on your calendar as “busy,” share the reason you are unavailable. Rather than saying you’ll be out of the oﬃce for “a

family trip,” be honest that you are taking time oﬀ work to help your

mother move into assisted living. Leaders showcasing that they have

personal lives and care responsibilities can have a huge impact in what

employees feel is “OK” to talk about at work.

Myth #5: If there was a problem with our policies, we’d know about it.

Companies rarely put eﬀort into evaluating policies unless something

prompts them to do so. In a labor market with a low unemployment

level, individual employees might rather leave their job than put in the

extra and often uncompensated work of pointing out policy ﬂaws and

going out on a limb to advocate for changes.

According to research from The Rosalynn Carter Institute, close to one

third of caregiver employees have chosen to leave a job at some point

because of their caregiving responsibilities. If someone says in their

exit interview they are leaving “to spend more time with their kids”

or “have more ﬂexibility to help with their elderly mother,” jumping

to the conclusion that this decision was purely personal can obscure

what the company could have done to better support the employee, and

what policies might have made it possible for them to stay on the job

## and thrive. (The authors of Harvard Business School’s Caring Company

report have an excellent chart, Figure 15, on the self-perpetuating cycle

that leads to caregivers getting overlooked by companies in this way.)

One way companies can start proactively addressing active issues for

caregivers, rather than just trying to stop the bleeding of costly attrition,

is by investing strongly in Employee Resource Groups as part of overall

DEI initiatives. I’m hearing more and more about employees starting

caregiver-speciﬁc ERGs, or expanding their women’s or parents’ ERGs

to include all caregivers.

So what does investing in ERGs look like? For starters, give these

## groups budgets, access to development and training, and compensate

employees for this work through bonuses, raises, and/or factoring the

work into their performance reviews. For ideas on how to do this, check

out The Parents in Tech Alliance’s new open-source database. I also

recommend giving ERGs regular access to company leaders. Welcome

them to make meaningful suggestions for the organization. Don’t think

of ERGs as an inconsequential social club, but as having the potential to

be a highly eﬀective focus group that lets your company know its blind

spots and helps come up with ideas for solving them. Plus, they double

## as a cost-eﬀective recruitment and retention tool.

If you aren’t convinced that your organization needs to think more

deeply about its caregivers right now, consider this your wake-up call

to start proactively planning for the future. In a few years, the tsunami

of eldercare responsibilities employees will face as their Baby Boomer

parents and relatives age may be drowning them. According to the

U.S. Census, the 2030s will mark the ﬁrst time in U.S. history that the

number of people 65 and older will be more than people under 18. This

makes building up your company’s care infrastructure a smart business

decision to get the most out of a strong and diverse group of employees

today and for decades to come.
