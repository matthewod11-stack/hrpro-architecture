When a major U.S.-based ﬁnancial institution needed help with an

organization-wide transformation, they turned to Debora, a seasoned

executive coach and change consultant. The institution was grappling

with technological disruption, shifting customer expectations, and

mounting regulatory pressures, and they viewed their transformation

## program as the natural solution to these challenges.

Upon arrival, Debora spent time talking with employees across all

levels, many of whom described their post-transformation workplace in

a negative light, using such terms as “war room” and “Hunger Games.”

The ﬁndings from a recent company pulse survey reinforced what she

had heard: Although employees understood why change was needed,

they felt they were already stretched too thin to take on any new

# initiatives.

Debora had arrived ready to coordinate initiatives across the

organization’s existing transformation program. But she soon realized

that a more-fundamental change was in order: The company’s program

needed a set of strategies that could be tailored to each department’s

speciﬁc challenges and constraints. Without such tailoring, even sound

transformation initiatives might falter or backﬁre.

We are HR strategy advisors and professors who have studied

## transformations across industries for more than 15 years, and in

doing so we’ve regularly encountered the situation faced by Debora:

## Organizations launch well-planned change initiatives with the best of

intentions but then struggle to achieve their goals.

To understand why this happens so often, we conducted a large-scale

study that spanned several years and surveyed over 4,300 employees

across 20 organizations. That work provided us with deep insights into

the underlying challenges that organizations face when embarking on

transformation initiatives. Building on those insights, we designed a

ﬁve-step process to drive successful transformation initiatives. Debora’s

request to bring data-driven precision to her work at the ﬁnancial

institution presented the perfect opportunity to pilot our approach

— which she did with great success. Her work not only encouraged

more adaptability and collaboration but also demonstrated promising

ﬁnancial potential. The pilot achieved a return of more than 200% on

the change-management investment. Impressed by these results, the

organization asked Debora to extend the ﬁve-step process throughout

the entire organization. In this article, we’ll brieﬂy sum up the process.

## Aligning Strategies and Motivation Styles

Many leaders attempting transformation initiatives fail in three ways.

First, they don’t clearly deﬁne the type of change their organization

or departments are facing, which means they can’t clearly deﬁne

their speciﬁc objectives. Second, they often apply a one-size-ﬁts-all

strategy to their situation and don’t assess what sort of balance it calls

## for between exploration (innovating and risk-taking) and exploitation

(optimizing existing processes). And third, they don’t consider who will

drive the change and how employees’ diﬀering skills and readiness for

change will aﬀect success.

Our research has revealed that underlying these failures lies a crucial

factor: Motivation styles are the hidden drivers of change initiatives.

Building on the work of Heidi Grant and E. Tory Higgins (see their

HBR article “Do You Play to Win — or to Not Lose?”), we’ve identiﬁed

three key styles: Play to Win (thriving on growth and opportunity), Play

Not to Lose (valuing stability and caution), and Balanced (seeking the

middle ground). These styles aren’t merely about skills — they reﬂect

how employees are inherently wired for change.

Aligning change strategies with employee motivation styles is crucial

for success, as we conﬁrmed working with Debora and her change

## project team at the ﬁnancial institution across 206 employees. To

achieve this alignment, we’ve distilled our insights into ﬁve steps that

you and your organization can also apply to your own situation.

- 1) Diagnose your change type.

Before launching a change initiative, determine whether you need to

focus on exploration or exploitation. Diﬀerent change types require

# diﬀerent adaptive behaviors.

The ﬁnancial institution that Debora was working with had made no

such assessment. Instead, leadership believed the entire organization

needed a radical transformation — an exploratory approach, uniformly

applied. This mindset, coupled with unclear departmental needs, led

to 15 overlapping change priorities. The result was a hodgepodge of

initiatives — among them “future-proof talent strategy,” “next-gen

## tech integration,” and “agile leadership transformation” — that spread

## resources thin across misaligned projects.

Our assessment revealed a more nuanced reality. Some departments

need a strategy of exploration (especially those facing digital

disruptions, which demand innovation), while others needed one of

exploitation (especially those hoping to optimize existing processes to

meet regulations and deliver quality service).

For each department, start by using a decision tree to lay out your needs

for radical and incremental change. Next, explore the potential risks of

focusing solely on exploration or exploitation for each change theme.

This process helps reveal blind spots and guides you toward a balanced,

tailored approach.

- 2) Map motivational styles.

With your change type identiﬁed, the next step is to map out your

employees’ motivational styles. When we did this at Debora’s ﬁnancial

institution, we found the following overall distribution: Play to Win

(45%), Play Not to Lose (40%), and Balancers (15%). But the distribution

varied signiﬁcantly from department to department. Some leaned

# heavily in one direction or another.

When working on this task, pay close attention to how team members

approach tasks and challenges. Do they focus on potential gains,

moving quickly toward solutions? Or do they prioritize avoiding

mistakes, taking a more cautious, methodical approach?

- 3) Match motivations to initiatives.

## With a clear understanding of both your change type and the

## motivational styles of the employees on your teams, you can now

strategically assign employees to projects that align with their natural

# tendencies.

In the case of Debora’s ﬁnancial institution, we matched Play to Win

employees with exploratory projects that involved the development of

new ﬁnancial products, and we matched Play Not to Lose employees

with projects focused on regulatory compliance and risk management.

Not surprisingly, we placed Balancers in roles that required both

innovation and careful execution. More extreme measures are possible,

too: During one merger we consulted on, we sorted employees by their

natural motivational styles and created entirely separate project teams

# for exploration and exploitation.

- 4) Tailor your change messaging.

## Eﬀective communication about change also isn’t one-size-ﬁts-all. Tailor

it to resonate with diﬀerent motivational styles. At Debora’s ﬁnancial

institution, we coached leaders to frame changes diﬀerently across

departments, depending on their dominant styles. Examples include:

“With this new platform, we’ll lead the market by oﬀering innovative

services and products that our competitors can’t match, positioning us

as a frontrunner in the industry” (Play to Win); “If we don’t implement

these changes, we risk falling out of compliance, losing our trusted

position with regulators and clients, and endangering our reputation

## and long-term security” (Play Not to Lose); “This transformation will

enable us to innovate and stay competitive, while also maintaining the

operational security and regulatory compliance that we depend on”

# (Balancers).

Sometimes high stress levels can indicate the change narrative does

not match employees’ motivation styles. In a Swiss bank’s Asia-Paciﬁc

expansion that one of us (Nicolas) advised on, the CEO’s initial message

of bold risk-taking created anxiety among Play Not to Lose employees.

By reframing the initiative as necessary for protecting the bank’s future

stability and competitive position, the CEO aligned the change with

employees’ risk-averse motivations and transformed their resistance

# into engagement.

- 5) Encourage a paradox mindset.

## Even with the best alignment between change types and motivational

styles, organizations will inevitably face situations where contradictory

goals must be pursued simultaneously. Encouraging a paradox mindset

— so that employees get comfortable in that zone of contradiction — is

# crucial for sustained adaptability.

Debora applied this approach in the customer-experience division of the

ﬁnancial institution she was working with, which needed to innovate to

improve customer relationships but also had to implement strict cost

controls. She was able to foster a paradox mindset in the division by

designing projects that balanced opposing objectives — and by then

encouraging open discussions about the inherent tensions that arise.

Leaders should model this approach, navigating competing demands

transparently. Regular team reﬂections on these practices reinforce the

mindset across the organization.

. . .

For years, organizations have chased the perfect transformation plan,

yet often they keep failing. The pattern is clear: Well-intentioned

change initiatives fail when organizations rush into one-size-ﬁts-all

transformations without understanding who they’re asking to change

## and why. Our research and Debora’s implementation of our ﬁve-step

process show that success comes from understanding exactly what type

of change each department needs and how their employees are wired to

deliver it. It is not about the perfect strategy but about making change

ﬁt your people, who are the ones who will make it happen.
