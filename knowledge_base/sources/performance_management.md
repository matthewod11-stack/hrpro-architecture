# INTRODUCTION

The primary purpose of appraising and coaching employees is to instill in them the desire for continuous improvement. Yet the outcome of many performance appraisals is frequently a decrease rather than an increase in performance. Among the reasons for this decrease is the belief by employees that they are being evaluated on the wrong things, by the wrong person; that is, the person who is evaluating them lacks objectivity, and hence is not ‘‘fair.’’ Moreover, the feedback that is given to them is not seen as timely or con- structive. Thus, it is not surprising that a performance appraisal often leads to legal challenges for the appraisers and the orga- nization that employs them.

boss who has a similar philosophy in the workplace.

Coaches have to appraise each indivi- dual on the team. Who should get more time on the ice? Who should appear where in the batting lineup? Who should be cut from the tennis team? The principles of appraising others apply to one’s self, as well as to appraisals of one’s subordinates, peers and boss. The primary differences between the traditional top-down performance appraisal versus performance management are the time interval, namely discrete (i.e., annually) versus continuous, and the use of construc- tive feedback or coaching tips from sources other than one’s boss.

Within the recent past, there has been a shift from the traditional annual perfor- mance appraisal by one’s boss to perfor- mance management, with coaching as the cornerstone. As suggested by the chief executive ofﬁcer (CEO) of Mattel Inc., ‘‘Peo- ple can’t and won’t do much for you if no one in the organization knows what’s going on, what you expect of them, and what the future holds. And talking to them once a quarter isn’t enough—you have to repeat messages of direction, inspiration, and com- fort daily, in a variety of forms.’’ To believe that an annual appraisal, or even a quarterly one, is likely to lead to an increase in an employee’s performance is as naı¨ve in orga- nizational settings as it is in the ﬁeld of athletics. The negative reaction to your child’s swim coach—who refuses to offer constructive feedback except at the middle and again at the end of the swim season— should be no different than the reaction to a

Research within the past decade sug- gests ways organizations can overcome pro- blems with the traditional performance appraisal. Five issues are addressed: (1) legal pitfalls; (2) the appraisal instrument; (3) who should appraise and coach the employee; (4) objectivity and fairness; and (5) the coaching process itself.

# LEGAL ISSUES

Human resource management came under legal scrutiny in 1964 with the passage of Title VII of the Civil Rights Act in the United States (U.S.). This act makes it illegal to allow sex, age, race, religion, or ethnicity to inﬂu- ence decisions regarding the recruiting, training, upgrading, compensating, demot- ing, or terminating of an employee. Legal issues are increasingly problematic for orga- nizations as people are becoming more aware of their legal rights. In fact, there has been a 100% increase in the number of

77

employment discrimination cases ﬁled since 1995, and these cases have usually involved complaints regarding a performance apprai- sal. Legal confrontations regarding perfor- mance appraisals have led to the discovery of ways to minimize them. Organizations are most likely to win court challenges when: (1) the appraisal instrument is based on a writ- ten job analysis; (2) it is behavioral; (3) there is a written manual for appraising and then coaching an employee; (4) reliability and validity of the appraisal decisions have been documented; (5) the results of an appraisal have been reviewed with the employee; and (6) organizations can show that appraising and coaching of employees is ‘‘fair.’’

# THE APPRAISAL INSTRUMENT

The appraisal instrument is the foundation for appraising and coaching employees. It is the basis for making administrative decisions in a uniform and consistent way. As noted earlier, a primary reason for the frequent fail- ure of a performance appraisal to bring about apositivechangeinaperson’sbehavioristhat many employeesview theinstrumentasmea- suring the ‘‘wrong things.’’ Designing the ‘‘right’’ performance appraisal instrument improves both the accuracy of the instrument and employee perceptions of fairness. The most frequently used instruments for asses- sing employees are bottom-line measures, trait-based scales, and behavioral scales.

Bottom-line measures often take the form of management by objectives (MBO). This approach emphasizes issues such as: Were X, Y, and Z goals attained? Were they attained on time? Was the quality satisfac- tory? The relevance of such questions is dif- ﬁcult to attack, as they appear to be objective. The probability that two or more appraisers will independently reach the same conclu- sion regarding a person’s performance is relatively high. For example, the person either did or did not decrease costs by 14%. Nevertheless, MBO leaves much to be desired when used as the primary basis for coaching an employee, or for making admin-

# 78 ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS

istrative decisions. As Donald Petersen, a former CEO of Ford Motor Company has noted, the emphasis on goal attainment is ironically a weakness of MBO. When receiv- ing a ‘‘good’’ appraisal is contingent on goal attainment, ingenious ways are often found by employees to make easy goals appear difﬁcult to administrative decision makers. Moreover, a focus on bottom-line measures is of little help in planning for and receiving training and development opportunities. They tell the ‘‘score,’’ but not what can be done to improve it. Dissatisfaction with this aspect of MBO can erode the employees’ belief in the fairness of the appraisal process. In short, the limitations of economic or bottom-line measures for appraisal purposes are at least ﬁve-fold. First, cost-related mea- sures are often affected by factors beyond a person’s control (e.g., lack of resources, situa- tional constraints). Hence people can be pro- moted or penalized undeservedly. To the extent that situational factors constrain per- formance outcomes, the focus needs to be on the person’s behavior, or their motivation level decreases dramatically. Second, bot- tom-line measures often do not take into account factors for which the person should be held accountable (e.g., team playing skills, creating seamless boundaries within the organization). Credit needs to be given to an individual for excelling on important non- quantitative aspects of his or her job. Third, bottom-line measures can foster a results-at- all-costs mentality, which in turn can lead to unethical, if not illegal, activity. Fourth, bot- tom-line measures yield little or no informa- tion on what the person must continue doing, start doing, stop doing, or do differently to impact the bottom-line positively. Telling a middle manager, for example, that there is a cost overrun is of little value. What the man- ager needs to know, and what an effective coach needs to explain to the manager, are ways to work effectively within budget. Finally,comprehensivebottom-line measures do not exist for the individual employee in most jobs.

Trait-based scales are often used to assess attitudinal and personality variables

such as commitment, creativity, loyalty, and initiative. However, unless traits are deﬁned behaviorally, they are too vague, subjective, and ambiguous. The appraisal reﬂects little more than the caprice of the appraiser. As is the case with bottom-line measures, trait- based assessments provide little insight into what the employee should start, stop or con- sider doing differently. For this reason, the courts usually take a dim view of these types of appraisal instruments. The solution is to measure and coach a person on observable behaviors required to implement an organi- zation’s strategy, which in turn increases the bottom-line.

Behaviorally based scales reduce ambi- guity by setting common expectations that make explicit what the person should start or stop doing. These types of measures account for more job complexity, relate directly to what the employee does, and mini- mize irrelevant factors that are not under the control of the individual. Behavioral criteria, developed from a job analysis, make clear what one must do to be productive, and what one must do to implement the strategy. As Colin Powell has argued, plans do not accom- plish anything: strategy is only as good as its execution. All the great ideas and visions in the world are worthless, argued Powell, if they cannot be implemented effectively and efﬁciently. Behavioral measures specify ways to execute an organization’s strategic plan.

The steps to follow in developing an effective appraisal plan for coaching pur- poses are six-fold. Employees must be assessed and coached on behaviors that are: (1) observable; (2) under their control; and (3) critical to the implementation of the organization’s strategy. Too often, the results of months of strategic planning are the stra- tegic document disappearing into a desk- drawer to be subsequently ignored for the remainder of the ﬁscal year. Of particular importance for perceptions of fairness is that (4) appraisal accuracy increases when both the coach and employee are informed ahead of time about what is to be observed. This foresight focuses the attention of both parties facilitates on pertinent behaviors, and it

recall when making administrative and developmental decisions.

In developing a behaviorally based appraisal instrument, (5) longer, objective, descriptive behavioral statements on the appraisal instrument are more effective than short phrases in increasing the appraiser’s accuracy. Finally, (6) keeping a written record during appraisal periods of the spe- ciﬁc behaviors that were observed improves the appraiser’s recall, and hence contributes to an objective appraisal and working pro- cess.

Behavioral observation scales facilitate performance identiﬁcation of training needs, and setting of speciﬁc perfor- mance goals. Behavioral measures tied to the organization’s strategy correlate signiﬁcantly with cost-related measures such as revenue, repeat business, and customer satisfaction. Hence, they serve as a diagnostic instrument.

# Diagnostic Instrument

Whether it is in the ﬁelds of medicine or golf, coaches beneﬁt from having a diagnos- tic instrument to assist them in determining what a person is doing well, and spotting what the person can do to enhance his or her knowledge, skills or ability. A diagnostic instrument also facilitates self-management. In medicine, a diagnostic instrument enables people to know what to eat and what not to eat, in order to maximize their quality of life, and minimize the probability of sundry dis- eases ranging from heart disease to cancer. It sensitizes people to early warning signs as to when a medical doctor should be consulted. In golf, a diagnostic instrument allows one to check one’s grip of the club, or placement of one’s feet to hit the ball long and straight. It facilitates discussion with a golf coach as to what one needs to do to improve one’s score. In organizational settings, an effective diagnostic instrument is one that focuses on those areas that move the strategy from rhetoric to action steps. Hence, the impor- tance of the appraisal instrument as a diag- nostic tool for coaching and developing an employee, and to an employee’s own self-

79

management. This diagnostic instrument should ensure that people are coaching themselves, and that they are coaching others on the ‘‘right things.’’

# Perceptions of Fairness

to the implementation and on-going use of apprai- sals. Trust (perceptions of whether people adhere to the organization’s rules when mak- ing appraisals, whether the appraisals are accurate, or whether the appraisals reﬂect favoritism), as well as employee perceptions of situational constraints on their perfor- mance, predicts their motivational level.

Employee acceptance is critical

Hostility toward performance appraisals and the coaching process often occurs when people believe that they are being evaluated on the ‘‘wrong things,’’ or on indices over which they have little control. This hostility is minimized to the extent that people can see that they are being assessed on the very behaviors that enable the successful imple- mentationofthe organization’s strategicplan. Another reason for employee hostility toward appraisals is improper weighting of the criteria. This has led to the concept of a ‘‘balanced scorecard’’ that provides a frame- work for coaching employees on the ways they can contribute meaningfully to the orga- nization’s strategy. For example, at Pricewa- terhouseCoopers (PWC), equal weight is now given to each of three criteria, namely: client, people, and ﬁrm. This is done to shift an overemphasis by some partners on the client, at the expense of coaching staff on ways to assist the client, as well as to ensure that what is done for the client and staff is not done at the expense of what is in the overall interest of PWC as an organization.

The attitudes of coaches as well as the people who are being coached is positive if the appraisal instrument facilitates assess- ments that are: (1) perceived as factual, objec- tive and unbiased; (2) explicitly related to the organization’s strategy; (3) developmental, in that the assessment speciﬁes what the employee must start doing, stop doing, con- tinue doing, or do differently to improve

# 80 ORGANIZATIONAL DYNAMICS

performance; and (4) conducive to setting speciﬁc high goals for doing so.

SOURCES OF APPRAISAL: WHO SHOULD COACH?

An appraisal instrument, no matter how carefully developed, is only as good as the people who use it. Hence the question: Who is the ideal coach? Is the answer the boss? What about one’s peers or subordinates? How about people coaching themselves?

# 360-Degree Feedback

Anyone who has children is aware that how they interact with their grandparents is not necessarily how they interact with their parents, babysitters, or siblings. Moreover, how they behave on the playground is unli- kely to yield clues as to how they behave in the classroom, let alone in the home. The answer to ‘‘Who is my child?’’ is ‘‘All of the above.’’ For similar reasoning, feedback from multiple sources, often termed 360- degree or multisource feedback, is blossom- ing in the workplace.

A perception of an employee’s perfor- mance varies among subordinates, peers, and supervisors. How an employee interacts with the boss is not necessarily an indicator of how that employee interacts with peers or subordinates. Multisource feedback takes into account the fact that different popula- tions (e.g., peers, subordinates) have differ- ent opportunities to observe different aspects of a person’s performance. It thus provides an integrated, holistic view of an employee, offsetting the biases of an appraisal from only a single vantage point (e.g., the boss). More- over, 360-degree feedback is consistent with organizational values for teamwork. Upwards of 90% of Fortune 1000 ﬁrms now collect assessments of an employee from multiple sources.

360-Degree feedback is being used in many large companies, such as DuPont, Gen- eral Electric Co. (GE), Motorola Inc., Procter & Gamble Co. and United Parcel Service of

America Inc. (UPS). For example, a 360- degree feedback program exists at AT&T Corp.’s business products division. Any manager supervising three or more people has to go through an evaluation every year and must share the results with his or her supervisors, as well as with the employees below the manager. Several senior managers, at AT&T, Nestle’s and General Motors Corp., have openly admitted that they have been surprised by the upward feedback within a 360-degree evaluation. The managers were unaware of the inaccurate perceptions of some of their actions, and the uncertainty amongst employees regarding issues the managers thought they had communicated. However, agreement among multiple sources of an appraisal should not be expected. Each source often observes an employee in different contexts, with super- visor–peer ratings typically exhibiting the greatest agreement, and subordinate–self rat- ings showing the least agreement. Hence, multisource appraisal instruments are often designedtoassess thoseaspects ofthe jobthat a speciﬁc population (e.g., subordinates) is most likely to observe on an ongoing basis. In short, a person’s appraisal often differs across populations (supervisor vs. subordi- nates) because of the actual differences in the behaviors that are observed in different contexts.

Thus, multisource appraisals are taken into account at JP Morgan Chase when deter- mining developmental goals (teamwork), and/or making an administrative decision (e.g., promotion). Among the strengths and limitations of each source of an appraisal are the following:

# The Boss

The boss often has a limited opportunity to observe his or her subordinates. Thus, a boss appraisal usually does not provide a complete picture of an employee’s perfor- mance. Consequently, supervisory apprai- sals frequently fail to improve a person’s performance and may lead to employee hos- tility. Such questions as: ‘‘On what basis are

you able to evaluate me?’’ undermine the credibility of the boss. The employee views the appraisal as unfair. The boss should be held accountable primarily for collecting data for appraising an individual from multi- ple sources, and then making the ﬁnal administrative and developmental decisions based on these multiple sources of informa- tion.

# Subordinates

Anonymous feedback from subordinates, often called upward feedback, can lead to positive changes in the behavior of super- visors. Leaders who receive feedback from subordinates that is more negative than their self-evaluation show the greatest level of subsequent improvement. These positive behavior changes have been shown to be sustainable over time. This is especially true for managers who have high self-efﬁcacy, namely, ‘‘I can change.’’ that Upward appraisals are used in such compa- nies as Pratt and Whitney and AT&T.

# the belief

# Peers

Anonymous peer ratings are among the best predictors of both training success and jobs. This is performance in subsequent because peers often have more job-relevant information than other sources, due to their opportunity to closely observe and compare themselves against others on task-relevant abilities.

Peer appraisals are increasingly popular in self-managing teams. Allowing people who comprise the teams to be responsible for appraising another increases interpersonal effectiveness, group cohesion, communication, employee motivation, and group satisfaction.

# Self-Appraisals

Self-appraisals, not surprisingly, are less accurate than appraisals from other sources. Self-appraisals have the lowest agreement with other rating sources (peers and super-

81

visors), and the lowest ability to predict the person’s subsequent performance. An intri- guing ﬁnding is that those whose self-apprai- sal is aligned with the appraisals they receive from others are usually high performers. This is because they score high on ‘‘self-aware- ness’’ of their abilities. Moreover, employees whose self-evaluations are in agreement with evaluations from their subordinates have been found to be more promotable than those whose self-ratings are inﬂated.

Overall, multisource feedback provides a comprehensive way of appraising employ- ees. It improves the accuracy of appraisals through the multiple viewpoints that are obtained, and it increases perceptions of fairness by ensuring that a biased source (e.g., one’s boss) is not over-represented in the appraisal process.

# TRAINING APPRAISERS/ COACHES

# Appraisal Accuracy

Appraisals are more often a reﬂection of the appraiser’s overall biases than they are of the performance of an employee. Appraisers from different populations (e.g., supervisors vs. subordinates) attach different weights to the same aspects of performance that they observe as a result of their different perspec- tives in the organization. A massive study involving over 4000 managers with apprai- two sals from at peers, two subordinates plus self-appraisals indicated that the idiosyncrasies of an appraiser affect the appraisals given to an employee.

two supervisors,

The U.S. Army showed that one’s knowl- edge and ability explained only a very small part of an appraisal from one’s supervisor and peers. The supervisor’s positive regard for a subordinate resulted in both positive leniency and halo errors, and little inclination to punish poor performance. Other studies have found that the perceived similarity of the subordinate by the supervisor inﬂates appraisals in the private and public sectors. This is especially true with regard to per-

Evaluations are also adversely affected by gender. Men are typically evaluated as more effective than women. That this ﬁnding reﬂects sex discrimination is suggested by that even when the males and the fact females demonstrate the same leadership behavior, women are devalued when the appraisers are male. A subsequent review of leadership perceptions in the military revealed preferential ratings for men in train- ing groups, primarily where there was a ‘‘token’’ woman; found in groups where there were several women. This suggests that token status exacerbates negative evaluations of women, because the token female receives considerable attention, which increases the pressure on her to per- form well.

this was not

Another study also points to the impor- tance of gender proportion as a factor affect- ing rating accuracy. The respondents, only 27 of whom were female, reported that men possess the motivation and leadership qua- lities necessary for effective performance, whereas women possess feminine attitudes that impair their performance. Yet, there were no performance differences between men and women on any objective measure. In still another study, the performance of women was rated higher than that of men when the women constituted a higher pro- portion than the men. Gender proportion appears to inﬂuence the performance evalua- tions of women. Increasing the representa- tion of women in mixed groups increases positive appraisals of them.

To minimize bias and increase the accu- racy and objectivity of coaches, training pro- grams should allow them to evaluate actors presented on videotape, receive feedback as to rating accuracy, and to practice, practice,

practice. Such training minimizes rating errors including leniency, halo, and simi- lar-to-me biases. This training should teach coaches: (1) the relevant performance criteria for evaluating people; (2) the relevant job behaviors to observe; and (3) and ways to effectively minimize errors in judgment when using the appraisal instrument.

# Feedback and Goal-Setting

In many instances, feedback decreases rather than increases performance. There- fore, training coaches in how to provide feed- back and set goals is critical to an effective coaching process. For feedback to bring about a positive change in behavior, a coach must: (1) focus on the behavior rather than the person; (2) be selective as to the ‘‘critical few’’ so as not to overwhelm the person; and (3) focus on the desired behavior rather than the undesired, as well as ways to demon- strate it. Sensitivity and tact in giving feed- back is critical for bringing about a change in behavior. Thus, (4) honesty should not be confused with hurtfulness.

Feedback in the absence of goal setting has little or no effect on behavior, because feed- back in itself is only information; its effect on action depends on how the recipient under- stands it, and what decisions are made with respect to it. For feedback to improve beha- vior, (5) speciﬁc high goals must be set, and the individual must be committed to meeting those goals, because goal setting affects choice, effort and persistence.

# Organizational Justice

Few things demoralize a person faster than feelings of jealousy, perceptions of favoritism, or beliefs that someone else is getting a ‘‘better deal.’’ Not only does a coach need to be fair; the coach must be seen as fair. At least four factors contribute to perceptions of fairness of a coach, namely, distributive justice, procedural justice, interactional jus- tice and the concept of voice.

The following questions are usually asked by employees regarding distributive justice:

What was distributed to whom? Who has the corner ofﬁce, received the coveted assign- ment, or was promoted or let go? Although the answers to these questions certainly affect perceptions of justice, often more important to employees are answers to ques- tions regarding procedural justice. Perceptions of procedural

justice are affected by answers to the question: Are there procedures, processes, or systems for deciding ‘‘who gets what?’’ If the answer is no, mistrust throughout the workforce is likely to be high. If the answer is yes, sub- sequent questions asked by employees include the following: Are the procedures representative of the thinking of the unit or that of a ‘‘chosen few?’’ Are they applied consistently? Are the procedures ethical? Is there an appeal system that people can use without fear of retribution? Do I have a champion? People become highly concerned with answers to procedural justice questions when they receive a poor appraisal.

Interactional justice refers to the interac- tions between the coach and the subordinate. To the extent that the logic of the coach is understood, and the coach is perceived as someone wanting to truly help the person improve performance, feelings of trust and respect are usually high, even if the employee disagrees with the coach’s appraisal.

that people believe that their views are taken into account before an appraisal is made. People are likely to support a decision that they did not initially advocate if they have ‘‘voice,’’ if their answer is yes to the question: ‘‘Was I heard?’’

# Voice refers to the extent

A ‘‘due process appraisal’’ includes giving an employee adequate notice of the appraisal (e.g., explaining standards in advance, seek- ing self-appraisals, giving feedback on an ongoing basis), fair hearing (adequate obser- vations of the person’s performance, granting the person an opportunity to explain self- evaluations)and judgmentbasedonevidence (e.g., consistent application of standards, an opportunity to appeal). Employees whose voice has been heard usually feel that the appraisal system is fair and accurate. ‘‘Due

83

process’’ increases an employee’s motivation to improve performance, as well as satisfac- tion with the appraisal system as a whole. In summary, training programs, in addition to focusing on ways to increase appraisal accu- racy, should stress the principles of organiza- tional the performance management process in general, and the coach in particular, are seen as fair.

Regardless of the care that is taken in developing the appraisal instrument and the training that is given to a coach, appraisal accuracy can be affected adversely by the organization’s politics. In a study of an Ore- gon newsprint facility and a Seattle bank, self-conﬁdence accurate appraisals was high. In the newsprint facil- ity, however, the performance appraisal did not affect an employee’s status in any way, regardless of whether the appraisal was posi- tive or negative; moreover, the appraisers anticipated neither positive nor negative out- comes for themselves for conducting accu- rate and timely appraisals. Performance appraisal was viewed by everyone as a ‘‘nonevent.’’ In the bank, appraisers feared the organizational consequences of ‘‘making waves.’’ The outcome that they expected, as a result of recording behaviors to document an unfavorable appraisal, was a decrease in the probability of they, themselves, being pro- moted. An organizational culture that fosters high self-conﬁdence and low positive out- come expectancies causes resentment. In these two companies, people who believed that they could make accurate appraisals stopped doing so.

conducting

For performance management to be taken seriously, people must see the relationship between the coaching provided and desir- able outcomes. They must see a positive relationship between the coaching process and other human resource systems, includ- ing stafﬁng and training, as well the effective implementation of the team’s, division’s or organization’s strategic plan.

When the outcome expectancies of con- ducting appraisals are neutral or negative, when there is no perceived relationship between the performance appraisal one

receives and subsequent positive or negative outcomes, the entire process is seen as mean- ingless. Therefore, a coach should be for- mally evaluated on the accuracy and comprehensiveness of appraisals of others, as well as on the extent to which organiza- tional justice principles are followed, and speciﬁc high goals are set.

# ONGOING COACHING

In the past ﬁve years, there has been a shift in emphasis within the private and public sectors from performance appraisal to perfor- mance management, from being a perfor- mance appraiser to becoming a performance coach. The shift is from a discrete activity to one that is performed on an ongoing process. The shift is from being primarily an evaluator to becoming a developer of people.

Cyclical year-round performance man- agement (i.e., feedback, analyzing results, setting goals) effectively increases organiza- tional performance. Executive coaching in a public-sector municipal agency increased employee productivity dramatically. This is because coaches can be powerful catalysts for bringing permanent improvements in employees’ behavior when they challenge employees on a daily basis, and when they instill in them the conﬁdence that they can expand their abilities to attain desired goals. The CEO of Hewlett–Packard was recently quoted as saying ‘‘along the way, you must remind people of how far they’ve come already and how much closer they are to achieving the goal.’’

# Outcome Expectancy/Self- Efﬁcacy

A drawback to setting speciﬁc high goals is that people may obtain tangible evidence that they did not attain them. They learn that they have failed despite their effort and per- sistence. Through multiple setbacks or even one severe one, they give up. To help people overcome their sense of helplessness, to instill optimism in the face of failure, coaches

need to focus on two key concepts: outcome expectations and self-efﬁcacy.

A primary role of a coach is to help people see the relationship between what they do and the outcome that they can expect. Motor- ola is known for having an employee devel- opment system that combines performance appraisals, succession planning, and indivi- dual career planning into a single, continu- ous system, so that employees know what they have done, where they are going, and how exactly they need to improve. There is a sense of what one is striving for, and goals are set about how to get there. In addition, conversations take place about how well one has accomplished one’s goals in the past, and the progress of their current goals. Employ- ees beneﬁt from being able to understand their frequent (quarterly) appraisals in terms of their own career development, as well their role in meeting organizational perfor- mance targets.

The response ‘‘I don’t get it’’ is sympto- matic of a lack of understanding of outcome expectancies. Thus, the job of the golf pro is to help the player see the relationship between wheretheleftfootisplacedandwheretheball goes after being struck by the club. The job of the salesdirectoristohelp thesalespersonsee the relationship between how the sales-call wasmadeandtheamountofrevenuethatwas generated. This is not a profound concept, yet it is one that many coaches in organizational settings overlook. The use of the empathy box described earlier in Organizational Dynamics (see Latham, 2003) is a helpful tool for clarify- ing anticipated outcomes.

A second step to instilling a ‘‘can-do’’ mindset in an employee is for the coach to focus on the person’s self-efﬁcacy, namely, the conviction that ‘‘I can cause,’’ ‘‘I can bring about,’’ ‘‘I can make happen.’’ Since self- efﬁcacy is task speciﬁc, a person may have high self-efﬁcacy in one area—such as bring- ing in new business, and low self-efﬁcacy in another, such as managing staff.

Task-speciﬁc self-efﬁcacy can be increased through: (1) enactive mastery, that is, sequen-

cing a task, giving assignments in such a way that all but guarantees early successes; (2) ﬁnding models of desired behaviors that the person being coached can identify with and learn from; and (3) the appropriate encour- agement from others, particularly the coach. For example, at Syncrude, a large Canadian energy company, those with high appraisals are singled out and written to personally by the operations manager. This encouragement from the coach reinforces that performance is not only appraised, but encouraged and valued by corporate leaders.

# CONCLUSION

Peter Drucker noted that in the 20th century, great leaders gave great answers; in the 21st century, great leaders will ask great ques- tions. In organizational settings, as is the case for their counterparts in professional sports, leaders may not necessarily be as adept or knowledgeable of the areas requiring coach- ing, as is the person who is being coached. Thus, becoming an expert on ‘‘the answers’’ is now, and will continue to be, all but impossible. The effective coach is one who questions and listens. Insightful questions lead to reﬂection; they lead to self-discovery. The arguable downside of becoming an effective coach is the queue; people seek out those who listen to them. However, as Colin Powell has observed, the day people stop bringing a person their problems is the day that person has stopped leading them. People have either lost conﬁdence that the person can help them, or they have con- cluded that the person does not care. Either case, argued Powell, is a failure of leader- ship. Together, performance appraisals that lead to ongoing coaching ensure a highly trained, highly motivated workforce. It is the essence of performance management.
