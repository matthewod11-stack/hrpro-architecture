## From World War II through 1980 the focus of the human resources

function was advocating for workers—ﬁrst as a way to keep unions out

of companies and later to manage employees’ development in the era

when all talent was grown from within. Then things changed. Driven

by the stagﬂation of the 1970s, the recession of the early 1980s, and

more recently the Great Recession, HR’s focus increasingly shifted to

relentless cost cutting. Decades of slack labor markets made slashing

HR expenses easy because it was hard for people to quit. Pay and every

kind of beneﬁt, including training and development, got squeezed.

Work demands went up, and job security fell.

Now the pendulum has swung sharply the other way. The U.S.

unemployment rate has been below 4% for ﬁve years, with the exception

of the Covid shutdown period. Productivity growth has lagged, with

the 2010s being the worst decade for it in modern times. That,

along with slow growth in the labor force, will probably keep the

job market tight for some time. Meanwhile, overwork, fear of layoﬀs,

lack of advancement opportunities, and worries of being replaced by

technologies like artiﬁcial intelligence have created an epidemic of

workplace stress in the United States. Evidence that companies have hit the limits of lean staﬃng includes the remarkable Kaiser Permanente

strike of 2023, which was the largest health-care labor dispute in U.S.

history, and pharmacists’ walkouts and sick-outs at CVS and Walgreens.

In all those disputes one of the main worker demands was that the

companies staﬀ open positions.

HR’s focus on minimizing personnel costs was not a problem when

job markets were cool. But now keeping positions ﬁlled and preventing

employees from burning out or becoming dissatisﬁed are the priorities.

To meet the fundamental challenge of hiring and retaining good

people, HR needs to return to its traditional role of taking care of

employees. It must play a lead role in persuading top management to

treat employees better and to change company policies on pay, training,

layoﬀs, vacancies, outsourcing, and restructuring.

# More Talk Than Action

In a slew of C-suite surveys, including those conducted by the

Conference Board, CEOs ranking the importance of stakeholders place

employees even higher than shareholders. They also say that talent,

especially acquiring it, is the most critical factor aﬀecting their

business. Yet so far little has changed in the way that companies

manage their workforces. Real wages are still barely keeping up with

inﬂation; weekly earnings actually declined slightly in 2022 and did

not grow at all in the ﬁrst three quarters of 2023. Promotions are rare,

with only 4.5% of employees receiving one within two years of being

hired, according to an ADP Research Institute analysis of the careers

of 51 million U.S. workers. A 2022 McKinsey survey found that a lack

of career development and advancement was the most common reason

people gave for quitting a job. A dearth of training and feedback from

supervisors and two other cost-cutting practices, “hoteling” (not giving workers a permanent oﬃce or cubicle and making them reserve one when they need it) and open oﬃce layouts, have also contributed to

# employee discontent.

Then there are the repeated restructurings that have become a way of

life at large companies. The constant changes raise employees’ stress

levels and take a big toll on their mental health. That not only pushes up

health-care costs but also increases turnover and undermines employee

engagement, performance, and productivity, as well as ﬁrms’ ability to

# recruit.

It’s understandable why breaking old habits is hard. Telling leaders

that the approach they’ve been following for 40 years—and the one

thing investors seem to understand about human capital (“cut it!”)—

is all wrong does not seem like a career-building move. Nonetheless,

HR executives can—and must—make the case to their CEOs and

operating executives that the old way is no longer working and that their

companies need to change direction.

# Make True Costs Clear

One critical step HR can take to get the C-suite to alter course is to show

leaders what the costs of current practices really are and illustrate the

value of human capital. To that end, HR should provide a dashboard

that includes metrics on turnover and what it costs the company,

information on why employees are quitting, and ﬁgures on vacancies

ﬁlled from within. It should also include data on employees’ well-being,

such as absenteeism rates, incidents of new illnesses and disabilities,

## use of employee assistance programs, and levels of commitment and

engagement. Those things all can have a signiﬁcant impact on ﬁrms’

success, but since they don’t show up in any single ﬁnancial accounting

category, they have to be pulled out and highlighted for the C-suite.

Corporate leaders often are unaware of the reality in their workplaces.

A long-running MetLife survey, for example, has found that while 83%

of top managers say that their employees are “ﬁnancially healthy,” only

55% of employees feel that way. And in their research Joseph Fuller

and Manjari Raman of Harvard Business School have found that C-

suite executives believe they routinely implement career advancement

practices that their employees say never happen.

If leaders realized that the true cost of turnover is often a multiple of an employee’s annual salary, they would immediately demand changes.

To supply leaders with good information, HR must get control of data

from company vendors. Many ﬁrms can’t see how well their hiring

practices work, because their applicant-tracking-system vendors have

## all the data about job candidates and their performance-appraisal

vendors have the data on how hires are doing. Businesses should require

that their data be delivered to them in usable, compatible formats

and, if not, that the vendors themselves do analyses for companies on

# demand.

# HBR / Magazine Article / HR’s New Role

## Perhaps the single most important piece of information that most

leaders lack is what turnover actually costs. When we’ve tested groups of

CEOs about this, we’ve found that they have no idea. Unfortunately, HR

leaders often don’t know either, or the ﬁgure they use is completely oﬀ:

Most cite the cost as $4,000 an employee, which is simply an estimate

of the marginal administrative costs of hiring a new person. It ignores

things like training expenses, new hires’ lower initial performance,

and the time coworkers have to spend interviewing candidates. If

leaders realized that the true cost of turnover is often a multiple of

an employee’s annual salary, knew what the value of the ﬁrm’s best

employees was relative to that of average employees, and understood

that 29% of people who have just been promoted quit (perhaps because

39% of employers routinely fail to give promoted employees more pay),

they would immediately demand changes. It’s one thing to tell leaders

that treating employees well is the right thing to do and that it supports

the company’s environmental, social, and governance goals. It’s another

to be able to add that the failure to do it costs the business in question

# an extra $10 million each quarter.

Ten years ago, driven by better information on the true costs of turnover

and how the retention and performance of frontline workers aﬀect

operational and ﬁnancial results, Walmart embarked on an ambitious

change program. (See “‘The Right Thing to Do,’” HBR.org, December 7,

## 2017, and “‘You’ve Got to Set Your People Up to Succeed,’” May–June

2023.) Among other moves, it increased pay, improved beneﬁts, invested

more in training, and redesigned jobs and schedules.

At Neiman Marcus, Eric Severson, the chief people oﬃcer, spearheaded

a similar transition by persuading the rest of the C-suite that the

retail chain was investing too little in human capital. He presented top

## management with data on the costs of turnover and the beneﬁts of

retention and leveraged “voice of the customer” tools from marketing

to ﬁnd out what drove turnover and successful hiring. On the basis of

that information, the company introduced generous paid parental and

family leave for all its associates, which was rare in retail but would be

especially valuable to its mainly female workforce, and allowed many

jobs to continue to be remote after the pandemic. Severson also got

the company to stop outsourcing recruiting by showing that it could be

done better and more cheaply in-house.

Such companies are the exception, however. At thousands of ﬁrms, a

lack of information continues to drive job cuts and decisions to put oﬀ

ﬁlling open positions. Executives announce restructurings and layoﬀs

because they think investors like them. But even when these sweeping

plans aren’t carried out, they panic employees, causing them to freeze

up and start looking for jobs elsewhere. Recent evidence has shown that

cutting head count deep and early, the typical advice when earnings fall, leads to worse ﬁnancial performance because of the diﬃculty of staﬃng

up again. (Meta and other tech companies that had layoﬀs in early

2023 in response to investor pressure announced hiring plans a few

months later.) And research by Ciao-Wei Chen and Laura Yue Li of the

University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign shows that leaving positions

open also can have signiﬁcant costs. They found that a one-standard-

deviation increase in the length of job vacancies was associated with 5%

# to 6% lower quarterly returns on assets.

Better information on the true costs of such actions might change senior

management’s decisions. HR can easily close the gap by sharing the

# right data with leaders.

# Address Employee Stress

HR should establish standard, credible metrics for employee stress and

discuss them alongside ﬁnancial and production numbers. But the

priority should be on reducing the causes of stress, not monitoring it

or alleviating its symptoms. Implementing wellness programs to help

employees manage stress is like building trauma centers to deal with car

# accidents.

One huge cause of stress is uncertainty.

That’s why HR should encourage leaders to

communicate their plans more proactively

with employees. If employees don’t know

what’s in the works, they’ll make up their

own stories, which are practically

guaranteed to be worse than the reality.

Two of the things they’re most anxious

# Kirsten Ulve

about these days are technological change

# and restructuring.

Fear of AI. Perhaps the biggest worry across workplaces is whether new

forms of AI will eliminate jobs. That was one of the main concerns

prompting the 2023 Hollywood strikes by screenwriters’ and actors’

unions, which succeeded in getting studios to place boundaries around

the use of AI to replace human talent. HR needs to calm the furor

by communicating to the organization, “We’re just ﬁguring out how

these tools can be used. In the past it has taken decades for new

technologies to be fully embraced, and virtually none has lived up to

the hype.” In fact, the evidence so far suggests that generative AI, which

has produced widespread worker fear, will be more likely to enhance

jobs in the near term than eliminate them. (See “How to Capitalize

## on Generative AI,” HBR, November–December 2023.) It’s particularly

important to be clear that the company has no secret plan to replace

people with AI. In addition, it’s smart to engage employees in evaluating

AI’s potential uses, because doing so helps reduce their stress and

increases learning in the process.

# HBR / Magazine Article / HR’s New Role

The restructuring threat. Company eﬀorts to reorganize to adapt to the

changing business environment are another major source of workplace

stress. The shift to “green” products, for instance, was one of the main

issues in the 2023 United Auto Workers strike, which ended with the

union’s securing protections for employees from restructuring resulting

## from the transition to electric vehicles.

Throughout the business world, companies see the ability to restructure

quickly as the key to long-term success. Yet without employee support,

change eﬀorts fail. Lately that support has been harder for companies to

come by. Gartner’s Cian O Morain and Peter Aykens note that a survey

conducted by their company found that employee willingness to get

behind new initiatives plunged from 2016 to 2022. (See “Employees Are

## Losing Patience with Change Initiatives,” HBR.org, May 9, 2023.)

We believe that if leaders fully understood the eﬀects of reorganizations

on mental health, turnover, and job performance, they would limit them

or go about them in diﬀerent ways. While many new organizational

structures are unlikely to last, all too often they involve changes that

cannot be easily reversed, such as laying oﬀ employees and hiring new

# ones.

# Find Better Ways to Be Dexterous

When companies do restructure, they should avoid simply moving from

one rigid architecture to another, redrawing boxes on the org chart

and reassigning employees to new managers. A smarter approach is to

compartmentalize change by creating smaller P&L units that grow or

shrink based on needs in a company’s target markets. AIG was famous

for entering markets by creating new companies to go after them and

then shutting those ventures down if the markets became unproﬁtable.

That was no doubt painful—but not as painful as restructuring the

entire corporation ﬁrst to chase a new market and then again to exit it.

Two other companies that have taken a similar approach are the French

## infrastructure company Vinci and Haier, the Chinese multinational

## maker of home appliances and consumer electronics.

The downside to decentralizing around autonomous P&Ls is a loss of

synergies, but there are remedies for that. ING, for instance, inspired by

tech companies’ agile models, loosely groups small multidisciplinary

teams into larger collectives for the purpose of coordinating bigger

tasks. When a project ﬁnishes, the team assigned to it disbands.

Functional experts in legal, ﬁnance, and operational risk are not

assigned to teams but can be called on to help out and give objective

advice. The system can ﬂex to meet new demands, but job titles and

reporting arrangements do not change.

Business leaders should also rethink how contract employees and

vendors are used. Almost 50 years ago, Charles Handy and John

Atkinson argued that contractors should do the peripheral work that

shifts when business needs and strategies change, allowing the core

of the business and its employees to remain stable. In recent decades

companies have done just the opposite and have resorted to using

contract workers and to outsourcing entire core functions, such as IT,

to drive down operating costs. In many cases that was a mistake because

the vendor couldn’t deliver or, worse, went out of business.

# Rebuild the Internal Labor Market

One eﬀective way for companies to increase ﬂexibility and reduce

employee anxiety is to retrain workers and give them opportunities to

transfer into promising areas of the organization. HR can play a central

role in making the case for those practices.

Despite the fact that training is necessary to grow talent from within,

companies invest remarkably little in it. A survey conducted in 2020 by

# HBR / Magazine Article / HR’s New Role

MIT’s Paul Osterman suggests that the average U.S. employee gets only

a half day of training per year—and that includes training of any kind,

## from compliance with new administrative practices to safety training.

The dearth of training translates into fewer opportunities to move up.

## Indeed, one of the most astonishing characteristics of the contemporary

workplace is how little career advancement there is. Research suggests

that only 10% to 20% of job vacancies are ﬁlled by current employees.

And like the McKinsey study we mentioned earlier, a Pew Foundation

survey found lack of advancement to be a substantial cause of turnover:

Sixty-three percent of people who’d left their jobs in 2021 cited it as

a reason for quitting. Lateral moves are even rarer than upward ones:

Only 1% of U.S. employees move laterally to diﬀerent businesses and

operations in a given year, according to data from the Society for

# Human Resource Management.

Internal job markets not only cost very little but also save enormous amounts of money by reducing turnover and the need to hire from the outside.

The beneﬁts of retraining are enormous because it prevents companies

from replacing good employees with people with diﬀerent skill sets,

who often have to be paid more. Some companies have realized this.

Several years ago, IBM oﬀered some employees who were about to be

restructured out of jobs the option of taking severance or moving into

roles requiring new skills that they would receive training in for one

day a week on their own time—a way of sharing the costs with them.

This approach had a huge payoﬀ—including better productivity, better

employee ﬁt, and lower turnover—and saved twice as much money

as the retraining cost. In 2019 PwC committed $3 billion to retraining

and promised its workforce of 275,000 that all employees who agreed

to undergo it, even those whose roles were eliminated by automation,

would have a job with the company, though it might not be the same job.

Internal job markets help current employees move to new positions in

their organizations where the growth is and where they can learn new

skills. They not only cost very little but also save enormous amounts

of money by reducing turnover and the need to hire from the outside.

Though internal job markets date back to the dot-com days of 1995 to

2000, they were scaled down after the Great Recession under pressure

from line managers who didn’t want to let their good employees leave

them, even if it was for better jobs in the same organization. Now these

programs are being revived, often under the name “talent marketplace.”

(See “How to Design an Internal Talent Marketplace,” HBR, May–June,

2023.)

HSBC says its talent marketplace was critical to its transformation into a

digital-ﬁrst bank. Unilever’s former CEO Alan Jope praised its revamped

internal job market, Flex Experiences, for helping the company

rearrange talent in a way that allowed it to weather the pandemic

and become more agile. A few years ago Flex expanded into matching

employees with learning opportunities on projects, particularly those

with ESG objectives. Since 2018 Unilever has reallocated 500,000

employee hours toward more than 4,000 business-critical projects,

improving overall productivity by 41% in the process. Seventy percent

of the assignments in those projects were cross-functional, helping

employees build skills that will make the organization even more agile.

# Strengthen DEI Efforts

A ﬁnal area where HR can take the lead is diversity, equity, and

inclusion. The “equity and inclusion” components, which get less

attention, are where HR advocacy for employee interests is especially

needed. Improving equity involves making the treatment of employees

and the distribution of opportunities fairer, oﬀering opportunities on

a clear and meritocratic basis, reducing favoritism, and tying rewards

## to actual performance in a straightforward way—all changes that

reduce perceived injustices, which can create enormous stress for

employees. Increasing inclusion comes down to creating an atmosphere

of tolerance and helping employees with their individual challenges.

A work environment in which employees feel safe being who they

are encourages people to speak up and inspires a sense of pride

and belonging. Those positive feelings translate into hard work and

increased employee loyalty. Employers who get DEI right are far more

able to attract talent because it widens the pool they can access,

# particularly among younger people.

. . .

Responding to a long-term change like the shift from slack to tight labor

markets usually takes a great deal of time. But no one wants to be at the

end of the line of companies reacting to an important inﬂection point.

The question is, Who will be at the front of the line? Over the past 40

years companies have built HR practices and operating cultures based

on the notion that squeezing employment costs and HR resources had

little downside. Some of the cost cutting was indirect—by not ﬁlling

vacancies and letting the remaining employees ﬁgure out how to get

additional work done—and some was direct, like shrinking training and

development budgets. That model is no longer working, yet companies

## continue with it out of inertia and because costs like turnover, unstaﬀed

positions, and disengaged employees have no line item in the ﬁnancial

accounting systems of enterprises in the United States and many

other countries. (See “How Financial Accounting Screws Up HR,” HBR,

January–February 2023.) To change harmful, outdated practices, HR

will have to provide business leaders with that vital information.
