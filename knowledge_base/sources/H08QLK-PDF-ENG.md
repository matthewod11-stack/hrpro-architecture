In 2011, venture capitalist Marc Andreessen declared that “software is

eating the world,” arguing that software-driven companies would upend

every industry. That framing explains why the 2010s were dominated

by digital transformation: incumbents and challengers alike invested

heavily in enterprise software to automate workﬂows and compete with

# digitally native entrants.

Today, enterprises face a parallel inﬂection: Generative AI will not

simply disrupt industries; it will disrupt the very software that enabled

the last wave of transformation. Even Satya Nadella, CEO of Microsoft

## —whose enterprise oﬀerings power millions of organizations—has

sounded the alarm.

This disruption will have ripple eﬀects far beyond software companies.

Most large companies depend on various enterprise systems to handle

foundational workﬂows, including booking sales, calculating ﬁnancial

results, and paying employees. Thousands of IT professionals support

this software, and the daily workﬂows of millions of employees involve

daily interactions with it. If companies shift from SaaS software to AI,

many of those jobs will change in signiﬁcant ways—and some will go

away altogether. For senior leaders, guiding organizations through this

shift will be a challenge.

## From Systems of Workflow to Systems of Work

Most enterprise platforms—from Salesforce to Workday—treat

organizations as systems of workﬂows. Workﬂows are processes that

enable the organization to accomplish any task, from hiring and

onboarding an employee to prospecting and expanding customer

relationships. These workﬂows are then analyzed as information

processing systems that map data ﬂows, automate structured analyses,

and require users to input, monitor, and act on information within

# predeﬁned parameters.

Consider Workday. Its data architecture centers on employee

records, enabling payroll processing, performance reviews, training

management, and beneﬁts administration. Completing a task like “add

a new hire” or “change direct deposit” involves navigating this complex

software system with explicit steps built into the user interface.

Similarly, CRM systems like Salesforce deﬁne discrete sales stages,

requiring teams to categorize leads, update status ﬁelds, and trigger

follow-on actions. Over time, the CRM workﬂow becomes embedded in

# day-to-day routines.

By contrast, a system of work—powered by generative AI—treats

## organizations as goal-oriented task environments. Rather than

beginning with a detailed map of every step in every workﬂow, it

starts with the job to be done, as Harvard’s Clay Christensen famously

urged, and then infers the requisite actions. Under the hood, AI ingests

signals—from a wide range of structured and unstructured data—and

dynamically stitches together the tasks needed to reach the objective.

There is no rigid choreography of screens and forms; instead, the system

continuously learns from exceptions, adapts its recommendations, and

orchestrates handoﬀs across functions without manual scripting. In

eﬀect, it transforms unstructured inputs into structured execution,

reducing the burden on users to know the workﬂow architecture and

freeing them to focus solely on desired outcomes.

In a CRM context, an AI-driven system would analyze signals—emails,

call transcripts, proposal revisions—and automatically update a lead’s

status. It would learn from historical outcomes to reﬁne the underlying

process, eliminating manual data entry and reducing process latency.

## Likewise, complex queries—once the domain of data analysts

translating requests into structured query language (SQL)—become a

matter of simple conversational prompts: “How many qualiﬁed leads

converted to deals exceeding $100,000 in Germany this quarter?”

Generative AI systems can parse unstructured inputs, generate the

necessary database queries, and deliver answers in seconds.

## Why This Shift Matters: The Difference Between Workflow Software and AI Systems

This transformation is more than incremental. It redeﬁnes the

relationship between how work is designed and how work is executed.

Traditional workﬂow software operates much like an industrial

# assembly line:

- Sequential. Tasks are deﬁned as ordered steps.

- Explicit. Every action must be predeﬁned and authorized.

- Rigid. Adapting processes requires redesigning data models and

# interfaces.

- Expert-dependent. Eﬀective use demands deep knowledge of both

# the workﬂow and the application.

AI-enabled systems of work, in contrast, resemble a responsive

# organism:

- Fluid. Processes emerge dynamically in response to objectives and

# context.

- Implicit. Workﬂows are inferred from data patterns and user intent.

- Adaptable. The system learns from exceptions and reﬁnes processes

# continuously.

- User-centric. Interfaces rely on natural language or other intuitive

# modalities.

For example, onboarding a new employee in an AI-driven HR system

might be as simple as asking: “Initiate onboarding for Jane Doe.”

The system would then generate oﬀer letters, schedule orientation,

provision devices, and enroll the employee in beneﬁts—coordinating

## across multiple back-end systems without manual intervention.

In essence, legacy software encodes best practices from past

## implementation projects; generative AI invent best practices in real

time, continuously optimizing outcomes.

# This Shift Is Already Underway

This transformation is not hypothetical. Every day we see more

companies beginning to make shifts to reduce their reliance on legacy

software systems. They include:

- Klarna, the Swedish ﬁntech serving 85 million customers, announced

plans in 2024 to sunset major SaaS providers like Salesforce and

Workday in favor of internal AI-driven record systems. They started by

creating a consolidated database of their enterprise data using Neo4j

and then using LLM-driven tools to build specialized applications

using their own AI software stack.

- Engineers at the industrial giant Siemens are eschewing employee

## resource planning (ERP) systems in favor of home-grown

conversational AI bots that can query Siemens’ product lifecycle

platforms to investigate supply chain issues and cost overruns.

- Advanced healthcare systems like the Mayo Clinic are piloting

generative AI tools to assist physicians with clinical documentation,

synthesizing patient histories and drafting care plans.

- Financial institutions such as JP Morgan are equipping their research

analysts with tools that query vast amounts of historical and current

ﬁnancial data and draft near-complete research reports.

- At Hitachi Global, the HR organization used Ema Unlimited’s agentic platform to gain 70% operational eﬃciency for shared services across Hitachi’s four business divisions. The solution was conceived and

deployed across 120,000 employees in eight weeks.

Early adopters in every industry are seeing eﬃciency gains in the

20–30% range as well as expanding their oﬀerings by replacing or

augmenting rigid, enterprise-wide software systems with ﬂexible, user-

# driven generative AI tools.

The scale of potential disruption is immense. In 2023, global spending

on enterprise software reached $913 billion—up 12.4% year over year. Venture capital has poured billions into SaaS startups. Yet both

legacy vendors and insurgent SaaS players now face existential risk. (Disclosure: both authors have aﬃliations with venture capital ﬁrms

that hold investments in both AI and enterprise software companies.)

The initial wave will target single-purpose, high-volume processes such

## as expense reporting, job postings, applicant tracking, IT support, and

# sales compensation.

Expense reporting illustrates the contrast:

- Today. Employees manually enter dozens of ﬁelds—amount, date,

## category—select from dropdown menus, and route reports through

approval queues. Each step introduces friction, errors, and time

# delays.

- Tomorrow. An employee photographs a receipt, instructs the AI to

ﬁle the report, and—assuming policy compliance—the system extracts

line items, validates the expense against calendar entries, checks

policy rules, auto-approves the claim, and triggers reimbursement.

Capabilities for more complex domains—manufacturing planning,

## ﬁnancial forecasting, lead qualiﬁcation—are less than ﬁve years away.

# Implications and Leadership Response

The advent of generative AI transforming systems of workﬂow into

systems of work has profound implications for leaders. To steer the AI

transformation successfully, they will need to focus on the following key

# matters:

# Governance & Risk Management.

Establish robust data governance frameworks that ensure quality,

security, lineage, and compliance. Implement continuous monitoring

for model drift, bias, and regulatory adherence. Deﬁne clear human–

AI collaboration protocols that specify handoﬀ points, accountability,

and oversight to maintain trust and mitigate errors. Early attention

to governance will build trust in the AI system that can withstand

# inevitable early challenges.

# Organizational Readiness.

Recognize that careers centered on workﬂow software—

implementation, customization, and maintenance—will evolve or

diminish. Administrative teams in HR, ﬁnance, and IT will shrink or

redeploy, freeing talent for innovation and strategic work. Suppliers,

investors, and local economies anchored in software services will also

feel these shifts. Change management, especially for the humans who

will be aﬀected and will need to adapt will have to be thoughtfully

managed to enable and accelerate the transition to AI systems.

# Strategic Responses.

Appreciate that unless they proactively lead this transition, incumbent

enterprise software leaders will lose the advantages they enjoy to

disruptive upstarts. To retain their advantage, incumbents should:

- 1. Prioritize interoperability. Open APIs and modular architectures

enable federated AI ecosystems that integrate legacy systems and

# new agents.

- 2. Redesign UI/UX for conversational workﬂows. Replace standard form

ﬁlling user interfaces with natural language and voice interfaces to

# lower adoption barriers.

- 3. Oﬀer tiered AI adoption paths. Provide fully autonomous agents,

human-in-the-loop conﬁgurations, and hybrid options, allowing

customers to calibrate control and risk.

- 4. Focus on jobs to be done. Shift from automating rigid processes to

delivering measurable outcomes, empowering customers to articulate

objectives and letting AI determine the optimal workﬂow.

By unifying governance, organizational readiness, and strategic

responses within a cohesive leadership agenda, existing enterprises can

transform uncertainty into opportunity, positioning themselves at the

## forefront of the AI-driven workplace revolution.

. . .

Generative AI oﬀers a once-in-a-generation chance to reduce the cost

## and complexity of enterprise IT—liberating organizations from rigid

workﬂows and enabling work to be reimagined from scratch.

Leaders must broaden their horizons. Beyond enhancing existing

systems, they should envision composable, adaptive workplaces where

AI agents and humans collaborate seamlessly. Just as software ate the

world over the past 15 years, generative AI will now transform the

software that shaped today’s organizations—and, in doing so, redeﬁne

how we work for decades to come.
