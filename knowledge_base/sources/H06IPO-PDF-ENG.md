Since the pandemic began, there’s been a call for managers to

be understanding and lenient with employees as they navigate the

stressors the global crisis has brought on. Now that restrictions are

lifting in many parts of the world, some managers are wondering how

to continue to balance compassion for the people on their team and

accountability for getting work done. Should you oﬀer ﬂexibility around

deadlines and performance expectations even if it means missing

team targets? How can you be understanding about what people have

been through — and continue to go through — while holding them

accountable? And should you worry about being taken advantage of?

I posed these questions to several experts who study motivation and

compassion at work to see what advice they have to oﬀer managers at

this time, and across the board, they said now is not a time to let up

on the care and consideration you’ve shown your employees over the

past year. Nor should you push people without also considering what

they need emotionally. As Jane Dutton, a professor at the University

of Michigan’s Ross School of Business and coauthor of Awakening

Compassion at Work, puts it, “Being compassionate doesn’t mean you

have to lower your standards.” Rather than thinking of it as a trade-

oﬀ between compassion and accountability, think about how you can

combine the two.

Here’s some advice for how to navigate the seeming tension between

being caring and thoughtful and holding people to high standards.

Reframe how you think about the last year

Let’s be honest: It’s been a terrible year for most people, though

not everyone experienced the trauma of the pandemic, the ongoing

reckoning around racial inequalities, and the contentious U.S. election

in the same way. It can be easy to frame the past year as a wash — a

time when none of us were at our most productive. But that wouldn’t

be entirely fair. Rather than thinking, “We lowered our expectations,”

focus on everything you and your team did get done, suggests Linda

Hill, a professor at Harvard Business School and author of Being the

Boss. Chances are that it was a lot, accomplished in not particularly easy

circumstances. And instead of seeing the way you interacted with your

employees as “being lenient,” Hill says to think of it as “being ﬂexible,

which is the right thing to do.”

And reframe how you think about motivating employees

You may also need to rethink your assumptions about what motivates

employees. If you see compassion and accountability as opposite sides

of a coin, says Dutton, you’re thinking about it wrong. Many managers

believe they need to be tough to get people to produce, but the research

doesn’t support that. In fact, adding stress to an employee’s workday

can result in what’s called a “threat rigidity eﬀect,” where people who

feel they’re under threat focus on what they already know how to do and

fail to be creative or innovative.

You may be able to “extract labor” from people in the short term, says

Dutton, but over the long term, it has the opposite eﬀect. In other words,

coming down hard on people rarely works, especially if they’re already

suﬀering. “At a purely instrumental strategic level, you’re not going to

get the results you want if you add stress to people’s lives,” says Jacob

Hirsh, an associate professor at the University of Toronto. He says that

part of a manager’s job is to create a psychologically safe workplace

— and if you do that for your team members, it will be far easier to

then ask them to do their part. According to Dutton’s research, “People’s

response to compassion is often to invest more in the organization.”

So being compassionate and caring is not just a nice thing to do — it’s

# critical to performance.

Don’t ignore the reality

Now that we’re 18 months into this crisis, and many people are trying

to return to some semblance of normalcy in their lives, you might

assume that you can go back to a pre-pandemic level of productivity.

But don’t ignore the fact that most people are still feeling burned out. “We are all depleted,” says Dutton, and reopening oﬃces isn’t going to

make that go away. “It’s not going to be a stress-free world,” says Hirsh.

“There’s always going to be something going on in people’s lives.” He

also cautions that the “old style” of dealing with mental health at work

— essentially keeping it hidden and pretending it doesn’t exist — just

doesn’t work. We know now that people want to be able to talk openly

## about mental health issues in their workplaces.

What if you feel taken advantage of?

If some of your team members have been requesting accommodations

over the past year, such as extensions on deadlines, reduced workload,

or time oﬀ to take care of their mental health, it’s possible that you

might feel taken advantage of, especially if you’ve been giving your job

your all and getting your work done without such accommodations.

There’s a temptation, says Hirsh, for managers to think, “If I can endure

this, why can’t you?” But that line of thinking — and any attempt to

compare suﬀering and resilience — isn’t helpful. Everyone’s situation

is unique, of course. So don’t go down the rabbit hole wondering if

particular employees are using the situation to their advantage. As Hill

says, “You’re better oﬀ helping them with their burnout rather than

focusing on whether that person is making inappropriate use of your

# leniency.”

Instead, deal with underperformance directly. If someone isn’t able

to do their job according to expectations, understand why and talk

through, together, how you can address the root causes. Hirsh suggests

you consider: “Is it their motivation? Is it stress? Is it the workﬂow? Is

it a lack of training? Where are things actually hurting here? And then

focus in on that.” Hill suggests that you consider the team as a whole. If

the entire team is struggling to be productive, then you’ve got to address

## these issues at the group level, not just the individual one.

# Focus on resilience

Resilience plays an important role. “The limiting factor for many

employees is going to be how they handle stress and everything going

on in their lives. Some people handle it ﬁne — it’s part of their

disposition to be able to manage the stress. Others will need more

support,” says Hirsh. This is especially true for anyone who bore the

## brunt of the trauma and grief over the past year.

Hirsh adds that rather than wondering when you can stop asking people

how they’re doing, you should be thinking, “How can we help you

manage your life and perform better?” While it doesn’t fall solely on

you, as their manager, to help a struggling employee to build their

resilience, you can play a role. As Dutton says, “It requires extra

imagination and diligence to strengthen people.” But it pays dividends

in terms of performance and commitment when you do.

One way to motivate your team, especially when they’re under ongoing

stress, is to show them the progress they’ve made. “Help people see

how they’ve grown over the past year to sustain positive momentum,”

says Dutton. You might ask people to share whether they’ve honed or

discovered new skills or abilities during the pandemic (making it clear

that it’s OK if they didn’t). You also want to connect them to the purpose

behind their work. “Bathe people with the positive impact of their work.

It’s like a booster shot — physiologically and psychologically,” she says.

Have individual conversations — and plans

This all requires that you talk with your team members one on one so

you understand their unique circumstances. Don’t assume you know

what those are, even if you’ve been in close contact. Things shift. Hill

says, “Make it safe for them to tell you about what’s happening in their

lives and how that’s impacting their work so you can ﬁgure out the best

way to move forward.” At the same time, she suggests you make clear

what the job requires. You might say, “This is the work you need to get

done. Is that possible?” And then listen to what they think is feasible.

Taking into account the circumstances, you can then decide together

what makes sense going forward. Don’t feel like you need to tolerate

sustained underperformance, though. “If they’re not being productive

and you’ve made it clear what’s required for the job, and they can’t do

that, then you have a decision to make,” explains Hill. After all, you do

need someone to do that work.

Take it to the group

One of the best ways to encourage accountability is to do it at the

group level. Rather than pushing individuals, ﬁnd ways to have team

members keep each other accountable. As Hirsh says, “Accountability is

a collective goal, and it works best if the team can ﬁnd a way that we

are all achieving.” So sit down as a group and problem solve together.

Hill suggests you say something like, “OK, let’s assume these are the

conditions we have to work under for another six months. How can we

best do our work? And how can we improve our work together?”

# Take care of yourself

While taking care of your employees, don’t lose sight of yourself. You’re

likely feeling the same stress as your team members and the pressure

to produce results. “Managers are caught in the middle, as they often

are,” says Hirsh. It’s a tall order to be “meeting targets set by upper

## management and caring for the well-being of employees at the same

time,” he says. “There’s additional pressure of trying to navigate through

uncertainty and heightened conﬂict.” So be sure to take the time to take

care of yourself. That includes getting a good night’s sleep, eating well,

exercising, and making sure you have the support you need.

Given how tiring it is to be constantly worrying about your team while

also trying to meet goals, it’s tempting to try to pull back on compassion.

But it’s important to stick with it. Of course you need to be realistic

about what you can and can’t do for people, but Dutton urges managers

to think of compassion as “an investment in your people.” She adds, “it’s

an investment that has a huge payoﬀ.”
