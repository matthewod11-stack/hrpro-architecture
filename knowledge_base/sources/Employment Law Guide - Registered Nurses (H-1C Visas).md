# Section 212(m) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, (INA) (http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?

(8 USC §1101 et seq.(http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/8/1101.html); 20 CFR Part 655(http://ecfr.gpoaccess.gov/cgi/t/text/text-idx?

The Nursing Relief for Disadvantaged Areas Act of 1999 and its reauthorization in December of 2006 allows qualifying hospitals to employ temporary foreign workers (nonimmigrants) as Registered Nurses (RNs) for up to three years under H-1C visas. Only 500

H-1C visas can be issued each year during the three-year period of the H-1C program (2006-2009).

# The Oﬃce of Foreign Labor Certiﬁcation(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-labor) (OFLC) of the Employment and Training

# Administration (ETA)(http://www.doleta.gov/) administers the labor attestation process of the H-1C program. The H-1C program

applies to employers seeking to hire registered nurses at hospitals/facilities only in certain disadvantaged areas. The provision sunsets December 19, 2009.

The Immigration and Nationality Act (INA) restricts the employers eligible to participate in the H-1C program. Only hospitals in

health professional shortage areas as deﬁned by the Public Health Service Act and qualiﬁed based on the cost reporting period of ﬁscal year 1994 under Title XVIII of the Social Security Act may ﬁle applications for foreign registered nurses under the H-1C

program. The employer must attest to the attestations located in 20 CFR 655.1111 through 655.1118.

The Wage and Hour Division(http://www.wagehour.dol.gov/) investigates and resolves complaints that the employer failed to meet

conditions to which it attested. Complaints about such matters should be ﬁled with a local Wage and Hour Division

## oﬃce(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact/local-oﬃces).

All appropriate protections under U.S labor laws apply to workers under a temporary labor certiﬁcation from the Department of

# Labor.

No facility may intimidate, threaten, restrain, coerce, blacklist, discharge, or in any manner discriminate against any person because such person has ﬁled a complaint, testiﬁed, sought counsel, or asserted or exercised any rights on behalf of himself or

# others.

There are speciﬁc notice and posting requirements relating to the Attestations and petitions.

Notice of the ﬁling of the Attestation Form ETA 9081(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/eta/foreign-laborpdf/eta9081.pdf) must be provided

by the facility to the bargaining representative of the registered nurses at the facility immediately upon ﬁling with the Department of

Labor. Notice of the ﬁling of the petition must also be provided by the facility to the bargaining representative for the nurses on the date of such transmission to the Department of Homeland Security. If there is no bargaining representative, a written notice must

be posted at two or more conspicuous locations at the facility. In the alternative, electronic notice may be given by whatever

means the employer normally communicates with its employees (e.g., e-mail or home webpage). The notice may be either a copy

of the Attestation or petition, or a document stating that the Attestation or petition has been ﬁled and is available for review at the

facility. The petition notice must remain posted for 10 days. The Attestation notice must either be posted for the duration of the validity period or sent to the individual e-mail addresses of each nurse.

The notice must include the following statement: "Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the Attestation or

failure to comply with the terms of the Attestation may be ﬁled with any oﬃce of the Wage and Hour Division of the U.S.

# Department of Labor."

Within 30 days of the date of the ﬁling of the Attestation, a copy must be provided to all registered nurses employed at the facility

either by individual e-mail, or by posting and delivering the nurse a hard copy.

The facility must maintain a separate ﬁle available to any interested parties within 72 hours upon written or oral request containing a copy of various documents, including the attestation, the prevailing wage determination, description of the facility's pay system

(or copy of the pay schedule), and copies of all notices required by the regulations.

The facility must maintain its payroll records for at least three years, and make the records available if there is an enforcement

# action.

There are no reporting requirements.

The Department of Labor may assess a civil money penalty not to exceed $1,000 per nurse per violation, with the total penalty not to exceed $10,000 per violation. The Department also may impose appropriate remedies, including the payment of back wages,

the performance of attested obligations such as providing training, and reinstatement and/or wages for laid oﬀ U.S. nurses.

Various Federal, state, and local labor standards, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, will apply to foreign workers employed in the U.S.

# Compliance Assistance Available
