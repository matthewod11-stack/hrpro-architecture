your industry, and stay ripe for opportunities depends on the strength

## of your professional relationships and communication skills.

Just like any other currency, social capital can be earned, invested, and

spent. When it comes to your professional longevity, there is no greater

fortune than your worth in social capital. So how much do you have in

# your bank?

## What Social Capital Is and How I Leveraged It

Earning social capital is dependent on our ability to work together eﬀectively by having a shared set of values and working toward

a common goal. In a corporate environment, it makes employees

## more collaborative, but for remote employees, solo entrepreneurs, or

members of the gig economy, it is non-negotiable to success. Couple

that with the challenges of a hybrid or remote work environment, and it is the diﬀerence between being considered for an opportunity, ruled

out, or completely forgotten.

When I left my 17-year corporate career at a luxury brand to pursue

consulting, I went from being a member of a large corporate oﬃce

to working remotely and independently. Without my executive title

and the credibility of being employed by a well-known retail group, I

could only lean on myself when pursuing new business. My nearly two

decades of accrued social capital bolstered my ability to have my calls

returned and my emails responded to.

I understood the value of staying connected to my network and showing

a genuine interest in their careers while sharing my future ambitions for

consulting projects. I checked in on important contacts to inquire how

they were and what they were working on during a time when I didn’t

need to ask for anything. I sought them out on social media to amplify

and support their content shares and to keep my name top of mind.

When it was time to pitch ideas or ask for favors, I wrote persuasive emails expressing my request and oﬀering support in return. I valued

people’s time and made sure to write succinctly and directly. I have

always believed that being accessible makes you indispensable, so I

stayed on top of my inbox to guarantee my responsive communication

was swift. I knew being readily available for whatever came my way

was vital. If my outreach met silence, I followed up again appropriately

# within a week.

Once I conﬁrmed a project, I knew it was my job to communicate

proactively. As a remote consultant, I needed to let management know

that I was abreast of my work while also making meaningful

connections with the team I was working with. In addition, that

ensured that I received up-to-the-minute information. When you are

not physically present, it is easy for others to forget they need to

communicate directives beyond their four walls. I needed to stay on

people’s radars and demonstrate reliability. A good result with one

client would naturally lead to a subsequent referral.

The same issues can also aﬀect a corporate remote employee. When you

don’t have the luxury of proximity, it’s easy to get left behind and feel a sense of loneliness. Remote employees need to make a greater eﬀort

to actively participate in the company culture than people physically in

the oﬃce. That means they, too, need to communicate proactively and sometimes overcommunicate, while also making a concerted eﬀort to have virtual coﬀees with teammates.

Hybrid employees that straddle in-person and remote life typically have

the bulk of the meeting load crammed into their in-oﬃce days. That requires them to balance their relationship-building eﬀorts and focus

on more than just the colleagues they physically see.

## The Skills and Values Needed to Build Social Capital

What makes one person accrue social capital versus another? It comes

## down to your principles, work ethic, and, sometimes, your ability to

organize yourself.

If you have strong principles and a steadfast work ethic, you naturally

want to do right by someone. You want to complete that task no matter

what it takes because you committed to it, and not following through

would hurt you as much as it would disappoint someone else. I believe

your word should mean something. When you say you’re going to do

something, following through is tallied and judged on your professional

# scorecard.

Even so, if you’re working to improve your executive functioning

(organizing, prioritizing, etc.) or your skills in managing yourself,

drafting a to-do list might not be suﬃcient. Instead, consider making

meetings with yourself to block the time for each task on your calendar.

This can help you accomplish what you need to in the assigned

timeframe and will support you in delivering on your word.

Despite the clear beneﬁt in doing what you say you will, how many

times has someone promised you that they would make an introduction

for you but then ghosted you? Can you count how often someone owed

you something that was done incompletely or past a deadline? There

are way too many instances to count. The risk of unfulﬁlled promises

is that when you fail to deliver, you become labeled as someone who is

# unreliable.

Conversely, I’m sure you can easily name the people you know you can

count on and who earn the covetable reputation of consistently being

great to work with. You are conﬁdent these people can deliver whatever

you ask of them well and on time. Because of this, you are likely to call

on them repeatedly. You will think about these people even when they

are not in the room. In doing so, they have earned social capital with

# you.

Unlike money, which can compound when left alone if appropriately

invested, social capital can be sustained only with connection and

relationship maintenance. A once-positive reputation can become negative if an eﬀort is not made to sustain it. Take work references, for

example. You can’t assume someone who vouched for your work several

years ago would go out on a limb for you today if you haven’t put in the eﬀort to maintain that relationship. Social capital can expire, and if you

are not careful, you might ﬁnd yourself checking your bank account one

day and discovering a zero balance.

Follow these ﬁve tips to make sure you’re maintaining this positive

regard in every relationship you navigate, especially when you are not

# face-to-face:

- 1. Be gracious with your time. If you are on a team, raising your hand

to support someone else’s project or going beyond the scope of your role

to help others will make you an invaluable and memorable colleague.

It is how people establish a collaborative reputation and often get

identiﬁed for internal mobility. If you have a goal to one day move into a diﬀerent department of your organization, proactively doing this can

# yield powerful results.

For independent contractors, no one wants to work for less than they are worth or for free, and most people cannot aﬀord to, but sometimes

it’s strategic and acceptable to do so. For example, if you know that

working with this client will add credibility and valuable experience to

your business, and is likely to signal to other clients that you do good

work, it might be worth it. Even so, this is not something you want to do

as a regular practice. Always weigh the pros and cons.

When you do something as a favor for someone when necessary, you

have taken your ﬁrst step in building social capital with that person.

Furthermore, doing so, especially to gain experience in an area where you may need expertise, eﬀectively ﬁlls that skillset void. Negotiating a

testimonial as part of your fee is strategic and acceptable. It can build

your credibility and be a valuable asset on your website or secure a

# referral in the future.

- 2. Communicate strategically and with intention. The most critical

factor to success when you’re behind a screen is ensuring your

communication is written to inspire action. First, consider your

timing. Whether you’re sending a pitch, catching up on email, or

sending updates on projects, make sure you’re considering where your

colleagues are. Just because you don’t mind emailing after hours doesn’t mean others do or can. Or perhaps you are in a diﬀerent time

zone. Send or schedule your emails to be delivered within your shared

working hours to increase your odds of real-time response.

Second, your words need to connect with the reader. That begins with

understanding who you are addressing. Often, people forget to consider

their audience. They focus on what they want to say and ignore who

is on the other side. Do some research to understand the recipient’s

experience or point of view. If you are pitching an idea, it is always

beneﬁcial to understand what has been done before and what they

might be looking for.

When setting expectations, make sure your words are backed by action.

Accurately assess your capabilities and deliver on that. Or better yet,

exceed expectations. Make your words mean something.

- 3. Track your efforts. As your career progresses, keeping track of

your network inside and outside the company becomes increasingly

complex, primarily if you work remotely. While it may take slightly more eﬀort, maintaining a spreadsheet of your networking interactions and

referrals will be tremendously valuable. Not only will this assist you in

relationship management, it will support you in connecting the dots

between people. For example, if an introduction from a friend resulted

in a new client, you will want to remember who to thank in the future. It

will also help you monitor when it is time to follow up with people.

- 4. Stay on top of your inbox. “Inbox zero” is a lofty goal for many,

but managing all your forms of communication will allow you to take

advantage of every opportunity. Utilize tools like inbox labels and ﬁlters

to help organize yourself. Being a speedy responder shows people you

are eﬃcient and reliable. In a world inundated with messaging coming

from every direction, being quick to respond is a superpower and is

valued dearly. If colleagues know you are accessible, you will become

someone known as “good to work with.” While everyone needs work-life

balance, quickly scrolling through your emails after hours just to ensure nothing critical came in could mean the diﬀerence between putting out

a ﬁre or jumping on an opportunity. This is especially important if you

# work with people across time zones.

If you’re diﬃcult to get in touch with, the opposite holds. You may

become labeled as someone who cannot be depended on and may be

passed over for opportunities. It’s best practice to ensure that people

are responded to within a reasonable amount of time (ideally no longer

than two business days). Even if you don’t have the answer yet, letting

someone know that you’re working on it will give them peace of mind

that their email was in fact received. In addition, and as a gentle

reminder, if you communicate with team members on tech tools like

Slack, remember that your teammates can see when you are actively

# online or not.

- 5. Be generous and practice gratitude. Lending unsolicited support and amplifying another person’s eﬀorts go a long way. It is also never too late to thank someone for an opportunity. There is no expiration date on

gratitude. Thanking someone is also an underrated way to get back in

touch. In addition, if you are someone who reaches out to your network to ask how they are while asking for nothing — or even better, to oﬀer

support and take a sincere interest in what they are doing — you will

ﬁnd yourself ﬂush with social capital. A simple way to do this is to say,

“Your name popped into my head today, and I wanted to reach out to

see how you are.”

. . .

Remember that your credentials can’t speak for themselves; they need

to be bolstered by the relationships that you are fostering along the

way. Your social capital ensures your professional longevity, especially

when you are not physically present. For any type of professional, your

connections are as meaningful as what you know and the skills you

have. Even from afar, the most signiﬁcant opportunities will always

# stem from your trusted reputation.
