Why do so many high-performing professionals keep working at a

punishing pace, even when it damages their health, relationships,

and personal well-being? And why do organizational attempts to

## curb these extreme work hours—no-email-after-hours policies, mental

health initiatives, or wellness seminars—so often fail?

## HBR / Digital Article / New Research on Why Teams Overwork—and What Leaders Can…

Our forthcoming research reveals a powerful and often overlooked

mechanism driving this behavior: the “entrainment cycle.” Drawing on

more than 150 interviews in global law and accounting ﬁrms, we found

that professionals become emotionally and physically synchronized

with their organization’s relentless tempo, creating a powerful feedback

loop that locks them into a culture of overwork.

While high-tempo work cultures may appear eﬃcient and proﬁtable in

the short term, the long-term costs for organizations are substantial—

and often underestimated. These can include burnout-driven attrition

(particularly among high performers); limited space and time for

## creativity; lower productivity and higher rates of errors; and an

## unusually fragile work culture—all reliant on the adrenaline of constant

## motion. In moments of slowdown or crisis, such as economic downturns

or leadership transitions, this pace-dependent loyalty can evaporate,

leaving disengaged teams, quiet quitting, or sudden departures in its

wake, as seen during the Covid-19 pandemic.

So what can organizations do to future-proof themselves against the

heavy costs associated with high tempos? We draw upon our study to oﬀer insight into what causes entrainment cycles, how to break them,

and what companies should do instead to maintain proﬁtability while

supporting employee health, well-being, and retention.

# The Costs of Entrainment

In many elite professional service ﬁrms, long hours are more than

just a habit—they’re a way of life. Employees routinely work evenings,

weekends, and holidays, not simply because they’re told to, or they’re

particularly driven or “type-A,” but because they’ve come to feel that

pace is normal—even necessary.

Our study found that these high-tempo organizations share similar

characteristics, including:

- Formal timekeeping systems, like utilization rates and timesheets,

which push employees to track every half hour, fostering a constant

# sense of urgency.

- Career advancement systems (e.g., up-or-out promotion models

## and performance evaluation systems) that challenge professionals to

continually meet escalating performance targets year after year.

- Cultural expectations—reinforced by managers and peers—that

frame overwork as virtuous and normal, making boundary-setting feel

# like disengagement.

Together, these performance management and control systems don’t

just inﬂuence behavior; they shape how people feel when they’re

working—and when they’re not.

Our research found that when employees fall out of sync with their

## companies (for example, during holidays or quiet periods), they often

## experience negative emotions such as anxiety, boredom, guilt, and even

physical withdrawal symptoms. One woman partner in an audit ﬁrm

described falling ill at the start of holidays—a typical example of the let-down eﬀect, a phenomenon where the body, after prolonged stress,

becomes vulnerable to illness as stress hormone levels drop.

## The interplay between the positive reinforcement professionals

experience when synchronized with intense work patterns and their

adverse reactions when they’re out of sync exerts a strong psychological

and embodied grip on individuals. This makes it challenging for them

to disengage from the rhythms of work, even when the personal costs

## become apparent. As a male partner in a law ﬁrm notes:

When I’m busy, generally speaking, I am more energized…When I’m

not busy then the pressures that come with not being busy because of

all the ﬁnancial metrics and all that sort of thing that we’re judged

against…It can be a nightmare because…You get down on yourself

and then you’re probably like a bear with a sore head at home as well.

# Why People Stay in the Cycle

Employees in the study often described the fast-paced tempo of

work not as something they were forced into, but as something they

## craved—or at least couldn’t function well without. One described

the “adrenaline” of deadlines; another admitted they became “bored” without it. Even physical health was aﬀected: One participant’s

Apple Watch showed a sharp rise in resting heart rate during busy

seasons, while others described taking antidepressants to get through

particularly demanding periods, and others mentioned excessive

drinking to try to decompress.

Critically, even when professionals tried to disconnect—during leave,

illness, or family emergencies—the ﬁrm’s tempo lingered in their

minds. They feared falling behind, missing opportunities, or appearing

less committed. As one participant, a partner in a law ﬁrm, told us:

“When we’re on holiday, I’d like to check that there’s nothing, otherwise

I panic that there’s something happening that I don’t know about.

And the children do notice that and they don’t like it.” Similarly,

in an attempt to minimize the disruption of work on family time,

another participant reported hiding in the bathroom to call a client on

# Christmas day.

One ﬁnding of our research was that the more people became

synchronized with their organization’s rhythm, the more estranged they

became from their own biological rhythm and the rhythm of their

family life. For example, many participants reported skipping meals,

experiencing sleep disturbances, and connecting with work during

holidays with loved ones. This deep internalization of organizational

rhythms means that even voluntary overwork is not necessarily a sign of

engagement—it can be a sign of organizational entrapment.

# Breaking the Cycle: What Leaders Can Do

The entrainment cycle is subtle but powerful. But organizations can

design interventions to loosen its grip—if they understand what they’re

up against. Here’s where to start:

# Address the tempo, not just the hours.

To break entrainment, organizations must change how work is done.

That means, for instance, rethinking project pacing, reducing artiﬁcial

urgency, and redesigning calendars to allow for focus and reﬂection. It

implies a shift from reactive busyness to proactive planning.

One example of a systemic intervention is the introduction of a

four-day workweek. If done thoughtfully, this restructure sets a ﬁrm

boundary that forces teams to prioritize, streamline, and recalibrate

their tempo—not just compress the same overload into fewer days. Rather than individuals managing their calendars diﬀerently, the entire

organization shifts its operating cadence, prioritizing greater work-life

balance. In 2021, the United Kingdom–based Atom Bank shifted to

a four-day workweek without cutting employee pay. This wasn’t just

about fewer hours; it meant redesigning meetings, project cycles, and

planning norms. After two years, the company reported that the shift

had led to lower absenteeism, improved morale, sustained productivity

# —and better proﬁtability.

In order to address the constant pressure to be “on,” Basecamp, a

software company known for its project management tools, prioritizes

asynchronous communication and minimal meetings, encouraging

employees to take their time writing emails rather than being bound

to responding to real-time chats or hopping on to last-minute calls.

This allows team members to respond on their own schedules and

work without fear of missing something, fostering deeper focus and

# meaningful engagement.

Another example of a useful change to break entrainment cycles is

German automaker Mercedes-Benz’s “Mail on Holiday” email policy,

which ensures its employees are taking full advantage of their time oﬀ, without fearing an overﬂowing inbox when they return. Through

this policy, emails received during holidays are auto-deleted, and a

note is sent to the sender, conveying that they will need to reach out

once the employee has returned to the oﬃce. This allows employees

to disconnect from the oﬃce rhythm without anxiety about missing

something. Moreover, quite often, the fear of coming back from the

holiday and facing an inbox full of hundreds of messages made many

## employees in our study check and delete unnecessary emails during

holidays. One interviewee reported feeling the need to delete messages

even while in the queue to see the historic Sagrada Família in Barcelona.

While this policy is optional at Mercedes Benz, it provides a good model

for what organizations can do help interrupt harmful synchronization.

Watch for warning signs—and keep making adjustments.

One reason entrainment is so powerful is because it’s invisible. Over-

synchronized employees often appear committed and productive, but

beneath the surface, they may be struggling to disconnect, experiencing

sleep problems, or losing a sense of purpose—compulsion disguised as

# dedication.

The U.S.–based marketing company Buﬀer oﬀers a good example of a

company that has made both systemic changes to address overwork

while continuing to monitor how its employees are feeling. In 2020,

it introduced a four-day workweek alongside weekly “energy check”

surveys that ask employees about ﬂow, overwhelm, and engagement.

The data helps managers adjust workloads and prevent burnout. After

the rollout, employees reported feeling more productive, and objective productivity among the engineering staﬀ also increased. However, after

some employees noted that they struggled to complete tasks in fewer days during busy seasons, Buﬀer created a more ﬂuid system, allowing

the ﬁfth day to become, if necessary, an overﬂow day. However, if a ﬁfth

day is used, employees are told to compensate by working less other

# weeks.

Another thing large companies can do to stay attentive to employees’

well-being is to start leveraging the data to proactively detect and address early signs of over-entrainment in diﬀerent teams or

departments. For example, the auditing/consulting ﬁrm PwC uses

## an AI-driven mental health platform, Teale, which, through various

tools including an AI-powered coach, provides monthly anonymized

dashboards (with aggregated data to protect employee privacy). This

dashboard enables managers to gain strategic insight into workload

## distribution, team dynamics, and overall organizational climate

reported by employees. It allows managers to spot signs of stress,

disengagement, and burnout early, and respond before issues escalate.

. . .

While our research focuses on professional service ﬁrms—particularly

in law and accounting/consulting—many of the dynamics we observed,

## such as organizational entrainment and the costs of constant

synchronization, are highly relevant to any high-tempo, project-based

organization. If leaders want sustainable performance, they must break

the link between speed and success—and help their teams ﬁnd a more

human pace. This implies creating a new collective rhythm at a more

human-centered tempo, rather than forcing individuals to follow the

# relentless organizational rhythm.

Additionally, people should feel that they have the cultural permission

to pause. It is not enough to change schedules—companies have to

change expectations. Taking breaks, disconnecting on non-work days,

and ignoring the inbox when on holidays should become organizational

norms, not individual exceptions. The emotional sync with work

intensity could thus be disrupted, allowing people to develop healthier

# personal rhythms.
