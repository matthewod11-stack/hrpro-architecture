Mergers and acquisitions (M&As) are highly anticipated, high-stakes

events. When successful, they are one of the fastest ways for

organizations to accelerate growth and increase shareholder returns.

But closing a deal is typically a culmination of months, sometimes

## years, of negotiating, due diligence, and planning. Despite this

signiﬁcant investment of time and resources, many M&As do not

# achieve pre-deal expectations.

Why is that the case? Through our research and work with

organizations, we have found that while companies’ pre-deal due

diligence is often strong, there tends to be a lack of focus on the day-

to-day experiences of the acquired employees, which can have serious

negative implications for the success of the deal. For acquiring ﬁrms,

planning for the employee integration experience is just as important

for achieving deal value as other, more traditional, steps of the due

# diligence process.

Our recommendations for managing the employee integration journey

have emerged most recently from over 70 hours of interviews and

focus groups with acquired employees across 15 acquisitions of a large

multinational organization that routinely acquires companies. The

acquisitions we analyzed included organizations of all sizes, operating

## across diﬀerent industries and sectors and in diﬀerent geographic

locations. Our work facilitating M&As and change management with

a variety of ﬁrms over the years also supports our ﬁndings and the

guidance we give here.

We found that, on the whole, acquired employees generally felt

## underutilized, undervalued, underinformed, and in need of support

and guidance to navigate tangible and intangible elements of the

integration. They often felt voiceless and struggled to adapt throughout

the acquisition, integration process, and beyond. This ambiguity creates

feelings of overwhelm and stress. One acquired employee told us that

the acquisition news “felt like someone in her family had died.” This

matches our own observations of the ﬁrms we’ve worked with, where

we’ve seen that these sentiments are not only a common employee

experience, but also have serious implications for the ﬁrm and the deal’s

# success.

One organization we work with uncovered a consistent pain

point across their acquisitions: Acquired employees reported lower

engagement than legacy employees, and this discrepancy persisted

## ﬁve years and counting after the integration. Employee engagement

has important implications for proﬁt and customer satisfaction, and

employee turnover during times of critical organizational change is, at

best, harmful for productivity and, at worst, diminishes the value of the

acquisition. Ironically, the most common sentiment shared by acquired

employees was their desire to bring their own contributions and insights

to the newly integrated ﬁrm, not just the acquired ﬁrm’s technology

and products. And, when acquiring ﬁrms made even ad hoc attempts to

understand or accommodate newly acquired employees, those were met

with gratitude and increased buy-in.

The challenges faced by acquired employees may seem unavoidable,

but they’re not. They can be prevented by due diligence and planning

around the acquired employee integration experience, which is similar

to the due diligence and planning the acquiring ﬁrm does around other

aspects of the deal. Organizations can provide better experiences for

their acquired employees by deploying culture assessments, planning

for culture integration, creating a journey map, empowering mid-level

leaders, and remaining ﬂexible in executing the transition.

# Conduct a Culture Assessment

A robust culture assessment should include an organization-wide

## survey, focus groups across departments, and interviews with

key leaders to learn about the cultural compatibility of the two

organizations. These don’t need to be M&A-focused instruments; we’ve

used Denison Organizational Culture Survey and GlobeSmart (a for-pay

service) in the past. For companies where M&As are a pillar of strategy,

consider creating your own in-house assessment. Do this work during

## the due diligence phase of the acquisition (if possible) or immediately

# post-close.

In our experience, organizations tend to assess the culture of the

company they are acquiring but often fail to assess the culture of

their own organization. Understanding your own organizational culture

will help you determine which aspects of culture to prioritize during

integration. Plus, a thorough understanding of both cultures will help

you determine what you’ll need to do to successfully bring them

# together.

Organizations can ﬁnd designing these assessments overwhelming.

We suggest focusing on decision-making and risk-taking, which are

universally important aspects in which merged cultures must align.

Beyond that, we suggest looking at the cultural assessment of your own

organization to determine the highest-scoring dimensions. Those are

strengths of your culture and areas you will want to focus on.

## Analyze the results of the assessment as well as your business context

and acquisition strategy to deﬁne the objectives for your cultural

integration. Will you aim to blend the cultures? Assimilate one into

the other? Retain the individual cultures? And what do you expect

the tension points to be, given the diﬀerences in cultural values?

For example, when organizations diverge in how they approach risk-

taking and innovation, this misalignment can have ramiﬁcations for

the company’s competitive edge well into the future. In one acquisition

we reviewed, a legacy company’s risk-averse approach to innovation

collided with the risk-taking attitude of an innovative company they

acquired, resulting in delays in developing cutting-edge technology that

was expected as part of the deal.

Finally, if the integration is taking place across international borders,

consider the impact of national culture, as diﬀerences can inﬂuence

how individuals approach decision-making and rule adherence. For

instance, diversity of perspectives can be either valued or discouraged

depending upon the cultural context, but research has shown that a

mismatch between organizations on this issue can cause a culture clash

and impede success.

# Craft a Culture Integration Plan

Next, create a plan to achieve your integration objectives. This plan

should identify actions and resources you need to eﬀectively execute

the integration, addressing the areas that came up in your analysis of

# the results of the culture assessment.

Include ways to address the potential areas of defensiveness or

resistance to the acquiring ﬁrm and its culture that you identiﬁed.

Most often, this requires your organization to communicate and sell the

“why” behind your approach in a way that resonates with the employees

of the acquired company.

When one of our clients—a large, multinational ﬁrm—acquired a small,

## highly innovative start-up, our client’s conversations with leaders of the

acquired company revealed diﬀerences in the ﬁrms’ decision-making

strategies. Our client’s objective was to assimilate the acquired ﬁrm into

its culture, and that meant helping the acquired employees become

more deliberate in their decision-making. Instead of simply imposing

new processes without discussion, our client acknowledged the

diﬀerences between the companies and communicated the rationale for

## their slower, more deliberate decision-making process in great detail as

they integrated workstreams. As newly acquired employees experienced

the process for the ﬁrst time, it became apparent to them how multiple

rounds of input strengthened the product and increased the likelihood

of approval and long-term success. The ﬁrm’s clear demonstration of the

rationale behind the change made acquired employees feel heard and

included in the adoption of the new process.

## Create a Journey Map of the Employee Experience

As part of your overall integration plan, create an employee journey

map: a detailed guide of what phases, changes, and milestones acquired

employees will face over the next 12–24 months.

In our observations of M&As, we see acquiring companies typically go

## into the integration phase with a pretty robust plan, but they rarely

think about what the employee’s experience will look like. Mapping

that out early on will allow you to identify key touchpoints and pain

points to plan for, such as systems employees use to gain information,

HR systems that help them utilize their beneﬁts, and everyday items

that help them complete their work or administrative tasks—from

redesigned logos to ID badges. Thinking about the employee journey

as part of the larger M&A process will help you anticipate and manage

aspects of integration that might otherwise get overlooked, such as

deactivating old employee badges before the new ones have been

distributed. Some of these may seem minor, but when they are missed,

it wreaks havoc.

The journey map will also inform what resources you’ll need to

assemble and in what format. Consider a mix of written or automated

support along with live, face-to-face options. While automated support

is typically more cost-eﬀective and scalable, live, targeted support is

## best utilized for systems integrations, beneﬁts, and decision-making

questions speciﬁcally, especially when the issues involved are unique to

the employee. For example, one employee’s experience prior to parental

leave was made more stressful because the information she needed

couldn’t be found on the beneﬁts webpage, and she had a hard time

identifying who to turn to for more information. Access to an HR

specialist would have helped.

Finally, when communicating with acquired employees, be clear about

what will stay the same and be transparent about decisions that have

yet to be made. A common frustration among acquired employees was

being told one thing only for it to change later; a better approach is

just admitting you don’t know the answer yet. Update the journey map

regularly as new information becomes available.

# Empower Mid-Level Managers

In our experience, mid-level managers across both organizations are

## key to the success of the cultural integration process. Their people

are directed to go to them with questions, and they are the ones

who must translate the big-picture vision of the integration into day-

to-day eﬀorts. (As one acquired employee relayed to us, whether

or not acquired employees felt heard during the integration process

depended entirely on their manager.) But, as we’ve seen in our work

and elsewhere, often mid-level managers are left on the periphery of

integration conversations. And while they are often quite motivated by

early integration announcements, their excitement tends to fade when

they aren’t given the information or tools they need to execute.

## Instead, equip mid-level managers with robust information and a

## clear understanding of their decision rights and responsibilities in the

## integration process. Include them early and consistently in integration

conversations—we recommend regular webinars with a Q&A portion—

and encourage them to ﬁeld questions and concerns from their teams to

bring to top leadership as part of these conversations.

# Prepare to Course Correct

Any plan needs to be ﬂexible in the face of new information, and that is

particularly true when considering the employee experience in an M&A

situation. Rigidity in the face of newly uncovered information about

the acquired ﬁrm can signal a lack of appreciation, hurting employee

# morale and impeding productivity.

To avoid this trap, build reﬂection phases into your integration action

plan and proactively identify assumptions that need to be re-assessed.

For example, we’ve seen the planned speed of integration often having

to be reconsidered after more is learned about the acquired company, its

# operations, and its people.

Finally, keep a ﬁnger on the pulse of the acquired organization.

In addition to the data you’ll collect through a culture assessment

and recurring meetings with middle management, distribute pulse

surveys at regular intervals to directly measure engagement and

attitudes about the integration. Act on this information to improve the

employee experience. For example, an acquired company reinstated the traditional pizza for the oﬃce on Fridays when integration leadership

realized how important it was for morale.

. . .

While most acquired employees anticipate having to adapt to the

culture of the acquiring organization, they still expect to leverage the

strengths of their legacy culture. When acquiring companies fail to

fully understand and appreciate the culture and the people of the

organization they’re acquiring, they often miss out on the intangibles

that made the target worth acquiring in the ﬁrst place. To capture

the greatest value, acquiring companies cannot aﬀord to overlook the

# employee experience.
