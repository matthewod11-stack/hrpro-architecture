Sven, a sales leader, received a call from a major customer who was

furious. Their order arrived late, the product was damaged, and to top

it oﬀ, their invoice didn’t reﬂect the volume discount promised in the

# quarterly newsletter.

Sven wasn’t quite sure what to do. He’d need to involve other

departments to resolve the problems, but there was a lot of

organizational red tape. Plus, recent layoﬀs and economic uncertainty

had him paranoid about making a mistake. Sven decided to bring the

problem to my client Laura, his manager and the organization’s chief revenue oﬃcer.

Laura listened attentively as Sven waded through the details. She asked,

“What support do you need from me?”

“Could you reach out to the customer?” Sven asked.

Laura knew Sven was capable of managing the problem, but she didn’t

want him to feel unsupported or dismissed. So, she agreed, adding item

# #143 to her daily to-do list.

In that moment, each felt a sense of temporary relief: Sven was relieved

that Laura was going to solve this, and Laura was relieved that Sven

felt supported in a rough moment. Yet, over time, the dynamic repeated

itself, and relief faded. Laura was burning out fast, Sven felt powerless

with his own customers, and results were starting to dip.

It’s a pattern I see repeatedly in my coaching practice, and one that’s

been well documented in research on learned helplessness and decision

fatigue. This dynamic creates decision-making bottlenecks, diminishes

team ownership, and accelerates managerial burnout.

Many leaders today are struggling to balance the aspiration of being a

supportive leader with the reality of being overwhelmed. If you ﬁnd

yourself wishing problems would stop landing on your desk—even

though you care deeply about the people bringing the problems—you’re

# not alone.

Abandoning compassion is not the answer. You don’t have to slam your

door, or tout the (terrible) adage of “Don’t come to me with problems,

# come to me with solutions!”

## Through my years of coaching leaders through decision overload and

team dependency, I’ve identiﬁed ﬁve questions leaders can use to

remain accessible, coach your team to problem-solve independently,

and safeguard your time. My clients across industries report consistent

results: When they shift from problem solving to using these ﬁve

questions, their teams step up.

What have you tried?

Asking this question doesn’t suggest you’re not available to support.

Instead, it signals that you expect initial eﬀort, or at minimum, some

brainstorming to have occurred prior to looping you in. This verbiage is

a gentle reminder to employees that they have authority to act.

The ﬁrst time you ask this question, you may be met with an awkward

silence or “Uh, nothing yet.” After the ﬁrst few times, your team will

learn to anticipate the question, start thinking ahead about solutions,

and pause before passing problems upward.

A director of tech ops I coached, Taylor, was frustrated that 1:1s

with his employees had devolved into weekly venting sessions about

organizational dysfunction. To make matters worse, most of these

meetings resulted in a laundry list of follow-ups and problem-solving

tasks for Taylor to handle alone.

When he began consistently asking, “What have you tried?”, the tone

of 1:1s shifted, and so did the outcomes. Within a month, his team

started showing up with partial solutions instead of raw problems.

Conversations became more focused, follow-through improved, and the

team started solving smaller issues on their own, without reﬂexively

handing them to Taylor.

What—or who—is getting in the way of tackling this?

If your employee hasn’t been able to tackle a problem, they should at

least be able to identify why. Whether it’s budget, time, or signoﬀ, get to

the root of what’s stopping them from solving it. Removing the obstacle is typically more eﬃcient for you, the leader, than taking ownership of

# the entire problem.

This question also helps you identify themes of the challenges that land

on your desk. Is it typically a signoﬀ issue that’s getting in the way?

Is it an unresponsive department or problematic vendor? Identifying

recurring blocks enables you to build sustainable solutions that don’t

depend on your constant involvement.

What support do you need?

The traditional question of “What support do you need from me?”—as

my client Laura asked Sven—is a well-intended leadership sentiment,

but it can unintentionally limit the number of potential support

avenues. Support is general. It doesn’t have to come from you, the

leader. It could also come from another leader, a fellow teammate, an

## adjacent department, or an external resource.

When employees feel comfortable seeking help broadly, problems get

solved faster, and teams build connectedness that doesn’t depend on

direct manager involvement. Encourage your team to think bigger

about the resources they can tap into.

What would you do if you were in my seat?

When you solve problems for your team, they often don’t see the eﬀort

you put in—staying late, sending follow-up emails, navigating politics,

and weighing trade-oﬀs. This results in:

- No appreciation for the person doing the solving

- No skill-building for the person who handed it oﬀ

Asking this question prompts your employee to carry some of the

intellectual load of problem-solving. You’re asking for their insights and

inviting them into the decision-making process.

I recently coached a customer success leader who was completely

underwater, ﬁelding hourly escalations. When she started asking her

team, “What would you do if you were in my seat?”, she saw a number

of beneﬁts: Her team started bringing forward more thoughtful ideas;

they became more patient when problem-solving took time; and they

stopped handing her the same problem twice. They saw ﬁrsthand what

went into solving the issue, and they began to learn how to do it

# themselves.

## A longitudinal study of more than 1,000 employees across 90 teams

found that leaders who engaged their teams in decision-making

and shared problem-solving saw signiﬁcant increases in both team

## eﬀectiveness and individual work engagement over time.

Is there anything else I should know?

Sometimes, the only reason a problem is on your desk is because your

employee didn’t want you to be surprised by it.

Thanking the employee and then asking “Is there anything else I should

know?” validates an open line of communication while leaving the

active solutioning to the teammate. They can still ask you for help, but

it’s on them to be direct with the request.

Diﬀerentiating between awareness of a problem and ownership of a

problem is critical. Fend oﬀ the temptation to jump into the weeds.

Unless speciﬁcally requested, don’t assume action on your part is

# necessary.

. . .

There isn’t a self-care checklist, meditation, or brain hack that’s going

to make an inroad at chronic managerial overwhelm. To bring your best

self to the most important moments, the volume of tasks must decrease.

The more you use these ﬁve questions, the less you’ll have to ask them.

Empowering your team to own their role is a gift to everyone. Only with

breathing room can you be a fully compassionate leader. Only when

employees feel empowered are they able to independently drive results.
