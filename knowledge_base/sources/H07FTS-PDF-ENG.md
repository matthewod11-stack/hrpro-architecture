We’re approaching three years since the initial oﬃce exodus, where

millions of people found themselves stationed at home full-time, overnight. The initial shock of that transition has worn oﬀ. So if

you participated in the oﬃce ﬂight, you’ve likely settled into some

# semblance of a routine.

But is it time to make a change? As a time-management coach, I’ve

helped clients all over the world navigate the shift from the oﬃce to

home, and back again. What I’ve seen is that some small tweaks to your

schedule can make a big impact and could give you a fresh approach to

# the new year.

Here are a few reasons why you may want to shake things up — and how to make these changes eﬀectively.

Reason #1: You’re feeling bored with the same old, same old.

One reason why you may need to change up your work-from-home

schedule is that nothing has changed at all in the past two-plus years,

and the monotony is getting to you. Instead of really starting work on

time, you’re logging in and then snoozing some more. You miss the

social interactions with your coworkers. And every day feels like the day

# before.

If you ﬁnd yourself in those WFH doldrums and it’s impacting your

motivation and productivity, it’s time to switch things up.

One of the most eﬀective ways to do that is through a change of scenery. I’ve seen people go to coﬀee shops, libraries, or even hang out by the

pool if they live in warmer climes. If you want a real oﬃce-y feel, you

could also position yourself at a co-working space. Getting out and

being around other people may add a little bit of time and distraction.

But if it overall helps you feel more energetic and motivated, then it’s a

# productivity win.

If it’s not easy to transport your work because you need multiple

computer screens or other special equipment, there are still ways that

you can infuse some variety into your routine. One could be through

a virtual coworking buddy. You could ask a coworker or friend to work

alongside you on a video call. Or you could use a service like FocusMate,

which will pair you with someone else in the world who needs to get

something done at the same time you do.

Finally, you could add a little spice to your routine by incorporating

something new and fresh. For example, if you sign up for ClassPass,

you can try out a variety of gyms in your area. Each week could be

an opportunity to experience something new. Or you could search

MeetUp.com for events happening in your area. Sometimes having

something to look forward to in the evening hours can make you much

more focused in the daytime hours. Clients I’ve worked with have also

said that being in a setting where it would be rude to be on their phones also helps their minds really shut oﬀ from work.

Reason #2: Your household routines have changed.

Another reason to adjust your work-from-home schedule is to account

for shifts that may have happened not to you, but around you. For

example, maybe your spouse has gone back to the oﬃce, so they’re gone

most of the day, or your kids have changed schools so the pick-up and drop-oﬀ times are diﬀerent, or you got a puppy and now you need to ﬁt

# walks into your schedule.

These changes in your environment matter and mean you need to

think carefully about all the parts of your day. For example, should

you adjust your start time to later or earlier? Do you need to look into

carpooling help for school or sports? Does your exercise schedule need

# modiﬁcations?

## Acknowledge how the changes in your household routine give you more

or less time, and then reset your expectations accordingly.

Reason #3: You want to establish healthier habits.

For some the shift to work-from-home bumped up their self-care

because they repurposed their commute time to enjoy more sleep in

the morning or to ﬁt in some evening walks. But for others not going

into the oﬃce took a toll on their healthy habits, leading to not having

a deﬁned stop time so they worked later and then went to sleep later.

Others also ditched their exercise routine when they stopped going to

the gym at work and never regained momentum. And still others may

have traded the salad bar in the oﬃce cafeteria for DoorDash and found

that even their stretchy pants no longer ﬁt.

If this sounds a bit like you, it’s time to tweak your schedule to better

support your health needs. Some potential solutions include giving

yourself ﬁrmer start and end times so that you have time in the evening

to wind down and get to sleep at a decent hour. If you want more

ﬂexibility than a set schedule but also want to have clarity on when

you’ve “done enough” for the day, another approach is to count out work

blocks that you complete, aiming for eight or nine hour-long blocks.

Once you’ve put in your hours whether that puts you at 4 PM, 6 PM, or 8

PM, give yourself permission to stop guilt-free.

To begin to fold back in physical movement, you can start small. Some

of the people I work with will begin with even 10 minutes of exercise a

day that they can do from home. Apps like Sworkit can give you short

routines and you can ﬁnd a plethora of free videos on YouTube. Another

strategy is to do short ﬁve-minute walks as breaks instead of checking

your phone. It takes about the same amount of time and improves your

health and focus instead of detracting from them.

Finally, if you’ve struggled with nutrition since working from home, you

may need to incorporate in a time on the weekends or a week night

to pick up or order groceries. Most grocery stores do have premade

salads and quick meals that are less expensive and often healthier than

takeout. You can also pick up apples, bananas, baby carrots, and other

quick and easy snacks to encourage nutritious eating.
