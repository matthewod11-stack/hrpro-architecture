valuable talent and skills, but also unique quirks, emotions, egosand, inevitably, flaws — results may vary.It’s important not to get overly stressed about making a bad hireas a first-time manager. It happens to the best of us (and it willhappen again). But once you’ve identified there’s a problem, it’scritical to take action before the situation gets worse. As I lay outin my new book,

Who’s Your Mike?, you have three basic choices:Develop them, re-assign them, or terminate their employment.However, the choice isn’t always so simple.Keep in mind that your job performance is likely being judgedhere, too — and firing someone after 90 days may reflect poorlyon your ability to hire and build a successful team. On the otherhand, you don’t want to let a problem employee orunderperformer stick around too long, because you could lose thetrust of your team, negatively impacting performance and drivinggood employees out the door. Most managers struggle with thiscareful balance of knowing when to try and make it work with aquestionable hire and when to cut and run.How can you tell when you should dig in and help a strugglingnew hire improve, or when it’s better to terminate theiremployment?There definitely isn’t one right answer for everyone, as managingpeople is often more art than science. But there are a few thingsthat can help you make the best decision under your uniquecircumstances. Here are four steps to consider:

- 1) Reevaluate their onboarding experience.Maybe a new hire isn’t performing as you’d expected, or they’renot just clicking with the team. At around 30 days, it’s still earlyenough to give them the benefit of the doubt and make surethey’re receiving the support they need to succeed. In fact, astheir manager, you owe them that opportunity.Take a step back and reflect on whether you’ve set them up forsuccess.

Did you set clear expectations? Poor performance might be asymptom of a new hire’s failure to understand organizationalnorms and the expectations of their position. Clearlycommunicating these upfront during the hiring andonboarding process can mitigate many pitfalls later on.

Have you given them the tools necessary to succeed?Determine if they have received adequate training to performtheir job functions, or if there are other resources or guidanceyou could provide that would help them get up to speed faster.Pairing them with a mentor or providing additional training onthe various technologies your department uses are just a fewideas of ways you can support their success.

Have you been accessible? There should be lots of back andforth during the onboarding process, with regular one-on-onecheck-ins during the early weeks of employment. If you’re sobusy you don’t have time to deal with a new employee, chancesof failure are high.If you identify gaps in their onboarding experience, then you canwork to fill those in and chart a more successful course forward.

Reset expectations, reopen the lines of communication, andensure they have all the tools and support they need to succeed.2) Seek advice from a mentor.Before making any decisions, it’s helpful to consult a trustedmentor who can offer you an objective opinion from a place ofexperience. Share some of the difficulties you’re facing gettingyour new hire up to speed and let them know what steps you’vetaken so far.Ideally, this person should feel comfortable disagreeing with you,challenging your decision-making process, and offering feedbackthat might not be easy for you to hear. You don’t just want asounding board, but a seasoned leader who can push you to growinto your role as a manager. At the same time, remember that noone has all the answers — and just because someone gives youadvice, it doesn’t necessarily make them right. Get someperspective on the situation, and then use your own bestjudgment to make the right decision for your organization.3) Communicate with your manager.It might be tempting to keep your difficulties with a problememployee from your own manager, but this usually makes thingsworse for you in the long run.In addition to seeking the counsel of a mentor, it’s also importantto “manage up” through ongoing conversations with your boss tokeep them apprised of your concerns. This way, you’ll not only getthe benefit of their advice and support, but you’ll also ensurethey’re not caught off guard if you end up terminating the newhire’s employment. The last thing your manager wants is to besurprised by your request to fire someone at the 90-day mark withno prior warning.

- 4) Check your gut feeling.Let’s say you’ve given a new hire 90 days to get up to speed intheir new role, and you’ve also addressed any trainingdeficiencies, but they’re still struggling. Chances are, it’s not amanagement problem. The next step is asking yourself these fourgut-check questions:

Knowing today what you know now about the role and theemployee, would you enthusiastically rehire this person forthe same role? They might be a ﬁt for another position in yourcompany, or maybe you wouldn’t rehire them at all.

Assuming they have the right training and tools, do theyalso have the mental aptitude and ability necessary tosucceed? Training can only go so far — at some point, anindividual just has to be the right ﬁt for the demands of the job.Are they able to ﬁgure things out, or are they always looking toyou for answers? Look for examples of grit, mental capacity, orsimply the ability to get things done.

If you had a whole team made up of this employee, howstrong would it be? If you get a sinking feeling, that’s a prettygood indicator for whether this employee is going to make it.

If the employee walked into your oﬃce tomorrow and quit,would you be relieved? If the answer is yes, terminating themis probably the move. If the answer is no, consider coachingthem and revisiting whether they’ve been provided everythingthey need to succeed.Again, managing people is never an exact science. There are manyfactors involved that will influence how you handle eachsituation. However, asking yourself these questions can help

validate your thoughts and your gut feeling about your new hire,and provide some clarity about how to move forward.. . .We owe every new hire an opportunity to improve and succeed intheir role, but it doesn’t mean we have to hold onto a problememployee forever. While you may elect to invest in their success,in the end, the right move might be to remove and replace. Ifthat’s the case, don’t wait — take action. Never let the fear ofdifficult conversations stop you from making your businessstronger and supporting the success of your team.
