In the corner ofﬁce at the Campinas plant of Luna Motors, the dim

light of a desk lamp illuminated a series of charts. Paulo Ferreira, the

president of Luna Brazil, had been so deep in thought he hadn’t even

noticed that it was now dark outside. Each line, curve, and number on

the papers in front of him painted a disheartening picture of the plant’s

performance: rising defects, increasing absenteeism, and a record high

in vehicles lost to labor issues. The plant was no longer competitive

# within the larger Luna network.

Paulo prided himself on being a problem solver. In business school he’d

always come up with the best solutions to case studies. But this was

not an academic exercise. Workers’ livelihoods—not to mention his own

# career—hung in the balance.

He was now puzzling over how best to implement his strategy for

reversing the trends: investing $1 billion in modernizing the factory

and pushing production from 85,000 vehicles to a staggering 170,000 vehicles a year.1 Though it was ambitious, doubling production would not only help the company meet rising demand for cars but also reduce

unit costs, increasing proﬁtability.

Paulo knew that his strategy would fail without the buy-in of one crucial

stakeholder: the labor union. In South America unions were more than

just collective bargaining entities; they were potent political forces.

With 70% of the plant’s workers in Aliança Automotiva Brasileira (AAB),

getting the union’s endorsement was pivotal to any revamp.

While there hadn’t been any strikes recently, AAB seemed to be throwing its weight around. The use of the andon cord2—which brings production to a standstill—had increased dramatically. Several weeks

earlier a gaggle of union representatives with placards had begun

gathering at the gates each day to meet the factory’s managers on their

way to and from work. Memories of a strike a decade ago still haunted

Paulo. He had been a young manager then, full of ideas and optimism,

and the strike had been his ﬁrst taste of the power the unions wielded.

Production had ground to a halt, and relationships had frayed. Years

later they were still not fully healed.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Case Study: Navigating Labor Unrest

His recent encounters with Lucia Mendez, the sector leader at AAB,

hadn’t been promising. Paulo had made signiﬁcant overtures—better

overtime pay, more days of leave for junior hires, even subsidized

transportation to help workers get to the plant—but each time Lucia had

responded with a ﬁrm “Not enough.” Paulo respected her toughness,

but he wished the union would stop seeing the negotiation as a zero-

sum game and adopt the more collaborative, progressive approach

that he’d seen work wonders in Germany and Japan and even other

# industries in Brazil.

However, he also felt some responsibility for the poor relationship.

When the plant ﬁrst opened, Luna Motors had ramped up operations

too quickly, focused too much on technical prowess over leadership

and communication skills in hiring and promotions, and failed to

## address several legitimate issues about ergonomics and worker safety.

Paulo deeply wished for the chance to do a reset and foster a spirit of

# partnership.

He was also worried about the members of his management team.

The strain of the labor agitation and the protracted negotiations was

starting to wear on them. Comparisons of the union to “the enemy” had

reached his ears. Paulo feared that the lingering resentment might make

## collaborative problem-solving with the union impossible in the future.

He took a deep breath, collecting his thoughts. He was not one to back

down. He had a battle plan to save the plant. He just needed the soldiers

to put it into action.

# An Ultimatum from Headquarters

Early the next morning, as Paulo was surveying the factory ﬂoor and

pondering his next moves, his phone buzzed to life. On the other end of

the line was Takeshi Nakamura, vice president of global operations in

## the Japanese headquarters of Luna Motors.

“Hello, Paulo-san,” said Takeshi in his smooth baritone.

“Good evening, Takeshi-san,” Paulo responded, trying to keep his voice

steady. “Did you have a chance to look through my proposal for the

# plant?”

“Your plan is innovative,” Takeshi said, genuine admiration in his voice.

“We’re willing to authorize the loans for the expansion. But we can’t wait

forever. Our patience with this labor dispute has limits.”

Paulo tightened his grip on the phone.

“In Japan,” Takeshi continued, “our kaizen philosophy centers around

harmonious collaboration between management and labor. It’s not

just about continuous improvement but also about trust, respect,

and mutual growth. The stories I hear from Campinas trouble me. Disruptions, the threat of strikes—these are not the Luna way.” 3

Takeshi went on, “Our commitment to our employees is deep but not

without boundaries. One idea we’ve been considering is repurposing

## the Campinas plant as a sales and distribution hub, which you would

run. If that happens, our operational presence in Brazil would shrink

dramatically, but the margins could be attractive. We’d like to discuss

that possibility with you as an alternative to expanding the plant.”

Paulo felt a knot in his stomach. He was being oﬀered a parachute—

albeit one that would put him in a lower-proﬁle position—but the move

would lead to hundreds of layoﬀs and decimate the local community.

Paulo had grown up in the area; after business school he had turned

down jobs in São Paulo and New York in order to move home. He felt

deeply connected to the community and wondered if he could live with

the repercussions of shutting down the production lines.

“Thank you, Takeshi-san,” Paulo said, his voice thickening with

emotion. “I will consider every avenue, with the best interests of Luna

# and our people at heart.”

# The Union Leader’s Demands

In his living room at home, Paulo sat deep in thought. Unsolicited,

Lucia, the head of the union sector, had ﬁred the next salvo. It was

obvious that she had somehow caught wind of Paulo’s expansion plan.

That was not unexpected. Lucia was one of the most networked leaders

## in Brazil—chummy with government ministers and celebrities and a

ﬁxture on the nightly news. When the Pope had visited Brazil, he met with Lucia before he met with any politicians.4

That evening, as Paulo had been driving out of the building, one of

the union members holding a placard had knocked on his window and

handed him an envelope with a letter from Lucia inside. Classic Lucia:

She always did have a ﬂair for the dramatic.

He perused the list of demands. Some of them he had already oﬀered

to meet: an increase in hourly wages and overtime pay to counteract

soaring inﬂation, paid leave for family illnesses, better ergonomics to

prevent injuries, and transportation subsidies for workers commuting from far-oﬀ areas.5

But now the union wanted more inﬂuence in hiring, training, and

promotions, citing German unions’ rights as a precedent. Paulo worried

that giving it more power would entrench mediocrity at his plant.

Lucia also wanted assurances that the expansion of the plant would

not lead to future layoﬀs, something that seemed impossible to provide,

considering his conversation with headquarters. Most troubling of all

was the demand that no artiﬁcial intelligence or algorithmic decision-

making be introduced into production without the approval of the

union, to ensure that AI would not be used as a substitute for workers.

Paulo shook his head. That was a totally unreasonable request. Though

AI was still a frontier technology in car production, who knew what

advances might emerge as cars increasingly became “computers on

wheels”? His ability to make quick decisions to stay competitive could

be undermined by a participatory process.

He wasn’t even sure whether the union was negotiating in good faith.

Just last week, in an interview with a local news channel, Lucia had

referred to Luna as a “corporate villain” and painted the union’s struggle

as a ﬁght against greed. He knew that Lucia had political ambitions.

Was she actually hoping for a deal, or would she throw her own workers under the bus to be seen as tough and further her political career? 6

His phone buzzed. It was a text from Lucia. “Thoughts?” it read.

He hesitated for a moment before typing, “I’m thinking some of these

requests are unreasonable.”

Her response was instant. “That’s a shame. I guess you want a strike?”

Memories from the last strike, of a cacophony of shouting voices,

angered faces, and idle machinery, ﬂashed through Paulo’s mind. “You’re bluﬃng,” he responded. “Would you really send your workers

to the picket lines now, when the future of the plant is at stake?”

“I’m not bluﬃng, but let’s not negotiate over text,” was her reply. “The

union is like your in-laws. Even when they frustrate you, they’re still

# family.”

Paulo smiled. Lucia certainly could be charming. “We want to be your

partner,” he wrote back. “How about we get together for a meal next

# week and complain about our in-laws?”

Lucia sent back a thumbs-up emoji.

Paulo leaned back on the couch and sighed. Before him now lay

two paths, each of which presented its own set of risks and rewards.

He could adopt a hard stance, pressuring Lucia with the very real

possibility of closing the plant and using Takeshi’s oﬀer to turn it into a

# distribution center as leverage.

But because he was a consensus builder by nature, Paulo believed that

true strength lay in unity, not division. He also realized that Luna’s

management had been at least partly at fault for the present rift—

and wondered if capitulating to some of the union’s demands might

foster the partnership he yearned for. It would be a gamble, since

compromising on near-term technological advancements could make

Luna Brazil uncompetitive, hamstringing the plant and his own career. But might it also pave the way for a more resilient operation? Kaizen was

## about continuous improvement not just in processes and technology

but also in people. Paulo’s heart leaned toward reconciliation and

growth, but his mind warred with the potential risks of capitulation.

His next move was shaping up to be the most consequential one of his

working life.

Question: Should Paulo oﬀer further concessions or threaten to close

# the plant?

# Case Study Classroom Notes

- 1. What are the potential risks and rewards of doubling production capacity in a manufacturing plant? Explore the implications for stakeholders and the strategic considerations.

- 2. Pulling an andon cord (traditionally, a rope) stops a production line. In

the kaizen approach, every worker who sees a quality or process concern can do this.

- 3. Reflect on the complexities of managing a subsidiary that is part of a

# global corporation. How do cultural and operational differences impact strategy implementation?

- 4. During the Cold War many South American unions were involved in

political movements, some of which were violently repressed. What role might historical distrust in the region play in determining the union’s postures in the negotiation with Luna?

- 5. Sequencing is important to dealmaking. One approach is to tackle

major issues first. Alternatively, starting with simpler matters may build momentum and trust.

- 6. Savvy negotiators seek to understand each party’s best alternative to a

negotiated agreement (BATNA), which helps dictate how aggressive they can be. Sometimes, however, a counterparty’s BATNA is not clear.

HBR’s fictionalized case studies present problems faced by leaders in real companies and offer solutions from experts. This one is based on the HBS Case Study “Toyota and Its Labor Union in Argentina (A)” by Jorge Tamayo, Erik Snowberg, and Jenyfeer Martínez Buitrago.

A version of this article appeared in the March–April 2024 issue of Harvard Business Review.

The Experts Respond: Should Paulo offer further concessions or threaten to close the plant?

Larry Cohen is the former president of the labor union Communications Workers of America.

Paulo can pull oﬀ his plan to save the plant, but

only with Lucia’s partnership. The cornerstone of

any labor negotiation is job security. While pay and

beneﬁts are signiﬁcant, they are secondary. Paulo’s

expansion plan promises not only employment

stability but also employment growth. He must communicate that

clearly, stressing that while he can’t make guarantees because of his

dependence on investment from headquarters, he has management’s

# preliminary support.

Positive oﬀers will be more eﬀective than threats, but Paulo can

subtly introduce the possibility that the plant could become a

distribution center. Lucia, with her experience, will undoubtedly grasp

the implications. When plants turn into parts centers, as many have in

the United States, there are signiﬁcant job losses.

However, he faces another challenge: his own bosses. In my

## experience agreements on paper mean little without deeper buy-in

from management. Paulo should be more direct in making the case for

# expansion over conversion.

Eﬀective communication with all stakeholders is vital. To get everyone

on board, he and Lucia should jointly present the plan to both

management and the union’s rank and ﬁle. But Paulo’s message should

be personal. He should emphasize his local roots, his decision to return

to his hometown after business school despite opportunities to work in

## larger markets, and his commitment to the community and the plant’s

# future.

Lucia also can play a crucial role by using her political connections.

## With the Workers’ Party—known for its interventionist policies—in

power in Brazil, she can help ensure government support for Paulo’s

# plan.

All the elements for a successful resolution are present, but overcoming

mutual distrust will be the big challenge. If Paulo and Lucia can bridge

that gap, leveraging their positions and inﬂuence judiciously, the future

of the Campinas plant and its workers can be secured.

Paulo still has room to make concessions that will

help win union support for his expansion plan

and address the low employee morale plaguing

the Luna plant. Having walked the ﬂoors of many

factories, I know that such facilities perform best

when workers feel heard, recognized, and treated with fairness and

equity. A good starting point for Paulo could be Luna’s wage structure.

He shouldn’t rely on base wages alone or focus on overtime pay,

because that incentivizes people to work longer hours rather than more eﬃciently. Instead he should consider variable pay measures such as

proﬁt sharing and bonuses, which reward performance and encourage

innovation. He could also introduce an idea-management system that

would allow employees to suggest improvements, awarding bonuses for

those that are implemented.

That approach might deviate from the traditional “Luna way,” which

expects workers to have intrinsic motivation, and Paulo should expect

resistance from Takeshi. But he must advocate for the autonomy

necessary to address the unique dynamics of his workforce.

He can alleviate HQ’s concerns by proposing a structured investment

plan for the plant’s expansion. The funding could be released in

## tranches, contingent upon the achievement of predeﬁned productivity

and quality targets. Those goals should be transparent and visibly

communicated in the factory. I might even suggest a massive dashboard

above the ﬂoor, letting workers know that if they meet the targets, they will create x number of jobs for the community.

Additionally, Paulo should prioritize reskilling initiatives. They will help

lessen any underlying anxiety the workers have about being replaced

or rendered obsolete by new technologies such as AI or electric cars.

A robust training infrastructure will help get new hires up to speed

# quickly as well.

Paulo does not need to threaten Lucia with the potential closure of the

plant. He can simply explain that it is currently uncompetitive in the

larger Luna network and that he needs her help to ﬁx the problem. After

sharing his plans, including strategies for improving employee morale,

he should encourage her to partner with him on their execution.
