In an age of disruption, the only viable strategy is to adapt, and that

has never been more true than it is today. A generation ago, the half-life

of the value of a skill was approximately 26 years. Now the half-life is

often less than ﬁve years. So, it is perhaps not surprising that, globally,

corporations are expected to invest more than $380 billion in learning

# and development programs this year.

## HBR / Digital Article / Help Your Employees Develop the Skills They Really Need

Yet we need to do better. We know that, after decades of trying,

skills related to lean manufacturing, agile development and overcoming

unconscious bias, just to name a few, are woefully under-adopted in

most organizations. In fact, a recent report by McKinsey found that 87%

of ﬁrms surveyed expect to have a skills gap in the next ﬁve years.

More training is not the answer. We can’t simply send employees

to workshops focused on whatever proﬁciency is fashionable at the

moment and expect to get results. What is essential is to build coherent

skills-based strategies. We must think seriously about which speciﬁc

skills are to be targeted, who has to learn them, and what mix of

education, experience, and exposure will be eﬀective to create the skills-

based organizations we need to meet the challenges of the future.

For example, at the software company PKWARE, where Todd was

executive vice president, the company invested more than 1% of

revenues on sales training focused on aligning the team around a

particular process. While the staﬀ was educated, it failed to yield the

expected impact because the employees weren’t consistently getting the

mentoring and real-time coaching they needed to sustain the initial

# improvements.

Compare that with Wipro, where Abhijit was previously chief learning oﬃcer. Business leaders from the insurance unit were trained in a

speciﬁc skill: storytelling. Executives went to a literary festival in which

they were exposed to professional storytellers over three days. Each

night they also attended a structured workshop that helped them process what they observed. After returning to the oﬃce, they received

continued peer mentoring for an extended period and were encouraged,

in turn, to train their own teams on storytelling. This not only helped

spread the skills, but gave the leaders the opportunity to further deepen

their own proﬁciency as they taught others. The result: a dramatic

improvement in winning deals and a signiﬁcant boost in revenue

# growth.

Anders Ericsson, who has spent decades researching expertise, points

to the importance of deliberate practice in developing world-class

performers. Mere instruction is not enough, you also need to practice

skills, identify areas for improvement, and receive coaching. It is

this combination of education, experience, and exposure that improve

# performance.

# The 70/20/10 Learning Model

If our organizations are to learn the skills needed to win the future,

we recommend a “70/20/10” learning model incorporating education,

exposure, and experience. Here’s how it works:

## 10% Formal Instruction (Education): This portion of the learning

strategy involves structured educational experiences, such as the

storytelling workshops the Wipro executives attended at night. Other

examples include webinars or in-person courses that focus on speciﬁc

# skills.

## 20% Social Learning (Exposure): Social learning involves learning

from others. This is the role the professional storytellers played in the

Wipro example. Other options include mentoring, coaching, or peer-to-

peer interactions. For example, setting up a mentorship program within

an organization can help employees learn from more experienced

colleagues. Regular team-building activities can also foster a culture of

continuous learning and help improve skills.

70% Learning in the Flow of Work (Experience): This is the most

signiﬁcant part of the learning strategy. It involves learning on the

job through real-life experiences and tasks. For example, employees

can improve their problem-solving skills by working on complex

projects. Regular feedback sessions can help employees reﬂect on

their performance and identify areas for improvement. When the

participants of the storytelling workshop continued to teach their own

colleagues and apply it in their business pitches and reviews, they got

precious hands-on experience that deepened their storytelling skills.

This is very diﬀerent from more traditional corporate learning

approaches that focus primarily on MBA-style classroom instruction,

like the one General Electric made famous at the Management

## Development Institute at Crotonville during the Jack Welch era. To be

successful in the 70/20/10 learning model, managers need to take an

active role as coaches, rather than as taskmasters, working to mentor

their staﬀ to improve performance. At the same time, Learning and

Development (L&D) departments are going to have to do more than

merely source curricula; they need to collaborate intensively with

leaders to design personalized learning environments. Learning needs

to be inclusive, continuous, and collaborative.

For example, as part of a regional initiative to reinvigorate the Texas

Panhandle region, BOC Bank sought to help its managers make

the transition from seeing their roles as performance evaluators to

upskilling coaches. The L&D team didn’t start with a preexisting

learning plan, but ﬁrst spent time with leaders to identify tasks

for performance improvement. Those tasks were then broken down

into skills that individual employees needed to learn, and the L&D

team mentored managers as they took the lead coaching their staﬀ

through personalized learning plans, using the 70/20/10 model. Within

nine months, they started seeing measurable results in terms of the

company’s standard business metrics. “Our adoption of the 70/20/10

model is directly fueling our ability to innovate, enabling us to build

distinctive core software that sets us apart in the banking sector,” said

# Alex O’Brien, CEO of the bank.

If we are to compete for the future, we need to shift from a “war

for talent” mindset to a skills-based mindset. Talent isn’t an innate

property that ﬁrms can attract and bid for, but a capacity that needs

to be built — and in any case, the most vital skills of the future don’t

exist yet. In the same way that venture capitalists invest in and manage

portfolios of companies, corporate leaders need to pursue portfolios of

skills, divesting in some that become obsolete while doubling down on

others that begin to pay oﬀ.

The future of work will not be determined by technology, but by

creating the right mix of education, exposure, and experience needed to

develop skills and put them to work, creating a vastly more productive

# workplace and economy.
