of a recent McKinsey survey believed their AI investments had reached full maturity.

In just two years, 39% of U.S. adults have already used AI. The internet reached only 20% adoption in the same time frame. The rise of AI is not only reshaping industries but also creating opportunities for individual employees. AI frees people up to do higher-value work, expand their skills, and advance their careersµ

In one study, BCG found that in the last three years, AI leaders have seen 1.5x faster revenue growth, 1.6x higher shareholder returns, and 1.4x better return on invested capital than their less advanced peers´

According to McKinsey, 92% of companies plan to increase their investment in AI. Yet, many organizations still need guidance on how to realize tangible value, with only 1% believing their AI investments have reached full maturity´

We’ve observed (cid:22)rsthand what sets successful AI projects apart. Our insights come from 300) of our most successful implementations, more than 4,000 adoption surveys, and over 2 million business users´

This guide is designed to help your organization (cid:22)nd and scale AI use cases that deliver clear value. We break the process down into three steps:

It’s important to recognize that AI adoption means much more than just `nding the right use cases. Beyond the scope of this guide are topics such as how you build an AI-`rst culture, cultivate higher value use cases, and inspire adoption across your company. We’ll share more on those issues in other guides, but for now, let’s zoom in on the process of `nding the right use cases for your company.

This is a time when you should be getting beneŠts [from AI] and hope that your competitors are just playing around and experimenting.

# Key principles for finding new use cases

Keep these three principles in mind. They're the backdrop to all the practical guidance you'll (cid:18)nd in the pages ahead.

01

AI should be led and encouraged by leadership.

02

Complex use cases can feel impressive, but often slow you down. Instead, empowering employees to (cid:18)nd use cases that work best for them, and your company, is often a faster path to success.

03

Encouraging adoption with hackathons, use case workshops, and peer-led learning sessions is a catalyst for many of our customers.

Let’s walk through the best steps for sourcing use cases for your teams.

Identifying opportunitie(cid:14) for AI impact

Step one is 4nding parts of your business that can be immediately improved with AI.?

One way to do that is to think of AI as a way to create super-assistants for your workforce. AI super- assistants never get tired or lose focus. They’re always available whenever you need help. And they can (cid:20)ex across almost any task, augmenting your employees’ skills.

To identify potential AI use cases, focus on common workplace challenges in these three key areas:

# Repetitive low value tasks

# Skill bottlenecks

Navigating ambiguity

6

Identifying and scaling AI use cases

# Repetitive, low value tasks

Every job involves tedious, manual tasks that take people away from more strategic work. These mindless tasks slow productivity, and make work more frustrating and less ful(cid:17)lling. Summarizing meeting notes, looking for trends in spreadsheet data, generating product requirements docs, answering the same questions over and over… are all jobs AI can take on for your teams.

Claire Vo, Launch Darkly’s Chief Product O9cer, has created an Anti To-Do List of tasks she no longer needs to focus on. It includes things like monitoring KPIs, tracking competitors, and sharing customer stories and anecdotes over Slack.

Every time I do something I dnd annoying, I ask myself, how can I not have to do this again?

## Claire Vo Chief Product and Technology O9ceŠ Launch Darkly

# Skill bottlenecks

Work often slows when employees reach the limits of their expertise and need input from other departments or experts. This can create bottlenecks and delay progress.ª

AI can help bridge these gaps, helping employees expand their skillsets (from data analysis and trend visualization to coding) without waiting for additional support. Expert teams get more time back from lower value cross functional tasks, and everyone else learns to communicate in their language.

Our product manager use AI to create interactive prototypes without needing to slow down to wait for other teams to help.

# Navigating ambiguity

Knowledge work often involves ambiguity and open-ended challenges. Employees may struggle to get started or become blocked, causing projects to stall. Here AI can act as a catalyst, helping to generate ideas, analyze data, and propose next steps when the path is unclear."

People across all the companies we spoke to are using AI to kick-start their thinking and unblock new ideas. They’re using it to brainstorm campaign ideas, look for quick insights in raw data, analyze trends, or just (cid:12)gure out next steps when they’re not sure what to do.

Our marketing team brainstorms campaign ideas with voice mode in ChatGPT to unblock creativity and start working towards a brief.

Focusing on these types of work can help you quickly identify high-impact AI opportunities, helping your teams optimize workbows, reduce bottlenecks, and speed up innovation across your organization.

We formed an AI automation task force with this guiding principle. We asked all tnance team members to detail processes that they felt could benett from AI. We took that list and created a roadmap of projects we wanted to explore.

< Spend a lot of time on manual work that

others don’t always appreciate or value, or isn’t the best use of their time (i.e., their “anti- to-do list”"

< Hit a skills bottleneck until another team can come along and help them (data analysis, design, on-brand writing, and web development are good examples)

Use these lists to start sourcing possible spaces for new use cases

This can be done at the start of a workshop or a hackathon to help your employees see] where to start.

Teaching your teams the six use case primitives

Once you’ve given your teams a framework for identifying new AI opportunities, the next step is to train them on the fundamental ways they can use AI. To help with this, we analyzed over 600 use cases sourced from our customers. Most use cases fall into one of six 'primitives'—fundamental use case types that apply across all departments and disciplines:

# Six simple AI use cases

# Content creation

# Automation

# Research

# Ideation/strategy

# Coding

# Data analysis

These primitives are a quick way to help your employees Tnd the most promising use cases for your business. Each primitive represents hundreds of use cases we’ve seen across industries, roles, and workWows, making them a fast track to scalable value.

Let's take a closer look at each primitive, starting with Content creation:

Content creation AI can support content creation across all teams—whether summarizing sales calls or generating 2rst drafts of strategy documents, blog posts, web pages, and even images and visualizations.< We see teams using AI to edit and polish their work, then bring it in as a last-minute proofreader;

AI can automatically write in your company’s style and apply your tone of voice guide; follow your preferred document structures; or even provide feedback on writing. It can then translate your work into diFerent languages or repurpose it for diFerent audiences, channels, or programs.:

When writing, AI can take in the complete context of a conversation or consider a set of uploaded documents to shape the output. For example, try uploading your writing guide or use your 2ve best blog posts, then prompt ChatGPT to create a detailed writing guide based on those examples.

12

## Content creation use cases to get started with:

# Marketing:

Create campaign strategies, headlines or email campaigns. Generate content outlines and 0rst drafts. Repurpose content for di#erent audiences or channels.

# Finance teams:

## Create draft policy docs and technical accounting memosP for expert review.

# Product teams:

Build product requirements docs, generate product descriptions, release notes, launch communications,P and user guides.

# Sales teams:

## Generate account plans, scripts for calls, and follow-up emails.

# Research

AI is widely used for research across industries. From quick learning about new concepts (like AI adoption or design thinking); to searching the web for relevant articles or competitive data; to more comprehensive, multistep research projects that scan the web for articles, data points, and insights. We see teams uploading long, internal documents for quick insights too. (cid:31)

One of the biggest advantages of using AI for research is that you can specify the format and structure of how the analysis is presented to you: in table format, bullet points, organized in speci(cid:10)c sections, or cross-referenced(cid:29)

AI’s attention to detail and ability to follow instructions makes it a great research assistant.

Research use cases to get started with:

# Sales and Marketing:

Investigate new industries, understand competitors better,U and research new audiences.

# Finance:

Search for benchmarks from publicly listed companies, M&A targets, or articles and guidance on accounting standards.

# Product:

Size new markets, research competitors, identify trends,U and analyze user feedback.

IT:

# Coding

Many software engineers are power users of AI. They use it for debugging, generating (cid:17)rst-draft code in unfamiliar languages, porting code from one language to another, and rubber-ducking their code. In the past two years, AI’s capabilities in math, science, and coding across many languages have signi(cid:17)cantly improved, and many tools now even o(er real-time code previews$

We’re also seeing many non-coders take up coding with the assistance of AI tools. Just by using natural language, marketers and (cid:17)nance teams are able to build Python scripts to automate processes, SQL queries to retrieve data, or even visualizations with front-end code for websites or internal presentations.

Coding use cases to start with:

# Software Engineers:

Debug or rubber duck code, port it to other languages, and research API endpoints.

# Marketing:

Build interactive charts and data visualizations to share with web and design teams, or write SQL for data analysis.

# Finance:

Create Python scripts to automate parts of the monthly close.

# Product:

Build interactive prototypes to quickly ¡esh out new° product ideas.

# Data analysis

AI helps anyone harmonize data from di(cid:25)erent sources, identify insights and trends, and work with complex spreadsheet data without needing advanced Excel, SQL, or Python skills.*

You can provide AI with multiple spreadsheets or screenshots of dashboards to support quick analysis. It can interpret spreadsheet data, understand visual charts, and even help format your output for reporting. You can also guide how results are structured, such as specifying preferred chart types, summary formats, or comparison logic.

Data analysis use cases to get started with:

# Marketing:

Upload webinar attendance data and quickly visualize it. Summarize key trends from a dashboard screenshot.

# Product:

Analyze trends, social media feedback, or upload CRM data(cid:129) on feature requests to surface new opportunities.

# Sales:

Review your account lists to ¨nd your strongest accounts.(cid:129) Map leads to accounts and score them for intent signals.

# Finance:

# Ideation and strategy

Ideation and Strategy use cases are popular across all teams, from brainstorming a new blog post to helping structure a document, troubleshooting a strategy, or giving feedback on work based on key goals or stakeholder preferences"

As AI models become more multimodal, we’re seeing teams use voice and vision to interact with AI just as they would with a colleague.

And as models become more capable of thinking through complex problems, we’re seeing many teams build strategic plans with them, taking into account their data, goals, context, constraints, and dependencies.

Ideation and strategy use cases to get started with:

# Marketing:

Brainstorm campaign ideas based on new opportunities. Upload your marketing brief and ask what’s missing. Prompt\ for a go-to-market plan for a product launch.

# Finance:

Build a market expansion plan for a new geography, taking into account local competitors, risks, size of opportunity, and resource demands.

# Product:

Build launch plans that re(cid:157)ect all dependencies and risks. Upload your PRD and identify areas of weakness before an executive review.

# Sales:

## Practice your pitch or discovery skills with voice mode.

# Automations

Many use cases involve automating parts of a task. We’ve seen customers identify repeatable, routine tasks and design ways to hand them o- to AI. Automations can be simple, like generating weekly competitive updates, or more complex, like creating a (cid:14)nance report for weekly executive brie(cid:14)ngs, ready for human review.(

Memory and custom instructions are the key to automating these kinds of processes. Custom GPTs are the method for sharing them. By creating a standard set of instructions, uploading the same document, and specifying the same output every time, teams are able to o(cid:27)oad lower’ value tasks&

Today these automations are often individual tasks, but with products like deep research’ and Operator, we’re moving into a world where AI can take on multi-step tasks independently’ and on schedule.

Automation use cases to get started with:

# Marketing:

Create a standard report and visualizations for quick webinar readouts. Or build Slack update summaries from meeting notes or transcripts.

# Product:

Create a launch update summarizer. Or summarize and share weekly customer insights. Turn meeting notes into Slack posts for executives that summarize dependencies and next steps.

# Finance:

Turn weekly (cid:14)nancial data into an executive overview, with alerts for changes that need attention.

IT:

Upload your software architecture as a screenshot and ask for key dependencies, risks, and opportunities for optimization.

## How Estée Lauder Corporation built a repeatable GPT development proces7

Estée Lauder’s GPT Lab starts with cross-discipline teams—including a business user, a subject matter expert, and a technical lead—to identify and develop high-impact use cases. Their process is simple and repeatable(cid:21)

01

# Design

The business user deYnes the purpose, scope, and audience in a two-page brief

02

# Prepare

The SME gathers relevant data to shape the use case around best practice

03

# Build and Test

The tech lead builds the GPT, integrates the data sets, and tests the GPT for accuracy and consistency

04

# Launch

The full team deploys the GPT and creates a user guide

05

# Pivot and Scale

The full team uses feedback loops to iterate and optimize based on GPT performance

“Designing the right use cases means asking the right questions,” says Charmaine Pek, Director of ChatGPT Enterprise Adoption. “Why do we want to build this GPT? What is the problem that we're trying to solve? What impact will it have?$

Gathering and prioritizing(cid:5) use cases

Once teams understand key use cases and begin identifying problems to solve, use cases tend to multiply quickly!

The challenge then shifts from discovery to prioritization. Which use cases can you scale to impact all employees? Which are most likely to deliver cost e(cid:28)ciencies now? Which might lead to a new product or revenue stream? (cid:30)

Our customer success teams use this Impact/E%ort Framework to help enterprise customers prioritize use cases. It’s a simple quadrant that scores each use case against the value to the company and the degree of e%ort it requires.

Quick wins with strong impact and low e(cid:29)ort—often the best place to start building momentum.

The lowest-e(cid:29)ort projects that a single user might spin upS for themselves as a personal assistant on a given task.S Many start as individual solutions, but often becomeS valuable across teams.

Often transformational (like Moderna’s Dose GPT or Klarna’s customer assistant) but these use cases typically require more time, planning, and resources to build. Many teams start with quick wins to build momentum and use them as inspiration for investing in higher-value projects.

These can be safely put aside for now. But new products and capabilities might make them easier to build and deploy, so be open to promoting them.

The next move: Department workflow mapping

Most teams begin by using AI for individual tasks: editing blog posts, generating campaign briefs, or drafting policies. It’s easier to think of AI in the context of speci(cid:24)c, discrete tasks.(

But as we watch power users embed AI into everything they do, we often see them (cid:24)nd use cases that start to span multi-step work(cid:21)ows.
