It’s now been ﬁve years since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic and

the sudden upending of the way workplaces functioned around the

world. In reﬂecting on this anniversary, there’s one under-the-radar

innovation that emerged from the crisis that I believe has the potential

to beneﬁt organizations for years to come—but only if we’re thoughtful

about how to maintain it. That innovation is the idea that we can now

hire the best leaders from anywhere in the world and allow them to

work remotely, not tethered to the home oﬃce or near most of their

# employees.

To be clear, since the pandemic began there have been ongoing

## discussions about the relative merits of remote and hybrid work and

return-to-oﬃce policies. But these debates have largely focused on

employees, without considering the implications of remotely based leaders and how they might need to work diﬀerently as they supervise

performance and build culture from a distance. The challenges are real,

but so are the beneﬁts—which I’ve seen in my work as a leadership

# advisor to an array of ﬁrms.

For example, the new leader of a corporate function recently asked me

to work with her team to develop a new strategy for supporting the

business. We were organizing a big in-person work session with the

team. Since the company is based in New York, I assumed that most of

the leaders she managed would live in or near the city and suggested

that’s where we should hold the meeting. She disagreed, thinking that

maybe it would be better to ﬁnd a more central location so that no one

would need to travel too far. When I expressed some confusion, she

went on to explain that while she worked out of New York, the leaders

## she managed lived in San Francisco, Scotland, Florida, Hong Kong, Tel

Aviv, and London. Her predecessor had focused on getting the best

people with the most experience for the various roles, and didn’t require

that anyone live near the corporate center. I heard from her and from

other members of her team that they felt that the function was stronger

# for this choice.

This discussion made me realize that geographically dispersed

leadership teams are common enough now that they don’t raise

## eyebrows. Indeed, many of the senior business or functional leaders

in my client organizations don’t live near their corporate centers, or

their teams, while pre-Covid, senior leaders who lived far from the

corporate or regional business oﬃce were the exceptions rather than

the rule. That change was swift, according to Tory Clarke, co-founder

## of Bridge Partners, an executive search ﬁrm in New York City: “Prior

to March 2019, approximately 1 in 10 leadership searches that [we]

undertook allowed for the incoming executive to be based outside the

home oﬃce region. Today [in 2021], that data is ﬂipped—it’s probably

only 2 in 10 leadership searches that require a speciﬁc location.” Broader

geographical searches for executives have continued even in the return-

to-oﬃce era; the resulting expansion of the talent pool has been named

one of the executive search trends of 2025 by JRG Partners, a leading

# recruiter of top talent.

# The Benefits

For many years, organizations assumed that managers or executives

needed to be located near their teams or leadership peers to provide

supervision, coordinate processes, solve immediate problems, and be

accessible for meetings. By deﬁnition, this limited the pool of potential

applicants to people who already lived in these locations or were willing

to move. (And as one of my senior clients recently told me, if his

company had insisted that he move to the corporate headquarters, he

wouldn’t have taken the job.)

The pandemic challenged this assumption. Leaders were still able to be eﬀective without being in physical proximity to their teams or

colleagues on a regular basis. In fact, research from 2023 showed that

workers who were not physically near their supervisors were 15% more

connected to company values and their direct managers than workers

who were.

With geography no longer a limitation, organizations can look almost

anywhere to ﬁnd the best leaders for the job, broadening the applicant

pool signiﬁcantly. And recruiters can approach talented people who

otherwise might turn down an opportunity that requires relocation—

critical for star leaders who may have excellent alternatives.

This shift is also hugely beneﬁcial to leaders themselves as they manage

their careers and lives. As the head of a retained executive search ﬁrm

noted, many executives “no longer want to move for work,” but rather

prefer to maintain roots in a community and avoid disrupting their

families. Perhaps that is why recent surveys have shown that 68% of

“bosses” (middle managers, functional leaders, executives) would like to

continue working remotely.

# The Pushback

Despite the beneﬁts of remote leadership, there are still plenty of

objections. For one, managing employees from a distance—without

being physically present—requires leadership skills that are diﬃcult,

don’t come naturally, and often aren’t taught in business schools or

corporate universities. For example, leaders who manage remotely need to ﬁnd diﬀerent ways of building a cohesive culture, bonding with their

people, managing social isolation and mental health, and making sure

that processes are coordinated across groups. None of this is easy, which

may explain why 70% of managers in one survey last year said that it’s

easier to supervise employees in person.

Remotely based leaders can also become invisible to their people and

to key stakeholders they need to inﬂuence, falling victim to the “out of

sight, out of mind” syndrome. No matter how good they are at their jobs,

they may not be asked to participate in key task forces or be considered

for new assignments. So in many cases, it’s just easier for leaders to go

back to the way it was.

The biggest constraint to remotely based managers, however, is the

general perception that allowing people work remotely is bad for

culture, morale, and productivity. In this context, many of the CEOs

who I spoke with over the past year felt that people working remotely

were not suﬃciently productive, or didn’t understand the fundamental

values of their company, or hadn’t built relationships with other areas of

the ﬁrm that they needed to interact with. Almost all of these cultural

worries seem to center around the workforce, and not the leaders, and

many have been refuted in research. Still it’s hard to tell workers to

come back to the oﬃce and exempt their bosses (though that seems to

be happening too). Thus, the kneejerk reaction, in many cases, has been

to mandate that all employees—including leaders—limit their remote

work and return to the oﬃce, at least for two or three days per week,

if not full time. This has been the approach taken by three quarters of

# large U.S. organizations.

# Good Remote Leadership

Although our collective experience is still somewhat limited, let me suggest several ways in which remote management needs to be diﬀerent

if it’s really going to work.

# More conscious planning and use of time

First, and perhaps most obvious, is that managing remotely requires

much more travel, which may cancel out some of the stay-at-home or

ﬂexibility beneﬁts of being remote. But it is necessary for making your

# leadership visible.

In the client organizations that I’ve been working with over the

past couple of years, remote leaders have not only been making

appearances in the oﬃce (on some of the days that employees need to be there) but also traveling to oﬀsite planning sessions with other senior

## leaders, periodic group meetings and conferences for larger groups of

## employees, client meetings, professional conferences, and more. Each

of these trips requires not only time, but pre-planning to connect with

the right people and have the right agendas. In other words, managing

from a remote location takes real work, planning and thinking—more

perhaps than just coming to an oﬃce on a regular basis.

One of my clients, who lives on the east coast but manages large

concentrations of people in several other locations, told me he is

very deliberate with his travel planning, arranging meetings and even

unstructured time in advance. He organizes a town hall at each site each

## quarter so he and other leaders can share information with each other

and have unscripted time with their teams. He has also shaped the team

so that he has strong business and HR leaders at each site to help him

consult with them ahead of a visit about how to best leverage his time.

Monitoring performance through technology and greater structure

Without immediate visual cues and interaction, leaders need to

## rely more on technology-generated reports and pre-scheduled virtual

meetings to monitor employees’ performance and output—without the eﬀorts backﬁring.

One senior leader I work with holds a weekly Monday morning virtual

meeting with his direct reports, who are located around the world. They

go around the “room” quickly with each person giving an update on key

performance goals and any issues that need attention. It’s a major time

commitment every week but it means the team won’t get out of sync

# with each other.

Listening and creating connections The third way that remote managing diﬀers is that it may require a more intense and targeted eﬀort to really understand what each team

member and colleague needs and how to help them be successful.

Direct contact with teams and colleagues on a day-to-day basis gives

## leaders a reasonably good understanding of people’s motivations, career

## ambitions, strengths, weaknesses, and the interpersonal dynamics

between them. In a remote setting, this contact becomes virtual and

less frequent and these signals diminish.

To combat this, leaders need to intentionally and consciously talk to

their people, listen to them, and devise ways to help them succeed.

Be proactive about reaching out if you have even a minor question or

concern, don’t cancel your one-on-one meetings, and take advantage of

moments just before a virtual meeting begins or after it ends to foster

connection and hear what’s going on. Most importantly, don’t limit

the interaction to work issues. Be deliberate about ﬁnding out what’s

happening in their community or in their lives.

This kind of intensive listening, however, doesn’t come naturally to

everyone, and may be quite diﬃcult for some managers. But without it,

managing remotely may not work.

## For example, at Nationwide Insurance, where 90% of employees either

work remotely or have a hybrid schedule, leaders are trained in

storytelling to convey the culture and values. They also are encouraged

to ask their team members not just about their work experience but also

their full life experience, which can be harder to grasp when people are

working away from the oﬃce. Similarly, at Edward Jones, a ﬁnancial

advisory ﬁrm where the majority of employees work remotely, leaders

are asked to focus on building relationships with their people, even

when the interactions are mostly virtual. As their head of HR notes, “It

really is about listening, deeply understanding and ensuring that we are

able to meet their needs where we can.”

The pandemic experience taught us that leaders can be recruited from

anywhere, and do not necessarily need to be located at a corporate

or business center. If we’re going to take advantage of this broader

pool of leadership talent, however, we have to recognize that remote management requires diﬀerent skills and disciplines. And unless we

develop those remote leadership skills, it will be easy to lose the
