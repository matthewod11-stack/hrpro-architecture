## Chapter 6 Cross-Cultural Competence and Cultural Intelligence in the Workplace

Cross-cultural competence (3C) and cultural intelligence (CQ) are two interrelated constructs that assess an individual’s ability to effectively perform in cross-cultural situations. This ability is becoming increasingly important due to globalization and the high costs associated with expatriate failures. Globalization, deﬁned as inter- dependence among countries, has increased the intercultural interactions many experience daily (Erez and Shokef 2008). These interactions often result in chal- lenges for people in both domestic and international organizations. Domestically, immigration has increased the cultural diversity in many organizations across the globe. Internationally, organizations are realizing that they must do business in all parts of the world to compete. Therefore, in order for companies to succeed, managers must be effective in other cultures (Morris et al. 2014). CQ and 3C are at the heart of what managers need to understand to participate in today’s global market. This becomes increasingly important when considering the statistics of how many expatriates leave their assignments early. It is estimated that expatriate failure costs the U.S. alone at least 2 billion dollars a year (Martinko and Douglas 1999). In order to avoid failures, expatriates need to develop 3C and CQ.

Competence, in the realm of work, refers to a level of proﬁciency or expertise that yields feelings and perceptions of having capabilities essential for successfully performing a job or fulﬁlling a duty. An individual can self-rate her or his level of competence or it can be rated by others. In contrast, a competency is “an underlying characteristic of an individual which is causally related to effective or superior performance in a job” (Briscoe and Hall 1999, p. 37).

# 6.1 Cross-Cultural Competence

While it is universally considered important, researchers have not yet agreed upon a universal deﬁnition of cross-cultural competence perhaps because, as Leung et al. (2013) suggested, 3C is a “polysemous term with different meanings to different

groups of researchers” (p. 992). These differences may be seen even within uni- versity communities. Operationalizing cross-cultural competence is particularly important for evaluating whether universities stating internationalization as a strategic goal are achieving that goal, yet it seems that administrators of institutions of higher education and intercultural scholars deﬁne intercultural competence dif- ferently. Deardorff (2006) employed a Delphi method whereby these experts pro- vided their opinions on the deﬁnition of intercultural competence and how to measure it with the explicit goal of reaching consensus among the experts. Administrators considered the term intercultural competence as interchangeable with the terms “cross-cultural competence, global competence, and global citi- zenship” (p. 247) and their preferred deﬁnition was not as nuanced as the deﬁnitions scholars preferred. Administrators preferred “‘Knowledge of others; knowledge of self; skills to interpret and relate; skills to discover and/or to interact; valuing others’ values, beliefs, and behaviors; and relativizing one’s self. Linguistic com- petence plays a key role’ (Byram 1997, p. 34)” (Deardorff 2006, p. 247). However, scholars preferred the deﬁnition: “‘the ability to communicate effectively and appropriately in intercultural situations based on one’s intercultural knowledge, skills, and attitudes’ (Deardorff 2004, p. 194)” (Deardorff 2006, pp. 247–248).

Generally, 3C focuses on cognitive–affective state in which one is perceived to have proﬁciency and expertise on cross-cultural issues. Hammer et al. (2003) deﬁne intercultural sensitivity, the affective component of 3C, as the ability to accept, value, and experience cultural differences. Sensitivity is also a foundational con- struct for the awareness and skills components of 3C. Heppner et al. (2012) con- ceptualize 3C, with a focus on national culture, as cross-cultural awareness, knowledge, and skills. Others focus on knowledge (information or facts), skills (i.e., behavioral aptitudes), abilities (e.g., tolerance for ambiguity), and other character- istics (e.g., curiosity and motivation) required to perform a job as operationalizing competencies that when a person excels in all areas, s/he is said to have a high level of 3C (Abbe et al. 2007; Matsumoto and Hwang 2013; McCloskey et al. 2010). In order to develop 3C, one must ﬁrst learn about oneself (i.e., self-awareness), fol- lowed by learning how to relate with others (i.e., intercultural sensitivity), and third developing an openness to understanding others (Black and Mendenhall 1990). Thus, 3C is evident through a person’s ability to interact with people in different cultural environments and situations, as the result of an ability to make sense of situations that are not inherently (or natively) schematic and to share thoughts about topics without widening cultural divides (Greene Sands and Greene-Sands 2013). Drawing on Heppner et al.’s (2012) framework, Wang et al. (2015) organize the aforementioned concepts into three coherent 3C predictor factors. These factors are (1) individual/psychological difference factors—personality, attitudes, and coping, (2) behavioral factors—immersion experiences, and (3) cognitive factors—making sense of experiences (i.e., sensemaking). Based on the work of Leung et al. (2013), is, declarative one must also have developed cultural meta-knowledge, knowledge about the knowledge people of a certain culture have. Knowing what people in another culture believe or know helps individuals communicate with members of another culture. Leung et al. showed that when participants thought that

# that

# 6.1 Cross-Cultural Competence

others they were communicating with had the same cultural background, partici- pants were less explicit with their navigation instructions, relying more on land- marks, whereas participants who thought others were from a different culture, the landmarks would not even be mentioned.

A high level 3C is difﬁcult to ﬁnd among many international assignees. Some have individual dispositions that make them prone to adapting to new situations with ease, whereas for others several actual intercultural experiences and training would be required to have even some competencies, let alone competence. This assertion begs the question: can 3C be trained? According to Wilson et al. (2013) both personality (as measured by the Big 5: openness, conscientious, extraversion, agreeableness, and neuroticism) and situational factors (e.g., prior experience abroad, language proﬁciency, cultural distance) inﬂuence whether a person might develop a high level of 3C. Thus, given the right circumstances, a motivated person may be able to develop some level of 3C, but without this motivation to learn, 3C cannot develop. The implications on organizational selection and training are rather straightforward. When selecting a person for an international assignment, be sure to select a person who already has 3C or a person who is highly motivated to learn, open and ﬂexible to new environments, and thoughtful about considering other cultural norms.

# 6.2 Cultural Intelligence

CQ is deﬁned as “global people skills” or the ability to behave appropriately and effectively in culturally different situations (Thomas 2006). While the conceptual deﬁnition is fairly well agreed upon, a model of the construct is not. Earley and Ang (2003) incorporated four factors to operationalize CQ, including cognitive intelli- gence, metacognitive intelligence, motivational intelligence, and behavioral intel- ligence. Cognitive intelligence refers to declarative knowledge of a particular culture, such as knowing nonverbal communication rules. Motivational intelligence focuses on the desire and effort put forth to learn and understand observations and experiences in unfamiliar sociocultural contexts, such as reading books to learn more information about normative workplace relationships between supervisors and subordinates. Metacognitive intelligence refers to knowing how to gain knowledge of the culture and understand how to apply it to the relevant sociocultural context. Behavioral intelligence refers to demonstrable actions in a given sociocultural context, such as bowing more steeply than a superior in Japan.

In contrast, Thomas (2006) operationalizes CQ with three factors, including knowledge, mindfulness, and behaviors. Thomas’s operationalization, similar to others’ operationalization of 3C (above), considers not only declarative and pro- cedural knowledge under the knowledge component, but also sensemaking and motivation. Motivation falls under knowledge, because it is a cognitive factor reﬂecting what a person wants or desires. Earley and Ang (2003), as stated above, distinguish between cognitive intelligence and motivational intelligence, whereby

# 97

cognitive intelligence has to do with what people know and motivational intelli- gence reﬂects an individual difference describing a person’s determination to acclimate to a different socio-cultural environment. Mindfulness, according to Thomas, refers to an astute awareness of one’s present environment and experi- links knowledge with behavior. Because mindfulness “regulates ences, and it cognition” (Thomas 2006, p. 86), it is considered a metacognitive strategy that enables individuals to attend to one’s own experiences, to others’ experiences, and to when and how to interact with the environment. Thus, it relates to Earley and Ang’s metacognitive intelligence factor. Finally, the behavior component refers to skills individuals have to be able to demonstrate competence in a cultural envi- ronment, as well as ability to know when not to behave in certain ways. It resembles Earley and Ang’s behavioral intelligence component, though while Earley and Ang might consider a deep bow to a Japanese superior as indicative of behavioral intelligence, Thomas acknowledges that just because someone knows to and can bow, it does not mean s/he should bow.

According to Wang et al. (2015), 3C factors addressed above predict CQ. In a four-point longitudinal study (from pre-departure to 3 months post-arrival), they found that connectedness with the host culture, anxiety levels, coping through family support, and perceived language discrimination predicted international stu- dents’ scores on CQ at 3 months post-arrival. More speciﬁcally, Chinese interna- tional students studying in the USA, who started off with a high level of CQ, but also perceived language discrimination (e.g., opinions not taken seriously because of language ability) and high levels of anxiety, had a signiﬁcant decline in their CQ. Nonetheless, high scores on CQ positively related to life satisfaction. Thus, indi- viduals who are open to new experiences, sociable and have good communication skills are likely to “ﬁnd cultural intelligence easiest to acquire” (Thomas and Inkson 2008, p. 23). Although individual differences in values, personality, and predis- positions may not be necessary to develop CQ or 3C, if present, certain personality factors can speed up (or enable) its development (Greene Sands and Greene-Sands 2013; Thomas and Inkson 2008). Employing Earley and Ang’s (2003) cultural intelligence model, Ang et al. (2006) empirically examined the relationship between the ﬁve-factor model of personality and found that openness to experience posi- tively related to all four intelligence components (cognitive, metacognitive, moti- vational, and behavioral), and extraversion positively related to all intelligence components, but metacognitive intelligence. Thus, personality characteristics are sufﬁcient but not necessary predictors of the ability to develop 3C or CQ.

With mindfulness, one becomes aware of one’s own attributions, and, more the attributions that others will be made of one’s behavior. For importantly, example, Camiah and Hollinshead (2003), in a study of attributions Western expatriates made of their Russian colleagues and vice versa, found that Russians make less of a distinction between personal and professional life, and this results in Russians divulging personal information to their coworkers. More speciﬁcally, American expatriates perceived the Russians as being too open and unprofessional, and the authors asserted that the Russians experienced the rebufﬁng as a sign that Americans needed to “lighten up.” The greatest source of problems between

# 6.2 Cultural Intelligence

individuals in the two cultures was the difference in how unequal pay is perceived. Russians perceived large differences in pay negatively, whereas Americans expected it. Camiah and Hollinshead’s suggestion to surmount these problems based on differing attributions assumed that adjustment will come easiest to those who focus on relationship building. A relationship allows open exchange of attri- butions that can be used both as a building block for future interactions and abstracted to other experiences.

# 6.3 Summary

intelligence is Differentiating between cross-cultural competence and cultural clearly a challenge. Some studies suggest that factors related to 3C are predictive of CQ, but several of the measures of the multi-faceted 3C are also predictors of the multi-faceted CQ. Research comparing these different measures and delineating more clearly their unique properties are needed, else the concepts will become little more than interchangeable terms, as they are currently in some, but not all, studies. Generally, researchers have identiﬁed that cross-culturally competent individuals and culturally intelligent individuals will have good overall health and well-being (Wang et al. 2015), personal adjustment, good interpersonal adjustment, and effectively perform tasks (Deardorff 2006; Thomas and Fitzsimmons 2008). In order to successfully develop 3C or CQ one must have cross-cultural experiences that include interpersonal interactions, be aware of their experiences, demonstrate interest in their experiences, make sense of their experiences, and process their growth through the experiences. A differentiating factor between 3C and CQ is that for 3C, sensitivity is the link between knowledge and behavior, whereas for CQ, metacognition and mindfulness is the link between cognitive intelligence and behavioral intelligence—it focuses on knowing when and how to act and when to suspend judgment. However, even the concepts of sensitivity and mindfulness overlap in that both focus on awareness and consideration of others and the situ- ation in which one is embedded. In short, perhaps the most distinguishing aspect of 3C and CQ is the researcher’s orientation, social/organizational psychology (dis- tinguishing between knowledge, skills, abilities, and other characteristics) or cognitive/behavioral psychology (with a focus on cognitive and motivational, metacognitive/mindful, and behavioral intelligence).

The implication of these ﬁndings is that some aspects of 3C or CQ can be learned in the classroom, some through experiences, and some are simply a matter of a person’s desire. If there is desire to enjoy effective intercultural interactions, a person’s motivational intelligence or disposition toward openness to new experi- ences would lead someone to learning more about other cultures and trying new practices, foods, and activities. The more experiences people have and the more people think about the experiences, the more they become cross-culturally com- petent and culturally intelligent.
