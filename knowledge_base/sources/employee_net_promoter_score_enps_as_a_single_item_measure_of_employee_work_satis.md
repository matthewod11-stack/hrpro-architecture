Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) as a Single-item Measure of Employee Work Satisfaction An Empirical Evidence from Companies Operating in Poland

# Piotr Sedlak

# Cracow University of Economics

# Introduction

Living in the modern world means a high probability of being invited to a survey and facing the question: “How likely is it that you would recommend X company to a friend or colleague?”. Those respondents taking part in an employee satisfac- tion survey may have heard the version “[…] would you recommend work at our company to a friend or colleague […]”. This single question concerning the will- ingness to recommend is a base for the Net Promoter Score1 indicator. It became so popular in customer surveys that it could claim the title of The Holy Grail of so- cial research. Does it deserve it?

This text will focus on NPS methodology and its possibility to be adapted in an employee satisfaction survey. An important task is checking what the “would recommend” question really measures. A fair part will be devoted to deliberation about the development of the NPS and showing how the “would recommend” ques- tion works in practice of the employee satisfaction surveys.

Who created the NPS and why it became so popular?

The NPS was created by Frederick F. Reichheld2 who published in Harvard Busi- ness Review the text with convincing title: The One Number You Need to Grow3. Reichheld was ensuring his readers that: “you don’t need expensive surveys and complex statistical models. You only have to ask your customers one question”4. Having a good professional reputation5 and being sure of his research was prob- ably one reason of Reichheld’s success. The other reasons may be the simplicity of the NPS, the easiness in understanding for managers and the focus on business growth. The item created by Reichheld was even called “the ultimate question”6. There is much research confirming the success of the NPS in the business world. For example, in one piece of research, 71% of the large companies in the sample were using the NPS7 or another research showing that the majority of Customers Experience Directors use the NPS as one of the key indicators8.

# Development of the NPS

Reichheld, in his text, is rather modest when it comes to the description of his methodology. He mentions that the research took 2 years and “the ‘would recom- mend’ question generally proved to be the most effective in determining loyalty and predicting growth”9. What we know, is that the author of the NPS was look- ing for correlation between the survey questions and business results based on over 4000 surveys.

## Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) as a Single-item Measure of Employee…

Although linking survey results to actual companies’ results and customers be- haviour is surely a good idea, there is a statement of Reichheld’s which can cause confusion:

[…] my colleagues and I looked for a correlation between survey responses and ac- tual behavior – repeat purchases, or recommendations to friends and peers – that would ultimately lead to profitable growth. Based on information from 4,000 con- sumers, we ranked a variety of survey questions according to their ability to predict this desirable behavior10.

Interestingly, that actual recommendations to friends and peers was treated as a depend variable. It seems obvious that the question about the willingness of such a recommendation happened to be a good predictor of such behaviour. It is not a mistake. The same information was later repeated in the Reichheld’s ar- ticle: “The data allowed us to determine which survey questions had the strongest statistical correlation with repeat purchases or referrals”11. There was no infor- mation which of the output (repeated purchases or referrals) was more important. There is also no information about the correlation indicator.

# The scale

In the question that the NPS is based on (How likely is it that you would recom- mend X company to a friend or colleague?), an 11 point scale is used. The respond- ents mark their willingness of recommendation from 0 to 10, where 10 means “ex- tremely likely” to recommend, five means neutral, and 0 means “not at all likely”. Reichheld and his team noticed that the customers (or respondents) can be divid- ed into 3 groups. Based on that, he created a quite strict rule how to characterize them. Depending on the answer, the respondents were categorized as “promoters” in the case of those who answer 10 and 9, “passively satisfied” refers to those who marked 8 and 7 and those who chosen from 6 to 0 are called “detractors”. Taking only the 2 highest answers to describe “promoters” was in Reichheld’s opinion the solution for the tendency of people to give rather positive answers in such surveys. This decision however, leads to an asymmetry during the final score computation. The score of the eNPS indicator is counted as the percentage of promotes deducted by percentage of detractors. So theoretically the eNPS scores can be from –100% (only detractors) to +100% (only promoters).

Is 11 points a good choice? Reichheld has not explained why the question was developed with 0–10 scale. There is a long debate among researchers of how many points the scale should have. Five points is believed to be enough for gen- eral questions12. Most of the research found by the author of this text suggest using scales consisting from 5 to 7 point. Of course, it must be kept in mind the purpose of the survey, the content of the question itself, and the statistical op- erations to be undertaken. Fortunately, it is not a decision for a lifetime, and in many cases a procedure of rescaling can be used13. Another issue is that fully labeling the scale (which is not the case in the NPS) is believed to bring positive impact on research quality14.

Criticism of the NPS There is as much enthusiasm in the business world15 as criticism about the NPS in science. First, there is no agreement on the fact that the NPS is the most impor- tant and only indicator to measure16 as Reichheld was implying originally. Sec- ondly, many researchers failed to replicate original results and therefore found the

NPS as a poor predictor of customer loyalty and customer satisfaction17. Perhaps, the harshest words were used by Sharp, who called Reichheld’s work a snake oil and fake science18. In other articles, it was pointed out that there was no consider- ation of research bias during NPS development19. Among other criticism we may find that the NPS is focused on the user, not exactly a person who make buying decision20.

An important factor we should keep in mind is the influence of national culture on the NPS. Originally the indicator was developed in the USA. Americans are the na- tion of optimists and for example Europeans are more modest in describing the positive view of something21. There are opinions that in Europe, the NPS should be measured differently and those who gave 10 and 9 but also 8 should be promoters and detractors should be limited only to those who gave 5 or less on the scale22.

## Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) and Employee Satisfaction

In the literature there is not much written about the Employee Net Promotor Score (eNPS)23. What we know for sure is that the idea behind the eNPS is to ask employ- ees how likely they would recommend their company as an employer. The meas- urement method, the definition of detractors and promoter remains the same24.

Before answering the question if the eNPS may be used to measure job satisfaction, it is good to clarify the latter.

So, what exactly is job satisfaction? On an everyday basis, satisfaction would be connected with a positive, pleasant feeling, often the word satisfaction is con- nected with fulfillment. There is an important component of emotions when we speak about work satisfaction. Lock briefly described it as “pleasurable or posi- tive emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s job or job experiences”25. Having satisfaction defined as an emotional state, it has to be remembered that it is only part of the whole story. Satisfaction is in fact an attitudinal construct re- flecting one’s evaluation of his or her job26. The same opinion is presented by Stam- ple and Higgins, who treats satisfaction as a positive attitude towards work and duties27. The term attitude encompasses affect, behavior, and cognition28 which confirms that satisfaction is rather a multidimensional construct.

# Research Methodology

The author has conducted the employee satisfaction surveys for several compa- nies. In this paper there will be presented parts of this research. Presented data was gathered in 2019 in three different companies. To ensure data confidentiality, further in the text these firms will be referred to as Company A (N = ca. 6000), Company B (N = ca. 100) and Company C (N = ca. 400)29. The companies were operating in Poland and all the surveys were conducted in Polish. In each case, all the employees employed, at the moment of the research, were asked to participate in the surveys. The respondents received an invitation to a CAWI (Computer As- sisted Web Interviewing) survey, sent to the company’s email address. The aver- age response rate in these 3 surveys was 63%. The structure of surveys was differ- ent in all the companies.

Looking at the answers distribution, it can be seen that there is no common pat- tern, or common peaks. In the case of the company B, 82% of the respondents chose the score 6 or higher, the mean result was 7.1. This can be interpreted as at least a good situation. However, the eNPS score (% promotors – % detractors) is minus 6%, so below zero, which may be understood as something going wrong. Neither of the companies described in this paper have a positive eNPS value. The author had opportunities to visit company B and conduct some interviews with managers and line employees. The qualitative data confirms that the opinion about the com- pany among its employees was good or even very good. Clearly the way of counting the eNPS score percentage of people who chose 2 values (in the scale 10 and 9) de- ducted by the percentage of people who chose 7 values (from 0 to 6) is hard to agree on, and can be misleading for eNPS users. It should be borne in mind that the re- search was conducted in Poland and the culture influence on the eNPS results30. The eNPS question, in the case of all the surveyed companies, has proven to high- ly corelate with items concerning the general opinion about work satisfaction and with the whole work satisfaction scales. As all the scale items cannot be disclosed,

the following text will focus only on items treated as separate entities. Described correlation suggest that the eNPS can be used as a single-item work satisfaction measure. Although such simplification causes information loss and due to the fact that there are no other possibilities, this solution should work on a sufficient level when it relates to measuring work satisfaction and engagement31.

The research of Legerstee provides similar results to the material gathered by the author. What is important is that Legerstee also measured the employee engage- ment which corelated with the eNPS even higher than work satisfaction32. Engage-

ment is also considered an attitude33 but puts more emphasis on behavioural. In the surveys used in this text, there was no possibility to extract engagement compo- nents in order to have a chance of establishing if the eNPS predicts work engage- ment better than work satisfaction.

# Conclusions

The extraordinary popularity of the NPS question resulted in market demand for a similar construction in employee satisfaction and engagement research. In the author opinion, the eNPS item is good for a general opinion evaluation. Still many differently constructed questions may lead to similar results. Using a single-item measure provides information about general opinion but does not give the compa- ny’s managers any further information. The manager will know if his team is happy or not, but will not have access to the reason of such an opinion. The eNPS alone will not help to improve the situation in the company as it is not directed at any factors causing satisfaction or dissatisfaction.

On the plus side of the eNPS, there is certainly simplicity. The question does not require any special instructions for respondents, it is easily understood by manage- ment. An exception is the score itself which may be below 0 in situations when the majority of the people chose, for example, 7 and 8 on the 0 to 10 scale. This last is- sue in the authors opinion is the biggest disadvantage of the eNPS, especially when used by people who do not know how the score is calculated.

# Abstract

The goal of the article was to evaluate the pros and cons of using the eNPS indicator and its possi- ble adaptation in employee satisfaction surveys.

The author conducted 3 independent surveys on over 6500 employees in 3 different compa- nies. The eNPS results were correlated with questions concerning the general opinion about work and the employer.

The eNPS indicator was proven to highly correlate with items describing the general employee opin- ion about work satisfaction. The numerical value of the indicator itself is considered by the author as misleading due to asymmetry in the classification of positive and negative opinions.
