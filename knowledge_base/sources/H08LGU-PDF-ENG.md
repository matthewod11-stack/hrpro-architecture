The need for more inclusive workplaces for all is undeniable — 91%

of workers have experienced discrimination related to race, gender,

disability, age, or body size, and 94% of workers care about feeling a

sense of belonging at work. But anti-DEI rhetoric and backlash has sunk

support for diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI) to a low of only 52% of

# American workers.

## HBR / Digital Article / What Comes After DEI

The predominant response to this backlash among practitioners I’ve

talked to has been to largely continue with the status quo, rebrand the

language as needed, and adhere to existing initiatives and programs

under the DEI umbrella that remain legal until forced to do otherwise.

Fewer practitioners — or employers — are considering whether DEI

work itself has room to improve.

In this moment, leaders and practitioners invested in building healthier

workplaces and societies for everyone have a once-in-a-generation

opportunity to reimagine this work — not only to adapt to a new

sociopolitical climate, but to let go of practices that have outlived their

usefulness and refocus our eﬀorts on what works.

## Decades of research shows clear problems with status-quo DEI. Despite

their widespread prescription, DEI trainings often fail to change bias

or reduce prejudice. Popular strategies for communicating the value

of DEI can paradoxically both hurt marginalized communities and

decrease leadership support for DEI. Common initiatives intended to

create better workplaces for all might instead activate backlash, increase

burnout, and fail to improve outcomes for underserved groups.

DEI needs a reset. People want more diverse, equitable, and inclusive

workplaces, but the initiatives and approaches common to mainstream

DEI are far from the only way to achieve them.

Drawing from research, conversations with colleagues, and my own

work over the last decade as a DEI practitioner, I’ve developed a

replacement that I call the FAIR framework. It’s built around the core

outcomes of fairness, access, inclusion, and representation that DEI was

supposed to achieve for all, and it oﬀers four principles to guide this

# work.

# What Does a Better Model Look Like?

As I wrote in HBR last year, the mainstream DEI strategy adopted by

many organizations — marked by jargon-heavy communication, siloed

programming reliant on burned-out volunteers, one-oﬀ workshops

utilizing outdated tactics like blame and shame, and little measurement

or accountability — often created the appearance of progress at best and

# substantial backlash at worst.

Leaders at the forefront of reimagining this work are using data

to design interventions that measurably improve outcomes for all.

They apply a change management approach to create impact at

scale, improving personnel policies; hiring, promotion, and feedback

processes; leadership incentives; and organizational culture and norms,

rather than repeatedly seeking to “build awareness” without follow-up.

They are building coalitions that engage everyone in the workplace

as part of the solution, rather than looking to pin problems on one

social identity group versus another. And they are communicating in

ways that defuse defensiveness and threat by establishing the beneﬁt

of this work for everyone, rather than resort to rhetoric that inﬂames

# intergroup hostility and polarization.

“I’ve been encouraged by data that show if you design for better

processes, you don’t always need to ﬁrst get everyone on board,” said

## Ruchika T. Malhotra, author of Inclusion on Purpose. “Actions most

often change as a result of intentionally designed processes. For

example, designing a more equitable hiring process actually beneﬁts

people of all backgrounds. But if people are resistant to the word

‘equitable,’ it shouldn’t stop leaders from designing for better hiring

outcomes using the same principles.”

People want more diverse, equitable, and inclusive workplaces, but the initiatives and approaches common to mainstream DEI are far from the only way to achieve them.

This development in the DEI space has been a slow-moving revolution

resisted by leaders and practitioners more comfortable with the status

quo. Now, DEI must adapt in exactly this way if it wants to survive.

## Instead of the performative, individual-centered, isolated, and zero-sum

methods of the current mainstream approach, DEI work must evolve to

# become:

- Outcomes-Based, focusing on measurable results like pay equity,

physical and psychological safety, wellness, and promotion rates,

rather than bandwagoning (and only budgeting for) a one-time

training, posting on social media, or other behaviors that signal

commitment without demonstrating results. Rather than gauge an

employer by whether they have committed to progress, an outcomes-

based approach requires us to gauge an employer by whether they

have measurably achieved progress.

- Systems-Focused, using change management to achieve healthier

workplace systems — policies, processes, practices, and norms —

rather than a “self-education” approach. For example, rather than

ask every person to align their individual beliefs with an arbitrary

standard of “inclusion,” a systems-focused approach aims to achieve

inclusion at scale by rewarding inclusive leaders, creating inclusive

workplace processes, and normalizing expectations for inclusive

# behavior.

- Coalition-Driven, focusing on engaging the wide range of people who

stand to beneﬁt from a healthier and fairer workplace, rather than

limiting participation by identity or ideology. Rather than delegating

the blame for a problem or the onus of problem-solving to small groups

of employees, a coalition-building approach aims to engage everyone

in taking responsibility and working together to ﬁnd solutions that

work for all, even if not everyone shares the same beliefs about the

# work.

- Win-Win, focusing not only on creating better outcomes for all, but

communicating the beneﬁts of progress — even if it might look to

be limited or localized at ﬁrst — for everyone. A win-win approach

intentionally aims to push back against the notion that progress could

be zero-sum: for example, rather than assuming that only women will

be interested in challenging gender bias, a win-win approach might

involve reaching out to people of all genders with the assumption that

challenging gender biases beneﬁts everyone.

How can FAIR succeed where DEI has failed?

The FAIR framework is a model for building human-centric

organizations around the above principles. The four outcomes of FAIR

are:

# Fairness

Fairness is when all people are set up for success and protected against

# discrimination.

Given people’s diﬀering identities, experiences, and needs, fairness isn’t

achieved simply by treating everyone in exactly the same way, but by

building workplace policies, processes, and practices to prevent bias,

maintain accountability, and meet a range of needs while ensuring the

## same high standard of experience for everyone.

We measure fairness by looking at the major touchpoints of a person’s

interaction with their environment. In the workplace, that means

examining how people’s experiences diﬀer regarding pay, promotion,

## resources, opportunities, discipline, learning, and feedback. If we

## ﬁnd major diﬀerences in experience — for example, older workers

consistently report being paid less than their younger colleagues in

the same roles, or candidates without an Ivy League background are

consistently passed over for promotion compared to their equally

experienced Ivy League-grad colleagues, or neurodivergent workers

are pushed into a more limited set of career tracks compared to their

neurotypical colleagues — we can investigate potential unfairness and

make corrections to policies, processes, or practices to ﬁx the problem.

In one organization I worked with, a senior leader was dealing with

a situation where a manager reporting to him had been accused

of promoting her team members for personal reasons rather than

readiness. Rather than singling out this manager alone for remedial

bias training, I worked with the organization to protect against

discrimination more broadly by formalizing the promotions process:

requiring promotion criteria be transparent, clarifying these criteria to

focus on demonstrated performance rather than assumed potential,

standardizing the evaluation process with rubrics, and upskilling

decision-makers to utilize this process with conﬁdence.

Improving systems rather than “ﬁxing” individuals requires change

management, not a one-time intervention. Luckily, this approach may

resonate strongly with what workers already value. Everyone wants a

workplace free from favoritism and discrimination, where everyone has

the support they need to do their best work and is rewarded fairly for

their eﬀorts. Framing FAIR work in these terms can make it clear that a

healthier workplace is good for everyone, and secure the broad support

needed to change the status quo for the better.

# Access

Access is when all people can fully participate in a product, service,

# experience, or physical environment.

## HBR / Digital Article / What Comes After DEI

While it is closely related to accessibility, access applies to more than

disability. Achieving access requires removing barriers to participation,

## and designing products, services, experiences, and environments that

work for all. For example, if frontline workers aren’t given the means or

time to participate in a major virtual celebration that their headquarters

colleagues are putting on, the event is inaccessible. If a major all-hands

meeting is scheduled on a Jewish or Muslim holiday, the meeting is

# inaccessible.

To measure access, we look at people’s participation and engagement

with the various aspects of their environment. We can use metrics like

attendance, utilization, or completion rate, and collect additional data

## through tools like the (Accessible) Usability Scale or user feedback.

If we ﬁnd major diﬀerences in experience — for example, workers

with children are not attending a monthly networking event because

it takes place during typical daycare pick-up hours — we can investigate

potential inaccessibility, and make corrections to the product, service,

experience, or environment to ﬁx the problem.

Addressing access means organizations should adopt new standard

practices in design and development. Too often leaders treat lack

of access as isolated issues to be solved on a case-by-case basis,

and approve sloppy shortcuts that don’t solve the root cause of

inaccessibility. Imagine a building manager who, instead of installing

a ramp to make an entrance accessible, tasks a staﬀ member with

manually pushing wheelchair users up the stairs. Because the needs

of users outside the “norm” are not made a standard part of the

## design or development process, products, services, experiences, and

environments end up making the same errors again and again — a

phenomenon known as accessibility debt.

## HBR / Digital Article / What Comes After DEI

To successfully embed user input and feedback into development

cycles, practitioners must challenge people’s assumptions that

prioritizing access is costly and time-consuming — it is far less so

than accessibility debt — and demonstrate that doing so is possible.

Expanding access for those outside the status quo can result in

surprising beneﬁts for everyone, even those who may not think of

themselves as having access needs, builds more resilient organizations,

## and contributes to the independence, dignity, and agency of all people.

# Inclusion

Inclusion is when all people feel respected, valued, and safe for who

they are.

Inclusion is about engaging thoughtfully with what makes people

diﬀerent — ensuring that given the diversity of people’s identities,

experiences, beliefs, and perspectives, all can feel respected, valued,

and safe. If mostly remote workers feel just as valued by leadership as

## their mostly in-person counterparts, that’s remote/in-person inclusion.

If the workplace is a physically safe place to work, and a psychologically

## safe place to share critical feedback, experience productive conﬂict, or

take risks for workers of all genders, that’s gender inclusion.

To measure inclusion, we can administer surveys and assessments

## on people’s feelings and experiences within an environment. We can

ask about their experiences with physical and psychological safety,

their comfort reporting and seeking out support for discrimination if

it occurs, and their feelings of respect or disrespect while at work.

If we ﬁnd major diﬀerences in experience — for example, LGBTQ+

workers report experiencing physical harassment more frequently

than their non-LGBTQ+ colleagues do — we can investigate potential

exclusion, oﬀer feedback and accountability to those involved, and

make corrections to the environment to ﬁx the problem.

## HBR / Digital Article / What Comes After DEI

Inclusion is ultimately a matter of workplace norms and culture.

Workplaces often address inclusion through event programming (think

“lunch and learns” or cultural heritage celebrations), but these shallow

## attempts at celebration or education rarely change language or

behavior ingrained within the status quo. An immigrant experiencing

xenophobic threats at work is most supported by a standard protocol

that meets their safety needs and addresses threatening behavior

at the source — not by asking them to participate in a “cultural

diversity celebration.” An introverted person who is often spoken over

in meetings is most directly supported by meeting agendas sent before

## each meeting and managers with meeting facilitation skills, not a 50-

minute lunch event attended by 10 people on the “power of introverts.”

Rather than gauge an employer by whether they have committed to progress, an outcomes-based approach requires us to gauge an employer by whether they have measurably achieved progress.

To actually change culture — the set of shared values, expectations,

and beliefs for how people engage with each other — leaders and

practitioners must do more than share aspirational lists of “do’s and

don’ts” tied to speciﬁc identity groups. Storytelling, formal authority,

and social incentives are all more eﬀective tools for shifting behavior

away from unwanted norms and toward desired ones. I once advised

a leader who wanted to use their authority to replace a meeting

norm of “loudest voice wins” with a ﬁve-minute silent period before

every discussion for everyone to write down their talking points.

This simple practice, communicated clearly and upheld consistently,

helped shift the implicit norms among the team. Rewarding and

celebrating those who act inclusively, setting expectations for inclusive

communication and behavior, and building shared group identity

around being respectful and inclusive people are eﬀective strategies for

improving inclusion that any leader can utilize.

# Representation

Representation is when all people feel their needs are advocated for by

those who represent them.

## Representation isn’t as simple as demographic box-checking.

Representation requires participatory decision-making processes,

## frequent and transparent communications between leaders and key

## partners, and high trust in leadership from the many diﬀerent groups

they represent built oﬀ a track record of accountability. If leaders

consistently promise that they will listen to workers experiencing

exclusion but then refuse to meet with them, those workers

lack representation — even if they technically have a designated

“representative” on the leadership team. If a product team aims to build

products “for all people” but does not consult or include perspectives

## from a key audience in their design process, that audience lacks

## representation — even if a member of the product team shares an

# identity with that audience.

To measure representation, we can collect self-reported data from

surveys and assessments on people’s feelings about leadership,

inﬂuence, voice, and trust. We can ask about their trust in leadership,

the degree to which they feel like their opinions are solicited and

valued, and the degree to which decision-makers consider needs like

theirs. If we ﬁnd major diﬀerences in experience — for example,

Black workers reporting feeling most unheard and excluded from

decisions impacting them compared to other colleagues — we can

investigate potential lack of representation and make corrections to

communication, behavior, and decision-making processes to ﬁx the

# problem.

## HBR / Digital Article / What Comes After DEI

Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism. While people may be

slightly more inclined to trust those who share identities in common

with them, trust is more dependent on the behavior and track record

of those in power. It’s possible for a leadership team made up entirely

of women to be non-representative of women if none of the leaders

take the eﬀort to understand and advocate for the needs of the women

they supposedly represent. On the other hand, it’s possible that a

## product team without direct experience living in rural communities

might be very representative of rural communities due to frequent

communication, active outreach, and ongoing eﬀorts to understand and

advocate for rural communities’ needs.

Focusing on representation as an issue of trust rather than an issue

of identity allows us to avoid zero-sum conversations that can come

from ﬁxating on demographics. Assuming no change in team size,

teams populated only with white men must necessarily lose white men

if they are to gain women or people of color. This framing instantly

activates the common fear that eﬀorts to increase diversity are “coming

## for the jobs and opportunities of white men” and other majority

group members and lowers the possibility of productive dialogue. If

practitioners can instead start a conversation about how much diﬀerent

groups trust and feel heard by leadership, taking seriously those who

don’t feel represented regardless of their identity or background, we can

avoid zero-sum mindsets and the backlash they engender.

Representation is a matter of trust, not tokenism.

Does this mean demographics don’t matter? Not at all — but

demographic parity (having a workforce demographic mix that mirrors

that of customers or society) is an issue of fairness, not representation.

So long as leaders are engaged in making workplace systems like

## hiring, promotion, and feedback more fair, demographic change will

be a lagging indicator of progress. In the meantime, today’s leaders

have actionable goals to strive toward if they want to become more

representative of those they serve, regardless of the identities these

# leaders possess.

. . .

Whether leaders and practitioners choose to adopt the FAIR acronym or

not, many of the DEI leaders I spoke to discussed the urgent need for

status-quo DEI work to evolve.

“’DEI’ was great, it had a run. We have to get really good with the

fact that things evolve,” urged Amber Cabral, founder of leadership

development ﬁrm Cabral Co. “So let’s not be so committed to a group

of words and yet be so divorced from how they actually show up in

# meaningful ways.”

“An area missing in DEI work was embracing that the work requires

change,” said communications strategist Kim Clark. “DEI tended to stay

at the top level of organizations, perhaps exempliﬁed as a branded

external campaign, rather than empowering every department, every

team, and every employee. This led to performative communications

that caused more harm than good.”

“I see [an] opportunity to go beyond the perfunctory, performative, and

symbolic,” said Zach Nunn, CEO and founder of Living Corporate, an

experience management company. “This is where this space is going;

in some ways, the critical season [we are experiencing now] is a good

# thing.”

“FAIR addresses the reality [that] the current workplace has been failing

everyone in diﬀerent ways,” said W. Brad Johnson, PhD, a professor at

## the U.S. Naval Academy. “For instance, more and more majority men

who become fathers want to share more equitably in caregiving, but

the calciﬁed workplace may not grant them equitable access to parental

leave and ﬂex-work. FAIR would level the playing ﬁeld for men, women,

mothers, and fathers in this area.”

As your organization continues to navigate anti-DEI backlash, challenge

yourself and your leaders to look beyond the DEI status quo. Ensure that

as your language, initiatives, and strategies evolve, you are grounding

them in outcomes rather than intentions, debiasing systems rather than

“ﬁxing” individuals, creating broad coalitions rather than polarized

cliques, and communicating the win-win value of this work rather than

giving in to zero-sum narratives. Ensure that whatever you call the

work, you are building an organization for tomorrow that is better for

everyone in it than it is today.
