In times of crisis, many of us ponder existential questions about health,

security, purpose, career, family, and legacy. However, more often than

not, such contemplation is short-lived. The demands of everyday life —

the here and now — can overwhelm us, leaving little time to think about

the long term and what we are working toward. As a result, when faced

with life decisions both big and small, we are left with nothing to guide

# us but emotion or intuition.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

The corporate equivalent, of course, is attempting to run a business

without a strategy, which every HBR reader knows is a losing

## proposition. But as longtime consultants to organizations around the

world, we wondered: Could we adapt the model for strategic thinking

that we use with institutional clients to help individuals design better

futures for themselves? The answer is yes, and the result is a program

that we call Strategize Your Life. We’ve tested it with more than

500 people — including students, young professionals, middle-aged

## employees and managers, C-suite executives, board members, and

retirees — to help them develop their individual life strategies.

You can create a life strategy at any time, but it can feel especially

appropriate at certain milestones — a school graduation, the start of

your ﬁrst job, a promotion, becoming an empty-nester, retiring — or

after a major life event, such as a health scare, a divorce, the loss of a job,

a midlife crisis, or the death of a loved one. When you have a strategy,

you will be better able to navigate all those transitions and diﬃcult

moments, building resilience and ﬁnding more joy and fulﬁlment while

minimizing stress. This article will help you get started.

# A Surprising Symmetry

Every corporate strategy project is diﬀerent. But the hundreds that

we’ve conducted for large organizations have had commonalities,

including the use of certain methodologies and tools. We typically work

through seven steps, each guided by a question:

- 2. What is my life purpose?

- 3. What is my life vision?

- 4. How do I assess my life portfolio?

- 5. What can I learn from benchmarks?

## As the former head of strategy for a U.S.-based Fortune 50 company

told us, “Knowing the right questions is much harder than having the

answers.” Just as corporate strategy is an integrated set of choices that

positions a company to win, life strategy is an integrated set of choices

that positions a person to live a great life. What’s more, we can apply

tools from classic organizational strategy and other realms to help you

ﬁnd answers to the seven questions above and make better decisions.

Critics might say that you can’t transfer concepts from business to life.

In the 1960s there were similar concerns about whether strategy ideas

from the military and politics could apply to the corporate world. The

management guru Peter Drucker even changed the title of his 1964 book

from Business Strategy to Managing for Results because everyone he and

his publisher asked told them that strategy belonged to those realms,

not to business. Yet we’ve also seen business-world principles employed

to improve people’s self-management. For example, in their best-selling

## book Designing Your Life, Stanford University’s Bill Burnett and Dave

Evans modiﬁed the design thinking they used in software development

to help individuals.

Strategize Your Life is our attempt to do the same for strategic thinking

in a concrete, step-by-step way. We believe it can lead you to new

insights on how you deﬁne and ﬁnd your great life. Our goal is to give

## your emotion and intuition an analytical partner.

In surveying our workshop and coaching session participants, we found

that, in the past, only 21% had outlined what a great life means to

them, 9% had identiﬁed their purpose, 12% had set a vision for their

life, 17% had created concrete goals and milestones, and a paltry 3%

had developed what could be called a life strategy. These are critically

important issues that very few of us are spending enough time on.

As Martha, a 26-year-old graduate student, explained, “Life keeps taking

shape… When all the Christmas parties and weddings and trips are

suddenly over, you ask yourself, ‘Have I really lived or has life just

happened to me?’” She was eager to be more proactive. “What better

help is there than a high-level plan for life?” she asked. “Not to strictly

follow it and forbid life to unfold, but to have a common thread. What

should my story be? What should I have experienced so that in the end

I can say to myself, ‘I have lived’?”

Unlike most self-help books, we don’t present one golden path to

happiness or life satisfaction. Because everyone is unique, we give you

the tools to ﬁnd your own path in a seven-step life strategy process. In

step 1 you deﬁne what a great life means for you. In step 2 you outline

your purpose; in step 3 your life vision. Step 4 is a portfolio analysis of

how you spend your 168-hour week, while step 5 involves setting life

satisfaction benchmarks. In step 6 you incorporate the results of the

ﬁrst ﬁve steps and determine your choices and potential changes in

your life, and in step 7 you map out a plan for putting your choices into

action. We recommend that you take notes throughout so that, by the

end, you can put an initial version of your life strategy on a single page.

(To help, we created a life strategy worksheet, which should be ﬁlled out

after you’ve gone through all the steps.)

This work may seem daunting, but in practice it should take you only

a few hours. That said, it might not be easy. You will have to challenge

yourself and go beyond the obvious. But you shouldn’t give up, because

the answers you’ll discover are so worthwhile. After all, what’s more

important than your life? Commit to thinking strategically about it, look

forward to the insights you will gain, and enjoy the journey.

Watch Rainer Strack explain how to build a successful life portfolio.

# The Seven Steps

The process begins with a simple yet profound question:

- 1. How do I deﬁne a great life?

The starting point of any corporate strategy process is to deﬁne

fundamental metrics for success. For instance, does the organization

want its strategy to focus on driving sales, shareholder value, or positive

# societal impact?

What are the right metrics in an individual’s life? Our social norms and

hierarchies might suggest we measure ourselves with money, fame, and

power. But studies have shown that money leads to greater happiness

only to the extent that our basic needs are met, after which its returns

diminish or even plateau. Other research shows many of us are on a

“hedonic treadmill”: After we get a pay raise, are promoted, or purchase

something that triggers a pleasurable high, we return to our original

level of happiness. And then there is social comparison — no matter

what you achieve, someone will always be richer, more famous, or more

# powerful than you.

The ancient Greeks saw two main dimensions of a great life: hedonia

## (a focus on pleasure) and eudaimonia (a focus on virtues and on

meaning). More recently, scholars have pointed to the importance of

social connection. A study of more than 27,000 people in Asia found a

strong correlation between being married and being satisﬁed with life,

while a study that has followed 268 Harvard College men from 1938

to the present, and was expanded to include their children and wives,

as well as a study that has followed 456 residents of inner-city Boston

since the 1970s, also expanded to include children and wives, found that

meaningful relationships were the key driver of long-term happiness.

## The late Harvard Business School professor Clayton Christensen agreed:

In his classic HBR article “How Will You Measure Your Life?” he wrote,

“I’ve concluded that the metric by which God will assess my life isn’t

dollars but the individual people whose lives I’ve touched.”

A framework that includes all these factors — hedonic, eudemonic,

and relational — is the PERMA model, introduced by Martin Seligman,

## the founder of positive psychology and a University of Pennsylvania

professor, in his 2011 book, Flourish. Other researchers later developed

it into PERMA-V, which stands for Positive emotions (frequent feelings

of pleasure and contentment), Engagement (being in the ﬂow, losing

## track of time), Relationships (mutual feelings of caring, support, and

love), Meaning (contributing to making the world a better place),

## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

Achievement (striving for success or mastery, reaching goals), and

Vitality (being healthy and energetic).

To determine what makes a great life for you, start with each element

in PERMA-V, or even add your own categories, such as autonomy or

## spirituality. Then rate each one’s importance to you on a scale from

0 (not important) to 10 (very important). Try to recall periods of deep

satisfaction in your past and consider what triggered them.

In the ﬁrst step of strategy projects, we conduct a comprehensive

analysis of the status quo. So, you should also rate your current

satisfaction with each dimension on a scale from 0 (not at all satisﬁed)

to 10 (very satisﬁed). This quick assessment will give you a rough idea

of how you deﬁne a great life and initial ideas about what you need to

# change.

- 2. What is my life purpose?

For a corporate strategy to be successful, it must be anchored to the

organization’s purpose, which lies at the intersection of, What are we

good at? and What does the world need?, and takes into account, What

are our values? and What excites us? Using these questions, we’ve

helped companies around the world develop purpose statements. A

## purpose statement serves as an important guardrail for your strategy

and is a North Star for your organization.

The same questions can be used to ﬁnd your life purpose. Ask yourself,

What am I good at? Think about situations at work or in other areas of

life in which you have demonstrated critical strengths such as creativity,

teamwork, or communication. Then ask, What are my core values?

Think about critical decisions you’ve made and principles you hold

dear that have provided direction, such as honesty, fairness, or integrity.

There are dozens of online lists and tests to help you consider your most

important values. The next question is, Which activities light me up?

## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

Perhaps your answers include mentoring, problem-solving, or engaging with diﬀerent types of people. Finally, ask, What need can I help address

in the world? It could be one of the 17 Sustainable Development Goals

## of the United Nations, such as health, education, gender equality, or

climate action, or it could be something much more general, such as

# love, kindness, trust, or security.

In the purpose-deﬁning stage of strategy projects, we conduct belief

audits to get input from many stakeholders. Do the same. Ask friends or

family members what your strengths are, what values you live by, what

things excite you, and what need you might help ﬁll.

Draw from your own answers and theirs to draft a purpose statement,

and then ask for feedback on it. Or you can engage ChatGPT in an

interactive dance, using the answers to the four questions as input to

help you develop your purpose statement, as Tom, a climate physicist,

did in one of our recent workshops.

When Joudi, a Kurdish refugee from Syria currently living in Germany,

went through this exercise, he identiﬁed his core strengths as ambition,

passion, and hunger for knowledge. His core values were justice,

peace, family, and charity. He said he was most excited by innovation,

neurosurgery, and entrepreneurship (notably his experiences selling

accessories as a street vendor in Istanbul and founding a multilingual

AI-powered integration support platform for Ukrainians who had ﬂed

their country for Germany). As for the world needs he wanted to

address, Joudi cited health care, freedom, and equality. In the end, he

wrote this purpose statement: “Remain medically passionate, willing to

learn, entrepreneurial, and strong-willed to drive medical innovation

and create equitable access to health care for people.”

A chief human resources oﬃcer at a global industrial company wanted

to step down from her current role but was unsure whether she should

look for a similar role in another company or do something completely diﬀerent. She went through the seven steps and came up with a simple

purpose statement, “To help and lead others to aspire,” through which she realized that she did want another senior HR role, just in a diﬀerent

# company.

There are other methods for deﬁning one’s life purpose, of course.

But it’s important to ﬁnd the time and a way to do it. We’ve seen

some workshop participants sharpen their existing purpose ideas, while

others have had a real “aha” moment, ﬁnally understanding what they

were meant to do. Purpose guides your life strategy.

- 3. What is my life vision?

The next step in building a corporate strategy is to set out a vision

for the future. We typically ask leadership teams where they want

their organization to be — in terms of innovation, growth, product

portfolio, market presence, etc. — in ﬁve to 10 years. Often we have

them ask themselves questions like, What newspaper headline about

our company would we like to read a decade from now?

Individuals should also strive to envision who they want to become in

the years ahead. As the Stoic philosopher Seneca said, “If you do not

know which port you are sailing to, no wind is favorable.” At the same

time, you want to remain open to surprises and serendipity. Seneca

commented on this as well: “Luck is what happens when preparation

meets opportunity.” Strategizing your life is the preparation.

So, ask yourself: What story would I like people to tell about me ﬁve to

10 years from now? What would I do if money wasn’t an issue? What will

the 80-year-old me not want to have missed in life? Your purpose and

your strengths might also trigger some ideas about your vision.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

For this step we have used a photo-sorting exercise similar to what

our corporate clients use in branding and innovation strategy projects.

Out of 180 photos, workshop participants select two to four that best

represent their personal and professional vision — what one person

described as a “mood board.”

In both business and individual life strategy, a vision can give you

focus. Jim, who will soon be a doctor, had a purpose statement that

was rather general: “Bring people together and share passions.” His

vision was more concrete and speciﬁc: “To create spaces for more social encounters, such as a medical practice with a shared coﬀee shop, and

to get involved in homeless medicine.” Your vision should be equally

# descriptive.

You might end up with a short list of bullet points or a one-sentence

summary of your vision. No matter how you capture it, a vision

statement can be powerful in guiding your life. An example we love

comes from our colleague Sebastian when he was 14. After a poor math

test result, his teacher told him, “Teaching you is a waste of time” and

warned he’d never get a high school diploma. For the next couple of

years Sebastian took that to heart, skipped school, and started working

as a bricklayer. Eventually, however, he decided to make a change, and it

began with this vision statement: “I will go to university and get a PhD

and then go back to my math teacher — all in the next 10 years.” He did

just that, graduating summa cum laude with a PhD in economics, and in

another 10 years he was a managing director and a partner at BCG.

- 4. How do I assess my life portfolio?

Companies typically use portfolio analysis to assess their business units

on key parameters such as market growth or share and to decide where

to invest capital. BCG is well-known for its 2×2 growth-share matrix.

But what is the equivalent of a business unit in life? We focus on six

## strategic life areas (SLAs): relationships; body, mind, and spirituality;

## community and society; job, learning, and ﬁnances; interests and

entertainment; and personal care. We then subdivide the six SLAs into

16 strategic life units (SLUs). (For a full list of the SLUs, see the exhibit

# “The Key Areas of Life.”)

See more HBR charts in Data & Visuals on HBR.org.

And what are the equivalents of capital expenditures in life? Time,

energy, and money. A week has 168 hours. How do you spend them?

## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

With your signiﬁcant other, with family, at work, playing sports, at

church, getting a good night’s rest?

Look back at the past year, including holidays, and assess how much

time you spent on each of the 16 SLUs in an average week. When an

activity crosses categories, split the time between them. For example,

if you went jogging with your signiﬁcant other for one hour a week,

allocate half an hour to the signiﬁcant other SLU and half an hour to the

physical health/sports SLU. Next, rate all 16 SLUs on a scale of 0 to 10

based on how important they are to you. Then rate the satisfaction you

derive from each on the same scale. (This goes one level deeper than the

# similar PERMA-V exercise.)

Now sketch out your own 2×2; we call it the Strategic Life Portfolio. But

instead of mapping growth against share, you will put the importance

of each SLU on the y-axis and the satisfaction it brings on the x-axis.

Plot each SLU with a bubble, making the size of the bubble roughly

proportional to the percentage of time in a week you spend on it.

In the top-left quadrant, you will ﬁnd the SLUs of high importance

and low satisfaction. These are areas of high urgency, because you care

about these activities deeply but aren’t focusing on them enough to get

the most out of them. The SLUs in the top-right quadrant also deserve

some attention: You want to keep devoting signiﬁcant time and energy

## to your most important and highest-satisfaction activities, and invest

less in those that are less important (bottom left and right).

Finally, look at your entire 2×2 and ask yourself: Does my current

portfolio of SLUs put me on the right track to support my purpose and

achieve my vision? Does it bring me closer to how I deﬁne a great life?

Where can I save and reallocate my time? Just as in corporate strategy

projects, you want to set some high-level priorities — rather than a

## detailed plan — for investments of your time, energy, and money.

When Toni, an engineer, completed this exercise, he saw four

## areas for urgent improvement in the top-left quadrant: signiﬁcant

other (since he didn’t have one), mental health/mindfulness, societal

engagement, and education/learning. His job/career SLU was split

between two quadrants, and he was spending too much time on online

entertainment, which charted in the bottom-right quadrant. It became

clear to Toni what he needed to change.

- 5. What can I learn from benchmarks?

In almost every strategy project, we do a best practice and

benchmarking analysis to understand what we can learn from leading

companies. We can do the same for individuals by looking at role

## models and then, more importantly, at the research on life satisfaction.

Ask yourself: Who conducts their personal and professional life in a

way I admire? Maybe it is a coworker caring for his bedridden parent,

the mother of three at your kids’ school who also manages payroll for

a Fortune 500 company, or your religious leader who lives his purpose.

Ask yourself what makes them admirable, and what choices they would

make if they were in your shoes.

Now consider what scientiﬁc studies tell us about life satisfaction —

not anecdotally but across large populations. We already mentioned

the Harvard and Asia studies. One of the largest studies worldwide

on life satisfaction is the German Socio-Economic Panel survey, which

covered almost 100,000 people from 1984 to 2019, gathering more than

700,000 completed responses. It found that signiﬁcant others, children,

friends, sports, spirituality, community involvement, salaries, savings,

and nutrition all contribute to life satisfaction. Not surprisingly, health

problems have a very negative impact, and you can ﬁnd an optimum

amount of time to spend on leisure and sleep.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

Other studies have found that proven life-enhancers include practicing

kindness, mindfulness, meditation, and gratefulness; cultivating more

humor and laughter; dedicating time to learning; and developing a

growth mindset (that is, believing your abilities and life can improve through eﬀort and persistence).

As you do this work, it’s important to understand and learn from what

has worked for others, while also remembering that you can’t just copy

and paste someone else’s approach. Your life strategy should be unique

# to you.

- 6. What portfolio choices can I make?

Corporate strategy is about making choices between options: Should

we keep our current portfolio, diversify, focus, acquire a company, or

enter a new market? In life, the equivalent questions are: What happens

if I continue to live my life the way I am now? What if I change my

priorities? Equipped with your deﬁnition of a great life, your purpose,

your vision, your SLU ratings, and your benchmarks, you are ready to

# ﬁnd out.

Go back to the great-life exercise in step 1 and think about what you

can do for your areas of dissatisfaction. Review your purpose and vision

from steps 2 and 3 and brainstorm how you might realize them. Think

about the SLUs that step 4’s portfolio exercise identiﬁed as needing

more attention, and how you can improve satisfaction or reallocate time

there. Then consider how the insights gleaned from step 5’s benchmarks

can help you with all of the above. From this long list of potential

changes and actions — small and large — select several that will best

## move you toward a great life, and commit to them.

Now you need to be speciﬁc about what you want to change.

Examples from our workshop attendees include reconnecting with

three friends from school, visiting one’s grandpa every week, engaging

in a weekly micro-adventure with one’s signiﬁcant other, changing jobs,

committing to a new sleep schedule, trying a meditation app, starting a

gratitude journal, spending more time with one’s kids, exercising every

day, supporting refugees, starting a social business, practicing religion

again, dedicating 15 minutes to learning every day, switching college

majors, converting a van into a camper to travel, and moving abroad.

The possibilities are endless.

On the other hand, you have only 168 hours each week, which means

you must reduce, outsource, or bundle existing activities, or make them

more eﬃcient through productivity strategies and tools. For example,

when you work out with your boyfriend or volunteer for a good

cause with your friends, you are bundling sports and signiﬁcant other

or societal engagement and friendship. Life strategy is about setting

priorities; it is not about ﬁlling every waking minute. Remember to

## reserve space in your calendar for downtime as well. Researchers at

## the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School and UCLA’s Anderson

School of Management found that people are happiest when they have

two to ﬁve hours of free time each day.

When Judi, a workshop attendee, ﬁnished making her list of actions, she commented, “If I change all this, I will be a diﬀerent person in

a few weeks.” Your life strategy could involve big steps like starting

a business, traveling the world (as one of us did), or setting up an NGO, or it could involve a small step like meeting for coﬀee every

week with people you care about. Even a small change can have a

big impact in two key ways. First, if you do it over and over again,

you take advantage of the compound growth rate. Second, you are a node in a network of people, so your change not only aﬀects those

close to you but also ripples outward. After all, sometimes big changes

are triggered by small, seemingly insigniﬁcant actions — the famous butterﬂy eﬀect. For example, research has shown that doing just 15

minutes of physical activity a day increases life expectancy by three

years (despite amounting to only about half a year of time investment).

Exercise also gives you a dopamine boost, improving your mood, which

beneﬁts those around you and makes you more productive at work,

potentially leading to new outputs that greatly impact the lives of

# others.

If you know which strategic life unit needs work but don’t know

what changes to make, dig deeper and develop a substrategy for

that unit — a job/career strategy, a family strategy, a mental health/

mindfulness strategy, and so on — just as each business unit does with

the overarching corporate strategy.

For example, to develop a job/career strategy, ask yourself the following

questions: How does my current job support my purpose and vision?

Does my current job give me a sense of achievement and engagement

(two of the six great-life dimensions)? How does my current job align

with the strengths I identiﬁed in the purpose step? Finally, look for

benchmarking data, such as BCG’s Decoding Global Ways of Working

study, where we list the top 10 criteria of great jobs according to more

than 200,000 respondents. Again, rate how your job measures up to

these criteria. The answers to these questions will give you an idea of

how to move forward in your career.

- 7. How can I ensure a successful, sustained life change?

Change is not easy. Need proof? More than 40% of Americans set New

Year’s resolutions each January, and reports indicate that more than

90% fail to follow through on them.

Many companies, such as Google, ensure successful implementation

of the strategies they’ve outlined by using OKRs (objectives and

key results). OKRs are focused, ambitious, output-oriented, ﬂexible,

# measurable, and transparent.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Use Strategic Thinking to Create the Life You Want

We recommend doing the same for each of the changes you committed

to in step 6. Deﬁne the broad objective and the date by which you

want to achieve it. Then break down each of those objectives into a

few key results or action items, again with deadlines. Consider adding

them directly to your calendar. If you are unsure about implementing a

big move in your life, experiment. For example, Toni identiﬁed mental

health/mindfulness as a high priority, so he might set an objective of

“Download an app and try meditation techniques for 10–15 minutes a

day (ﬁnish by the end of November).” He could then break it down into

two key results: (1) review meditation apps and get started (ﬁrst week of

November), and (2) try an app for three weeks, review the experience,

and make it a daily habit (last three weeks of November).

There are many ways that companies hold themselves to OKRs. Here,

we focus on three of them. Anchoring means sharing your plan, as

Google does by making its OKRs public. Who will you tell about your

plan or ask to join you on your journey? Strategy projects always involve

small teams, so consider not only seeking input from others but also

inviting one or two people to work on their own life strategies and then

workshop everyone’s results as a group. Consequences means setting up

## incentives for achievement, such as bonuses for success or penalties

for failure. How will you reward yourself when you’ve successfully

changed an aspect of your life, and what will the consequences be

if you don’t? And check-ins means routinely stepping back, reﬁning and adjusting your eﬀorts, and celebrating your achievements, as agile

project development teams do. When each week can you spend 15

minutes to review and update your life strategy?

Toni, for example, might tell a friend to hold him to his changes,

promise to donate a signiﬁcant amount of money to a charitable cause

if he doesn’t stick to them, and schedule a weekly check-in with himself

# every Sunday before his study session.

# Your One-Page Life Strategy

Often, the seeming enormity of an important task — like life strategy

development — is what stops us from doing it. So, to make what seems

impossible possible, we recommend putting your entire life strategy on

a single sheet of paper. We borrowed this idea from one-page summaries

we have used in past strategy projects, and we saw it with Craig Perrett,

a leadership coach who helps very senior executives at BCG manage

their time after a successful career. If you have ﬁnished the exercises in

this article, you can easily ﬁll out this worksheet.

To start, write down what deﬁnes a great life for you. Next, record your

strengths, your values, what lights you up, and what the world needs,

and then add your purpose statement that incorporates those ideas.

Third, summarize your life vision. Fourth, refer to that 2×2 you sketched

and note the SLUs that are high priorities for action or that you spend

too much time on. Next, write down the changes you’d like to make

and commit to. Finally, for each of those changes, list an objective and

two to three key results with deadlines, and then note the anchors, the

consequences, and the check-in plan to make the change stick.

weekly 15-minute check-in, we recommend scheduling a longer, one- to

## two-hour review session with yourself, or with the life strategy group

you started with other people, every six to 12 months. Review all seven

steps, consider setbacks or shifting circumstances, and adjust

# accordingly.

The chief human resources oﬃcer we mentioned earlier puts her one-

pager on top of all the papers on her desk. She looks at it every day to

reinforce her belief in what makes a great life and to ensure she executes

on her strategy for achieving it; when she has an idea for reﬁnement,

she writes it down. You can try that, too. A couple we worked with, who

wanted to develop life strategies in tandem, went so far as to document

their life purposes and goals with photos and notes in a picture frame.

They hung it on the wall of their home, a daily reminder of where they

want to go both together and as individuals.

Life is full of adventure and trauma, love and sadness, joy and stress.

It can be great or terrible. There will be ups and downs. But a lot of it

depends on you and the choices you make. A life strategy will not only

guide you but also build your resilience so that you’re better able to

# recover from missteps.

Sophia, a doctor who suﬀered from a serious chronic illness, wrote

to us after attending a workshop: “I realized I want to make more

decisions, do really crazy things, enjoy small and big moments,

celebrate successes, go to places I’ve never been, meet people I’ve never

seen before, take breaks in between, follow my ﬂow, and make myself

# my most important project in life!”

Now, go and do the same. Your life is your top strategic priority.
