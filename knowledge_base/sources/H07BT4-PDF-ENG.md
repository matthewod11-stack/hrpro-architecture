To get deals over the line in today’s high-pressure sales environment,

sellers must undertake new, challenging activities outside their comfort

zones. The ongoing need for agility is taking its toll: In a recent Gartner

survey of more than 900 B2B sellers, 89% report feeling burned out and

54% report actively job seeking.

# HBR / Digital Article / Why Some of Your Salespeople Are Dragging — and How to Fix It

Sales leaders recognize the acute talent challenge on their hands,

particularly in the era of catchily named, viral workplace trends (looking

at you, quiet quitting). They clutch the old playbook in the hopes

of ﬁnding some way to motivate their people by making tweaks to

# compensation, recognition, and reward.

The problem is, nearly six in 10 sellers describe the leadership of their

sales organization as not understanding what “really” motivates sellers.

# Seller Drive Isn’t The Issue

Through our research, we were surprised to learn that motivation

toward work is not the problem.

In fact, 76% of sellers report high levels of motivation toward work,

or what we call drive. Sellers experiencing drive are mentally engaged,

ready to take action, and persistent in the face of obstacles. Drive is

## an important predictor of seller success and a natural focus of sales

leaders. As one might expect, higher drive is associated with higher

# quota attainment.

So if three in four sellers report high levels of drive, then how can

they also be burned out and looking for a new job? Blame another lesser-

known character lurking in the seller motivation story – an evil twin of

sorts whom we’ve come to call drag.

# Drive’s Evil Twin: Drag

Sellers experiencing drag are plagued by workday boredom and

distraction. They procrastinate. They “go through the motions” to

satisfy activity-tracking requirements. Meanwhile, progress on true

# priorities languishes.

Essentially, drag is demotivation away from work. But it’s more than

just an unpleasant experience: Drag is statistically associated with lower

## quota attainment and higher levels of active job searching.

High-drag sellers are more likely to be job hunting. We found that 70%

of high-drag sellers report actively looking for new job opportunities,

compared to only 7% of low-drag sellers. Between an open territory,

hiring expenses, and ramp time, seller turnover is costly. Not only are

high-drag sellers more likely to leave, but their performance suﬀers as

well. Relatively speaking, mean quota attainment is 1.7 times higher for

# low-drag (vs. high-drag) sellers.

On the whole, drag predicts worse performance and increased intent to

leave. What’s most concerning about drag, however, is that even sellers

with high drive aren’t immune to its eﬀects.

# Sellers Feel Conflicted

The dynamics of seller motivation are complex. For many sellers, both

## drive and drag resonate with their day-to-day work experience.

According to sellers we interviewed, although some aspects of the job

can be engaging — especially live interactions with customers and

colleagues — others can be a real drag. Our survey results conﬁrmed

it: While more than three out of every four sellers have high drive, 83%

of sellers report medium or high levels of drag.

The subjective experience of drag is hardly cold and clinical. Sellers we

spoke to often expressed frustration with leadership’s failure to act on

their concerns. This begs the question: Why aren’t leaders doing more

# about this?

Unfortunately, it turns out they’re simply going about it the wrong

way. Sales leaders tend to chase marginal increases in drive via

compensation and recognition. But our research suggests that leaders

who properly diagnose and address drag will see greater improvements

## in seller retention and commercial performance.

# Diagnose and Reduce Drag

Drag is a symptom of deeper organizational issues. The good news?

That’s precisely what makes it so treatable. Our analysis shows that

two of the biggest and most common contributors to drag are a lack of

career development opportunities and feeling like a cog in a machine.

Ultimately, however, the most important causes of drag can vary by

# organization.

The ﬁrst step to diagnose drag in any sales organization is to move

## beyond periodic skip-level meetings, climate surveys, or manager

feedback. These standard approaches can often lead to misdiagnosis,

encouraging leaders to treat the surface level symptoms of drag rather

# than its underlying causes.

Lever, a small HR software organization selling talent acquisition

solutions, undertook a co-investigation alongside sellers to increase

engagement and curb attrition. Their comprehensive diagnostic

approach is credited with a reduction in seller attrition, down from

double digits to only 3% year to date. Their work highlighted four

essential steps in eﬀectively understanding and solving unique sources

# of seller drag:

## Tailor a collaborative investigation process.

Any approach to soliciting seller input should incorporate multiple

channels to provide honest feedback, including at least one avenue to

do so anonymously. At Lever, a mix of focus groups, guided discussions,

and surveys ensured that sellers could share speciﬁc pain points and

also beneﬁt from the perspective of their peers, clarifying which issues

were potentially systemic.

Synthesize seller feedback to uncover unstated needs.

Lever sellers met in small groups to discuss common pain points and

decide which to prioritize in their reporting. Leadership consolidated

input to distill key overarching themes and further investigate root

causes of particularly consequential issues. Interestingly, leaders did

not put the onus on sellers to make a business case for ﬁxing each

concern raised. Instead, sellers were asked to rate the impact on either

the customer experience and/or their own employee experience.

Develop a mixed-project portfolio.

Lever used an investment portfolio approach to analyze and prioritize

the relative costs and beneﬁts of each potential project according to

## time horizon, risk, and impact (on both the seller experience and the

customer experience). The ﬁnal project mix was selected based on

urgency, visibility, and resource intensity to achieve optimal return on

# investment over time.

Maximize seller buy-in by being transparent.

Lever’s next step was to begin developing shared project dashboards

to document rationale for which drag-reduction eﬀorts to prioritize

## and implement. Progress updates in the implementation stage serve

to further signal leadership’s commitment to improving the seller

# experience.

## Cutting Through The Fog of Career Development

Fifty-nine percent of sellers report having trouble envisioning a clear

## and attainable career path within their sales organization. Those sellers

who perceive a lack of career development opportunities tend to

# experience higher levels of drag.

High-drag sellers are in turn up to 35% less likely to attain quota

and up to 51% more likely to be actively job-seeking than their low-

drag counterparts. To reduce seller drag, sales leadership must address

the risk and uncertainty that accompanies career movement at many

# organizations.

Unfortunately, sellers looking to branch out within their

organization typically have limited knowledge of available alternatives.

Traditionally, sellers have climbed a vertical career ladder, graduating

to bigger or better accounts, segments or goals — perhaps even moving

into management. This trajectory tends to aﬀord limited opportunity to

## ﬂex and stretch across a wide range of relevant competencies.

To address these common shortcomings, one approach is to develop a

# “career lattice.”

A career lattice incorporates traditional career path advancement, but

adds more opportunities to gain experience and skills training in

related, parallel roles. It clariﬁes role responsibilities using consistent

language to describe skill requirements and allowing sellers to assess

# skill transferability.

The very existence of a career lattice signals a commitment to helping

employees envision a bright future within the organization, but lattices

are hardly the only way to signal a genuine investment in seller

# development.

FedEx’s European sales group understood that limited career

development opportunities can jeopardize seller engagement. Merely

oﬀering clear options may not be enough — for many sellers, internal

## career exploration feels reputationally risky.

To address these concerns, FedEx changed how they structured their

seller leadership academy. Under the new program, selected applicants

could test drive a management role before fully committing, with

no penalty for opting out and remaining in a frontline sales role.

Unselected applicants were provided with supplemental development

opportunities and individual coaching to help position them for success

in the next application cycle, further mitigating perceived risk.

FedEx didn’t limit program eligibility to a hand-selected few. Instead,

they changed how they identiﬁed leadership academy candidates:

Rather than requiring nomination from a manager, sellers could

now signal their career aspirations and commitment by applying

independently. According to FedEx’s European Sales VP, the Sales

Leadership Academy (SLA) has been a valuable tool for the next

# generation of sellers:

“When we look at why people leave, it’s the lack of development

opportunities. Through SLA, we’ve seen a reduction in turnover as

SLA prevents other ﬁrms from poaching talent, and there has been

improvement in seller engagement as well.”

Leaders might question expanding career development opportunities

if those opportunities make it easier for sellers to leave the sales

organization. But our research shows that sellers who feel locked

into a particular career path are more likely to look for outside job

## opportunities. Furthermore, their pre-resignation performance might

also suﬀer, leading to lost revenue.

# Empowering Sellers

Fifty-six percent of sellers report feeling like a cog in a machine, while

76% feel that sales leadership dictates how to meet their sales objectives.

Sellers experiencing drag from feeling like a cog in a machine are up to

34% less likely to achieve quota and up to 44% more likely to be actively

job seeking.

Many sales organizations believe standardized, repeatable sales plays

limit risk, minimize skill gaps, boost aggregate performance, and

generate predictable revenue. But this approach may leave sellers

feeling that they have little control over their work, providing scarcely

# any real value.

To reduce this source of drag, leaders should empower sellers by

encouraging them to solve customer problems and improve business

processes. Successful seller empowerment eﬀorts are guided by three

# principles:

- 1. Meaningful work. Ensure opportunities will have a material impact

## for either the organization or the customer.

- 2. Guardrails. Limit risks associated with seller innovation by

setting clear boundaries through scoping, seller enablement, and a

# systematic review process.

- 3. Exportability. Harness the impact of successful seller insights

through formal implementation or productization of promising new

# ideas.

SAGE, an academic publishing company, took a seller empowerment

approach rooted in these principles to address seller frustration and

disengagement arising from the inability to meet customer product

# needs.

SAGE asked sellers to propose modiﬁcations to SAGE’s product set.

First, sellers drafted an initial product brief linking the new proposed

oﬀering to an unmet client need. Next, cross-functional partners

worked with the seller to vet and further develop the proposal. High-

potential solutions were turned into products and in turn, introduced to

# the market.

Sales leaders have long relied on seller drive to carry the day. But the

focus must shift to drag and its outsized impact on commercial results.
