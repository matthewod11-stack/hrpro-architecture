Élodie is a senior leader in a technology company. She has a young

child and a husband who also works. She is particularly strong at

## two skill sets: leadership and collaborative problem solving. Because of

this, she’s considered critical for major company initiatives.

What’s her reward for being such a high performer?

- Stressful goals: Because she’s done so well in the past, she often

receives the most complex and risky goals after others have failed.

- Meeting mania: Because she is seen as an essential part of the team

and can often solve even the thorniest of issues, her days are ﬁlled with

back-to-back meetings, which requires her to get work done at night

# and on weekends.

- Under-mentored: Because her organization focuses on ﬁxing and

improving “squeaky wheels,” Élodie feels under-mentored by her

leaders. Since she doesn’t cause problems, her needs are not met.

- Return-to-oﬃce pressure: Because she’s “high proﬁle,” Élodie has a

higher expectation to work from the oﬃce, resulting in less ﬂexibility.

On top of that, leadership is becoming harder. Skill gaps, decreasing

loyalty, worsening volatility, and higher worker expectations have

increased the burden on leaders to the point where leaders are burning

out at signiﬁcantly higher levels. After battling burnout for months,

Élodie quit, despite her company taking all the standard measures to

retain talent. So why aren’t current attempts working?

For many reasons, and as we describe in our book Primed to Perform,

many companies build cultures that are focused on controlling the

output of low performers, rather than growing and unlocking everyone’s

skills. For example, think about your task management meetings, where

you review what tasks are red (problematic), yellow, or green. Who is

this meeting for? Its purpose is typically to ensure that low performers

get the bare minimum done. But is it helping low performers improve?

And is it the best use of high performers’ time? In both cases, usually

# not.

Or consider traditional annual performance reviews, which are typically

designed to strike fear in low performers rather than help high

performers excel (which comes instead from continuous developmental

coaching). Rigid goal setting and approval, mandatory training

programs detailed procedural guidelines — none of these processes

accelerate your most valuable colleagues.

This approach is low-ROI and ultimately problematic for high-

performance cultures. Leaders spend an inordinate amount of time

handholding their least productive colleagues and managing what

they’re working on and how, instead of helping their strongest

contributors move faster and do more. Meanwhile, because these

handholding tactics are focused on pushing the work forward rather

than ﬁguring out how to get better, they fail to turn low performers into

high performers. Ultimately, by failing to nurture skill or motivation,

low performance cultures stunt growth and repel top talent.

Organizations need to build cultures that are obsessed with high

performers, focusing the culture on keeping high performers and

making new ones. Here’s how.

- 1. Reduce Meetings Down to the Minimum Viable Dose

One of the biggest pain points in organizations today is too many

meetings. In Élodie’s example, high performers are hit the hardest,

because they are constantly dragged into conversations to help unblock

their colleagues or ﬁx their issues. If you want to keep your top talent,

you must free them up to spend more of their time on interesting,

# impactful work.

The ﬁrst step is boiling meetings down to a minimum. After decades

of research and experimentation, we have found that the following

meeting cadence works for most teams.

First, establish a simple weekly team rhythm that drives intensity,

not pressure. Every team should have just three weekly meetings:

prioritization on Monday; problem solving midweek; and “pencils

down” on Friday. Prioritization is about aligning on the team’s strategy

for the week. Problem solving is for discussing challenges that have

been percolating between meetings. And pencils down is to review

completed work, share feedback, and align on next steps.

Next, optimize your one-on-ones. Managers spend an inordinate

## amount of time in one-on-ones often due to an over-reliance on

live conversation to remove roadblocks. For example, one ﬁrst-time

manager we know at a leading mechanical engineering ﬁrm spends

about a third of his week in one-on-one meetings with his direct reports.

“Between one-on-ones and team huddles, I don’t have any time left for

the actual work,” he told us. But if you’re using the three weekly team

meetings well, then there will be much less need for one-one-ones.

Finally, strip down goal planning to the bare minimum: one quarterly

“goal check” conversation. During a goal check, the team should align

on its strategy for the next three months. These are the priorities that

will anchor the weekly rhythm of prioritization, problem solving, and

# pencils down.

Once you’ve taken extra meetings oﬀ the calendar, people’s time will

be cleared up for deep work and problem solving. This improves

everybody’s work, but it has an especially high impact on top

# performers.

- 2. Measure Your Team’s Motivation

When teams get stuck in vicious cycles and aren’t improving, high

performers get frustrated. In contrast, teams that measure motivation

have a blameless, action-oriented conversation about how to improve

and where they’re getting stalled out. This allows high performers to

take ownership, facilitate problem solving, and build a team culture

that’s worth sticking around for.

You can measure motivation using our online tool or using your own

preferred survey tool. Whatever method you use, you should be asking

# questions like the following:

- What are teammates excited about working on in the upcoming

# quarter?

- What might be causing them anxiety or pressure?

- What habits does the team want to improve?

- What are some speciﬁc ideas to improve those habits?

- What did we do really well last quarter that we should maintain?

Similar to the goal check, teams should conduct a quarterly health

check where they answer questions like the above and craft an

# improvement plan for the quarter.

- 3. Routinely Mentor High Performers on Concrete, High-Leverage Skills

Many high performers leave because they no longer feel they are

growing in their role. This is often a result of an extremely painful

performance review process, where the focus is on evaluation of past

results and assigning blame rather than providing helpful advice on

development and growth. The next time your team does performance

reviews, anchor the conversation around concrete skills that you believe

will increase performance. This shifts the mindset from evaluation on

past actions to learning for the future.

In most cases, few leaders know which skills to prioritize teaching, or

even how to teach them. We’ve found the skill sets of problem solving,

organizing teams, and leadership to be the most critical — and yet the

# least developed.

For example, imagine how Élodie would react if her leader had the

time to help her work through her burnout in regularly scheduled

development conversations. Perhaps Élodie has been struggling to

generate good ideas from her team, and so she has been playing

“hero,” coming up with all the solutions and implementing many on

her own. A skilled, devoted mentor might help Élodie work on the skill

of structuring problems so others can solve them, and by this time next

quarter, Élodie might not have to put the team on her back quite as

# much.

To make skill development easy, schedule a quarterly skill-check

meeting with each of your direct reports. During a one-hour

conversation, help your direct report reﬂect on their current skill goals

and, if they don’t yet have any or have hit them all, pick a new one.

Doing so will shift the culture changes from one where “squeaky

wheels” and underperformers get feedback, and instead, leaders have

forward-looking conversations to build up their high performers like

Élodie. High performers will take skill-based advice and run with it,

allowing them to grow in place, instead of jumping to a new job. Loyalty

# and performance grow hand in hand.

## The Impact of Being High-Performer Obsessed

No matter the kind of business you run or the people on your team, it

is worth investing in a high-performance culture. When organizations

make the switch, we’ve seen massive improvements in sales, quality,

and customer satisfaction, all while improving employee retention and

# motivation.

If you can build a high-performer obsessed culture, not only will you

retain your top talent, you will also elevate every colleague and make

## your organization a standout in your industry.
