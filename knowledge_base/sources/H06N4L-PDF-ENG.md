Accommodating a religiously diverse workplace is not just a nice to have practice; it’s increasingly becoming a must have for business and

company leaders. For 15 years, I’ve worked for Interfaith Youth Core

(IFYC), a nonproﬁt in Chicago that is dedicated to advancing interfaith

cooperation in the United States. The number one question I get from

peers in business and nonproﬁt spaces is not about the latest hot topic

related to religious identity — it’s usually some version of this: “As an

interfaith organization, how do you handle religious holidays for your

# employees?”

It’s not surprising that this question is coming up more and more.

Religious diversity in corporate America is a fact. Although nearly two-

thirds of Americans identify themselves as Christian, that number is

down 12% over the last decade, according to Pew Research Center on

## Religion and Public Life, and the number of people in America who

identify as Jewish, Muslim, Buddhist, and Hindu is increasing, as is

the number of people who identify as having no religious aﬃliation.

For decades, many companies’ holiday calendars have been oriented

around the major Christian holidays. As people who practice other

religions become a large portion of the talent base, these shifts require that HR and internal DEI eﬀorts update the way they handle policies for religious holidays — so that people can have time oﬀ to celebrate

whichever religious holidays are meaningful to them, their families, and

# their communities.

Welcoming employees’ religious diversity can even be a competitive

advantage. The Society of Human Resources points to studies that show

that when employers are attentive to recognizing and accommodating

their employees’ religious traditions, levels of employee engagement

and retention increase. More and more companies and corporations are

reaching out to IFYC, asking us to advise on religious accommodation

## issues and interfaith engagement for their employee and client base.

What can companies do to accommodate employees who need time oﬀ

# for religious observance?

One possible instinct is to close for all religious holidays, but that

would quickly become untenable. By some estimates, in 2021 there

are approximately 176 religious holidays. Closing the oﬃce for even a

third of those holidays would be a nonstarter for most organizations.

Another potential strategy is picking and choosing speciﬁc religious

holidays to observe as a company, but this strategy quickly becomes

complicated at best, and problematic at worst. This would, by default,

leave certain community members and traditions out, and therefore

would not meet the ultimate goal of showing respect for worldview

diversity. (At IFYC, we intentionally use the term “worldview” to

describe a guiding philosophy or outlook on life, which may be based

## on a particular religious tradition, spiritual orientation, non-religious

perspective, or some combination of these). The ideal is a step beyond

just “accommodation” — it’s to show employees that company leaders

value them and respect and welcome this aspect of their identity.

Below are some practical and meaningful ways that your organization

can support its religiously diverse employees:

Consider oﬀering your employees ﬂoating holidays: Our organization’s holiday policy is simple. We oﬀer 5 ﬂoating holidays, to

be used however the employee chooses to use them. Companies can oﬀer ﬂoating holidays alongside other paid time oﬀ. Our organization

provides employees paid federal holidays, with the exception of

Christmas Day (since Christmas Day is also a religious holiday). As a

committed Christian, at ﬁrst I found it strange to have to put in a time-oﬀ request for Christmas, but this experience helped me gain a

deeper appreciation for my non-Christian colleagues who are used to

such procedures to observe their holiest days.

Pair any ﬂoating holiday policies with generous PTO: Pairing our

ﬂoating holidays with a generous PTO policy is important, especially

because some religious traditions have more than ﬁve holidays. For

example, there are up to 13 Jewish holidays per year that can require

missing work. One of my colleagues observes all 13 each year, so she

uses up all of her 5 ﬂoating holidays and supplements the additional time needed with PTO. Oﬀering generous PTO and ﬂoating holidays gives employees enough time oﬀ to observe the religious, secular, or

spiritual holidays or traditions that are important to them while still having enough time oﬀ for other purposes.

Be mindful of language: Language matters, and that’s why we use the

term “ﬂoating holidays” instead of “religious holidays.” At IFYC, over

a third of our team members identify as Secular, Humanist, Agnostic, Atheist, or non-religious. This policy allows them to take time oﬀ for any

holiday or practice that is particularly meaningful for them, which may

not be tied to religious observance.

Have other ﬂexible policies in place to support your employees: In addition to having time oﬀ policies that support religious

accommodation for holiday observance, it’s also strategic to have other

ﬂexible policies in place. If you don’t already have a Flex Time policy, consider oﬀering options for your employees to ﬂex their hours, so

your team members have the option to work a ﬂexible schedule during

special periods of religious observance. For example, during Ramadan,

## a holy month where many Muslims fast during daylight hours, many of

my Muslim colleagues will start the workday early and then end early to

adjust for energy levels while fasting.

Beef up your religious literacy: As a manager, you can’t be expected to know everything there is to know about all the diﬀerent religious

traditions out there, but having a basic religious literacy to help you

navigate one of the most complex aspects of American life is a sound

investment in your leadership. It only takes a few minutes to get started.

Take IFYC’s 10 question interfaith literacy quiz to test your knowledge,

and check out IFYC’s knowledge toolkit for religious literacy to learn

## more about less appreciated or misunderstood traditions.

Ask questions: Open up space to encourage your team members

to share key tenets of their beliefs or traditions that may result in

requests for accommodation, particularly as they apply to dietary needs,

## holidays, clothing, and prayer requirements.

Don’t make assumptions: Don’t assume you know which holidays

adherents of a particular tradition observe or how they observe them.

For example, if Americans know of any Hindu holiday, it’s normally

Diwali, but many people may not know that Jains and Sikhs also observe Diwali for diﬀerent reasons. Another example: in the Jewish

tradition, Hanukkah is perhaps the most well-known holiday because

of its proximity to Christmas, but it’s usually not as important as

Rosh Hashanah, Yom Kippur, or three pilgrimage festivals (Passover,

Shavuot, and Sukkot) and doesn’t typically require missing work. Don’t

know? Ask!

It’s also important to note that accommodating religious holidays is just

one way to support your religiously diverse workplace. For us at IFYC,

providing a work environment that respects each employee’s religious

or non-religious traditions and observances is incredibly important,

because our work is ultimately about taking it a step further by creating spaces where people who orient around religion diﬀerently can build

## relationships and work towards the common good.
