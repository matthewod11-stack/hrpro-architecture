and a broad number of factors in play, but what’s clear is thatwell-being is driven only partially by material security.I’ve spent a great deal of time exploring this phenomena, which Ithink of as a crisis of purpose. In my

# HBR Guide to Crafting Your

Purpose, I try to articulate some ways in which normal people canlive more meaningful and flourishing lives. This includes anumber of thoughts on the things that can offer us truefulfillment: love, meaningful avocations, beauty, a purposefuloccupation, adherence to a religion or philosophy, and service toothers.But what doesn’t make us happy? Surprisingly, even with

Confucius, at our disposal, many of us continue to aspireto things that have no prospect of bringing us real meaning or joy.What are they?1) MoneyAlmost every major religion and philosophic tradition haspreached the foolishness and destructiveness of the love ofmoney. Still, so many of us continue to prioritize it as the numberone pursuit in our lives.Money can relieve suffering,

but alone, it doesn’t lead to

happiness. When I was born, my family and I lived in a single-wide trailer in central Florida. There were weeks when we didn’tknow where our food or money for medical bills would comefrom. Much of the world faces similar or more dire hardships —hunger, homelessness, lack of health care and other essential

resources. For people in these situations, money can be life-saving. If you need a meal, antibiotics, or a shelter for yourself andyour loved ones — money is critically important.But once a person’s needs are met, more money rarely leads togreater happiness. Professors Angus Deaton and DanielKahneman

found that income levels tend to stop improvinghappiness at around $75,000. While

a more recent study indicateshappiness can continue to improve with incomes beyond thatlevel, there does appear to be a point at which income stops beinga primary determinant of emotional well-being. (It’s $105,000 in

this study)Moreover, too much money can lead to increased

# loneliness and

anxiety. Money often complicates

# family dynamics and

relationships. This is, at least in part, because while money canalleviate our most pressing material concerns, it can also

# trigger

us emotionally and complicate our views of the world. Viewedwrongly, money can make us paranoid about the motives ofothers, and lead to feelings of jealousy, envy, or insecurity —particularly if we begin to measure ourselves by it. Someone willalways have more money, and money can be lost just as easily itcan be gained. Finally, money can tempt us into believing thatwealth is a proper measure of someone’s worth, when, of course, itis not.What money can’t do is provide for the most meaningfulexperiences in life — friendship, flow, a sense of purpose, andlove.2) LikesThe approval of others — fame, admiration, applause — hasalways been tempting. This is particularly true for teens andyoung people, whose brains are

wired to seek the approval of

others in ways that make them more vulnerable to social media.We humans have an innate

desire to be liked or

to belong, and weoften fall prey to the belief that being liked on a larger stage willlead us to being more pleased with our lives. But that’s not thecase.There are so many stories of famous people — celebrities,politicians, entrepreneurs — who achieve stratospheric successonly to fall prey to drug abuse, depression, and grief. These storiescan serve as a reminder: the pursuit of the approval of othersmore often leads to devastation than real happiness.In the age of social media, this problem has become more acute.

Millions of people seek the dopamine hit of “likes” and views onTwitter, Instagram, TikTok, Facebook, or other platforms,believing that more social media friends and attention will meana greater sense of worth. But often,

the opposite is the case.Emerging evidence shows that social media use and happinessare

inversely correlated. The rise of social media generally hasbeen directly linked to increases in

depression and anxiety. Inshort, social media’s positives (e.g., connecting with friends) aredramatically outweighed by its negatives (e.g., comparison, envy,anxiety, self-doubt, superficiality). Pursuing attention on theinternet, rather than leading to lasting fulfillment, can provokeloneliness, anxiety, superficiality, and depression.It’s important to distinguish between the more superficial types ofapproval gained from fame or social media and the genuinefulfillment available through deep and meaningful relationships.One of the primary determinants of a person’s fulfillment in life isthe

depth and breadth of their meaningful relationships. Serviceto others — whether visiting a home for the elderly or working ina soup kitchen — is a

surefire way to improve your life. But

cruising social media for fame and admiration is more likely tolead to emptiness than enlightenment.3) StuffIf you scroll Instagram or TikTok, you may have seen a popularseries of videos in your feed asking people about the cost of theirclothes, their cars, or their homes, and how they got them. Themessage underlying these videos seems to be: When we have astatus-worthy jacket, car, or mansion, we’ll be fulfilled.But “

stuff” won’t make you happy. Ample research indicates thataccumulating material possessions — much like accumulatingmoney — doesn’t improve life satisfaction and can actually leadto deeper feelings of anxiety, insecurity, and emptiness. Also likemoney, no matter how much stuff we have, someone else alwayshas more. The very act of status seeking is an anxiety-producingexternal game rather than a means of internal growth. Thenovelty of any material thing, whether a car or a computer,eventually wears off and the need to replace it grows.

Experiences are the opposite. Taking a yearly trip to the beachwith family or exploring a new continent with friends greatly addsto life satisfaction and leaves us with more enduring happiness.Unlike most things, experiences create lasting memories. Theycan expand our internal horizons and cause us to

think more

broadly. When done with friends, they offer an opportunity toinvest in meaningful relationships.“Stuff” will never be enough to give a life meaning, purpose, orjoy. But experiences and relationships will.The irony of life is that we often pursue things we think will makeus happy and fulfilled, only to find they’ve left us emptier andmore anxious once we attain them. Changing our behavior to

pursue the right things — purpose, meaningful relationships,service to others, and positive experiences — and away from thefalse promises of money, stuff, and attention, can help us to leadmore joyful and fulfilling lives.
