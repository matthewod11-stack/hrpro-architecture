work are paid fairly, regardless of their gender, race/ethnicity, orother protected class factors. In other words, equal pay for equalwork.“[E]quitable and fair pay is among the greatest drivers ofemployee satisfaction,” human resources research analyst andauthor Josh Bersin said in his

HR Predictions for 2022 report. “[I]fyou want to win the war for talent in 2022, fair pay may be one ofyour biggest techniques.”But pay equity is more than just a competitive tool in a red-hotlabor market. It’s an opportunity to foster innovation, driveemployee engagement, minimize turnover, maintain (or improve)brand reputation, and attract investors.In fact, a study conducted by job recruiting site

Indeed finds that81% of workers are more productive and engaged when theyperceive themselves as paid fairly. Moreover, that same reportsays 75% of employees are more likely to apply for a job when thecompany is known for pay transparency.With so much to gain from making pay equity a priority,employers who merely pay lip service or treat it as a one-off do soat their own risk. Employers that fail to effectively address payinequity open themselves to public backlash and legal action, allat the peril of the bottom line. This is especially true with moreand more

pay equity-related laws being enacted across the U.S.and abroad.

No matter where your organization is on its pay equity journey, adiligent, forward-looking vision is key. Fortunately, there areconcrete steps employers can take to demonstrate genuinecommitment to fair pay.

In my role spearheading pay equity audit practices for

Trusaic, apurpose-driven technology company, I assisted in developing thepay equity maturity model to help employers understand wherethey are regarding pay equity. It’s a three-level framework thatallows organizations to evaluate their current pay practices,progress, and long-term goals.To start, leaders should ask themselves some basic questions. Doyou have pay equity-related policies or initiatives? If so, are theydocumented and are they being measured? How do you involveyour employees? Do you actively communicate progress to all ofyour stakeholders, including employees, investors, the public,and/or your local community? Have you established your payequity goals? How are you tracking your progress towards thosegoals? Is there accountability?Your answers to these questions will be key to identifying whereyour organization falls in the model. As you evaluate your payequity efforts and ultimately determine your position, let thesequestions guide your progress. With some regularity, revisit themand see if you’ve advanced to the next level of the model.Below we outline the three levels, discuss the key factorsdistinguishing each level, and identify how businesses can ascendthe model to become a true fair-pay workplace.

The first stage of the model includes employers with an entry-level understanding of compensation equity. These types ofworkplaces typically lack strong DEI policies or representation,haven’t established concrete pay equity or DEI measurementsystems, and ultimately have low employee engagement.Employers at this level usually experience challenges incomplying with various local, state, and federal equal pay-relatedrequirements because they don’t have the resources to do so, orthey simply aren’t making pay equity a priority. As a result, theseemployers carry gender and or race/ethnicity wage disparities,whether they know it or not.This year, two companies in particular demonstrated the risks ofnot making pay equity a priority.The first is gaming company Riot Games, which recently

settled a$100 million gender discrimination lawsuit that included claimsof unequal pay, discrimination, sexual harassment, andretaliation with California’s Civil Rights Department.In addition to a lump-sum payment to affected workers, thesettlement requires the company to establish a reserve for makingpay adjustments and funding DEI programs, as well as conductroutine pay-equity audits to proactively identify potentialinstances of gender and race/ethnicity wage discrimination andremedy them once found.The second example is entertainment company ActivisionBlizzard, which reached

an agreement with the federal U.S. EqualEmployment Opportunity Commission for similar claims. On top

of paying $18 million for gender discrimination and sexualharassment charges, the company must enhance its pay-equitypolicies and DEI practices, as well as hire an internal equalemployment opportunity coordinator, among other actions.These organizations’ agreements with various state and federalgovernments forced them to incorporate elements of the payequity maturity model into their overall organizational strategy.Once these organizations implement the requested changes, theywill exhibit characteristics of level two of the pay-equity maturitymodel: programmatic.How to advance to the next level:

Establish a measurement system for employee baseline pay.

Deﬁne your pay-equity goals.

Continuously monitor your baseline pay to track progresstowards those goals.

## Communicate commitment and progress to relevantstakeholders.

Employers at the programmatic level of the model have fair-payinitiatives underway, measurement systems in place, and jobstructures and a pay philosophy documented. They’re compliantwith pay-equity laws and are working to improve representation.They communicate goals, progress, and achievement with variousstakeholders.

Employers should note that the programmatic level, whilesignificantly further along than the foundational level, is notnecessarily a safe zone.For example, despite making proactive pay-equity efforts,

LinkedIn recently paid almost $2 million in back pay to 700female workers in its California-based engineering, marketing,and product departments who were paid less than their malecounterparts. While the company was able to demonstrate that itwas making a conscious, proactive effort to foster fair-paypractices, the results of its internal analysis contrasted with ananalysis by the Department of Labor. LinkedIn denies allegationsof discrimination, but entered into the multi-million-dollarsettlement agreement. Since the settlement, LinkedIn has alsosigned the California Equal Pay Pledge, which among other items,demonstrates a commitment to ensure equitable pay practicesacross its workforce.This situation highlights the importance of data quality whenconducting pay-equity audits. If you’re making compensationdecisions based on faulty data, it can be costly and ultimatelycreate more pay inequity issues. Working with pay-equity expertscan help ensure reliable data are powering your pay equity audits.Software too plays an important role, since it can monitor payequity continuously and validate data.So, while conducting a pay equity audit is critical for becoming afair pay workplace, employers looking to advance to the highestlevel of the pay equity maturity model must take additionalaction.How to advance to the next level:

Validate data to ensure pay equity initiatives are accurate.

Routinely act on pay equity and representation ﬁndings toachieve fair pay.

Identify root causes and align initiatives to eliminate them.

Execute planned initiatives to address pay issues, eliminate paydisparities, and improve representation, employee sentiment,promotion, hiring, and retention.

## Achieve or surpass pay equity/DEI standards/industrybenchmarks.

## Regularly communicate progress to stakeholders.

Tie leadership bonus compensation to achieving DEI globalstandards.

Obtain third-party certiﬁcation demonstrating achievementand commitment to fair pay.

Employers who have reached this level have worked their fair-paygoals and initiatives into their business philosophy, and theycontinuously work towards promoting pay equity and DEI. Theyhave reliable data, routinely perform pay-equity audits, andsubsequently take action to correct the root causes of paydisparities, if identified. Moreover, employers at this stage of themodel solicit employee feedback and use it to drive their payequity initiatives.

L’Oreal and GM are two examples of companies at the top of themodel.

GM has regular ESG and CSR reporting in place,demonstrating workplace transparency and an ongoing

commitment to sustaining pay equity. GM has publicly sharedthat it has no overall gender pay gap and reported in

2019 thatwomen made up 55% of its board of directors.Last year L’Oreal became

EDGE certified, which means their payequity and DEI achievements were reviewed and verified by anindependent third-party auditor. Actions like receiving third-party certification prove to employees, investors, and other keystakeholders that the organization’s stance on pay equity isdocumented and confirmed.

Employers making pay equity a priority this year, and goingforward, should identify where they stand in the pay-equitymaturity model and what it will take to get to the next level. And,if you haven’t started on your pay equity journey, don’t wait anylonger.As the rapidly evolving work environment continues, one thing isclear: achieving fair pay is an ongoing effort that requires long-term commitment. Those eager to compete in the war for talentwill pursue it like any other business function. As the saying goes,what gets measured, gets managed.
