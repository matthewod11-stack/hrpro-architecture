Whenever we achieve a new milestone—whether it’s landing a major

client, winning a promotion, or beating sales targets—we’d love to think

our colleagues would cheer and support us. But it doesn’t always work

out that way. As your successes build up, you may begin to sense that a

colleague—even one who was once a friend—is starting to feel jealous or

# resentful of you.

## HBR / Digital Article / When Your Colleague Is Jealous of Your Success

It’s an uncomfortable situation, which most of us hope it’s a

misunderstanding or will simply go away over time. But unfortunately,

it’s more common that others’ jealousy and resentment will only

compound as you notch further career milestones. As executive

coaches and speakers on workplace issues, we’ve seen many successful

professionals hobbled by challenges with coworkers who’d like to bring

them down a notch. Here are ﬁve steps to take action when you feel that

a colleague is beginning to feel threatened by your success.

- 1. Check your assumptions.

It’s possible your colleague is feeling resentful—but it’s also possible

you misinterpreted a comment or that they were having a bad day.

Before making assumptions about their state of mind, it’s worth asking

# yourself:

- Have they recently changed their behavior toward you?

- Are they making backhanded compliments? (For instance,

“Congratulations on winning that account. Must be nice having the

# boss tee it up for you.”)

- Have they reduced the amount of time they spend with you, or

stopped providing support they previously gave?

- Have you seen evidence of competitiveness or “one-upmanship”

(e.g., challenging you publicly in meetings or diminishing your

# accomplishments to others)?

If you’ve seen repeated evidence of hostility or passive-aggressiveness

over time, it’s likely they’re actually feeling threatened by you and it’s

# not your imagination.

- 2. Understand why they’re jealous.

Once you’ve concluded that there really is a problem, the natural

impulse might be to avoid them so as to avoid the conﬂict. But that’s

the wrong move. Approaching them directly and thoughtfully can help

identify miscommunication that might eliminate the problem entirely.

For instance, your colleague may have made an incorrect assumption

about you and your motives (for example, “You got that promotion

because Brad’s team needed help and you let him fail”). Or a third party

might actually be feeding them negative information about you.

You can ask them: “I’ve noticed lately that when I speak in meetings,

you’re often taking the opposing view. Can you tell me more about that,

or is there something going on?” This gives them the opportunity to ask

## questions or air any perceived grievances.

Alternatively, if there’s a recent success that seems to have triggered

the problem, you might talk to them directly about it. “I know you also

wanted the promotion,” you might say, “and if I were in your shoes, it

might be diﬃcult for me. I just wanted to check in with you about that.”

A gracious strategy is to think about ways you can help your colleague.

They’re far less likely to feel resentful if they’re also on the path to success, and you’re helping them get there. For instance, you might oﬀer

to help them land big projects, mentor them through the process so that

they are successful, sponsor them for opportunities, and help them get

noticed for future promotions.

- 3. Analyze the power dynamics.

It’s useful to think through your relative organizational status, as

compared to your colleague. Which of you is more senior? Do you

need them to meet your professional needs either now or in the future?

Which of you is better networked inside the organization?

If you’re in the “power position,” you may be able to relax about your

colleague, as there’s frequent jealousy aimed up the corporate ladder,

and others are unlikely to take it seriously. But if a more powerful

colleague has taken a dislike to you, it may have serious consequences

# for your future at the organization.

Furthermore, consider if you have shared or competing goals. Can you

both get what you want? Or does one person need to lose for another to

win? You’ll want to create an inventory of potential ways they could seek

to harm you (for instance, speaking up against you when it’s time for promotions, or keeping you oﬀ an inﬂuential committee) and develop

strategies to mitigate against those risks. And you’ll likely need to take

further direct action, whether it’s speaking to them again, or possibly

raising the issue with their boss.

- 4. Find out who your true allies are.

There are people in your circle of trust who have always had your back

and are excited for you when you succeed. In fact, they might have had

an inﬂuential role by supporting you either publicly or privately. They

amplify your work in front of others, encourage you when you need

## some cheerleading, and push you outside of your comfort zone so that

you can learn and grow. These are the people whose support you’ll need

if a colleague who feels threatened by you starts to make trouble.

But in reviewing your allies, it’s also worth asking: Have you noticed

any changes in their actions toward you? Have they stopped returning

your calls or texts? Are they avoiding opportunities to interact? Perhaps

they’re no longer swinging by your oﬃce for a quick chat or they’re

only reaching out to you when they need something? Did they suddenly

unfriend you on social media or stop engaging with your posts?

Everyone has busy periods, but if someone has started avoiding you

on an ongoing basis, it’s likely a sign that you can no longer count

on them, perhaps because they’re jealous themselves, or because their

impression of you has been compromised by someone else who is.

- 5. Minimize contact if necessary.

You’ve tried to address the situation directly and turn around negative dynamics. But despite your best eﬀorts, some individuals cannot move

past their envy. They cling to a misguided, zero-sum mindset–the belief

that for one person to succeed, everyone else must fail, or at least, stay

# stagnant.

When this is the case, recognize that no amount of eﬀort on your

part will change their erroneous perspective. At this point, it becomes

essential for your own well-being to distance yourself. Such negative

people will ﬁnd fault with everyone else who succeeds, so it is best not

to be aﬃliated with them.

Cut the cord elegantly, but ﬁrmly. Remain cordial and professional in

necessary professional interaction, but don’t exert additional energy to

try and include or help someone who is likely to resent you (at best)

or backstab you (at worst). Your attention is better utilized fostering

relationships with colleagues who align with your newfound success

## and contribute to a healthy and collaborative environment. You can

never control how others perceive your success, but you can control how

much inﬂuence you are willing to let their negativity impact your life.

Generally speaking, those at the bottom compete, while those at the top

# collaborate. Choose wisely.

It’s discomforting when a colleague starts to feel resentful of your

accomplishments. But by following the strategies above, you can make

every attempt to turn them around and get them on your side—or to

limit the damage they can do to your professional aspirations.
