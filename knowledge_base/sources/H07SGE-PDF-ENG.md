The EU has long been committed to improving worker well-being,

claiming it wants to create more transparent and predictable working

conditions for all its 182 million workers. Now, it’s moving ahead with

# this objective on a number of fronts:

- Its Transparent and Predictable Working Conditions Directive, which

member states were required to enact by August 2022, is geared

toward improving employee protections and increasing labor market

# transparency.

- Its Work-Life Balance Directive, which came into eﬀect in 2019, aims

to set minimum standards for paternity, parental, and career leave as

# well as ﬂexible work arrangements.

- Its Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) mandates that,

starting in May 2024, any company with €40 million in net turnover,

€20 million in assets, or 250 or more employees that trades in Europe

publish detailed information about their eﬀorts to address a range of

# sustainability challenges.

In recent years, many companies hired a chief sustainability oﬃcer and

established a set of high-priority programs to reduce carbon emissions

and the risk of global climate change. The enactment of these new

regulations signals a new era in which it’s time to extend the concept

of sustainability to include similarly critical issues with the workforce —

an idea I call people sustainability.

People sustainability takes a holistic approach to corporate human

capital practices, including diversity and inclusion, well-being,

employee safety, and fair pay. It raises these human capital issues to the C-suite and obliges chief human resource oﬃcers to work with chief sustainability oﬃcers on these programs. It means that your

employee well-being eﬀorts are no longer delivered piecemeal, which

was ineﬀective no matter how well-intentioned or resourced they might

be.

The EU is essentially saying that all these “HR programs” are much

bigger than HR: They now fall into the category of global citizenship

mandates, and companies must treat and report them as such.

## How to Integrate People Sustainability into Your Company

I’m talking to European and U.S. ﬁrms about how they are gearing

up for the Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive and developing

people sustainability metrics. Here are examples of how a few

companies are approaching this:

- Heineken has developed standard measurements of human rights, fair

pay, and even living conditions for all its contract workers helping it

# deliver beverage sales around the world.

- Enterprise software leader SAP has coupled its industry-leading

## diversity program to new pay equity and sustainability initiatives.

For example, the company now openly publishes all pay bands so

employees can see where they are and the pay scales for all new

jobs posted. In parallel, it provides hiring and workplace support for

neurodivergent employees. After undertaking a progressive gender

pay equity analysis, it inaugurated a very aggressive program of

## promotions of women into senior leadership — all long-term “people

# sustainability” strategies.

- Financial services ﬁrm Liberty Mutual sees people sustainability

as a factor in limiting the global risks of its customers, partners,

and employees in the face of accelerating climate change. Chief sustainability oﬃcer Francis Hyatt, who previously served as executive

vice president of enterprise talent practices, oversees the integration

## of global climate issues in the ﬁrm’s risk management approach

and promotes sustainability solutions for employees, resellers, and

customers. The company promotes thought-through generational and

gender equality programs, and Hyatt ensures that every employee

understands how their long-term safety and success is part of the

company’s overall sustainability strategy. In other words, this new job

function uniﬁes all the brand’s existing HR work into the context of

sustainability and helping the planet.

What links all three of these major corporations is the way each

separately discovered that when you frame human capital investment

in the context of sustainability, it assumes even more importance than it

did before.

If you see value in this approach, where should you start at your

organization? Building on the European Union’s new detailed CSRD

reporting requirements, leaders will need to address issues ranging from

greenhouse gas emissions to gender pay across their own operations, as

well as that of their suppliers and business partners. You should try to

ensure sustainability becomes a pillar of operations as early as possible,

as the compliance clock is ticking.

The real action is to get your HR team to start working as soon

as possible with their ESG colleagues to get people sustainability

metrics and strategies into your business goals. To drive this, bring

together a team including your heads of HR, DEI, and ESG, as well

## as representatives from your corporate ﬁnance and legal teams, to

design your people sustainability program. You’ll ultimately want to

see these goals reﬂected in your annual report and other stakeholder

communications, so that these programs are seen as a core part of

# company strategy.

## A recent survey by PwC reveals that many CEOs anticipate climate

risk will aﬀect their cost proﬁles and supply chains in the next year.

However, despite these challenges, 60% of the surveyed CEOs do

not plan to reduce headcount, and 80% do not plan to decrease

compensation, as they recognize the importance of retaining talented

# employees.

Data like this underlines how people sustainability has become an

integral strategy for corporate growth. Investors will soon begin to

## measure the eﬀectiveness of a company’s well-being initiatives as a key

## metric of overall performance as much as its P&L.

You don’t have to be directly aﬀected by Europe’s new sustainability

laws to see that bringing together previously disconnected eﬀorts

## such as DEI, purpose, or L&D under the umbrella of “long-term

organizational sustainability” makes a lot of sense. You might even

see it as meeting the needs of the present without compromising your

future: a measure of sustainability that certainly gets my support.
