California’s department of motor vehicles was a mess back in 2019.

The state’s then-new governor, Gavin Newsom, described customers

as “outraged” by their DMV experiences. It could take several hours

to complete simple tasks like renewing a driver’s license. Ancient IT

systems meant many transactions that could have been automated were

dismal, in-person ordeals. Silos and mistrust within the department

undermined collaboration and change. And frontline employees were

demoralized and distressed.

That year, Governor Newsom hired veteran technology executive Steve

Gordon to transform the DMV: to increase online services, improve

service at ﬁeld oﬃces, and bolster employee morale. Gordon knew the

DMV was in crisis when he took the job, and not just from the troubling

statistics and press reports, but from his own visits to oﬃces. At the San

Jose DMV oﬃce Gordon visited while he was still considering the job, a

long line formed at 6 a.m. — two hours before the doors would open at 8

a.m. One man even brought a lawn chair in anticipation of a long wait.

The Newsom administration expected Gordon to implement

widespread improvements in this big, complicated, and troubled

department — and to do it fast. That was a tall order, as the DMV has

## some 10,000 employees, 180 ﬁeld oﬃces, and an annual budget of $1.3

billion, all in a state with 27 million licensed drivers and 36 million

registered vehicles. The pressure on Gordon’s team was ampliﬁed by a

one-time $242 million budget bump to speed the DMV’s turnaround.

They rose to the challenge.

Two of us (Huggy and Robert) are academics who have devoted the last

eight years to “The Friction Project” to uncover how leaders can make

## the right things easier and the wrong things harder in organizations. We

were intrigued by the rapid repairs Gordon’s team made at the DMV. So

we joined up with Stanford case writer Michael Rothkopf, as well as

a wonderful team at Stanford Business School, to work with Gordon

and his colleagues to produce a multimedia case study, “Steve Gordon:

Reducing Traﬃc Jams at The DMV,” available to download for free.

We could write an entire book about lessons from Gordon’s team about

leading change in big organizations — especially those saddled by bad

## old habits and systems and immovable ﬁnancial, legal, and political

constraints. This article zeros in on how the team was able to improve

the DMV so much and so fast thanks in part to Gordon beginning his

tenure by doing something massively ineﬃcient: wandering around.

## The New Boss Visits All 180 DMV Field Offices

Gordon explained to us that because the DMV was in crisis and he faced

intense pressure to ﬁx it quickly, he lacked the luxury of taking 100 days

“just to learn what’s going on” as he had in past leadership roles. His

team went straight to work on updating the DMV’s ancient technologies

and improving customer experiences.

Yet he slowed way down in one crucial way. During his ﬁrst months on

the job, Gordon visited all 180 DMV ﬁeld oﬃces, putting some 50,000

miles on his car in the process. That meant, for example, visiting the

Crescent City oﬃce near the Oregon border, as well as the Chula Vista

oﬃce some 850 miles away near the Mexican border. During each 30-

minute to one-hour visit, Gordon described his plans for easing burdens on customers and employees and asked staﬀers to identify problems

# and propose solutions.

We call Gordon’s method “management by driving around” because it’s

reminiscent of “management by wandering around” (MBWA), a term

HP executive John Doyle coined in the early 1960s. As Doyle wrote

in an email to Robert in 2019, he invented it after HP cofounders Bill

Hewlett and David Packard visited his manufacturing facility in the

United Kingdom in 1961. The duo “wandered around chatting with

people, asking what they were doing, etc.” According to Doyle, these

conversations motivated workers because Bill and Dave showed interest

in them and came across as “normal folk.”

MBWA was embedded in the HP culture a couple years later when,

at a senior leadership meeting, Doyle complained that “the rather

quantitative MBAs [they] were hiring” were missing subtle and diﬃcult-

to-measure lessons and creating a soulless workplace. He described Bill

and Dave’s method, arguing, “We need less of the MBA perspective and

more MBWA, management by wandering around, action.” Doyle’s pleas

“really enlivened the meeting and caught on in a big way.”

# Virtues of Management by Driving Around

By 2024, Gordon’s team had sped up service at the DMV, built a more

innovative and customer-focused culture, and cranked up customer

satisfaction. Twice as many DMV services were available online in 2024

than in 2019. Lines at oﬃces were shorter and moved faster, especially

for millions of customers who made required in-person visits to obtain

a Real I.D., a form of identiﬁcation that will soon be mandated for

air travel for all U.S. residents. A host of technology and workﬂow

## improvements, along with hard-working and well-trained frontline

employees, cut the average time DMV customers spend at the clerk

window to obtain a Real I.D. from 28 to eight minutes. And surveys of all

180 DMV ﬁeld oﬃces found that customer satisfaction with in-person

visits rose from 2.5 on a 5-point scale in 2018 to 4.25 in 2023.

Gordon’s in-person visits to those 180 DMV oﬃces helped his team

make changes that spread and stuck — and serve customers faster.

Here’s how.

It bought them time to make the right changes. Gordon acted quickly to set high standards for the department’s staﬀ of

10,000 and to start building a culture where when “we recognize what

needs to be done, we do it, and we do it now.”

Yet there were many solutions to the DMV’s crisis that Gordon’s team

knew would take time to ﬁgure out. The team realized that, for such

unknowns, they were in what Nobel Prize winner Daniel Kahneman

called a “cognitive mineﬁeld.” That’s when people are confused or

overwhelmed, when things are falling apart, and although they want

to make things better, they don’t have a suﬃcient grasp of causes and

remedies. In such cases, it’s wise to pause and assess the situation rather

than do something rash and wrong.

All that driving around bought Gordon and his team precious time

to think about, uncover, and develop better solutions. For example,

Gordon and chief digital transformation oﬃcer Ajay Gupta found the

28 minutes the average customer spent at the window to get a Real

I.D. to be unacceptable, but they needed time to ﬁgure out causes and

remedies. Gordon’s oﬃce visits helped him identify unnecessary steps staﬀers at DMV headquarters had added — for example, a requirement

that multiple team members review each application when a review by

a single member was suﬃcient. Gordon, Gupta, and their team also

slowed down to dissect how every step in the Real I.D. registration

process unfolded and could be improved. According to Gordon, they

were able to streamline the process so much because “[they] challenged

every one of those steps,” asking questions like, “Does it come from a

statute? A regulation? A policy? Is it a good idea? Is it a bad idea?”

It built trust with frontline employees.

In his early days at the DMV, Gordon discovered that “the prevailing

culture at the time did not encourage employees to question the status

quo or the wisdom of systems and processes that were negatively

impacting the consumer experience.” Much as John Doyle learned from

Bill Hewlett and David Packard some 60 years ago, Gordon believed that

visiting all those ﬁeld oﬃces would help create trust among frontline

employees — to feel a personal connection with their new boss, and be

seen, heard, and understood, and to feel safer to speak up.

Gordon also found that some DMV leaders at Sacramento headquarters

had never visited ﬁeld oﬃces themselves. So, he began “kicking people

out of the nest.” Gordon was conﬁdent that building face-to-face

relationships with frontline employees would make them more likely

to buy into system-wide changes, rather than dragging their feet and

resisting new practices.

It got them unﬁltered ideas.

The Friction Project taught us that senior leaders who identify the

causes of and remedies for broken bureaucracies are often skeptical of

information ﬁltered through the management levels between them and

where the work is actually done. So, they bypass the hierarchy and learn

## directly from the people on the front lines.

For example, when Gordon visited ﬁeld oﬃces, employees told him about ﬂawed systems, and sometimes oﬀered ideas for repairs that

he would never have uncovered if ﬁltered by the DMV hierarchy.

During one visit, Gordon pressed two frontline employees, Andrea

and Samantha, to tell him about the most frustrating or confusing

issue for DMV customers. They immediately identiﬁed the confusing

## organ donation questions on the driver’s license application. The opt-

in/opt-out questions were so badly worded that it sounded as if “the

DMV would try to remove an organ right there on the spot.” Those

two employees then sketched out proposed changes in wording and

formatting on sticky notes. Gordon took the notes back to the engineers

at the DMV’s Sacramento headquarters, who implemented the changes.

It cranked up the emotions that propel change.

As Chip and Dan Heath document in Made to Stick, making rational

and evidence-based arguments — especially through dull emails and

memos packed with new expectations, procedures, and rules — is

a lousy way to motivate people to change their behavior. Change is

more likely to start, spread, and stick when messages are wrapped in

compelling language and stories that trigger action-inspiring emotions

including enthusiasm, empathy, anger, and pride.

Fortunately for the DMV, Steve Gordon was adept at telling stories

that stirred emotions among employees that inspired them to help

## implement — rather than undermine — widespread improvements in

customer service. Those visits Gordon made to all 180 ﬁeld oﬃces,

as well as how he talked about the little setbacks and triumphs, were

reminiscent of writer Joseph Campbell’s “hero’s journey”: The key

character, who appeals to the audience and has a desirable goal, sets

## out on a diﬃcult journey, encounters obstacles and setbacks, recruits

allies, and assembles resources as it unfolds. And in the end, the hero

# reaches their goal.

Again and again, when we dissect what successful friction ﬁxers do,

we encounter leaders like Gordon who instill “authentic” (rather than

“hubristic”) pride in others. In particular, the pride DMV employees

felt about working together to speed service for their customers runs

through these stories about Gordon’s journey. For example, when

Gordon celebrated Andrea and Samantha, the two frontline employees

who sketched out their ideas on sticky notes, he emphasized the pride

they (and he) felt in their work. That story embodied the culture that

Gordon wanted throughout the DMV.

Gordon told the story about Andrea and Samantha in a three-minute

“Director’s Corner” video titled “Speak Up” that was shared with

all DMV employees. The video included interviews with the duo

to illustrate how, by looking around, employees who are curious

about their work, pay attention to obstacles, and notice frustrations

that customers face — and say something about it — can improve

DMV services. In the video, Gordon urged employees to talk to their

supervisors about such obstacles and frustrations or email him directly.

He explained, “To continue improving, we need the ideas from those on

the front lines to help us understand where the impediments are for our

customers. We’re using this story to try to encourage more staﬀ to give

us feedback.”

. . .

Leaders and teams that make the right things easier and the wrong

things harder in organizations treat friction ﬁxing as a way of life. As one CEO told us about his company’s eﬀorts to eliminate unnecessary

meetings, such work is like “mowing the lawn”: Constant maintenance

is required; there is no “one and done.”

That’s why, despite Steve Gordon’s pride that the DMV had improved

customer service in so many ways in just ﬁve years, he emphasized, “We

still have a lot more to do; we are certainly not celebrating in the end

zone yet.” Above all, we are impressed by Gordon’s devotion to creating

a culture at the DMV where, long after he and his team have moved

on, people will question the status quo, move swiftly to prevent and

repair the never-ending problems that arise in every organization, and

“think of [themselves] as a competitive customer product and behave as

if dissatisﬁed customers could take their business elsewhere.”
