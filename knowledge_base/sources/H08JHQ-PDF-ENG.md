One of the toughest responsibilities people leaders must take on

is confronting their direct reports about performance issues. I still

remember how nervous I was giving corrective feedback to a team

member as a ﬁrst-time manager. I didn’t sleep much the night before

and leaned heavily on the notes our HR department helped me prepare.

During my career as a CEO and people leader, I watched many new

managers struggle with these conversations. We humans have an innate

desire to be liked and to belong. Confrontation of any kind can threaten

that, and leaders who are new to performance conversations often feel

this the most. They fear that sharing critical feedback might damage

# their reporting relationships.

If you can relate to this experience, don’t worry. While performance

conversations are rarely easy, through time and repetition, your

communication skills and comfort giving critical feedback will improve.

There are, however, some common mistakes people make when they’re

just starting out. To help you avoid them and gain more conﬁdence

in your approach, let’s talk about what not to do during performance

conversations — and what to do instead.

## Mistake 1: Waiting Too Long to Have the Conversation

Avoiding a diﬃcult performance conversation is not good for anyone.

For your team member, it can be deeply damaging, especially if it means

they lose the opportunity to make amends.

Performance problems typically don’t get better with time — they need

to be addressed thoughtfully to work toward a resolution. The best

approach, in my experience, is to give critical feedback at the time or

as close as possible to when an issue occurs. Don’t wait for a series of

small problems to snowball before giving someone corrective feedback,

even if it means addressing outside of a formal review.

You can set your team member up for success by giving them a heads-

up about the discussion; for example: “I noticed you missed your last

deadline on the project. I’d like to meet later this week to talk about

what happened and how we can avoid it in the future.” This way, they

won’t be surprised by the topic of discussion, and you can both prepare

# beforehand.

# Mistake 2: Not Preparing Enough

Many new managers fail to properly prepare before their performance

discussions. But preparation is critical for a productive conversation.

This is even more true if you plan to share critical feedback.

You should enter the conversation with an understanding of your

## employee’s responsibilities, as well as your own expectations around

how and when they should be meeting their goals. You should be able

to name both their strengths and development areas. If there are tasks,

projects, or skills at which your employee is falling short, you should

also be able to give them a clear explanation of why or where they

haven’t met your expectations.

This is why preparation is so important. Before the meeting, ask

# yourself:

- What am I expecting this employee to achieve in their role this

# quarter?

- Are my expectations reasonable, and have they been communicated?

- Am I able to explain how their work contributes to the larger team

# goals?

- If I believe they are falling short, what evidence do I have to support

# that?

- Can I give them examples of what’s not working?

- What guidance will help them get back on track?

Giving your team member practical examples of where expectations are

not being met and how that’s impacting the team or organizational

goals will help them understand why you’re bringing up the issue.

Focusing your explanation on the work — and not the individual traits

of the person — is more likely to get you a respectful (as opposed to

a defensive) response. Instead of saying, “You didn’t give your best on

Project X. I am quite disappointed in you,” you could say, “I feel that you

could have done much better on the trend analysis for Project X. Had

we reviewed the data more deeply, we would have noticed the gap in our oﬀering and our team would have won the bid. I know you can do better,

so I am disappointed in how that report came out.”

## Mistake 3: Not Asking the Right Questions

Your performance conversation should be a two-way street, particularly

when it comes to critical feedback. To provide your employee with

useful guidance, you need to uncover what’s driving their poor

performance. Asking the right questions will help you do that.

Instead of starting the conversation by making conclusive statements

like, “You’re not fully focused on your work these days,” ask open-

ended questions such as, “How are you feeling about the job?” or

“How are things going in your role?” Questions like these can help you

understand the other person’s perspective, including any concerns or

challenges they may be struggling with. Knowing where they’re coming

from will allow you to give advice that addresses the actual problem —

rather than what you think the problem is.

When your employee speaks, suspend judgement and listen actively.

There are many possible reasons for poor performance, and each demands a diﬀerent course of action. In my experience, some common

causes include:

- Personal issues such as poor health or family problems

- A lack of skills or experience needed to do the job

- A lack of clear direction around your expectations

- A poor attitude or lack of motivation

Finally, remember that open questions can help you build trust with

your direct report. If your relationship is on the newer side, however,

be patient. It may take several discussions to get on the same page and

come up with next steps.

## Mistake 4: Making the Issue About the Person

When you go into a performance conversation, are you there as an

enemy or an ally? A manager who enters the discussion with an

adversarial tone — for example, by saying, “You’re not meeting my expectations,” or “You’ve messed this up and now the project will suﬀer”

— is pitting themselves against the employee.

Instead, focus on the work itself — not the person. Position yourself

## as a facilitator between the company’s needs and your employee’s

needs, capability, and performance. You can do this by taking a

third-party approach. For instance, you can make an objective and

honest observation by saying something like, “The team needs to make

progress on this project, and your skills are important for us to get

there. But I’ve also noticed you’re facing some challenges in hitting your

target goals by the deadline we’ve discussed.” Then, follow up with your

open-ended question: “Can you tell me what’s been going on from your

# perspective?”

Taking on the role as facilitator signiﬁcantly reduces the emotional

pressure you may feel during diﬃcult conversations. It also reduces

the chance that your employee will feel personally attacked by your

feedback. If you show genuine care in the other person’s development,

they will usually sense it and understand you’re trying to help them

# improve.

## Mistake 5: Not Creating a Roadmap for Improvement

Critical feedback doesn’t end with you simply giving directions. After identifying the factors aﬀecting an employee’s performance, work with

them on a plan to address the issues raised. Skipping this step leaves

## your employee without a roadmap for improvement and nothing to

# measure their progress by.

Begin by documenting the areas of concern and the actions to be taken

to improve their performance. This should be done in consultation with

the employee so that they understand what’s expected of them, and

it may take a few meetings to put into place. Include milestones and

check-in dates where you can meet to give them feedback on their

progress and learn how it’s going from their perspective.

If they’re hitting roadblocks, you can use these check-ins to address

those and tweak the plan as needed. Set an agreed-upon and reasonable

date to draw the process to an end, which will vary depending on the

progress being made.

. . .

Lastly, remember that how you say something and the words you use to express your feedback and intentions makes all the diﬀerence. You

can provide the most diﬃcult or harsh feedback in a humane and caring

way if you think of it as helping develop your employee. That said, there

will be people who won’t accept that they have performance issues and

will not be happy with you for confronting them. That’s okay.

Unfortunately, being a great people manager is not about being a friend

or being liked by everyone all the time. People want a boss who cares

about them and helps them get their job done. A great people manager

can communicate their organization’s strategic intent and how their

team members’ work is contributing to it.
