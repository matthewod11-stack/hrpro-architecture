When Your Go-To Problem-Solving Approach Fails Eight steps to help you assess what’s not working — and why. by Cheryl Strauss Einhorn

Have you ever noticed that when you go home to your parents’ house,

no matter what age you are, you make decisions diﬀerently than when

you’re at work or out with a group of friends? For many of us, this is a

familiar and sometimes frustrating experience — for example, allowing

our parent to serve us more food than we want to eat. We feel like adults

in our day-to-day lives, but when we step into our childhood homes we

# revert.

That’s not the only situation in which we change our decision-making

habits. We may be a diﬀerent decision-maker with the coworker who

intimidates us, the veteran employee who serves as a mentor, or the

recent college grad who has asked for your mentorship.

In other words, we approach decisions diﬀerently depending on the

context — where we are and which role we’re playing — and the other

decision-makers with whom we’re engaging.

Through my research into decision-making, I have identiﬁed ﬁve

## diﬀerent decision-making archetypes, or problem solver proﬁles, that

explain how people tend to approach their decisions. The ﬁve problem

solver proﬁles (PSP) are:

- Adventurers, who make decisions easily and go with their gut, but

who may downplay evidence, and input from others, if it contradicts

# their gut reaction

- Detectives, who like to follow the data, but who may overvalue facts

# and undervalue people

- Listeners, who want to solicit the input of others, but who sometimes

can’t hear their own voice

- Thinkers, who thrive on identifying multiple paths and outcomes, but

who can struggle to make a decision in a timely manner

- Visionaries, who pride themselves on seeing pathways that others

don’t, but who avoid the ordinary even when it’s eﬀective

Most of us rely on one dominant PSP. Each type of problem solver has

some real strengths, but also some blind spots — cognitive biases — that

# impede clear problem solving.

However, what I call “situationality” can also override your dominant

PSP. Situationality is more than context. I deﬁne situationality as a

formula for the situation we ﬁnd ourselves in: how and where we are

working, where we are in our life, who we are deciding with, and how

much ownership we have over the decision at hand. So, situationality is

a blend of external and internal factors. But it’s important to recognize

that each situation is diﬀerent; we are not static, and neither is the world

# around us.

Making decisions based on situationality is not always a bad thing.

Letting your parent decide how much chicken to serve you lets them

show their love for you – even if you know you’d like a smaller portion.

Similarly, if you’re an adventurer just starting out at a new job, you may

need tune into your listener in order to learn the ropes. Once you’re

more comfortable, you can let your natural adventurer come out.

Sometimes, however, situationality can present a problem. It can

change our decision-making approach in a way that causes friction. As

it did with Miriam.

Miriam is the chief executive and founder of an agriculture technology

start-up. Using my PSP quiz, she identiﬁed herself as a listener, someone

who likes to gather the wisdom of others, tends to have a trusted group

of advisors to discuss their decisions with, and avoids conﬂict.

“I enjoy listening to the perspectives of others on any topic because

I understand that we all think diﬀerently,” Miriam observed. “I like

thinking about how one decision can impact people very diﬀerently.”

Like other listeners, Miriam makes new friends easily and connects with

strangers virtually everywhere she goes.

However, shortly after we began working together, Miriam confessed that she had had repeated communication diﬃculties with her

cofounder, and that their relationship had turned rancorous. Recently,

he had begun ghosting her. Typically, this kind of acrimony would

be very diﬃcult for a listener who values relationships and excels at

building them. I pointed out the apparent contradiction to Miriam, who

was as puzzled as I was.

She felt stuck. She knew she needed to sever this problematic

relationship, but she didn’t understand what had gone wrong. She

had another employee, Andre, and she was concerned that history

might repeat itself, without her understanding why. Would he ghost

her too? She didn’t know him very well, but thought they had a good

relationship. How could she move forward and “break-up” with her

cofounder in a way that didn’t make Andre collateral damage?

To help Miriam become unstuck, I asked her to think about how her

CEO situationality might be undercutting her dominant PSP, or her

# listener tendencies.

Thinking about situationality means looking at yourself as though you

are a character in a story. I’ve created a rubric with eight questions

to help you 1) frame the problematic work situation that requires a

decision, 2) tease out some of the key situational factors that are

inﬂuencing your decision-making, and 3) take a speciﬁc action to

improve your decision-making with others. Use these questions to

better understand how you may be making work-related decisions

diﬀerently depending upon the situation you’re in.

- 1. Define the problem.

What negative experience are you having in the workplace that requires

a decision? Often, we communicate and make decisions in a way that

feels comfortable to us but doesn’t get the result we expect.

Miriam, in her early 30s, was in conﬂict with her cofounder. She

couldn’t understand what went wrong but didn’t want his removal from

the company to negatively impact her relationship with her remaining

employee, Andre. She told me, “I’m the CEO but my cofounder won’t

answer my calls. I haven’t heard from him in weeks. I thought he was

doing his job, as I was doing mine but now I don’t know. I can’t aﬀord

to have this situation fester any longer. It’s impacting the company and

# Andre.”

- 2. Assess location and team dynamics.

Where are you working? Are you in an oﬃce or working remotely? Part

of a team or working independently? If you’re part of a team, does your

team have regular meetings or are you mostly on your own?

Where you work and your role can aﬀect your comfort, communication,

and conﬁdence as a decision-maker. Miriam had begun her career

working in a lab, where she was largely on her own, running

experiments. Since starting her business, she’d been working remotely

## from the basement of her father’s house due to the pandemic. She

was comfortable working alone, although she observed that it was

“sometimes hard to feel like a CEO.” Since she had never really

worked as part of a team, she assumed that an independent working

style worked for others as well as it worked for her. She hadn’t

organized regular company meetings, expecting others to do their work

# independently.

- 3. Consider your career stage.

Are you starting your career, at your peak, or counting the days until

retirement? We expect a new employee to listen and learn and an

experienced one to lead the team, but that’s not always the case.

Sometimes if you’re new at the job, you may feel pressure to prove

yourself. And a senior employee may feel comfortable stepping back

and letting more junior staﬀ take charge. Thinking about your career

stage can help you understand your decision-making behavior.

As a lab scientist without any direct experience working with a CEO,

Miriam unwittingly adopted a CEO persona. “I am a scientist by

training,” she told me. “So, founding a company was a big leap for me.

As the CEO of a start-up, I knew I owned the decisions. I felt I needed to

move quickly and decisively because that’s what CEOs do.”

- 4. Adopt other people’s perspectives.

Who are the other stakeholders in the decision-making process and

what is their relationship to you? Are you trying to make your boss look

good or does the outcome of this decision primarily impact your own

# work?

Miriam saw herself as the co-head of a three-person team, all working

toward the same goal. Her cofounder’s ghosting challenged that idea. As

we discussed this question, Miriam realized that while she assumed that

Andre wanted the company to succeed, she didn’t actually know him.

Yes, they had been working together for a year, and she knew his work

and his voice but they’d never met in person. It was his ﬁrst start-up

experience as well and now, as the only employee and key stakeholder,

she recognized that how he reacted to the news and to his increased

workload would aﬀect the company going forward. Although she was

the boss, Miriam saw that she needed Andre’s buy-in; she couldn’t

succeed alone.

- 5. Scrutinize decision ownership.

Is it your decision to make? How much will you (or your organization) be

impacted by the decision outcome? And how important is the decision

# to you (or your organization)?

Note: Impact and importance are not the same. Impact is the eﬀect

on someone or something; importance is the signiﬁcance or value. A

decision can have a signiﬁcant impact but be of little importance, or

vice versa. For example, if the head of sales decides to skip a sales team

meeting, this decision may have a big impact on team members but

may not actually be important if the meeting doesn’t require the head of

sales to attend.

Miriam’s decision would have both impact and importance because the

company was a small start-up. She told me that while “I fully own the

decision to dissolve the partnership, the success of the company will

depend on me communicating eﬀectively with Andre about my reasons

for this major decision. I realize that owning the decision doesn’t mean

it only aﬀects me. I have to let Andre know how much his contributions

matter to the business, and to me. This relationship is important to my

business success.”

- 6. Connect your situationality to your problem-solving profile.

Looking back at the ﬁve PSPs, how does your situationality connect to

one of the blind spots in the proﬁles? For example, the blind spot of

a listener is that they sometimes can’t hear their own voice because

they’re focused on soliciting input from others. Try to stay focused on

your behavior in the one situation that you’ve identiﬁed as problematic.

Although Miriam had identiﬁed herself as a listener, she realized that

she’d made no time or space to listen to the co-workers in her start-up. She saw that she was making all the decisions. Looking back at the PSPs,

Miriam realized that, in this work situation, she had been behaving like

# an adventurer.

- 7. Examine assumptions that haven’t served you well in decision- making.

Miriam realized that she was making two assumptions, both that ﬁt the

# adventurer proﬁle.

The ﬁrst assumption was that her coworkers liked working

independently, because that’s what was comfortable for her. “In a

professional setting – particularly one where I’m in charge – I’m used to

working on my own and making my own decisions rather than reaching

out to others for their input,” she explained.

The second assumption was that, as a CEO, she thought she was

supposed to make all the decisions. “I assumed that no news was good

news, and that assumption turned out to be wrong.”

- 8. Recognize how your problem-solver profile can help you make more effective decisions.

While all PSP strengths provide solutions, returning to your dominant

PSP can enable you to use strengths that you’ve already built as a

decision-maker and initiate pathways where you’ve experienced success

# in the past.

Miriam realized that, in her situation as a CEO, she needed to bring

forward her listener behavior. Better communication with her one

employee wasn’t just “nice,” it was necessary. She knew she could be a

good listener — that’s her dominant proﬁle and that’s who she was with

her friends. “I have the skills I need to improve my work relationship

with Andre: curiosity, active listening, and trust building. I want to

hear Andre’s ideas about the company. I’ll suggest we have a regular

meeting where I can oﬀer a company update to provide greater clarity

and communication, and where I can listen to his ideas.”

Although Miriam was a listener in her personal life, in her professional

life she thought listening wasn’t necessary — deciding was. In a lab,

working on her own, her adventurer habits led to professional success

and made what could have been a lonely job deeply satisfying. But those

adventurer habits, while comfortable in a lab, were counterproductive

in the collaborative world of a start-up. Further, with no real experience

in behaving like a CEO, Miriam had fallen back on the decision-making

style that worked in her previous professional experience: situationality

had taken over.

By taking the time to look at a problematic work situation, Miriam

was able to see something that was right in front of her but that her

cognitive biases had blinded her to: She wasn’t listening to anyone.

Miriam needed to bring her strong listener skills into her work world.

. . .

We like to think we are mindful of the world around us and that we

will make the best decision in any situation, but situationality teaches

us otherwise. Eﬀective decision-making requires us to pause and ask

the right questions about a situation. Taking the time to ponder these

questions can show us the habits, cognitive biases, and patterns of

decision-making that are getting in our way. Once these are revealed

to us, we can work to remove them and make better decisions together.

Miriam and Andre now have a regular weekly meeting to discuss work

and a monthly meeting focused on building their relationship. Whether

it’s talking about a breakthrough in the science world or a book they’ve

both read, taking the time to connect as people has been a win for both

# of them — and for the company.
