Over the past 25 years executives have become fervent advocates

of learning, calling it an imperative, career insurance, and the only

source of competitive advantage. That enthusiasm is warranted: Today

the development of new skills, knowledge, and mindsets is critical to

most businesses’ key strategic eﬀorts—from navigating global crises

and unprecedented industry change, addressing the rise of generative

AI, and driving innovation, to attracting and retaining talent, building

inclusive workplaces, and making a positive diﬀerence in society.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Three Ways to Lead Learning

Indeed, more and more business leaders are moved to make a bold

promise: that their company is not just a machine to deliver proﬁt

but also a community devoted to social impact and its members’ well-

being. Learning is key to fulﬁlling that promise, especially in an age

when talent ﬂocks to organizations that oﬀer to upskill employees and

support their development. A commitment to learning is critical to making organizations both more eﬃcient and more humane.

The growing importance of learning has heralded the arrival of a new

breed of senior leaders—people I call leaders of learning. They may be chief learning oﬃcers, heads of learning and development, heads

of talent and organizational development, and in some companies, chief human resources or chief people oﬃcers. They advocate for and

organize learning, developing learning strategies and implementing

learning initiatives for the enterprise and its employees.

But many of their eﬀorts are going awry. Academic studies reveal mixed

evidence on whether such initiatives produce lasting individual or

organizational change. Despite their public commitment to learning,

in private many executives I meet express skepticism about the quality

and eﬀectiveness of it in their workplace. “How do I know this has any

impact on my company’s transformation?” I often hear. And there’s

skepticism from employees as well: “My boss doesn’t actually care about

my learning, just about results” is a common complaint.

Throughout my career I’ve taught, coached, and collaborated closely

with leaders of learning. I’ve watched their excitement turn to

frustration as their eﬀorts were met with ambivalence and resistance

or failed to deliver after raising much hope. To ﬁnd out why so many

are stymied—and what can be done about it—I teamed up with Annie

## Peshkam, a learning researcher and coach, to interview leaders of

learning at 69 multinational ﬁrms across industries and continents.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Three Ways to Lead Learning

One of our key ﬁndings is that companies begin to stiﬂe learning when

executives assume that there’s a single right way to do it that will

serve all the organization’s needs. That’s simply not the case. We found

that there are three distinct ways to lead learning—as a custodian, a

challenger, or a connector—all of which can be successful in the right

context. The methods used by leaders with the three approaches don’t

vary much; they all involve a combination of formal workshops, on-the-

## job learning, cases, speakers, 360-degree feedback, and so on. But how

and why leaders deploy them diﬀers dramatically. And we found that

too often the intent of learning was unclear in organizations, resulting

## in a mismatch between the learning approach and current company

needs. That caused friction and frustration and derailed eﬀorts to

improve learning.

Understanding the three approaches and the diﬀering goals they serve

can help executives select, develop, partner with, and be better leaders

of learning for their companies.

# Custodians

Custodians see learning as instrumental to executing an organization’s

strategy and strengthening its culture. In their view learning is a tool

to help employees perform their roles better (and get better roles).

While learning helps employees succeed and advance, the ultimate

beneﬁciary is the organization, and any learning that doesn’t provide

a concrete advantage to the company is probably useless.

Custodians embrace this view because they see themselves primarily as

stewards of the business. For them, alignment with senior leadership is

a top priority; they create value by bringing others on board with the

top team’s agenda. Indeed, many custodians we spoke to were business

leaders in other areas before they came to learning, and most noted how

much they had in common with their C-suite peers.

Instrumental learning gets people to converge toward a norm, be

it a cultural framework or a competency framework. Employees are

assessed against a clear model and then get assignments meant to ﬁll

any gaps identiﬁed and build cultural cohesion. (A major concern of a

custodian is thus picking the right people for the right learning at the

# right time.)

For his series House of Books, Franck Bohbot set out to capture the essence and character of libraries around the world.

Custodians prefer centrally developed boot-camp-type learning that

facilitates the deliberate acquisition and practice of new skills. Courses

replicate the actual workplace, oﬀer employees timely feedback on their

practice attempts, and allow them to try again. The goal is for people to eﬃciently gain facility with new or diﬃcult skills. Learning experiences

are explicitly connected to the company’s strategy and culture, since

custodians disdain initiatives that are “too academic,” or too distant

from immediate application in the company. In the right contexts

programs designed like this help participants strengthen their skills and

rise up the ranks and help the company grow.

A classic example of the custodian approach is Apple University. Aware

that the company was growing fast and that he would soon let go of its

reins, Steve Jobs hired Joel Podolny, then the dean of the Yale School of

Management, to develop a bespoke curriculum to socialize employees

in Apple’s unique ways of making decisions, communicating, and

building products—and teach them the fundamental principles of

simplicity, usefulness, and intuitiveness that Jobs held dear.

The custodians we spoke with were most successful and most satisﬁed

in companies where there was a pressing need for alignment—for

example, following the launch of a new strategy or after a period of

fast growth that had strained coordination across the ﬁrm. In such

circumstances custodians can bring much-needed standardization and

strengthen the common culture through their approach to learning. But

we have seen custodians suddenly be ﬁred, too—for example, when a

new CEO determines that the company’s learning approach is too rigid,

stiﬂing innovation or overlooking talent whose views might beneﬁt the

# organization.

# Challengers

When CEOs want a learning leader who is less concerned with

upholding standards and more focused on developing innovative

capabilities, they often turn to a challenger. In contrast to custodians,

challengers embrace a humanistic belief that employees have an

intrinsic right to grow and forge their own paths and that the

organization must honor that right. While the organization beneﬁts

from learning because it helps employees raise the quality of their

work, challengers believe that the ultimate beneﬁciary must be the

individuals themselves, or learning will become oppressive.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Three Ways to Lead Learning

Challengers often consider learning to be a moral duty of the

organization rather than a ﬁnancial one. “I believe that education is the

way to help people grow personally and live a better life,” one told us.

Challengers tend to claim they have an “outsider” perspective

that diﬀers from the organization’s mainstream thinking. They see

themselves as valuable specialists who bring unique expertise to the C-

suite—often with learning-focused résumés. These leaders love telling

stories of their peers’ skepticism; friction with other senior leaders seems only to aﬃrm their view that most executives are champions

of the status quo who need redeeming rather than pleasing. That

reﬂects challengers’ perception that learning is valuable in helping

people defy norms and break habits that hold the company back. While

instrumental learning fosters convergence and alignment, humanistic

learning encourages divergence from a norm.

There are strong beneﬁts to the challenger approach. The ﬁrst is

engagement: A number of challengers we spoke to reported proudly that

employees they worked with had turned down higher-paid jobs oﬀered

by other companies, because they were afraid they would be made

to conform and would lose the freedom they enjoyed. The second is

innovation: Liberated, energized people are more likely to come up with

new ways to do things. They can adapt global policies to local cultures.

They do not wait for instructions to seize an opportunity or respond to

a market turn. Most important, they are the restless, tinkering, internal

champions of change that Clay Christensen believed were necessary in

established companies, lest disruptive innovation from nimbler ﬁrms

ﬁnd them unprepared. It’s perhaps ironic that while challengers report

caring less about retention than custodians do, by making employees

feel their skills are more portable, they improve it.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Three Ways to Lead Learning

Companies begin to stifle learning when executives assume that there’s a single right way to do it that will serve all the organization’s needs.

## If conformity stiﬂes companies and silences employees, as challengers

see it, then the boot camp typical of organizational learning often

makes it worse. Humanistic learning, in contrast, is best pursued

in a “playground,” where it’s self-guided and more personalized.

Employees choose what to learn and when on the basis of their

interests, strengths, and personal goals; there is less emphasis on

models, assessments, ﬁlling skill gaps, and the best practices of experts.

When challengers program speakers, often they’re luminaries outside

the company’s industry (artists, philosophers, other inspiring thinkers).

When challengers oﬀer classes, they favor workshops that help people

## reﬂect on the company’s culture and their own habits, work, and

interpersonal styles. Challengers frequently support talented employees who wish to pursue courses and programs outside the company’s oﬃcial

oﬀerings—be they cooking classes or spiritual retreats. Accountability

comes from frank conversations about what those employees will do

diﬀerently at work as a result of what they’ve learned.

If military training is the obvious application of a boot camp, training

for an architect or an artist would be an appropriate one for a

playground. More and more companies are realizing that playgrounds

are valuable for leadership development, too. A playground inherently

allows people to acquire a larger variety of skills and viewpoints than

they would at a boot camp—and develop the kind of agility and

autonomy that’s required to lead. In the right contexts, playgrounds

## foster new ideas, the questioning of norms, and changes in perspectives

and relationships, allowing for not only innovative leaps in thinking but

also holistic personal growth. Boot camps are best for acquiring new

skills; playgrounds for developing new selves.

Laszlo Bock’s Work Rules!, which is based on his experience as the head

of people operations at Google, can be read as a challenger manifesto.

## The title of a central chapter, “Let the Inmates Run the Asylum,”

captures challengers’ view of organizations and their intent in them.

The learning initiatives Bock describes throughout the book are all

based on one principle: The more freedom leaders provide and the more

attention they put on the growth and aspirations of each individual, the

more attractive a company becomes to talent and the more likely that

talent is to have new ideas and turn them into breakthrough products.

Bock’s approach worked wonders for Google at a time when the

company was set on building an innovation engine and competed

ﬁercely for talent. But those are not the only circumstances in which it

works. Challengers are most successful and satisﬁed in companies that

are hungry for change. Those could be ﬁrms in which strong traditions

or a stretch of success has made people cautious or complacent. In

such circumstances challengers have the most impact and experience

the fewest clashes with their executive teams. The most successful

challengers are often protégés of CEOs or CHROs who want “something

## diﬀerent” and value professional expertise.

It’s worth noting that while many CEOs are uneasy being champions

of this approach themselves, they do want it to be represented on their

teams, so they hire challengers but don’t give them enough support.

That kind of ideological tokenism is a recipe for failure. And like

custodians, challengers can fall out of favor when their work is no longer

seen as constructively questioning the status quo but, rather, as a costly

# subversion.

# Connectors

Learning leaders in the third group, connectors, strive to integrate

## the business-minded approach of custodians with the person-focused

approach of challengers. Working through the two conﬂicting sets

of principles, connectors tend to cast themselves as bridges between

established leaders at the company’s core and emerging leaders at

its periphery. Their aim is to turn the company into a community

that is both eﬀective and made up of individuals who act and grow

authentically. Perhaps unsurprisingly, connectors are also some of the

most seasoned leaders, who have experience with both instrumental

# and humanistic approaches.

While our research wasn’t based on a random sample, connectors

do seem to be rarer than custodians or challengers. Connectors say

their integrated approach requires striking a tricky balance but believe

that focusing solely on results is dated and can stiﬂe creativity, and that focusing solely on empowerment is ineﬃcient and can strain

# coordination.

Like custodians, connectors favor initiatives that are anchored in a

strategic imperative for the company. However, they pay particular

attention to those that require the collaboration of diﬀerent groups,

because they prioritize building employees’ mutual connections rather

## than their connection to the organization.

Like challengers, connectors usually incorporate personalized learning

opportunities into their courses and workshops. They encourage

employees to see tackling a corporate challenge as a vehicle for their

own personal and professional growth. Yet connectors place a unique

emphasis on using learning experiences to bring people together,

speciﬁcally to allow them to learn about and from one another—

and they see such exchanges as potentially more valuable than the

educational content itself. I call this a “town hall” approach. Connectors

## value high-quality facilitation of conversations among executives—for

example, about solving a thorny innovation problem—for two reasons.

First, they believe that’s how the organization can best ﬁgure out

how to overcome hurdles. Second, even if an idea that springs from

such discussions doesn’t get implemented, the relationships built while

working on it might endure and serve people and the company well in

# the future.

## When the CEO of the global energy specialist Schneider Electric set

## the company on a path toward digital transformation, its head of

talent, inclusion, and culture, Tina Mylon, championed a seven-year

learning initiative called Transforming Schneider Leadership, or TSL

(which I played a part in designing and delivering). It was built on

the core principle that transformation should be the business not of

individual leaders but of a leadership community. TSL provided a space

for Schneider’s executives to think and relate in new ways, through an

intensive experiential workshop that took a playground approach, while

also helping them develop the skills for implementing a digital strategy,

through a digital boot camp at which people acquired and practiced

using speciﬁc innovation tools. Since the program began, the company

has tripled in value and grown into a provider of innovative and

sustainable energy-management solutions. The organization is prized

for its diversity and has improved retention and increased internal

promotions. There’s no way of knowing how much of that success is

directly attributable to TSL, but Mylon has in that time reported seeing

the company’s extended pool of leaders grow “more diverse, skilled,

and impactful, and more connected to each other,” something that has

served the company well in its cross-unit innovation and culture eﬀorts.

# Franck Bohbot

Connectors are most successful and satisﬁed in companies where

inclusion is a top priority—companies where community building is

necessary to sustain a healthy leadership pipeline or to integrate the

values and views of diﬀerent groups. These are organizations where

the viability of the business and the vitality of the community are

understood to go hand in hand—which would be most companies,

when you think about it.

In my experience, custodians frequently are assumed to be the best

ﬁt for business, and as noted, challengers are often hired as tokens of

innovative thinking but given little support. It seems to me that both

those patterns stem from the fact that most businesses focus excessively

on alignment and as a result wrestle with innovation, inclusion,

and sustainability. With their integrative approach, connectors help

companies overcome those problems.

But connectors aren’t perfect. Their work is criticized as being ineﬃcient, and it surely takes time. They also often mentioned that it

was a struggle to hold instrumental and humanistic views of learning

## simultaneously. And in circumstances where community building isn’t

a priority, connectors can appear unfocused. When introduced to the

three types, some executives have even told me that they do not believe

connectors really exist—that they’re just custodians or challengers

## without enough discipline or enough courage to state their convictions.

Perhaps those executives are simply skeptical that a company might

truly honor both instrumental and humanistic principles, doing well

and doing good. Connectors view that skepticism as unfounded and

work to overcome it.

# Finding the Best Fit

Understanding the three ways to lead learning can help you shift the

## conversation away from the methods and costs of educational initiatives

and toward their values and aims. It can also help you grasp why

the learning leaders you work with might be struggling: Custodians

and challengers can become embattled when people disagree with

their preferred approach, and connectors often internalize the tension

# between the diﬀerent views of learning.

Awareness of the various approaches can help learning leaders make the

## case for their initiatives, to the beneﬁt of the ﬁrm.

## Which Approach Is Best for Your Organization?

There are three distinct ways to lead learning, each of which can be successful in

# the right context.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Three Ways to Lead Learning

When a learning leader I worked with, whom I’ll call Mark, took the

## role of director of corporate learning and development at a large global

ﬁrm, he was given a bold challenge: Increase internal hires to 75% of

all appointments for top roles by better preparing existing talent for

leadership. Through Mark’s connector lens, the problem was evident:

The current talent-management process was disjointed. While some

business groups and regions had knowledge about how to develop

leaders, the organization lacked a common framework that established

which skills the company’s leaders needed and how they should acquire

them, and aspiring leaders were mostly isolated in their individual

# divisions.

Mark proposed engaging all the company’s learning-and-development

professionals and leaders to create that framework together and

proposed a suite of collaborative global programs as a vehicle

for building relationships across leadership generations. The senior

management team resisted. Surely this was a competence problem; how

would connecting people spur leadership? “It was the worst meeting of

my whole career,” Mark recalls.

But a friend helped him see the meeting as a reﬂection of the

very challenge he was working to address: He needed to help senior

executives let go of their custodian strategy, in which they were

## the gatekeepers for all learning and development, and collaborate to

develop talent. Mark recast his strategy in this way, and a few months

later it received a green light. And in time it has delivered. During

Mark’s tenure, leadership development has come to span all regions

and business groups—and the percentage of senior leadership roles

ﬁlled by internal candidates has reached the company’s target. In a

recent round of top management appointments, 100% were internal

candidates, saving the company money and raising its proﬁle as a

workplace where talent is given opportunities to develop and lead.

. . .

Whether you’re hiring a new learning leader or trying to understand the

dynamics of the one your company has in place now, ask yourself: What

is your organization trying to accomplish? Does your team (or division

or organization) need to execute on a clear vision, or does it need to

forge a broader one? Is the learning required to make progress more

instrumental or more humanistic? What is needed to promote the right

combination of those approaches for your organization? Answering

those questions might help you ﬁnd the learning leadership that can

# bring that vision to life.
