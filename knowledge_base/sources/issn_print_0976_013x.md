# Developing Entrepreneurial Ecosystem:

## A Case Study of Technopark, Thiruvananthapuram

## Srirang K Jha*and Amiya Kumar Mohapatra**

# ABSTRACT

Technopark in Thiruvananthapuram is one of the largest technological parks in the world. It

was established by the Government of Kerala in 1990 as an autonomous organiza(cid:415)on to meet

the infrastructure needs of emerging electronics and Informa(cid:415)on Technology industry. The

Technopark has now expanded to accommodate more than 200 companies that employ a

large por(cid:415)on of the IT workforce in Kerala. Besides, Technopark also helps the budding

# entrepreneurs through its state-of-the-art Technopark Technology Business Incubator (T-TBI)

which provides economical plug and play facili(cid:415)es to start-ups in IT/ITeS sectors and support

them throughout the gesta(cid:415)on period. Characteris(cid:415)c features of Technopark contribute

signiﬁcantly toward developing an enabling ecosystem for the entrepreneurs within the

campus. This ar(cid:415)cle provides an insigh(cid:414)ul account of how the Technopark is changing the

entrepreneurial landscape in Kerala and crea(cid:415)ng opportuni(cid:415)es for the young to innovate,

grow and become successful in all their ventures. True, Technopark is a success story of a

# INTRODUCTION

Thiruvananthapuram is capital of Kerala –a southern province of India. The city has a unique

topography comprising res(cid:415)ng hills, ﬂourishing groves, extensive coast lines, chao(cid:415)c urban

trails, and lively metropolitan suburbs. Also, it is the most populous city of Kerala. The city is

well connected with the rest of India through railways, roads, waterways, and airways.

Tradi(cid:415)onally, people of the Thiruvananthapuram district were engaged in mineral processing,

sugar milling, tex(cid:415)les, handicra(cid:332)s, rice cul(cid:415)va(cid:415)on and coastal ﬁshing1. However, today it has

emerged as a hub of technology-driven industries thanks to an exci(cid:415)ng entrepreneurial

ecosystem triggered by Technopark. As a result, the city has become hothouse for burgeoning

start-ups leading to huge job opportuni(cid:415)es for the young and talented workforce drawn from

across the country and other parts of the world. Diversity of workforce in the city has also

enriched the socio-cultural milieu of Thiruvananthapuram for which signiﬁcant credit must be

assigned to Technopark.

Technopark was established by the Government of Kerala in 1990 as an autonomous

organiza(cid:415)on to meet the infrastructure needs of emerging electronics and Informa(cid:415)on

Technology industry even before India adopted the policy of liberaliza(cid:415)on, priva(cid:415)za(cid:415)on, and

globaliza(cid:415)on. It is registered under the Travancore-Cochin Literary, Scien(cid:415)ﬁc and Charitable

Socie(cid:415)es Registra(cid:415)on Act, 1955. By 1995, ﬁrst phase of Technopark was ready to welcome the

entrepreneurs who were interested in se(cid:427)ng up their factories or oﬃces in a contemporary

industrial campus with all the ameni(cid:415)es under the sky. Facili(cid:415)es at the Technopark manifested

its vision “to provide a holis(cid:415)c enabling environment to make knowledge industry intrinsically

compe(cid:415)(cid:415)ve and world class”. Further, the organiza(cid:415)on truly lived up to its lo(cid:332)y mission

## Design, Development, Incuba(cid:415)ng and Training establishments”.

In addi(cid:415)on to the vision and mission, the quality policy of Technopark makes the organiza(cid:415)on

dis(cid:415)nct: “Provide viably, superior environment and services with assured quality of service to

make technology businesses intrinsically compe(cid:415)(cid:415)ve and successful and promote regional

development through synergis(cid:415)c linkages between industry, government and academia,

based on con(cid:415)nuous

# improvement and

innova(cid:415)on”. No wonder, Technopark,

Thiruvananthapuram has evolved over the years as one of the ﬁnest industrial hubs especially

for the technology companies in the world. Interes(cid:415)ngly, the Technopark campus which is the

largest technological park in the country in terms of built-up area is also reputed as one of the

“greenest technopolis”2 in the world thanks to architectural designs imbued with principles of

sustainability. Some of the top companies which have their oﬃces in Technopark include Aegis

So(cid:332)ware, Allianz Cornhill, D+H, Envestnet, Ernst & Young, IBS So(cid:332)ware, Infosys, Navigant,

Oracle, QUEST, RR Donnelly, Speridian Technologies, Suntec Business Solu(cid:415)ons, Tata Elxsi, TCS,

Toonz Anima(cid:415)on, and UST Global. The Technopark has now expanded to accommodate more

than 200 companies that employ a large por(cid:415)on of the IT workforce in Kerala3.

# CHARACTERISTIC FEATURES OF TECHNOPARK

Technopark provides a holis(cid:415)c and enabling ecosystem for the entrepreneurs as well as

established corpora(cid:415)ons. Characteris(cid:415)c features of Technopark are as under4:

- Most

lively IT Campus in India: Technopark has a sprawling campus that

accommodates 63000 IT/ITeS professionals. It oﬀers a rich and varied experience with

## by SWCB within 30 days from the date of submission of applica(cid:415)on.

- Stable Infrastructure: Technopark provides 100% power back-up, uninterrupted

power supply, and ambient air-condi(cid:415)oning for all buildings. There are two 110/11 kV

6

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

power substa(cid:415)ons within the campus. Water supply is maintained by Technopark

through a dedicated distribu(cid:415)on system. Even the support

# infrastructure at

Technopark is great. There is a bustling suburb right outside the Technopark campus.

Besides, there is a magniﬁcent food court within the campus. Presence of all the

essen(cid:415)al commercial shops and establishments make the campus self-suﬃcient. There

is a sprawling guest house within the campus to meet the needs of guests.

- Green Environment: The green buildings in the Technopark campus have boosted

energy eﬃciency through much lower power consump(cid:415)on. Besides, there is Solid

## Waste Management Unit within the Technopark campus.

- Responsive Maintenance Team: The opera(cid:415)ons and maintenance carried out by

Technopark guarantees 24X7 assistance to the stakeholders.

- Safe and Protected Campus: Technopark safeguards the interests of all the

stakeholders with zero man-days lost in the companies’ opera(cid:415)ons within the campus.

- Excellent Data Connec(cid:415)vity: Leased line in Fiber connec(cid:415)vity available in all the

buildings on the campus guarantees seamless connec(cid:415)vity at lower cost.

- Start-ups and Incuba(cid:415)on support: The Technopark Technology Business Incubator (T-

TBI) provides economical plug and play facili(cid:415)es to start-ups in IT/ITeS sectors.

- Lower opera(cid:415)onal costs: Technopark ensures lower opera(cid:415)ons cost with a host of SEZ

# and Non-SEZ rental op(cid:415)ons.

- Futuris(cid:415)c: The hi-tech infrastructure of Technopark is quite futuris(cid:415)c. The brilliantly

designed, fully air-condi(cid:415)oned conference halls, seminar and mee(cid:415)ng halls are well

equipped to meet all the business needs of the stakeholders.

# THE ROAD AHEAD

Technopark has not only served its stakeholders in a meaningful way over the years but has

also contributed towards job crea(cid:415)on, capital accumula(cid:415)on and wealth maximiza(cid:415)on.

However, the organiza(cid:415)on has a track record of always looking ahead in terms of enriching

the experience of all the stakeholders within and outside the Technopark campus while

con(cid:415)nuously adding value. Sanjeev Nair, Chief Execu(cid:415)ve Oﬃcer, Technopark is taking keen

interest in improvising campus ameni(cid:415)es and crea(cid:415)ng new opportuni(cid:415)es. An area where

Technopark needs to focus is development of non-SEZ commercial and residen(cid:415)al buildings5.

7

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

The organiza(cid:415)on has already taken a few ini(cid:415)a(cid:415)ves like organizing events to promote a culture

of innova(cid:415)on on the campus. Technopark can further leverage its loca(cid:415)on and facili(cid:415)es to

become a hub of tourism. It goes without saying that Technopark has emerged as a classic

model for all the technological parks in India and other parts of the world. Yet, there is no end

to excellence. Interes(cid:415)ngly, leadership team of Technopark is already making futuris(cid:415)c strides

towards further expanding the vibrant entrepreneurial ecosystem within the campus.

# Custard Apple Value Chain in Beed

## District of Maharashtra, India: A Case Study

# Amit Kumar Singh* and Himanshu Kumar**

# ABSTRACT

Agriculture, with its allied sectors, is the largest source of livelihoods in India where 70% of its

rural households still depend primarily on agriculture for their livelihood, with 82 percent of

farmers being small and marginal (FAO). The majority of small and marginal farmers as well as

the landless peasants depend on the other livelihood activity such as livestock and non-timber

forest products for sustenance in states like Jharkhand, Andhra Pradesh, Odisha, Maharashtra,

etc. Some of the non-timber forest products are a catalyst for their income, and custard apple

(also called Sitafal/Sarifa in some regions) is one of them. Many communities are involved in the

cultivation of custard apple in different states. One such community called Banjara is significantly

engaged in cultivating custard apples in Maharashtra's Beed district. In this paper, the readers

can get a holistic view of the value chain of the custard apple. The case study demonstrates how

a small tribal community-driven enterprise turns profitable by processing custard apples in the

Beed district of Maharashtra. Taking cue from the case, the government can promote cultivation

# INTRODUCTION

The custard apple is a drought-tolerant fruit plant. It can remain healthy even in worse

atmospheric conditions. The plant does not need much water and pesticide too. In other words,

custard apple needs less attention, low-maintenance cost, and low investment. It also includes a

pleasant aroma and taste and is also a source of medical benefits in which it is used as an

antioxidant anti-diabetic medicine. Further, the custard apple has good acceptability in various

value-added products viz., juice, ice cream, toffee, milkshake, vinegar, Ready to serve the

beverage, jam, and nectar etc. with 10 to 55% contribution. According to The Agricultural and

# Processed Food Products Export Development Authority (APEDA), yearly yield of custard apple

in India was over 298 thousand tons in 2018.

Beed custard apple grown in the Balaghat ranges of the Beed district has a phenomenal, sweet

taste. The high potassium content and micronutrients in the rocky terrain with shallow, gravelly,

well-drained soil of Balaghat range around the Beed district, especially in Dharur, Ambajogai,

Ashti is more prominently responsible for Dharur custard apple’s unique and distinct taste. The

yield of Beed custard apple is 10.89 Kg/Plant. The perfectly round shape, attractive shiny green

external fruit colour with pleasant texture and flavour, and the distinct creamy white or yellowish

colour with wide space appearing on maturity are the key features to identify the custard apple

from Dharur. The Beed custard apple is heavy and produces a high quantity of pulp. The pulp is

juicy, white creamy, granular, edible, soft and fleshy, with a mild flavour and slight acidity (0.24%)

(Balaghat Sitaphal Sangh, 2016). Maharashtra leads the country in custard apple production, with

92,320 tons, followed by Gujarat, Madhya Pradesh and Chhattisgarh. Custard apples are also

## grown in Assam, Bihar, Odisha and Rajasthan.

The authors had facilitated village organization women to start a custard apple processing unit

to make them sustainable and make an example of entrepreneurship in Dharur block of Beed

district (Maharashtra). Earlier, they were involved in cotton harvesting as labourers and got ₹100

wages per day. The government gave a grant of approximately ₹5 lakhs to start a processing unit.

The processing output result details have been given in Table 1.

It may also be noted that it is a perishable commodity and is available for a very short period of

1-2 months. An average of 10 women were involved in the whole process including procurement,

processing, and market linkage. The technical agency facilitated their endeavours. The targeted

customers for the processed pulp of custard apples were the ice cream industries, local juice

# vendors among others.

Previously, the tribal women of Beed district depended on the local aggregator who in turn had

a monopoly in this region. Hence the custard apple farmers in the district were not able to get

good prices for their yields. The aggregators used to buy custard apples from the local farmers at

rate of ₹4-5₹/kg and sell the same at the rate of ₹80 or more in the city markets. After the setting

up of the custard apple pulp processing unit as part of government intervention, the local farmers

were able to get ₹12-14 per kg.

# CONCLUSION

The case is based on a small unit of extracting the pulp and selling them at local market. Only 10

women are involved in the processing. More than 50 tribals women sell the custard apples to the

processing unit. Also, the processing unit is engaged in extracting the pulp only. However, there

are several opportunities available to the local micro entrepreneurs. They can get involved in

converting custard apple pulp into powder and sell the same on various online platforms. Thus,

a seasonal venture can be converted into a round-the-year enterprise for the tribal women.

For example, custard apple can also be used for making jam, fruit-flavoured yoghurt, fruit drinks

and syrups, with fruit extracts from custard apple (Hoyos, 1980), juices (Sinthiya and Poornima,

2017), candies, and wines (Kadam (2001), ice-cream (Yadav et al., 2010) ), squash (Sravanthi et

# al., 2014), milkshake (Bakane, 2016), vinegar (Raichurkar and Dadagkhair, 2017) or nutritional

# flour (Souza et al., 2018).

Involvement of the technical agency to provide their expertise to the tribal women is limited for

a short period. Once the processing unit takes off, the technical agencies exit the scene. Hence

the village-level processing units are under constant threat from the big players. Hence, it is

imperative for the government to also create safeguards for the tribal women who come forward

to start their own small ventures in the form of custard apple pulp processing units. Further, the

government can increase financial support to make such ventures sustainable. Moreover, such

endeavours can be gainfully integrated with self-help groups. Also, the government can make

concerted efforts to promote the non-farm sector in the country to help small and marginal

farmers in supplementing their income during lean seasons when there is no work in the farms.

## Entrepreneurial Orientation and Circular Business Practices:

# A Conceptual Framework

# U. Amaleshwari* and Jeevitha R.**

# ABSTRACT

The idea of a circular economy is becoming more popular in academia, business, and public

policy. A circular economy is an alternative economic model that reduces waste, pollution, and

the lack of resources. On the other hand, numerous studies have been studied under

Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO). The dimensions of EO, such as risk-taking, innovativeness and

proactivity, are studied to draw a relationship with Circular Practices. The literature study

examined the theories' ideas and ways of thinking about them. It also gave a framework that

pointed out the problems and the research gaps. The research design comprises of developing a

hypothetical model with Entrepreneurial Orientation as the exogenous variable to test the

endogenous variable of Firms Performance. In addition, Circular Practice targets Performance as

a mediating variable. The methodology used in this study is quantitative that contains a random

sample of Entrepreneurs in Tamil Nadu, India. The questionnaire is suggested for collecting and

# INTRODUCTION

Entrepreneurship is identifying and exploiting business possibilities at the individual opportunity

nexus. (Shane S & Venkataraman S, 2000). The GEM 2022 report defines entrepreneurship as

starting and operating a company. When entrepreneurs start new businesses, they create jobs,

income, and value-added, the three pillars of economic growth. They often introduce new goods,

technologies, or processes (GEM 2022). Economics, psychology, and sociology were the most

significant influences on the study of entrepreneurship. Schumpeter (1934) and McClelland

(1967), considered to be the founders of the field of entrepreneurship studies, looked at the topic

from a psychological point of view. They focused on people as the main subjects of their studies.

Between 1980 and 2005, mainstream entrepreneurship studies shifted in this regard. (Kirchhoff

- 1991) This method used economic and strategic theories to understand entrepreneurship during

this period (Frese & Gielnik, 2014). Choosing to go into business for yourself opens various doors.

It brings in more money from economic and industrial activity, investment returns, job

# opportunities, foreign direct investment (FDI), and increases in national income.

In addition to their regular company activities, many smaller companies have started to use

environmentally friendly practices, environmental legislation, environmentally friendly talents,

and innovative ways to get resources to help the environment (Rizos, 2016). The rise of the

collaborative economy led to technological advances that gave people more freedom and made

connecting with others easier. Platforms for working together can make it harder for their

businesses to stay in business (Fang & Li, 2022). Many entrepreneurs and business owners are

very optimistic and consider social and environmental issues when making decisions. These

worries may go away as incomes rise, however. Since many of these economies have already felt

17

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

the effects of change on society and the environment, it may not be surprising that less wealthy

countries take these issues seriously (GEM, 2022). As a result, practitioners, and researchers of

entrepreneurial orientation (EO) want to focus more on environmental problems and ideas like

## the circular economy (CE) (Cullen and De Angelis, 2021).

The concept of a circular economy (CE) can be summed up in the expression "reduce, reuse, and

recycle," which aims to strike a balance between promoting economic development and

preserving the natural environment. It attempts to circumvent the inherent flaws of a straight

business model, defined as "take, make, use, and dispose of" (EC, 2015). We need to move

toward a new "circular" paradigm based on reducing, reusing, and recycling resources. This

approach facilitates the closure of the loop in economic systems, thereby generating

environmental and economic advantages across various levels of analysis, as stated by EC (2015)

(EEA, 2016). At the organizational level, the implementation of Circular practices (CP) is facilitated

by various behaviors, such as the prioritization of regenerative resources, the conversion and

elimination of waste, the design of durable and reassembled products, and the integration of

products and services in 'product-service-systems' (PSS). These practices offer significant

opportunities for cost savings and revenue generation (Stahel, 2013). To use the CE framework,

businesses need to make significant changes to their strategies and develop entrepreneurial skills

in crucial areas (Tura et al., 2019). This article employs the resource-based view (RBV) theory of

# the firm.

According to Wiklund and Shepherd's (2005) assertion, there needs to be more examination

regarding the correlation between a company's resources (VRI) and its organization (O) in

elucidating its performance within the context of the VRIO terminology. They propose that more

research should be done on the correlation because there are signs that managerial decisions

can affect how the firm's resources are used in response to changes in the environment and new

opportunities. Entrepreneurial Orientation (EO) is an essential metric for organizations because

it can increase the firm's resources by focusing the attention of top-level managers on the best

way to use resources to find and take advantage of opportunities.

18

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

This research seeks to cover this void by establishing an EO model that influences the objective

performance of Circular Practice by minimizing its challenges to improve the performance of

firms. Specifically, this study will focus on improving the performance of firms. This study aims to

respond to the following research question: Which EO structures influence the achievement of

cyclical practices by target performance to enhance firm performance?

# LITERATURE REVIEW

This research is built on the Resource-based view (RBV) theory. According to RBV, organizations'

resources are essential in accelerating performance and ensuring competitive advantage (Hitt et

al., 2011). This school of thought says that the diversity of a company's resources gives it its

unique competence, which determines its level of ongoing success and helps it grow. (Barney,

1991). Researchers (Barney & Clarke, 2007; Newbert, 2007) say that a company's improved

performance may be due to better use of the company's internal resources. The idea of a

resource-based view (RBV), which focuses on companies' internal capabilities that function as

building blocks to generate competitive advantage and enhance firms' performance (Shah et al.,

2019; Barney, 1991), is highly significant from the standpoint of business performance. RBV looks

at what a company can do on its own, which gives it a competitive edge and improves how well

it does its job. The researcher came up with the idea that better and more long-term growth

needs an accurate assessment of the resources available inside an organization. According to

Morgan et al. (2009), appropriate articulation of an organization's internal resources and the

methodical use of those resources are essential to achieving a competitive edge and maintaining

the firm's development over time. As a result, this research aims to establish a conceptual

framework that considers three significant aspects of Entrepreneurial orientation, Circular

Practice target performance, and firm performance. The business will be more efficient if it

makes suitable investments in its own resources, responds quickly to market changes, looks for

opportunities, and is willing to take risks to put forward new ideas, especially if the circular

practice is developed at the same time.

# ENTREPRENEURIAL ORIENTATION

Entrepreneurial orientation (EO) is an essential aspect of entrepreneurship and strategy. It shows

the management's vision and guides the organization's efforts to develop new ideas that help

customers and the businesses that serve them. (Smith & Jambulingam, 2018). EO is an

organizational trait that reflects how "being entrepreneurial" is realized in organizations or

business units. The particular area of entrepreneurship is understood as indicated by risk-taking,

innovativeness, and proactiveness. EO refers to how these characteristics are manifested in

organizations or business units. (Covin & Slevin, 1989; Miller, 1983). To be more explicit, the term

EO "refers to the processes, practices, and decision-making activities that lead to new entry,"

with the dimensions antecedent to new entry being risk-taking, innovativeness, proactiveness,

autonomy, and competitive aggressiveness. (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). According to the conception

of Miller, Covin, and Slevin, EO is expressed in the standard variation of risk-taking,

innovativeness, and proactiveness. To be more specific, EO can be seen in the typical differences

in how these processes show up in behavior. Polites, Roberts, and Thatcher (2012) explain that

EO is a "profile construct" based on how Lumpkin and Dess think about it. This means that EO is

represented by how the dimensions of the construct are merged into an overall profile. Both

ways of thinking about the situation may be defended. (Covin & Wales, 2019).

EO is the behavioral predisposition of an organization towards creativity, proactiveness, and risk-

taking that contributes to organizational performance (Isichei et al., 2020; Dankiewicz et al.,

2020; Kramoli & Dobe, 2020; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). Risk-taking refers to the proclivity of an

organization to undertake endeavors and engage in actions that entail an element of

unpredictability in their outcomes. (Kallmuenzer & Peters, 2018). A risk-taking attitude measures

a person's willingness to make choices regarding endeavors with a high likelihood of success

# (Anderson & Eshima, 2013).

The performance of the business is positively correlated with the risk-taking behavior of

entrepreneurs, as perceived from the SMEs' standpoint. (Wiklund & Shepherd, 2005). According

to Lumpkin and Dess (1996), there exists a variation in the propensity for risk-taking and its

20

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

outcomes at both the organizational and structural levels, which can be attributed to the goals

and objectives of the organization. The willingness to take risks "represents the willingness to

take advantage of opportunities that have arisen in the environment," even though the company

and the entrepreneurs know "neither the likelihood of its success nor the consequences of its

actions." Risk-taking "represents the willingness to take advantage of opportunities that have

arisen in the environment" (Rodrigo-Alarcon, 2018). Thus, The literature presents various risk-

taking strategies to address operational crises in firms operating in the Central European region.

The availability of financial tools, financing solutions, and digital intelligence, including IoT and

Big Data, is crucial for enhancing the performance of firms, as suggested by recent studies (Cantu

et al., 2021; Gong et al., 2020).

H1: Risk-taking has a positive influence on achieving the target of Circular Practice target

# Performance of SMEs.

The concept of innovation pertains to the extent to which an organisation is inclined towards

innovating its business operation processes. (Zufiqar et al., 2019; Bhatti, Rehman, & Rumman,

2020). Innovation enables the organisation to capitalise on novel prospects, meet customers'

demands through novel products and services, and assume the role of a pioneer in the sector.

(Isichei et al., 2020; Shah et al., 2019). Furthermore, individuals who exhibit a proclivity for

innovation are likely to possess a greater capacity for identifying diverse channels of financial

resources than those who exhibit a lower inclination towards innovation and access beyond the

## conventional methods of loans and shares (Christian Stone, 2016).

H2: Innovativeness has a positive influence on achieving the target of Circular Practice target

# Performance of SMEs.

The notion of proactiveness pertains to the capacity of an organisation to anticipate and take

proactive measures in response to the demands of consumers by providing novel products and

services that have yet to become familiar to any other entity in the industry (Kallmuenzer &

21

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

Pefactor, 2018). The internal factor that plays a crucial role in the success of an organisation is

proactiveness. This factor allows organisations to capitalise on first movers in the industry,

indicating a high level of entrepreneurial activity (Isichei et al., 2020; Lumpkin & Dess, 1996). The

capacity of an organisation to anticipate the future demands of consumers and effectively meet

those demands is a crucial driver of business performance. The market analysis allows the

organisation to assess present market demand and anticipate future expectations, potentially

resulting in business expansion and enhanced performance (George & Marino, 2011). Hence,

proactiveness encompasses not only current business operations but also those of the future.

The attribute of proactiveness enables enterprises to forecast emerging concepts and recognise

prospects within the market. (Lumpkin & Dess, 1996).

H3: Proactiveness has a positive influence on achieving the target of Circular Practice target

## CONCEPTUAL DEVELOPMENT TO THE HYPOTHETICAL MODEL

A theoretical framework was created to evaluate the model for the research objectives after an

in-depth assessment of the relevant literature, taking the research challenge, and performing

an extensive examination of the relevant theories and models. The framework was used to

build hypotheses using the following constructs. The exogenous variable was considered as

variables of EO, including risk-taking, Proactiveness and Innovativeness of an Entrepreneur. The

endogenous variable is the Firms Performance, and the mediating variable is Circular Practice

# Target Performance.

# METHODOLOGY

The research is centered on investigating theoretical constructs or latent variables that are not

directly observable, commonly referred to as latent variables. This study focuses on the latent

# variable of Entrepreneurial Orientation among Entrepreneurs and Managerial individuals in Tamil

# Nadu, India.

As latent variables are not subject to direct observation, they cannot be measured directly. This

study considers Risk-taking as an exogenous variable. In contrast, the observed variables are

Proactiveness and Innovativeness—the above components are indicators of the fundamental

constructs they embody. The additional mediating variables comprise Circular Practices' target

Performance as indicators. Upon implementation of PLS-SEM, an evaluation is conducted to

determine how each indicator variable contributes to representing its corresponding construct.

Additionally, an assessment is made to determine the effectiveness of the collective set of

indicator variables in representing the construct, focusing on reliability and validity. The present

evaluation pertains to assessing the measurement model utilising the partial least squares-

structural equation modelling (PLS-SEM) approach. Partial Least Squares Structural Equation

# facilitates

# the evaluation of

# theoretical constructs and

interrelationships with measured variables and latent constructs. The PLS-SEM method also

enables the assessment of the degree of fit between the theoretical model and the empirical

# data. (Hair et al., 2014).

# PRELIMINARY CONCLUSION AND FINDINGS

The present study has analyzed the impact of Entrepreneurial Orientation on the performance

of firms, with Entrepreneurial Orientation considered the exogenous variable and firm

performance as the endogenous variable. The mediating factors are directed towards the Circular

practice target Performance variable. Numerous studies on entrepreneurship provide evidence

of the significance of skills, sustainability and green Orientation. This paper tries to draw a

# relationship between the Entrepreneurial Orientation towards circular practices and its impact

on firms' performance. Subsequent research endeavours may empirically examine the

hypothetical framework designed to evaluate Entrepreneurial Orientation and Circular Practice.

# ABSTRACT

Supply chains act as the backbone of the world economy. The ever-increasing challenges and

complexities have led to several revolutionary concepts in supply chain practice. This study

aims to capture the significant research orientation and practices of supply chains and future

alignment with challenges of inexperienced nature. The increasing importance of Hyper-

agility, Industry 5.0 considerations and evolving sustainability paradigms have been

discussed. This study aims to capture the robustness of current supply chain practices to

address future challenges regarding the human-centric Industrial Revolution, extreme time

pressure requirements, and incorporating evolving dimensions of sustainable practices in the

changing business landscape. Reconfiguration and flexible supply chain strategies have been

suggested as the robust platform for future evolving drivers.

# INTRODUCTION

The drivers of supply chain practices in the contemporary business world are continuously

evolving. As a result, the supply chain is also under continuous improvement to maintain a

competitive edge under such diverse market scenarios. Although the practices and policies

are market-dependent and

# intra-dependence between stakeholders

involved, optimal

alignment of supply chain practices and policies is always open to improvement. The supply

chain is a system of systems. It encompasses various activities like procurement,

transportation, loading/unloading, manufacturing, storage, inspection, marketing, etc., where

the task is to align these activities and resources with the market needs with utmost efficiency

and responsiveness. In the present business world, competitive edge depends upon the rivalry

## of ‘supply chain vs supply chain’ and the involved efficiency and efficacy.

Today the world has emerged as an intelligent global village wherein a product/service

conceived as good at one part may be demanded from anywhere. The fulfilment of such

demand requires the involvement of units at geographically dispersed locations and leads to

an extended/global/ultimate/long supply chain structure to ensure 7Rs (Garcia and You,

# 2015). The dynamic and collaborative perspective of supply chain management empowers

the utilization of different philosophies and improvement tools of other sectors or industries

to address the challenges it faces in the day-to-day operation and long run. One such industry

at an arm’s length synonymity with the supply chain is the manufacturing industry, and the

successfully implemented tools and principles have been of great significance in tangible and

observable terms. This relation attracts researchers and academicians from engineering and

management backgrounds to foster the qualitative as well as measurable aspects of the field.

Lean, agile, leagile, resilient, sustainable, digital, flexible and reconfiguration paradigms are

the most discussed paradigms in supply chain literature, as depicted in Fig. 1. The evolving

# triggers and challenges of the 21st-century demand supply chain researchers and practitioners

of robust, innovative concepts and their applications to maintain a competitive edge.

Although the research efforts from both fields are continuously developing, a methodology or

tool of universal fit for all the instances and challenges, whether from the theoretical or

quantitative aspect, is infeasible.

Failure of supply chains at challenging times has resulted in unfortunate experiences and

# sufferings for individuals, society, the environment, and the global economy. The transition

28

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

from managing individual management silos traditionally to the supply chain aspect emerged

as the more holistic and practical approach. And presently, supply chains, especially global

ones, are responsible for the worldwide availability of products and services. The supply

chain has always been challenging as it deals with several conflicts, interests, regulations, and

targets. Supply chain models are need-oriented and require tuning to improve performance

from whatever aspect is demanded or conceived as prime importance. Innovation, real-time

decision-making, sustainability orientation, and human-centric are the critical ingredients

identified to gain a competitive edge for supply chains in future (Turner, 2023). Supply

chains are continuously evolving to attain a competitive edge, and this study aims to cover

the practices that are present in practice and explores suitability towards future challenges.

# BACKGROUND AND RESEARCH MOTIVATION

The academic records illustrating applications and conceptual demonstrations of different

SCM (Supply Chain Management) practices were identified and subsequently categorized

based on their period of introduction in SCM research.

# Lean, Agile and Leagile Concepts

The research developments in lean concepts can be traced back to TPS, by Womack et al.

(1990) popularised lean in the book ‘The Machine that Changed the World’. Lean practices

focus on developing a value stream for eliminating muda, doing more with less, cost

reductions, volume-centric production and working well in a stable and predictable demand.

Agile, on the other hand, as a bearer of competitive advantage, focus on responsiveness and

29

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

the ability to respond rapidly against uncertainty and is suitable for high-end innovative

technological products with shortened life-cycle (Yusuf et al., 2004; Aggarwal et al., 2006 &

Singh and Pandey, 2015). Two critical lessons were identified in a review by Hoek (2001),

carrying the past decade of academic literature as streamlining the operations and achieving

an agile supply chain. Although the two practices, lean and agile paradigms, seem similar, but

are different and have some overlapping concepts. The study by Narasimhan et al. (2006)

concluded that the quest for agility might include lean as a precedence practice but not

necessary in the case of pursuing leanness.

Similarly, regarding performance measures/metrics improvement, delivery speed and

reliability act as the overlapping concept between the two paradigms. The literature on lean

# and agile concepts

indicates chronological developments

# in critical attributes and

overlapping/dual aspects between the two paradigms. It has been suggested that leanness acts

as a foundation for agility (McCullen & Towill, 2001), or in other terms, agility as a precursor

to leanness (Hormozi, 2001).

The two paradigms were combined to form the so-called leagile paradigm with the

positioning of the de-coupling point. To qualify as successful leagile, lean and agile cannot be

applied at the same point and lean should be applied upstream and agile downstream about

the de-coupling point (Pattanaik,2021). While adopting lean, inventory levels need to be

reduced, but from an agility view, customers are supplied with what they need at the right

time, even with high inventory. Thus, a balance between cost reduction and responsiveness

maximisation is desired; the portion of lean and agile in total SC might change dynamically

and seldom encounters pure leanness, and pure agility may be observed in real business

practices. Hence supply chain approach can be changed according to circumstances. It is not

suitable to declare that one is better and the other is worst. Instead, they complement each

other, and the combination depends upon market conditions (Kisperska & Haan, 2011).

# Resilient and Sustainable Concepts

Resiliency has been applied in several scientific fields like engineering, sociology, ecology,

# economics, psychology, and organization management with different perspectives. Supply

chain resilience utilizes the aspect of flexibility, dynamic capacity, and adaptability approach

towards negative as well as positive influences of the environment (Ponomarov & Holcomb,

2009). It was identified as one of the critical components of Supply Chain Risk Management

30

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

(SCRM), with overlapping concepts of organizational agility under dynamic competition, i.e.,

the ability to cope with unexpected challenges, survival under threats, and exploit challenges

to take advantage of opportunities (Sharifi & Zhang, 2009). Parallel developments in

resilience concepts, i.e., restoration or rebound aspect (fail-safe design from an engineering

# perspective) and beyond restoration towards further development (safe-fail design from

ecological perspective) of novel capabilities with better strength can be identified in various

interpretations of literary study (Coutu, 2002; Fiksel, 2006 & Vogus and Sutcliffe, 2007). The

most grounded enablers of resiliency in the supply chain have been suggested in the review

work carried out by Ponis and Koronis (2012), such as agility, flexibility, velocity, visibility,

# availability, redundancy, mobilization of resources, collaboration, and supply chain structure

knowledge. Significant overlaps have been identified in literary studies dealing with

resilience definition and capabilities and a better perspective considering resilience as an

adoptive and evolving nature guiding supply chains to consider sense, respond, control,

recover and evolve to a more robust state, thus, gaining competitive advantage.

# In

## the review by Carter and Rogers (2008), several potential

# intersections with

social/environmental/economic aspects have been identified, and a broader framework of

sustainable supply chain management has been presented, which includes risk management,

transparency, strategy, and culture towards triple bottom-line goals for the supply chain. The

research development aspects of sustainability have undergone objections, often identified as

costly undertakings by the company to achieve a win-win situation, and were considered low-

hanging fruit. Ideal sustainability occurs at the intersection of social, environmental, and

economic goals in strategic vision, and aggregated network effort comprehensively orients

# towards these goals.

A coupling of efforts towards the triple bottom-line concepts has been agreed towards several

benefits such as cost savings, design for reuse, better working conditions, increased

motivation, productivity, less absentee, enhanced reputation, and broader social acceptance,

# among others. Theoretical developments in the sustainability aspect of the organization

# utilize concepts from population ecology theory, consideration of energy as the master

resource, RBV (Resource-based view), and suggested practices as the run for the acquisition

of energy resources at low cost, vertical coordination, contracts, joint ventures, partnership,

and alliances and enables accessibility to member’s technologies thereby, ensuring effective

utilization of resources. Knowledge has also been considered one of the prime resources that

31

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

can be utilized to attain a sustainable edge against competitors. Knowledge gained through

# experiences of sustainable procurement, processing and delivery among stakeholders results

in waste and cost reduction goals, responsiveness achieved, and adaptive capacity under risk

and uncertainty positively influences trust and other performance measures of stakeholders.

Flexible approaches and increasing accessibility to resources are crucial to sustainability and

long-term vitality. Although resilience has not been considered a part of sustainable thinking,

overlapping concepts of reducing long-term risks from resource depletion, harm from

products such as pollutants and waste, societal safety, food insecurity, climate change, and

population growth but proactive management of such risks at an early stage will provide an

inimitable edge against competitors in the long run. Within the context of sustainability, risk

management focuses on the understanding and control of the risk associated with the triple-

# bottom-line concept.

## The essence of risk management and further transparency on social, economic and

environmental issues has been realized as part of the sustainability thinking of organizations

for risk assessment of stakeholders and deciding priorities. Organizations mention risks in

their sustainability report and continuously examine risks at stakeholders’ locations to

minimize reputation downfall and facilitate transparency towards sustainable development.

Formation of crisis teams and the audit of their contingency plans to ensure adequate

# response and recovery, sharpen practical skills, coordination improvement, and identification

of trouble spots are some of the disruption mitigation plans as a part of sustainable practice

# before the onset of an emergency.

# Flexible and Reconfiguration Concepts

From the manufacturing perspective, internal flexibility traces back to TPS aiming to

eliminate waste that does not add any value from the customer’s point of view, acts as a

predecessor of lean production (Womack et al., 1990), and later externally extended to

organizations and finally to supply chains in decades of 21st century (Duclos et al., 2003;

More & Babu, 2008). The supply chain flexibility provides options and features on which

most of the literature studies agree are the utilization of inter-firm as well as intra-firm

flexibilities under risk and uncertainty, focusing on adaptability of linkages between partners

# and

incorporating strategies/structure/network design changes, agility for proactive

32

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

# responsiveness, flexible robustness in relationship and orientation of entities towards goal

# attainment.

Flexibility, in general, is a multi-dimensional and complex concept, and the implications

associated with supply chain practices are imprecise and inconsistent, ranging from the

practices at individual resource, shop floor, plant level, operational and at the system level.

The triggers and enablers of flexibility have been identified in a literature review carried out

by Tiwari et al. (2015), in which critical flexible practices to mitigate risk and uncertainty are

identified as encompassing adaptability, collaboration, integration, transparency and trust,

postponement, agility, outsourcing, restructuring, redundancy, and combination with

# alternative resources and links.

Despite the advances in research angles of lean, agile, resilient, sustainable, and flexible, the

search for a versatile integral actor which incorporates and guides research implications from

different research aspects has been identified as reconfiguration (Dolgui et al., 2020), with its

origin in robotics dealing with the restructuring of modules in space. Reconfiguration has

been argued, as the extension of flexible manufacturing aspects emphasizing the aid of self-

adjustments and adaptability, for rapid response to changes in a cost-effective manner for

companies (Koren et al., 1999).

Traditional literature studies suggest reconfigurability in terms of changeability for quick and

# cost-efficient addition/removal of resources or products at the equipment, production, and

system level, which now has been extended at the supply chain level for design under cost-

efficient, responsive, resilient, sustainable manner and can be considered as the prime concept

to incorporate viability (Ivanov, 2020). Modularity, integrability, convertibility, scalability,

diagnosability and mass customization are the key characteristics of reconfiguration and

employing these characteristics, the decision and evaluation of the supply chain capacity to

adapt to changes can be performed (Biswas et al., 2019; Zidi et al., 2021a; Zidi et al., 2021b).

# In scarce studies, quantitative evaluation and optimization aspects of reconfigurable supply

chains (Jafarian and Bashiri et al., 2014; Guo et al., 2018 & Pattanaik et al., 2022).

# Extracted Motivation

While going through available literature on different supply chain paradigms, the overlapping

concepts and interdependence criteria towards a robust practice can be observed. Starting

33

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

with the network management (NM) phase, the transition towards a leagile paradigm, leagile

# SC in resilient paradigm and further extension of these concepts towards performance

improvement under TBL (Triple bottom line) aspects of sustainable thinking, a more holistic

view of integrated SCM was obtained. The aspects of sustainability and further inclusion of

redundancy units and collaboration ability enabled SCF (Supply chain flexibility) and aligned

as per the industrial aspects of the present context resulting in RSC (Reconfigurable supply

# chain).

A common consensus towards reconfiguration as the highest level of development in the

supply chain paradigm with all-inclusive paradigms has been ascertained. The developments

in the reconfiguration field have led to the identification of several overlapping paradigms,

covering almost all

## the well-established paradigms and critical factors

# to access

reconfiguration allied performance measures but are limited at the system level. Although

digital tools can automate and integrating the supply chain as a system of systems and enable

better transparency, the sophistication level required for incorporating everything from a

spreadsheet to the dynamic integrated system of several players, capabilities as well as

robotics and Industry 4.0 enabled technologies to inspect, report, sense and adaptive response

initiation makes the whole picture rather complex.

Skilled expertise is required to excel in maximum aspects, i.e., multi-tasking and multi-field

experts of the integrated process as a system to interpret data and allied response triggering

mechanisms to maintain a competitive edge under several complex considerations.

Innovation and dynamic network capabilities practices to maintain a competitive edge are

getting tougher daily. Such complex analysis requires the integration and collaboration of

critical thinking and Industry 4.0 smart practices, an essence of Industry 5.0, to improve

responsiveness at a more sustainable dimension, thereby prospering the requirements at the

individual, societal, and global economic levels. The research paradigms under Industry 5.0,

evolving sustainable dimensions and real-time dynamic agility are nascent. This study

explores the present research paradigms, i.e., flexibility, reconfigurability, and digital SC

## outputs as a facilitator of prime importance towards future technologies.

## THEORETICAL ADVANCEMENTS ON FUTURE DRIVERS AND SUITABILITY OF

# RECONFIGURATION AT THE FOREFRONT

# Hyper-agility Aspect of Supply Chains

Supply chain agility has been considered an enabler of quick response to changes and

providing a competitive edge under uncertain situations. However, during the disruption of

Covid-19, several organizations with supply chain agility could not respond quickly (Do et

al., 2021), and the agility capabilities evaluation was a necessary step for future events.

Supply chain hyper-agility is an extension of supply chain agility. Certain distinct concepts

can be identified as hyper-agility focusing on the quick response to grab the opportunities

under disruptive events against long-term planning, and at the operational level, can introduce

## new products or services within a few days.

Opportunities under such disruptive events are only short-term and may not have long-term

benefit opportunities. The short-term perspective of goals and response at ultra-speed is at the

core of hyper-agility and is suitable for colossal demand but for a shorter period. Disruption

can even lead to extraordinary demand, and under Covid-19 disruption, several organization

ramped up their supply chains extraordinarily, and some even changed the product category

35

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

earlier in operating. Although the practices adopted could not fulfil the extreme demand for

essential medical kits and tools, further government intervention was required (Sharma, 2020

& Iyengar, 2020).

Critical paradigms utilized under a hyper agile environment emerged as dealing with the

network alignment to capture the aroused opportunities from disruption is reconfiguration,

expansion of working employees, i.e., flexibility aspect, Industry 4.0 automation, data

# analytics tools and several online social platforms, i.e.., digital tools for economic

performance improvement. Although the research development in hyper-agile paradigms is

nascent, specific requirements needed to achieve hyper-agility, have been highlighted from

## the broader perspective of the dynamic capability view (Raj et al., 2023).

# Customer Involvement

The level of customer engagement is a critical factor and affects supply chain operations.

Mass production strategy was considered suitable for Industry 2.0 aspects, and globalization

rendered personalized goods and services to customers at low cost. Industry 3.0 was based on

developments in computing and IT tools utilization for various customized products, i.e.,

mass personalized products demand. The shift in nature from cheap, mass-produced products,

exploiting economies of scale to more expensive customized products and Industry 4.0

aspects demanding design and manufacturing as per individual customization at a low cost

and in large quantities poses a challenge for the supply chain.

Flexibility aspects of the volume-variety mix, make-to-order processing technologies, quality,

costs, and times under supply chain practices are continuously evolving, credited to cloud-

# computing, blockchain, IoT, data mining, ERP and other data integration tools, vision

# technologies like AR, VR and CAD, automation and robotics, digital manufacturing, and

## other technological tools (Novais et al., 2019).

## The Transition towards Industry 5.0 and Evolving Sustainable Dimensions

A new paradigm of the digital supply chain is under discussion, i.e., Industry 5.0, which

focuses on incorporating societal and environmental perspectives. The dehumanization aspect

of Industry 4.0 concerns society, individuals as well as government and the urge to include

significant human contributions in future industrial revolutions, their return to workplaces,

36

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

explore the hybrid potential of cognitive skills, critical thinking abilities of humans and

# speed, accuracy by automation and intelligent production system (Longo et al., 2020).

The concept of Industry 4.0, wherein automation and robotics have been utilized as

competitors to humans, now under the aegis of Industry 5.0 practices will rely on

# collaboration and integration of human-machine interactions, AI algorithms, and automation

to enhance productivity and response. AI in people’s daily life and Society 5.0 are some of

the implications that will not only be restricted to organizations but also more open towards

solving societal problems. The sustainability aspects will be extended for the benefit of

society and for the sustainability of the economy by creating expertise skills in human-

machine connectivity and allied employment opportunities. Resilience, sustainability, and

digital SC are concurrent strategies to adopt in Industry 5.0.

## Robust Practices and Concurrent Strategies

Supply chain evolving triggers have led to several developments in concepts and practices.

However, the quest for robustness and innovation to maintain a competitive edge under any

circumstances needs continuous refinement and performance measures evaluation. Dynamic

supply chain/network structure capabilities are continuously subjected to performance

improvements from individual or aggregated research concepts. The series of shocks and

disruptive events caused by the onset of the Covid-19 outbreak and several geographically

dispersed regulatory constraints hampered the performance of the global supply chain and

resulted in several sufferings.

Research practices developed to date were subjected to critical, practical, and unfamiliar

exposure, wherein most failed in achieving performance improvement and target achievement

under extremely high pressure of demand for essential commodities. As a result, several

organizations went bankrupt, and laying off employees hampering sustainable practices

became common. Human-centric focus and extension of sustainable dimensions/targets to

societal and individual prosperity were realized. Specific organizations could sustain and

improve their performances in economic, societal and reputation aspects by utilizing

## innovations, robustness, flexibility, and reconfigurability quickly.

# As evident from previous discussions, SC's reconfiguration principles and digital aspects with

dynamic capabilities and innovative practices hold an absolute position under such scenarios

to deliver a competitive advantage. The concurrent aspect of the dynamic supply chain

37

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

requires simultaneous sensing, responding, controlling, evaluating and decision-making,

# wherein an optimal engagement and management of different robust practices under one

single plan will be no easy task.

# CONCLUSION AND DISCUSSION

The theoretical aspects and practicality of Flexible SC, Digital SC and ultimately,

Reconfigurable SC act as the facilitator towards goals for human-centric, resilient, and new

# sustainability dimensions for Industry 5.0 and the hyper-agile environment. The research

# developments and practices in the supply chain indicate exploration of the overlapping

concepts and interactive relationship study as a prime methodology. The literature study

establishes the reconfigurable practices as of fundamental position under whatever scenario

subjected to and can be applied to other significant research angles under different

orientations. In this sense, leagile, flexible, resilient, digital, and sustainable practices can be

incorporated into a single reconfiguration framework with practices from different paradigms.

Moreover, current research practices' drivers are continuously evolving;

therefore,

reconfiguration prospects must be explored under such situations. As a system of several

systems, the supply chain will be under dynamic uncertainties, and disruptions may become a

new norm. The task under such a situation would be increasingly complex to generate a

# competitive edge.

The present study on evolving paradigms in supply chain research indicates several

indications of triggers that may be evolving. It may emerge as a sudden event in the not-too-

distant future, and the capabilities and innovativeness will be again under examination for

target achievement and performance improvement. In this context, Industrial 5.0 and allied

extension in sustainability dimensions and the need for supply chain agility under extreme

pressure from a reconfiguration perspective have been carried out since the Reconfigurable

SC has been advocated as the most recent and robust among all the paradigms. The consensus

that can be agreed upon is the positioning of Reconfiguration at the forefront for future

evolving challenges.

Although evolving drivers may be divergent from existing research practices, the scope and

applicability of the reconfiguration principle cannot be denied. Rather than focusing on

individual research paradigms requirements, the reconfigurations provide a more holistic and

robust practice that can be utilized with dynamic capabilities and integration towards several

38

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

challenges of future business context. In future, along with the engineering perspective of the

supply chain, the ecological perspective may be combined, and consideration of innovative

practices will treat the supply chain as an ecosystem. Reconfiguration practices under such

ecological systems and subjected to divergent drivers will require identifying and interacting

## several factors from the qualitative and quantitative aspects.

# Slugfest in a Virtual Sales Meeting:

# A Case Study on Toxic Work Culture

# Shweta Jha*

# ABSTRACT

This case is about deteriorating organizational culture and climate at a bank due to toxic to

behaviour of a senior manager who humiliates the team members during review meetings.

The team members are totally out of focus, and they constantly miss the targets. Use of slangs

by the senior manager has failed to motivate them to accomplish their goals. Rather, the team

members have become irritable, depressed, and anxious. Can the scenario be upturned? The

case raises more questions than it answers: Why the manager behaves in the manner he does

in formal sales meetings? Why the team members tolerate unbecoming conduct of the

manager? Why the team members never confront the manager over the use of slangs in

formal sales meetings? How the toxic behaviour of manager impacts the organization in

general and the team members in particular? What would be right measures for improving

## culture and climate in such organizations?

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

Mithun Biswas was excited about the zoom meeting at 3:00 PM on June 5, 2023. He had

joined Kharagpur branch of MyBank recently as a sales executive and it was his first sales

meeting in the new organization. However, other members of his team did not demonstrate

the same enthusiasm. He was visibly miffed about his colleagues’ lukewarm response towards

the schedule of the sales meeting through video conference which was likely to be addressed

by Regional Sales Head of Eastern Region of the bank based in Kolkata. In the previous

organization, Mithun had received sales executive of the year award for three consecutive

years. He never felt the heat of such sales meetings. Rather he would always look forward to

sales meetings as forums to showcase his accomplishments and take up challenging targets.

So, when the mood in his office became sombre after announcement of the meeting, he was

baffled.

Lalit Ghosh, Priya Majumder, Rohan Bose, and Raju Dastidar were busy preparing their

reports and framing their responses for the 3:00 PM meeting since morning. They had joined

the Kharagpur branch of MyBank during past couple of years. They were aware of the

temperament of Gautam Sarkar who had joined MyBank as Regional Sales Head in Kolkata

office about six months ago. He was a man in a hurry. He would lose his cool at the drop of

the hat. Moreover, he would become furious if anyone missed the sales targets hardly

appreciate those who were able to bring in business as per the set goals. He considered that

the sales executive did not work at all if he/she simply achieved the sales target. According to

Gautam, sales targets were restraining many sales executives to take initiatives to exceed the

desired numbers. Hence, he would spare none in the sales meetings.

The sales meeting commenced exactly at 3:00 PM. There were over 30 sales executives from

different branches of MyBank in Paschim Mednipur district of West Bengal. Kharagpur branch

was the largest in Paschim Mednipur district in terms of number of savings as well as current

accounts, quantum of deposits, disbursal of loans, etc. However, Gautam was never satisfied

with the sales team of Kharagpur branch. He was a bit lenient towards the sales executives

deployed in Salboni, Ghata, Belda, Chandrakona, Ramjibanpur, Garbeta, Balichak, Dantan,

# Mohanpur, Keshiari, Keshpur, Narayangarh, Sabang, Daspur, Debra branches of MyBank.

Nevertheless, sales executives of these branches were also bearing the brunt. Gautam

believed that these were the smaller branches of MyBank to cater to the needs of social

44

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

banking while the branches in Kharagpur and Midnapore required to be profit centres.

Midnapore was the district headquarters while Kharagpur was the largest town in the

Paschim Mednipur district. Sales head of Midnapore branch was politically connected.

Gautam was aware about the influential caucus in Midnapore and hence avoided any

# confrontation with them.

First in the line of fire was Lalit who was the senior most sales executive in the Kharagpur

branch. Gautam was in no mood to spare anyone in today’s meeting. Lalit shared his PPTs on

Zoom. Humiliation meted out to him in the last meeting was still fresh in his mind. He started

presenting his numbers. He had performed about 30% better than the previous month. Still,

he fell short of the set targets. Gautam again started chastising Lalit Ghosh in most demeaning

way. He told Lalit Ghosh that it was sheer luck that there was 30% increase in numbers from

the previous meeting but the rise in numbers did not demonstrate any labour put by him or

any initiative taken to accomplish the set the target. When Lalit tried to explain his position,

pat came the command from Gautam, ‘Just shut-up, you rascal, I need numbers, not your

# lame excuse’.

Mithun was devastated at the spectacle. But more was yet to come. The moment Priya started

presenting her report, Gautam got agitated. He shouted at her, ‘You are such a senior sales

executive, aren’t you ashamed of yourself’. He further slammed her, ‘If you can’t sale banking

products, go and work in your kitchen which is the right place for you’. Mithun started thinking

whether it was okay for such a senior officer like Regional Sales Head to make awful

comments in public, especially about female colleagues. He felt like switching off his laptop.

Fearing a backlash from the ‘big boss’, he decided to stay put. Soon it was Rohan’s turn. He

told Gautam that next month he would surely meet the target. He begged forgiveness for

having missed the numbers in the previous month. Gautam was not in a mood to stop. He

retorted, ‘You bastard, if you cannot perform, why are you coming to the office –do you think

it is a charity’.

By the time it was the turn of the last sale person to present his report, the atmosphere in the

zoom meeting had become horrific. All the choicest abusive terms in Bangla and English were

used liberally for all the sales executives present in the meeting. Although Mithun escaped

45

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

the fury of Gautam today, he knew what was in store for him during the forthcoming month.

He had attended hundreds of sales meetings in his brief stint as Sales Executive in three

organizations so far. Yet, he never experienced such a venomous attitude of a senior manager

towards his team members. Himself a star sales professional, Mithun never faced any

unpleasant remarks from his bosses. All the three sales managers under whom Mithun got

rigorous training earlier, were quite polite, compassionate, empathetic, and accommodating.

Hence the team members usually went out of their way to attain the set objectives. On several

occasions when the team member faltered, manager came forward to support and guide him.

Mithun became apprehensive about his own performance in the new organization. He was

filled with self-doubt about the decision to join MyBank. Now he understood why the sales

team at Kharagpur branch of MyBank were so prickly. There was hardly any camaraderie in

the team. They hardly supported each other and barely indulged in any professional or social

conversations. Their focus was to attain their individual targets by any means. Mithun also

observed that his fellow sales executives appeared stressed and fatigued. Some of them were

also taking medicines to manage their blood pressure. The scenario in the branch office was

absolutely depressing. The branch manager was rude to everyone in the office. Even the

colleagues worked in silos and never bothered about others. Generally, the clients had to wait

in long queues to get things done. Many of the clients were contemplating closure of their

accounts with MyBank. Mithun had overheard the conversations among the clients and was

concerned about the prospects of the Kharagpur branch of MyBank.

Mithun had no clue about how the organizational climate at MyBank could become conducive

for all the internal stakeholders. There was none in the branch office to share his concerns.

Now he had two options –either he would move on to yet another organization or approach

the corporate HR for interventions. Mithun chose the latter. He shot an e-mail to Raman

Bagchi, the HR Head of MyBank, requesting him to take corrective measures before it was too

late. Mithun had little idea about how his e-mail would be taken up. But he was pleasantly

surprised to know that an inquiry into the conduct of Gautam Sarkar was initiated, and he

was suspended for the time being. Moreover, Raman had also constituted a committee to

suggest action plan for improving the organizational culture and climate at MyBank. Mithun

was the youngest member in the committee. News of his induction in the committee was

46

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

quite overwhelming. Can he really add any value to the deliberations of the committee?

Mithun immersed himself in thinking aloud… More than ideas to change the scenario, Mithun

had several questions: Why Gautam Sarkar behaved in the manner he did in a formal sales

meeting? Why did the team members tolerate his conduct for long? Why the team members

never confronted Gautam on use of slang? How the toxic behaviour of Gautam impacted the

organization in general and the team members in particular? Also, how the committee should

approach the whole issue? Can the committee really be able suggest appropriate measures

for improving the organizational culture and climate at MyBank? More specifically, what

would be right measures for improving organizational culture and climate at MyBank?

# DISCLAIMER

The case study is based on a true story. However, the names of the characters and

organization have been altered to protect their identities. The case can be used in the MBA

class to decode the nuances of toxic work culture and encourage students to thinks about

corrective measures which can upturn the organizational climate for good.

## Workplace Conformity and Workplace Values:

# A Comparative Study of TCS and Infosys

# Aastha Patel*

# ABSTRACT

This study examines the difference between workplace values and workplace conformity at

two IT giants, Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Infosys. Conformity is the act of aligning

oneself with the group, and the bulk of employee activities in a company revolves around

sustaining group conformity as a group habit. An organization's guiding beliefs and principles

are its organizational values. They include openness, confrontation, trust, authenticity,

proaction (taking the initiative, preplanning, preventative activity and evaluating alternative

payoffs before acting), autonomy, collaboration, and experimentation. For the current study,

TCS and Infosys employees provided 60 responses to a 4-point scale questionnaire based on

the OCTAPACE profile and a 7-point scale questionnaire based on the normative influence

scale. The result of the study highlights the workplace ideals having a significant difference

## with workplace conformity at both TCS and Infosys.

# INTRODUCTION

The 21st era is anticipated to be driven by informational technology, and India is seen as a

technological powerhouse at the centre of global attention. Businesses must utilize IT-based

services to increase productivity, facilitate business operations, and develop efficiently and

financially in today's global market. The IT industry is vital for the exponential expansion of

our GDP and the generation of millions of jobs. Expanding the Technology sector will require

us to develop at the same rate as China in all fields and help us capture the global market. The

pandemic has presented TCS and Infosys with significant business potential. The demand for

technological breakthroughs in most types has offered the two tech giants enormous

opportunities. To remain competitive, TCS has consistently invested in exploration and

innovation, staff training, intellectual property, and alliances. During March 2021 quarters

alone, the company closed 30 deals, establishing itself as the market leader.

Infosys has evolved towards a client-focused solid organization. It is also focused on forming

collaborations with the world's leading corporations. Infosys is also spending on designing

and developing the appropriate digital transformation-accelerating solutions. In addition, to

combat the current epidemic, Infosys has made significant adjustments to its infrastructure

to facilitate employees' work from home. The company achieved carbon neutrality as part of

its ESG program in 2020. In contrast, Infosys could only secure nine deals throughout the

# quarter.

The expansion and increase in production in several IT organizations are characterized by a

shared set of values and standards with their personnel. These principles can impact company

decisions and contribute to developing a collaborative and supportive professional

environment. Knowing a company's culture and its guiding principles can assist professionals

in assessing whether a particular workplace is a good fit. An organization's business activities

are guided by its values, standards, and regulations. These principles can impact the operation

of internal teams, the goods and services a business provides, and the promotional resources

and public communication a company shares. By defining acceptable behaviour norms, they

can help employees comprehend management's objectives and priorities.

50

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

Within our social contexts, conformity is pervasive. Occasionally, we are aware of our

behaviour, but we often act unconsciously without much thought or awareness. Sometimes,

we approve of things with which we disagree or behave in ways we are aware we cannot

control. Conformity facilitates the organization's behaviour as a single entity working together

as a team. Businesses must have regulations and guidelines that streamline and govern

output standards to retain brand integrity. It may be claimed that conformity stifles

innovation, but it also eliminates this issue by clarifying organizational norms and employee

expectations. It enables companies to have a degree of uniformity, which increases the

likelihood that everyone is working towards the same objective. Here it is pertinent to

mention about a major research on the theme –Solomon Asch, a noted psychologist,

recruited participants to execute what they thought was a simple perceptual test in these

1950s experiments. Pupils had to pick a line that matched one of three lengths. Individuals

choose the right decision. When questioned by confederates who had been informed of the

study and purposely chose the wrong line, 75% of participants conformed at least once. This

experiment effectively exhibits normative influence.

# LITERATURE REVIEW

Values express what's essential to you and your organization. Your values reflect your beliefs.

They reflect who you are and shape your culture. When considering values, think about your

conduct and decisions. If companies know who they are and who they aren't, they can hire

and fire the correct people. Employment branding and corporate culture boost hiring and

retention Effectiveness. Culture determines behaviour in any company. Culture is built on an

organization's values. These ideas help us understand what's right and wrong for our

# colleagues, clients, and community.

In firms that prioritize corporate culture and have authoritative management that imposes

business procedures, objectives, and regulations, normative conformity may limit the

socialization of employees. In such companies, normative discipline in a friendly culture may

# erode

individual characteristics, manifesting the adverse effects of autonomy and

dependence (Costas, 2012). Sitlani (2012) shows that the OCTAPACE culture in an

organization makes the employees better managers. Managers have a better chance to

improve their skills, abilities, and knowledge in a favourable culture than in an unfavourable

51

culture. Further, Jayanthi and Bhuvaneshwari (2014) observe, “In terms of OCTAPACE aspects,

Ponni Sugars Erode Pvt Ltd prioritizes collaboration over authenticity, autonomy, trust,

# proactivity, openness, and confrontation in terms of workplace culture. The confrontation

was placed last among the OCTAPACE dimensions”.

# Sharma, and Joshi (2017) in their research highlight government banks' functional autonomy

and effective governance. Public banks' work environment, job performance, and well-being

were constantly and significantly superior. Private banks' work culture, requirements, and

hours suggest higher work strain, more acute job stress, and disregard for human issues.

Researchers, namely Lim, M. S., Kim, C. Y., & Yoo, J. W. (2020), first believed, depending on a

sampling of Korean manufacturing firms, as in a sector with significant isomorphic dynamics,

firms would be compelled by homogeneity to adhere to industry norms and standards. The

data also indicate that when the industry is dynamic, the favourable impacts of strategy

conformity and invention on firm success are diminished.

# METHODOLOGY

The author mainly used standardized questionnaires called OCTAPACE and the Normative

social influence scale. The OCTAPACE profiling is a 40-item questionnaire that provides eight-

valued profiling of an organization's ethos. Openness, autonomy, trust, confrontation,

proactivity, autonomy, authenticity, collaboration, and experimentation are measured

through the test. There are two parts to the instrument. In section I, items 1 through 24 (three

for each of the eight values) explain values, and the respondent is asked to indicate the degree

to which his organization values each item. Part 2 has 16 items on beliefs, two for each of the

eight values, and the respondent assesses the extent to which the organization shares each

belief. The Normative social influence scale is a six-item test that assesses a behaviour change

deemed essential for group membership. Conformity stems from our desire for positive

interactions with other individuals. Sixty responses were collected from diverse TCS and

Infosys workers. With the aid of a manual, scoring and interpretation were accomplished. The

t-test was used to compare research groups across multiple dimensions.

Infosys on both conformity (0.254) and openness (0.461) as the P-value > 0.05.

The study by Chang, et al. (2023) demonstrates workplace conformance is a vital

characteristic that encourages the transmission of knowledge among Taiwan employees to

enhance their competition and creative potential. In the Indian context, however, Yadav

(2014) discovered that the intended magnitude of OCTAPACE value (usually believed to be

greater) is insignificant for all elements in sample Delhi-NCR universities. In universities

serving as examples, the expected degree of openness is less than the actual level of

openness. The P-value from the preceding table indicates and supports the study's conclusion

that openness and conformity do not differ significantly between TCS and Infosys in the Indian

# context.

Essawi, and Tilchin (2013) developed the structural adaptive value confrontation leading

model to foster a constructive confrontation between intended corporate values and present

employee values as part of the leadership strategy of transforming corporate culture. Further,

Essawi and Tilchin (2013) initiating and directing the constructive confrontation that enables

responding to feedback through the sophisticated and adaptable use of diverse methods that

facilitate and stimulate the adoption of the new organizational ideals. The preceding research

identifies confrontation as the latest organizational value, and the table demonstrates that

TCS and Infosys have no significant differences between confrontation and conformity

because, as per Gerard (1964), with confrontation, the people who choose to submit to others

do so more frequently than in situations without confrontation. So, it is possible that such

scenarios did not occur in both institutions, resulting in a negligible difference between

# confrontation and conformity.

conformity and trust, respectively. There is no significant difference between TCS and Infosys

on both conformity (0.254) and trust (0.815) as the P-value > 0.05. According to Rédha, et

al. (2022), organizational trust favours the organizational commitment. Following Yu-Yu

# Chang, Wisuwat Wannamakok, and Yi-Hsi Lin (2023), normative compliance in the workplace

may weaken expressive bonds in societal interaction and individuals' desire to demonstrate

vulnerability, which are foundations of interpersonal bonding and emotional trust. In

contrast, the preceding table indicates no significant difference between TCS and Infosys

employees regarding workplace conformity and trust.

conformity and authenticity, respectively. There is no significant difference between TCS and

framework of DEI, authenticity has different meanings. It is about being yourself on the job

without adhering to other people's expectations. Since the preceding table indicates no

significant difference between authenticity and conformity, it can be inferred that TCS and

Infosys personnel are inherently authentic.

Owan (2013) rightly mention that an organization with a high level of autonomy encourages

individuals to explore novel concepts and builds its strength on individual learning. In

contrast, the high-conformity organization assimilates individual unique expertise base and

promotes organizational learning through regular information sharing between individuals. It

implies that autonomy increases experimentation and trust, yet according to this study, there

is no substantial difference between TCS and Infosys employees regarding autonomy and

preceding table indicates that there is no substantial difference between workplace

conformity and collaboration among TCS and Infosys employees, contradicting the study, by

Tims et al. (2020) which demonstrates that non-conformists are more willing to work together

for the greater good, but conformity to societal standards can make individuals less likely to

Pozzo et al. (2020) observe that since culture is social, cultural innovation is accessible.

Cultural production should also facilitate technical and administrative innovation. Societies of

practice (Lave and Wegener, 1991) can influence cultural innovation and provide a fertile

setting for testing various indicators. DARIAH's twenty-one working groups, managed by their

59

members, are societies of practice where scholars of various degrees collaborate and co-

create. However, this study found no substantial difference in workplace conformity or

## experimentation between TCS and Infosys employees.

The research results contradict past comparative studies that asserted a vital association

## between the values of OCTAPACE dimensions and conformity.

# CONCLUSION

In conclusion, all 8 hypotheses are accepted. There is no significant difference between all of

the OCTAPACE values and conformity of TCS and Infosys employees. Social conformity may

impede co-workers from understanding one another's personalities on the job (Turner, 1985).

Thus, diverse workplace norms support normative conformity in different ways, and

conformance positively or negatively impacts complex social networks. (Tang et al., 2013).

Also, there is an emergent need of a thorough and standardized explanation of the causes

and outcomes of social adherence in organizational contexts. Extant literature does not

conform whether employees with inherent values are involved in social conformance. No

research has yet uncovered a significant difference between OCTAPACE values and

conformance in two or more organizations. However, the conclusions of some of the prior

comparative studies claimed a strong association among OCTAPACE cultural values. All said,

the scope of this study is limited to Tata consulting services (TCS) and Infosys employees.

Hence, it is imperative that more research may be taken up to test the inferences based on

# the current study.

## Impact of Diversity and Inclusion on Workplace Effectiveness

# Shivani Wadhwa* and Parth Aggarwal**

# ABSTRACT

In the current scenario, managing diversity and inclusion in the workplace has become the

priority to survive the competition. In line with the popular perception of diversity and

inclusion, this review paper explores how it may augment workplace effectiveness in terms

# of higher productivity, a culture of creativity and innovation, and overall financial

performance. This study also provides

# insights

# into organizations' challenges when

implementing diversity and inclusion initiatives. The article clearly emphasizes the need for

comprehensive Diversity and Inclusion programme in any organization to retain a decisive

# edge over the competitors.

## KEYWORDS: Diversity, Inclusiveness, Workplace, Organizational Effectiveness

# INTRODUCTION

# Diversity and

inclusion are two

interconnected concepts—but they are far from

interchangeable. Diversity is about representation or the make-up of an entity. Inclusion is

about how well the contributions, presence, and perspectives of different groups of people are

valued and integrated into an environment.” — Matt Bush, Culture Coaching Lead at Great

# Place to Work

Diversity and Inclusion are more than just buzzwords. They are becoming far more essential

for a healthier working environment. Making them a priority

# invariably augments

organizational effectiveness. Less inclusive organizations generally lack a culture of creativity

# and innovation. On the contrary, organizations with robust diversity and inclusion programs

are ahead of their competitors. Diversity refers to differences that exist between different

people in terms of their race, religion, sexual orientation, nationality, language etc. Inclusion

means making people, who are in the minority, feel valued, respected, and treated equally.

The organizations must adopt and implement Diversity and Inclusion programmes to attract

and retain talented people irrespective of gender, caste, creed, skin colour or sexual

orientation. The diversity and Inclusion framework seeks to treat people fairly, ensuring

everyone gets equal opportunities in the world of work and the community.

## SIGNIFICANCE OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION AT WORKSPLACE

# Diversity and inclusion program in any organization results in augmented employee

engagement, improved employee performance, enriched talent acquisition, a supplemented

culture of innovation, bettered decision-making, and an upbeat organizational reputation.

Hence, each point has been elaborated as under:

- Augmented Employee Engagement: Embracing and celebrating diversity within a

company can increase employee commitment and a stronger sense of belonging. Feeling

valued and acknowledged for their unique experiences and perspectives can enhance job

satisfaction and overall engagement. It's crucial for organizations to not only strive for

diversity but also foster an inclusive environment that recognizes and accommodates

individual differences. By prioritizing employee belonging through diversity and inclusion

efforts, companies can improve employee retention rates and create a more sustainable

# workforce.

Improved Employee Performance: When employees feel included as an essential part of

the company, they feel more inclined to perform their best. And so, it is not surprising

that their intensity of performance is dramatically enhanced so is the quality of the

65

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

outputs. It has been observed that companies with good diversity strategy experience

have about a 56% increase in job performance. In comparison, a single exclusion incident

can lead to a 25% decrease in an individual’s performance on a team project (McKinsey,

2020).

- Enriched Talent Acquisition: Embracing Diversity and Inclusion programmes in the

workplace broadens the candidates’ options to more diverse choices. But has it ever been

realized how it also attracts more talent? When the company opens its doors to all kinds

of candidates, it defines how it is viewed. According to research by Glassdoor, 76% of

people consider D&I in the workplace a significant factor while evaluating a job offer or

looking for new career opportunities (Glassdoor, 2021).

- Supplemented Culture of Innovation: A diverse workplace innovates more. Diversity is

crucial for the success of any organization, as it brings a variety of perspectives and ideas

to the table. People from different backgrounds can offer unique insights and innovative

solutions that may not have been considered otherwise. Collaborating with diverse

worldviews and skill sets fosters creativity and leads to more significant innovation.

Research supports this notion. According to a study by GrowthForce, companies with

above-average diversity had 19% higher innovation revenues. Prioritizing diversity and

inclusion (D&I), initiatives is essential for organizations to remain effective and adaptable

in rapidly changing industries. To be a thought leader in the industry, investing in D&I

initiatives is crucial for success.

- Bettered Decision-making: Inclusion involves actively seeking out diverse voices in

decision-making processes, which can lead to better outcomes by bringing in new

perspectives and ways of thinking. Embracing diversity expands the pool of ideas and

# approaches and fosters an environment of respect and collaboration. Inclusive decision-

making has been shown to offer a competitive advantage to businesses, as it allows for

## more informed and innovative solutions to complex challenges. Organizations can

improve their decision-making processes by prioritizing diversity and inclusivity and

driving long-term success.

- Upbeat Organizational Reputation: D&I

# initiatives significantly

impact how an

organization is perceived by various stakeholders, including employees, shareholders,

customers, and the public. Prospective and current clients are likelier to engage with

organizations that demonstrate a genuine commitment to these initiatives. Such

66

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

organizations send a powerful message that they value diversity and inclusion. Moreover,

cultivating a diverse workforce helps organizations expand their reach to a broader

audience and better comprehend the needs of their clients.

# LITERATURE REVIEW

Studies reveal that since 2021 and beyond, companies have devoted more attention and

resources to promoting Diversity and Inclusion (D&I) programmes. Unfortunately, many

organizations still struggle to measure the impact of their strategies and communicate that

impact to a growing number of stakeholders. More than 1,600 CEOs have signed onto the

CEO Action for Diversity & Inclusion Pledge, and 40% of companies discussed diversity and

inclusion in their Q2 2020 earnings calls versus only 4% the same quarter a year earlier.

According to Gartner research, the number of HR leaders identifying D&I efforts as a top

# (Source:

67

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

priority was 1.8 times higher in 2020 than in 2019. Gartner analysis reveals an almost 800%

increase in job postings for dedicated diversity recruiters (Romansky et al. 2021)

As the importance of diversity in the organizational context has increased, most organizations

would like to research diversity–organizational culture linkage, its effect on diversity

# openness, and between diversity and performance at individual and organizational levels.

Patrick (2010) found that diversity determines not only the results of the diversity within an

# organization but also the level of openness to dissimilarity characteristics among the

organization's members, work groups, and culture. Despite the technological wonders of

today's communication, international relations require us to deal with one another person-

to-person. For this to be effective, one has to overcome language and stereotype barriers.

This may require the mental elimination of terms like alien and the individual's perception as

having a different background (Moran, Harris, & Moran, 2011).

There is robust empirical confirmation that successful diversity management and improved

organizational performance are positively correlated (Ozbilgin and Tatli, 2008). However, a

consistent finding is that differences should be sought in moderation. Group members' ability

to elaborate diverse information may also develop over time as members become more

familiar with each other's perspectives and develop transactive memory. This suggests that,

especially for various work groups, it is essential that they can reach more extended tenure

and that they are allowed a more extended start-up phase than more homogeneous groups

(Knippenberg et al. 2004). (Patrick and Raj Kumar 2012).

The ability of individuals to influence the decision-making process and effectively contribute

their mite to the organization depends on the extent to which they can access information

and resources and are involved in work groups. “Inclusion” is also defined as fulfilling needs

for belongingness and uniqueness. According to Optimal Distinctiveness Theory, employees’

needs of belongingness and uniqueness must be met to feel included. Further, to feel

included, the unique characteristic of an employee must be valued within a group; more

importantly, though, this uniqueness the person brings to the group must be allowed and

encouraged to remain. Inclusive culture exists in the workplace when an organizational

# environment enables people with multiple backgrounds, mindsets, and ways of thinking to

68

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

work effectively together and to perform to their highest potential to achieve organizational

objectives based on sound principles (https://www.gritandflow.com). The organizations have

started coming forward to safeguard the interests of LGBTQ+ to create a holistic and inclusive

# workplace across the globe.

## ROADBLOCKS IN THE WAY OF DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

A foundation of personal growth must be present to engage in meaningful professional

growth. Individuals lacking in this foundation may pose a significant obstacle to successful

DE&I training because only some employees are in the same space concerning their personal

growth and emotional intelligence. Every person is shaped to some degree by their

# upbringing, whether cultural, religious, societal, or combinations of all or more influences.

Implicit biases and prejudices harboured within are carried forward to the workplace.

Individuals who do not possess a mature level of emotional intelligence may engage in acts

that can be interpreted as racist or sexist without realizing the impact of their actions on other

# individuals.

As such, some organizations may need to move forward in the DE&I space at a fundamental

level. A starting point would include examining the root causes of racism as a threshold

foundation. A look back in history reveals the scourge of slavery and its impact on society over

centuries and how the burden has plagued our nation, along with the guilt of those actions

weighing heavily on our collective conscience. Superiority ideologies passed down from

generation to generation are at the base in the formation of racial prejudice. Without

exposure to diversity and the plight of people of colour in society in general and in the

workplace, individuals cannot gain the pertinent information or develop the necessary

empathy to address and remedy such issues (Baum, 2021).

## STRATEGIC IMPERATIVES FOR PROMOTING DIVERSITY AND INCLUSION

Cox and Lancefield 2021) underlined five strategic imperatives for promoting diversity and

inclusion in organizations viz.

- CEOs as Champions of D&I efforts

## Integrating D&I efforts in corporate strategy

69

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

Furthermore, Society for HRM has prepared a comprehensive checklist for inclusivity that the

organizations must heed to foster a robust D&I programme (https://www.shrm.org/hr-

# today/news/hr-magazine/0418/pages/6-steps-for-building-an-inclusive-workplace.aspx):

 Make sure company leaders understand that inclusion is about ensuring that

everyone’s voice is heard, opinions are considered and value to the team is evident.

 Train managers—and hold them accountable—to show that inclusivity is a core

# competency.

##  Form an inclusion council with genuine influence and power.

 Value differences and create an environment where people can feel comfortable

bringing their “full selves” to work.



Identify underrepresented groups’ needs and give them necessary support and

# resources.

 Provide workers with a safe space to voice their concerns.

 Benchmark key aspects of your organization’s culture—and understand the employee

experience—before making changes to promote inclusivity.

 Remember that daily interactions are the most telling sign of whether or not your

company has an inclusive culture.

According to Cox and Lancefield (2021), ‘There’s widespread agreement on the need to

improve diversity and inclusion in the workplace. But it’s not easy to deliver on the promises

made. It’s time to adopt a more systematic, coherent approach. By following these five

strategies, leaders can make more progress and create a more representative, fair, and high-

performing workforce’.

# CONCLUSION

The study focused on identifying workplace diversity and inclusion barriers and strategies to

increase inclusiveness and awareness. Discrimination, prejudice, and ethnocentrism were

identified as the most significant barriers to accepting workplace diversity, along with blaming

the victim, stereotypes, harassment, and backlash. The preferred strategies for increasing

inclusiveness included learning about cultural differences and business practices in overseas

assignments, encouraging employees to accept these assignments, and providing language

training. The study recommended admitting biases and prejudices, recognizing, and valuing

71

## Journal of Management & Public Policy, Vol. 14, No. 2, June 2023

fundamental differences, and dispelling myths about diverse individuals in a group setting

with friends or colleagues to reduce prejudices and stereotypes. By implementing these

strategies, organizations can foster a more inclusive workplace culture that values and

# respects all employees.

In today's global market, organizations that embrace diversity among their employees are

better equipped to understand and meet the needs of a diverse range of customers. A recent

study in the IT industry has revealed that while most employees are open to diversity, a few

are enthusiastic and have fully embraced the positive benefits of a diverse workplace. To

foster inclusiveness, organizations implement strategies such as cross-cultural training,

encouraging overseas assignments, and offering language training. Discrimination, prejudice,

and ethnocentrism remain barriers to workplace diversity despite progress. Organizations

must take deliberate steps to manage diversity and leverage the potential of their employees

# for competitive advantage.

Leadership at all levels must genuinely commit to promoting diversity, equity, and inclusion

to create a workplace culture that fully embraces these values. While there may be a long

road ahead, continuing the conversation and taking action to effect positive change is

imperative. There is vast scope for further study of the factors affecting diversity and inclusion

in the workplace. Diversity management practices can be compared between industries, and

their impact on employee productivity and job satisfaction can be studied. There is also vast

scope for studies of perceptions of workplace diversity in different ethnic groups, religion-

based groups, and marginalized groups.
