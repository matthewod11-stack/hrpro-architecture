From 2002 to 2016, Wells Fargo employees exploited the bank’s sales

incentive program. They opened millions of unauthorized accounts and

enrolled customers in fee-incurring services to meet management’s

## unrealistic goals. Despite clear evidence of misconduct, company

leaders ignored the behavior, according to the Department of Justice

civil settlement agreement. The bank eventually paid more than $3.7

billion in ﬁnes. Top executives settled as well, including one who was

sentenced to home conﬁnement as part of a criminal plea deal.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Salespeople Game the System

Although the criminal behavior exhibited in the Wells Fargo case is

an extreme example, sales professionals who work under incentive

or commission programs frequently exploit the system to maximize

personal beneﬁt. Anyone who’s worked on or around a sales team

knows how routinely sales professionals who won’t reach their monthly

quotas postpone big deals so that they’ll have impressive numbers the

following month. There are many other ways salespeople game the

system, and the overall impact of such behavior can be enormous.

To better understand the extent of the problem, in 2023 our research

team conducted interviews with 38 salespeople, sales leaders, and

C-suite leaders in 19 industries ranging from pest control to heavy

## equipment manufacturing to software and ﬁnancial services. During

those conversations, we heard 64 distinct examples of incentive-

## related cheating and identiﬁed common ways salespeople game their

companies’ plans. We also conducted a poll of approximately 100 sales

## compensation professionals at a 2023 sales incentive conference and

learned that 83% struggled to prevent salespeople from cheating.

Of course, companies shouldn’t avoid incentive programs altogether,

despite their inherent risk. Well-designed programs can improve

seller performance and increase revenue. But managers should learn

everything they can about how their incentive programs are being

used—and abused—by employees. In this article, we draw on our

interviews—along with our combined experience researching sales

compensation and leading sales incentive plans for large banking,

software, consulting, and computer hardware ﬁrms—to oﬀer an

inventory of tactics salespeople commonly use and provide a framework

for addressing sales incentive exploitation, including whether, in some

cases, it should be tolerated.

# The Most Common Schemes

When managers design incentive plans, too often they focus only on

gaming techniques they’ve encountered in the past without taking into

account the wide range of behaviors they might face. To broaden their

perspective, we’ve developed a typology of eight distinct categories of

sales incentive gaming—each of which can be fairly benign or high-risk,

depending on the circumstances.

- 1. Sandbagging. This technique involves postponing the completion of

sales to a later measurement period to optimize incentive earnings. One

of our interviewees told us that every other year some sales reps at his

company would hold as many orders as possible from October through

December and submit them in January. The extra sales translated into

outstanding sales performance—and a very high commission for far

exceeding established quotas.

- 2. Partners in proﬁt. Salespeople may team up with customers

to manipulate company processes to secure a better deal for the

customer and a higher bonus for themselves. We heard in one of our

interviews about personal bankers who coached customers to sign

up for accounts to take advantage of promotional deals (earning the

bankers a commission) and then close the accounts at the end of the

# promotion.

- 3. Squandering sales. This tactic involves misleading customers in ways

that beneﬁt the salesperson but not the organization or the customer.

One interviewee recounted an example from a previous employer: Sales

reps would give customers discounts to upsell them to unneeded service

levels in order to earn the higher commission associated with the higher

tier of service. Though the salespeople came out ahead, the upsell hurt

the organization’s bottom line and the customers: The company paid

out a higher commission as a result of the upsell, and the customers

ended up paying more for unwanted, higher-tier services, possibly

resulting in customer dissatisfaction and defection.

- 4. Lost in segmentation. Salespeople sometimes game the system

by focusing their eﬀorts on buyer segments that provide greater

## opportunities for incentive payouts instead of the targeted segments

favored by the company. One interviewee told us that this was common

among customer service associates (CSAs) who were responsible for

## both inbound sales-and-service calls and outbound sales-only calls.

The CSAs would avoid accepting the incoming calls to maximize the

time they could devote to the outbound calls, thereby earning more

# commissions.

- 5. Carrot and stick. Salespeople may use rewards, promises, threats, or

punishments to encourage customer behavior that maximizes incentive

payouts. According to an interviewee at an airline, some agents oﬀered

to waive baggage fees for customers during the check-in process if

they signed up for the airline’s credit card, thus earning themselves a

# generous bonus.

- 6. Misleading customers. This tactic involves giving prospective

customers misleading information or withholding information to move

the sales process forward. At one ﬁnancial services company, some reps

would falsely tell call-in customers that the transaction couldn’t be

completed on the phone and encouraged them to meet with a ﬁnancial

adviser, which yielded them higher bonuses for in-house referrals.

- 7. Falsifying data. In this case, the sales management system is fed

false information or information is omitted to maximize incentive

payouts. In one interview, we heard that sales reps often log in to

sales management systems and add their names to deals they did not

participate in to increase their bonuses.

- 8. Faux customers. Creating fake customer accounts with the help of

friends, relatives, or coworkers, or simply fabricating accounts, is also a

common gaming tactic. Some sales reps ask friends to pose as buyers,

one interviewer told us. After the rep receives the commission for the

“sales,” the phony customers cancel their service.

# Anticipating Problems

This typology of tactics can help sales leaders and incentive plan

managers think like gamers when looking for signs of cheating in

existing incentive plans and when designing and rolling out new ones.

The eﬀectiveness of this process will vary according to managers’ ability

to anticipate all the ways sales incentive plans can be twisted for

self-serving purposes—what management scholars Mark Seabright and

Marshall Schminke call “immoral imagination.”

Incentive managers with limited immoral imagination should ask

trusted sales leaders and professionals to look over drafts of incentive

plans to identify ways in which people might game them. Reviewing

the list of common tactics can spur everyone’s thinking to identify

## loopholes and opportunities for rule-breaking or outright cheating.

Managers can use those insights to clarify rules, develop gaming

## safeguards, and design monitoring protocols.

Sales leaders should think like gamers when looking for signs of cheating in existing incentive plans and when designing and rolling out new ones.

Plan managers can also use the typology to detect cheating in

existing plans. When incentive teams conduct audits of sales data,

the typology can help them look for signs of wrongdoing or ﬂaws in

the plan design. Generally, this means examining data in the sales

## management systems for irregularities in salespeople’s behavior, deal

## closing, revenue measurement and recording, and the data ﬂow and

calculations that determine incentive payouts.

Consider how two companies we have worked with or advised used the

typology to supplement their standard protocols to ﬁnd misbehavior.

The incentive manager at a large U.S. ﬁnancial institution noticed

that the account-opening performance of one retail branch exceeded

the performance of comparable branches in the region. Given this

irregularity, the team suspected that a small group of bankers were

using the faux-customer tactic. It initiated an audit of all deposit

accounts opened in the previous 12 months and ﬂagged those that

had been closed in less than 90 days. The audit revealed that two

bankers routinely opened fake customer accounts and then closed them

after they had been recognized by the incentive system. The company

terminated the bankers and expanded monitoring for this pattern of

# account activity.

And recall our call center example of lost-in-segmentation behavior.

## After a week of intensive monitoring, the incentive plan team

determined that 15% of the reps were ignoring a large share of their

incoming calls, forcing other team members to pick them up, so that

these reps could focus on commission-paying outbound calls. Team

leaders corrected the behavior with one-on-one discussions, and the

incentive team instituted a process for ﬂagging similar behavior in the

# future.

Some of these practices may seem to be victimless crimes or relatively

insigniﬁcant. Submitting a customer order on the ﬁrst day of the

month rather than the last day of the previous month, for instance,

might annoy the budget team but have minimal impact on ﬁnancial

performance. But misleading customers, submitting false data, or

creating phony customers can jeopardize customer relationships,

## pose serious risks, and ultimately result in catastrophic ﬁnancial

# consequences.

# Assess Your Incentive Plan

What steps should managers take to minimize gaming behaviors? Start

by identifying which strategies your salespeople use and evaluate the

degree of the ethical breach. To determine the extent of the problem,

ask yourself whether it is the practice of many sales representatives,

a few, or a single person. Then consider the ramiﬁcations of the type

of cheating on customer relationships, ﬁnancial performance, and

legal, reputational, and other risks. (See the exhibit “How Bad Is Your

# Cheating Problem?”)

Salespeople who game the system may see their behavior as a harmless

bending of the rules and may not be out to do real damage to the

company or to customers. And it’s true that all sales-cheating methods

are not equal. Even when the prevalence of a certain cheating tactic is

high, the eﬀect on company performance can be fairly insigniﬁcant and

the behavior not indicative of a serious ethical problem. In other cases,

the impact can be severe.

Consider the situation faced by security systems provider Vivint Smart

## Home. According to the Federal Trade Commission, in 2021 some 130

of the company’s commissioned sales reps regularly engaged in identity

theft to approve customers for loans. If a customer didn’t qualify for

a loan, the reps would illegally use the credit record of an unrelated

person with the same name. Falsifying data in this way—often called

“white paging”—is a violation of several laws. The company admitted

wrongdoing and agreed to pay a $15 million civil ﬁne and a $5 million

ﬁne to aﬀected customers.

Given that a sizable number of sales reps had regularly engaged in

the behavior, and given the signiﬁcant reputational damage and legal

ﬁnes incurred, we would place that gaming activity in the top-right

“widespread disruptive” quadrant. Companies that ﬁnd themselves

in that quadrant should immediately alert leaders from sales, legal,

and compliance functions and risk management. They should develop

## a remediation plan for aﬀected customers, and in consultation with

HR, they should aggressively address the problem, including possibly

terminating the oﬀending salespeople. The company should put

stringent controls in place to ensure that the behavior does not persist.

Companies may choose not to fix every gaming tactic they discover. Indeed, it may be preferable to tolerate certain gaming strategies that have low impact or occur infrequently.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Salespeople Game the System

Once a company has determined the extent of cheating schemes,

leaders should carefully consider making changes to the sales incentive

plan. They should weigh the expected consequences of the behavior

against their organization’s appetite for risk. In most cases, executives

will conclude that tolerating salespeople’s cheating is not an option and

the compromised plan must be ﬁxed.

In cases where there is a consensus to ﬁx the problem, we recommend

# the following four-step process.

Use data to pinpoint how salespeople are exploiting the system. Let’s

return to our example of airline employees who received a cash bonus

for each passenger who signed up for a cobranded company credit card.

Employees working at the check-in counter would, against company

policy, oﬀer the credit card application to customers and propose

waiving their baggage fees if they completed the application on the spot.

Employees had the right to waive those fees for a variety of reasons:

when customers held the cobranded credit card, for high-tier frequent

ﬂiers, or as part of a service recovery eﬀort. That made it hard to isolate

the cheating scheme. We would advise the airline to use information

systems to identify the top quartile of credit-card-incentive earners

and match the timing of those agents’ credit-card sign-ups with their

# baggage-fee-waiving activity.

Revise the sales incentive plan. If cheating is the result of ambiguities

in the incentive plan guidelines, update the documents to clearly

## specify acceptable and unacceptable behaviors and procedures. If

cheating involves bending or breaking rules or providing false

information, add language prohibiting inappropriate practices and

reinforcing the consequences for employees who violate the policies.

Consequences might include denial or clawbacks of incentives and

# disciplinary action.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Salespeople Game the System

Consider a ﬁnancial institution where branch bankers were covertly

counseling customers to open credit-card accounts but not use them

(retaining the new card for emergency use only), allowing the bankers

to earn commissions. In response, incentive plans were modiﬁed

to require that customers use the cards before the bankers earned

commissions. This change meant that bankers did not immediately

receive their incentive credit for newly opened accounts and required

the ongoing collection of data to determine when cards were used for

purchases, balance transfers, and cash advances. However, those were

trade-oﬀs that the bank deemed appropriate, given that only credit

cards that are in active use generate revenue.

Establish ongoing monitoring of sales processes. Sales management

systems must be updated to spot and reject cheating. Examples

include systems that identify credit cards without any activity or

new card applications taken in combination with baggage fee waivers.

Additionally, reporting and dashboards should be created to give

visibility to questionable transactions. For example, a bank might

## collect data on branches with high account-closure rates within 60 days

of opening the accounts. Or they might analyze the work of bankers

whose new credit-card sales exceed the average for their region.

Sales activities that cannot be tracked solely through data might require

human monitoring and inspection. This could include random checks

for rule adherence, call monitoring, transaction audits, ﬁeld-based

## compliance inspections, or customer purchase veriﬁcations. Predictive

analytics and AI should be incorporated into ongoing monitoring

# eﬀorts.

Communicate the changes to the sales team. Once the incentive plan is

updated and the data collection and reporting systems are established,

sales leadership should communicate about any new or revised policies,

changes to the incentive plan, and the addition of monitoring to detect

and prevent future gaming. Leaders should also discuss any problems

with cheating that were discovered in the process. Explanations of the

policies should be combined with a review of the company’s code of

conduct. Sales organizations without such a code should create one and

share it to help prevent gaming tactics and reinforce the consequences

# of this type of activity.

If the steps above are carefully followed, the identiﬁed gaming will

be curtailed or eliminated—until the next weak link in the plan is

discovered. In our experience, it takes longer in larger companies to

adopt, roll out, and communicate ﬁxes to gamed incentive plans. The

monitoring practices and consequences for breaking the rules should

also be continually reviewed with sales reps. We recommend that

companies be diligent in sharing and reviewing dashboards and reports

with sales leadership to conﬁrm progress.

# Maybe You Don’t Respond

Companies may choose not to ﬁx every gaming tactic they discover.

Indeed, it may be preferable to tolerate certain strategies that have low

impact or occur infrequently. That’s because abandoning or altering a

mostly functioning incentive plan can have downsides: Changes may

disrupt the focus of the sales team, resulting in a dip in productivity.

Or salespeople might feel that the changes are unfair, resulting in

resistance, demotivation, or even turnover. Finally, plan changes may

produce unintended consequences, including new opportunities to

cheat, higher-than-expected payouts, or the disruption of existing

# customer relationships.

One company we studied—a $20 billion software reseller and solution

## provider—oﬀers an excellent illustration of such a decision. Under

a new incentive plan, sales reps earned a monthly gross-margin

commission. For example, a rep who sells products for a total

revenue of $40,000 with a cost of goods sold of $10,000 earns a

commission percentage on the $30,000 margin. Soon after the rollout

of the incentive plan, the sales operations team identiﬁed widespread

sandbagging. When sales reps knew they would not meet their monthly

quotas, they sat on later-in-the-month orders and submitted them early

the following month. The sales operations team classiﬁed the problem

## as widespread nuisance gaming (high frequency, low impact).

Company analysts suggested changing the plan to extend the sales

window from monthly to quarterly—which, they argued, would reduce

## the frequency of sandbagging and the number of delayed transactions.

But sales leaders pushed back, realizing that the company would be

better oﬀ tolerating rather than ﬁxing the gaming. Under the current

plan, sales reps optimized their commission pay by sitting on deals

for days or possibly a week. If the sales window were extended from

## monthly to quarterly, the behavior would most likely continue—but

reps would sit on deals for weeks or longer. That would lengthen the

sales cycle, lower sales velocity, and lower sales growth. The new plan

was rejected, and managers kept a close eye on the gaming behavior to

make sure the problem was not becoming more disruptive.

. . .

Nearly every sales leader and salesperson we interviewed told us, “All

sales-incentive plans can be gamed.” People will inherently seek ways to

maximize their personal beneﬁts and achieve their goals as easily and

## quickly as possible—sometimes at the expense of their integrity.

The process we have outlined in this article is not a one-and-done ﬁx

but an iterative exercise. Every new or revised plan will be scrutinized

for opportunities to bend or break rules, or even cheat outright.

Thinking like a salesperson will produce incentive plans that are

less conducive to gaming and constrain the human tendency to take

# unethical shortcuts.
