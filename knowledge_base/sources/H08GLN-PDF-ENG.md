Failure is often viewed as something you need to avoid, especially

by new managers who are eager to prove their competence or have

been previously conditioned to think that way. But failure isn’t a bad

thing. In fact, it can help in fostering your team’s long-term sustainable

# development.

While avoiding failure may protect short-term performance, it hinders

long-term growth and innovation. When employees take less risks and

stay within their comfort zones, they miss opportunities to stretch their

## abilities and experiment with innovative solutions.

If you’re a ﬁrst-time manager, you may want to rethink the role of

failure within your teams. Instead of waiting for failure to happen

(so employees can learn from it), you can intentionally embed failure

into team tasks with the explicit goal of learning. This is known

as productive failure, a scientiﬁcally tested method that can drive

## employee learning and growth, foster innovation, and enhance team

# resilience.

But this isn’t about setting your employees up for failure. To eﬀectively

utilize productive failure methods, you’ll need to organize a balanced

portfolio of tasks with built-in roadblocks. After employees have

completed the carefully designed tasks, you will need to hold a feedback

and debrief session to talk through the learnings.

So, where do you begin?

# Designing a Portfolio

The key to designing failure tasks lies in creating a balanced portfolio of

both performance goals and learning goals.

Performance goals include tasks that focus on achieving set goals where

failure is not acceptable. They may involve routine activities such as

accurately processing payroll or managing client deliverables on a high-

stakes project where success is imperative.

Learning goals are designed to push employees beyond their current

abilities. These stretch tasks are speciﬁcally chosen for their potential

to cause failure and struggle, which drives exploration and creative

problem-solving. Examples of such tasks could include creating a new

product feature from scratch or leading a cross-functional team for the

# ﬁrst time on a low-key project.

Separating these two goals is critical for productive failure to work

eﬀectively. By clearly communicating which tasks are learning vs.

performance-focused, managers can normalize failure in the learning

zone, creating a safe space for experimentation and growth.

# Building in Roadblocks

Once the portfolio of performance and learning tasks is established, the

next step is to design the roadblocks for the learning tasks.

For example, in anticipation of the AI push in their organization,

a ﬁrst-time manager may task their team to design an AI-driven

recommendation feature for the company’s e-commerce platform.

Given the novelty of the technology, the task is likely to push the team

beyond its current skill sets and knowledge. To create opportunities

for employees to engage in deep problem-solving, rather than simply

executing known solutions, a manager could:

- 1. Use constraints.

Deliberately place constraints on the task that help employees to think

creatively. For example, limit the amount of training data the team

can access for the AI model, forcing them to get creative with data

augmentation techniques or identifying proxy data. Additionally, you

could add a time constraint by shortening the project from six weeks to

four weeks to drive a sense of urgency and focus. This might prompt

the team to explore alternative, quicker methods of implementation

(e.g., open-source libraries or pre-trained models) instead of relying on

# typical solutions.

- 2. Include contrasting cases.

Design tasks that involve comparing diﬀerent approaches or scenarios.

For example, you might ask the team to compare two diﬀerent

recommendation algorithms: one based on similar users’ preferences

and the other based on the product’s features. The challenge lies in

deciding which model or combination is better and can help your team

think more strategically.

- 3. Throw in extreme boundary conditions.

Create tasks that push employees to deal with extremes outside the

norm. This might involve introducing an edge case where the AI feature

must work with extremely limited user interaction — for example,

generating product recommendations for new customers with minimal

browsing history or purchase data. This pushes the team to think

outside the box, perhaps leveraging demographic data or contextual

clues to develop creative solutions that would not have been necessary

# in a typical use case.

- 4. Create uncertainty.

Set up the task with incomplete or ambiguous information, for example,

if you know that users don’t typically ﬁll in all of their user preferences

data. The team must work through this uncertainty, conducting user

research, cleaning the data, and determining how to create meaningful

## product recommendations in the absence of clear guidelines. This

# builds resilience and adaptability.

- 5. Anticipate novice thinking.

Anticipate the kinds of novice-level solutions that less experienced

employees might propose and construct the task in a way those

solutions will not work. For example, novices might initially suggest

using a simple rule-based system for product recommendations (e.g.,

if the user bought item A, recommend item B). However, the task

could be structured in a way that requires integrating machine

learning algorithms and cross-sell between diverse product categories

— something that a basic rule-based system could not achieve.

- 6. Deliberately suggest sub-optimal or failed strategies.

The manager might suggest that the team start by recommending only

## the most popular products to every user, even though this strategy

has been shown to result in poor user engagement and satisfaction

in previous iterations. This roadblock encourages the team to rethink

personalization and explore more nuanced, data-driven approaches

that take into account individual user preferences rather than relying

# on one-size-ﬁts-all methods.

- 7. Encourage exploration and manage the struggle.

Once the team encounters roadblocks, it is essential that managers

resist the temptation to step in and solve problems for them. The

struggle is where real learning happens, and employees should be

encouraged to collaborate and try diﬀerent architectures (e.g., neural

networks vs. decision trees) to ﬁnd a solution. This does not mean there is no feedback during the process. Instead, the feedback is to aﬃrm the

goal of learning task, assure psychological safety, and encourage greater

# exploration.

Such an explorative bent requires more time, but it also results in

## deeper learning and better and more innovative solutions in the longer

run. As a new manager, you need to design a longer development

# runway for your team.

# Holding a Debrief Session

The next crucial step is to transform the failures into valuable learning

through a feedback process. Often, there is no correct solution, so the

manager could compare the team’s novice solution to a more advanced,

successful approach. In such cases, you can examine the experts’

ways of approaching the problem, the strategies they’ve deployed,

or criteria they’ve used to evaluate success. This process allows

employees to internalize the nuances of expert thinking, assembling a

deeper understanding of why some strategies fail and others succeed.

Moreover, these in-depth debrief sessions aid in structuring a team

culture that embraces failure as a norm.

You can also ask some reﬂective questions to help turn failure into a

powerful learning experience. For example:

- What assumptions did you make when approaching the task?

- What seemed like the right solution initially? Why did that seem like

# the right solution?

- How did your approach diﬀer from expert methods, and what made

# the expert solution more eﬀective?

- What key insights can we take from this failure to apply to the next

# challenge?

Designing failure tasks is not about setting employees up to fail, it’s

about creating opportunities for them to explore, learn, and succeed in

the long run. Productive failure experiments intentionally design tasks

that challenge employees, allowing them to fail in a structured and

safe way that leads to growth. By carefully balancing performance and

learning goals, crafting tasks with built-in roadblocks, and fostering a

culture that views failure as a necessary step toward innovation, ﬁrst-

time managers can unlock the true potential of their teams.
