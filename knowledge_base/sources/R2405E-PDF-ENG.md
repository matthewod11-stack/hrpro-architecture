As the markets celebrate the success of gen-AI and green-tech

start-ups, many experts are urging established companies to emulate

those ventures by committing to radical innovation—by disrupting

themselves before someone else does. But for a lot of incumbent

companies, that’s just not a feasible strategy. Their owners don’t like

risk and won’t kill the goose that lays the golden egg. As a result large

enterprises end up defaulting to incremental innovation, perversely

increasing the chances that they’ll get upended.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Legacy Company’s Guide to Innovation

Incumbents don’t have to be caught in this trap. To the contrary,

when managed well, the innovation process can both leverage and

transform a company’s existing operations. Large ﬁrms have a diverse

## array of capabilities and resources they can share with entrepreneurial

partners—or with in-house entrepreneurial managers—that have ideas

for breakthrough products and services. They can create portfolios

## of projects and nurture each one until its chances of successfully

scaling up have become clear. This allows incumbents to stay at the

leading edge of innovation in their ﬁelds and expand into new ones

while greatly increasing the odds that their entrepreneurial partners (or

intrapreneurial managers) will succeed.

But as we’ll see in the following pages, this approach is complex and

nuanced. It requires careful management. To describe how ﬁrms can

eﬀectively apply it, we’ll draw on what we’ve learned by studying

the experiences of more than a dozen large multinationals, including

## the European ﬁrms Atlas Copco, Enel, and Epiroc. Their innovation

process, we have found, involves three essential phases: exploration,

commitment, and scaling up. Let’s look at each one in turn.

# Exploration: Find Your Start-Ups

Innovators often work for decades to tackle grand challenges and turn

visions of the future into reality. Many of those eﬀorts will end in

failure; only one or two will go on to change the world. Start-ups

are hardwired for this journey. They have the freedom and, when

supported by venture capital, the resources to pursue their ambitions

single-mindedly. As long as the prospective upside is worth the risk,

they willingly embrace their chances of failure.

Unfortunately, this model doesn’t work for the management and

stakeholders of established companies, which are designed to provide

existing goods and services reliably and to adapt to customer

preferences. Corporate governance and capital controls are in place

speciﬁcally to ensure this.

Those constraints drive many incumbents to adopt a limited innovation

strategy: focusing on incremental improvements to existing businesses

or collaborating with just one or two like-minded partners on pursuing

a narrow ambition. That can be dangerous. Consider what happened

when Blockbuster had the opportunity to buy the upstart DVD-by-mail

service Netﬂix for $50 million in 2000. Unable to see that home movie-

entertainment purchases could be more than impulse decisions focused

on hits, Blockbuster ﬂatly rejected it. Four years later Blockbuster

unsuccessfully attempted to launch its own DVD-by-mail service, and

in 2010 it ﬁled for bankruptcy.

The incumbent innovators we studied avoided Blockbuster’s fate by

following three practices in the ﬁrst stage of their journey:

Setting up multiple partnerships. Companies should prepare for

a variety of future scenarios and conduct numerous experiments

with start-ups. Many incumbents’ breakthroughs have emerged

## from collaborations with entrepreneurial ventures. Two well-known

examples are the Pﬁzer-BioNTech Covid-19 mRNA vaccine and

Microsoft-backed OpenAI’s generative AI.

For these partnerships to work, incumbents need to create value for

the young companies—by, say, helping them test their inventions

or giving them access to their clients—and reserve the right to a

stake in any success. For instance, large ﬁrms might ask start-ups

to agree to become suppliers or secure the right of ﬁrst refusal on

investments. Smart incumbents typically pay start-ups for their services

## but avoid signiﬁcant early equity investments, an approach that also

suits the start-ups because securing a large customer can help them

get VC funding. Critically, the size of any single commitment shouldn’t

preclude the incumbents from working with other partners.

To scout out promising ideas, the Italian energy giant Enel sets up

innovation centers and events through which it connects with start-ups

and small companies around the world. Each year Enel gets involved in

about 200 proof-of-concept tests, spanning projects in the entire value

chain for the energy sector. But it forgoes early-stage equity investments

in those projects so that it can focus on business results.

# Through the Enel Innovation Hub Europe

2018, the company discovered Aerones, a

Latvian start-up that uses automated

technology and robotics to do wind-turbine

maintenance. As wind turbines doubled in

height, they became more powerful, but

maintaining them became more complex

and dangerous, and operators needed a

way to handle that task more safely and eﬃciently. During the Enel Green Power

Gjon Mili was a pioneer of strobe and stop-action photography and rapid-fire sequencing techniques used to capture multiple exposures in one frame. His methods of por- traying movement led him to collab- orate with Pablo Picasso, who drew with light in this series for Life mag- azine in 1949.

Bootcamp later that year Enel started to

## plan proof-of-concept tests with Aerones.

After successful trials, Aerones began

operations in 2021. By early 2023 it had

secured $30 million in growth capital

outside Enel, which reassured Enel that it

would remain a robust supplier for years and helped Aerones meet

surging demand in a market that’s expected to reach $50 billion by 2028.

Using the start-up’s solution, Enel can inspect, maintain, and repair

## turbines six times faster and 40% more cheaply than conventional

solutions involving human technicians. Its success has inspired Enel to

begin deploying robotic technologies widely across its operations, using

# them in 16,000 kinds of activities.

Sometimes the entrepreneurial partner will come from within an

## incumbent’s ranks. Post-it Notes, PlayStation, Gmail, and Amazon

Web Services (AWS) are all famous homegrown innovations. AWS is

a particularly notable example. In 2003, Andy Jassy, who had been

with Amazon for six years, was made the head of the nascent division. Oﬃcially launched in 2006 with oﬀerings such as Simple Storage

Service and Elastic Compute Cloud, AWS quickly grew into the leader

in infrastructure cloud computing, becoming central to Amazon’s

## competitive advantage—and its key source of proﬁtability. The unit’s

success eventually propelled Jassy into the position of president and

# CEO of Amazon in late 2021.

Establish hubs. Smart incumbents create innovation hubs that help

venture teams connect to the company’s middle management and

front lines. The Enel hubs, for example, identify about 4,000 potential

collaboration opportunities each year, from which, as we’ve seen, some

200 proof-of-concept projects emerge. Unlike R&D units, accelerators,

and incubators, which tend to isolate innovation activities from regular

business activities, hubs are designed to spread new ideas throughout

an organization. Consider the start-up Nozomi Networks, which

provides cybersecurity to critical infrastructure. The ﬁrst version of its

cybersecurity product was based on the novel idea of identifying threats

by monitoring normal network behavior and spotting deviations, but

its founders struggled to ﬁnd a partner that was willing to try it out.

They had almost given up when they were introduced to an Enel hub

in 2014. The hub arranged for them to test their solution on the remote-

## control infrastructure of an Enel hydroelectric facility in Italy. That pilot

enabled Nozomi to implement improvements to the system, which were

then scaled up and applied to many of Enel’s industrial plants around

# the world.

Groom intrapreneurial talent. Hubs alone cannot drive innovation

through an organization. Operational management and the front line

also need to be motivated to support it. That’s why Atlas Copco,

## a Swedish-based global industrial equipment manufacturer, rewards

managers with major promotions when they experiment with new

business-model opportunities. That approach helps the company create

## a new generation of leaders with intrapreneurial instincts.

A good example of someone that Atlas Copco nurtured is Helena

Hedblom. After starting as a materials manager in the R&D department

of the Rock Drilling Tools division, she moved up the ladder, becoming

a vice president of R&D and later the general manager of a stand-alone

company within the group, Atlas Copco Secoroc AB. Like other general

managers, Hedblom had full responsibility for the business, which

gave her exposure to the many entrepreneurial challenges of running

a global unit, including driving operational excellence and innovation

and hitting stretch ﬁnancial targets. Eventually she became the CEO

## and president of the mining equipment company Epiroc, a subsidiary

that Atlas Copco spun oﬀ in 2018. In that role she continues to

blend leadership with innovation, overseeing several breakthroughs in

automated mining technologies that have signiﬁcantly boosted safety, productivity, and cost-eﬃciency.

# Commitment: Leverage Your Advantages

Once a venture yields a breakthrough, hopes and expectations begin

to soar. This is usually the point where incumbents start to rethink

their role and increase their commitment, often by making serious

investments in or acquiring start-ups. Though they want to ensure

they’re not overtaken by competitors or other entrants, incumbents also

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Legacy Company’s Guide to Innovation

need to be mindful that if they’re too quick to invest a lot of money in

expanding the new project, they may waste resources and consequently

lose the stakeholder support needed to see the innovation through.

Because of that, we sometimes call this phase of the innovation process

the “corridor of uncertainty.”

Instead of framing their commitment as an either-or investment

decision, smart incumbents see it as a carefully managed escalation of

their involvement. When working with start-ups, they will shift from a

## relatively loose, hands-oﬀ relationship to a more collaborative one. At

this stage they’ll help the smaller venture ﬁnd creative ways to remove

roadblocks and prepare to scale up.

To determine whether an innovation project has cleared all the hurdles

necessary for larger investment, the incumbent needs to address four

# questions:

Is the business model viable? Incumbents need to test each innovation,

asking, What will it do, how will we supply its production, and how will

we make a proﬁt with it? W.L. Gore & Associates, owner of the Gore-Tex

brand, did just that with Bionic Yarn, a start-up with a novel approach

for creating textile-grade recycled polymers from ocean-bound plastics,

much of which it gathers by working with coastal communities in Costa

Rica. The two partners had to ensure that the sourcing and quality

of the plastic was reliable, identify a manufacturer that could adapt

its facilities to produce the new textile on a large scale, and develop

a market strategy positioning it as a premium product to support the

higher price needed to cover the additional manufacturing costs. Today

## 50% of the material in the new Gore-Tex laminate with the recycled

textile is supplied through Bionic Yarn’s operations in Costa Rica, and

the outdoor apparel brand Patagonia has already begun using the textile

# in its parkas.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Legacy Company’s Guide to Innovation

Do we have an ecosystem that will support growth? The industrial-

scale rollout of an innovative oﬀering is likely to require a system

of complementary businesses, including component developers,

downstream distributors, and service partners. When Atlas Copco

started exploring the possibility of creating a remote-monitoring service

## for its equipment, in the late 1990s, the complementary controllers

and underpinning connectivity technology were nowhere near ready.

So the company collaborated with a Belgian start-up, Velleman, to

create a remote controller. Soon afterward it conducted another trial

with an Italian controller producer. Those collaborations led Atlas

Copco to launch AirConnect, which sent users SMS and email alerts

when machines shut down. The service was met with limited interest,

however: Ultimately only 2,500 pieces of equipment were outﬁtted with

AirConnect. But Atlas Copco persevered, collaborating with another

Belgian partner to develop a service that tracked the locations of

portable equipment with GPS and monitored its battery-power and

diesel levels. All those experiments prepared Atlas Copco for what was

to come: In 2013 it secured a global roaming contract with a telecom

partner, which facilitated the large-scale deployment of its new remote-

monitoring technology, Smartlink. By 2020, Atlas Copco had supplied

more than 100,000 pieces of equipment with remote monitoring, giving

## access to the service to most of its clients.

How ready are our customers to make purchases? While forecasts

based on historical extrapolations may work well for mature

technologies, they’re unreliable for emerging ones. It’s important,

therefore, to map the pools of potential customers to identify which

projects and partnerships to prioritize. The ability to do this is an

advantage incumbents have over most start-ups, particularly in a

business-to-business context. A case in point is Epiroc: It has partnered

with Northvolt to develop batteries for electric vehicles and other

equipment used in mining operations, which help slash costs and

emissions. Because of its deep industry experience, Epiroc is aware that

the potential customers have a multidecade planning cycle and tend

to be conservative about capital investments. But it also knows which

customers are likely to be early adopters. Epiroc and Northvolt have

been able to identify the customers that are most ready to electrify their

ﬂeets, which will involve both reﬁtting existing equipment and buying

new machines. By embedding Northvolt’s batteries in its equipment,

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Legacy Company’s Guide to Innovation

Epiroc has positioned itself as the go-to party for electrifying mining

# operations.

How can we win support from other stakeholders? Innovators often

lack the credibility to win over skeptical stakeholders and regulators.

With their established brands and reputations, incumbents are well

placed to tackle that challenge. Take Humira, a new fully human

monoclonal antibody discovered through a collaboration between

## BASF Bioresearch and Cambridge Antibody Technology. When Abbott

Laboratories, the incumbent that had acquired BASF, brought Humira

to market, in the early 2000s, it was one of several monoclonal

antibody treatments for rheumatoid arthritis. However, it was mired in

controversy because its potential side eﬀects were hard to isolate from

the progression of the disease. The Abbott team worked with patient

advocacy groups to raise awareness and debunk the treatment’s stigma.

This, of course, involved some competitive risk, since Abbott’s eﬀorts

would also make rival products more acceptable to consumers and

health care professionals. But the move positioned Humira as the go-to

# treatment for rheumatoid arthritis.

As the examples illustrate, incumbent strengths come to the fore

in the corridor of uncertainty. But the leadership team deciding

whether to make signiﬁcant investments needs to evaluate whether the

innovation team is answering the four questions with quality insights

and experimental evidence or merely with market chatter. That is the

only way to know if an innovation is truly ready to be scaled up.

# Getting to Scale: Move Fast

Once a new venture’s business model becomes viable and the interest

of a critical mass of users or customers is clear, the adoption of an

innovation tends to take oﬀ exponentially, accompanied by a frantic

race to market. So it’s vital for incumbents to be organized to rapidly

mobilize their resources and scale innovations up quickly.

At this stage investment is the only factor preventing a new venture

from realizing its full potential. While other obstacles may still crop up,

the risk of not committing is now greater than the risk of committing.

Unfortunately, at just this point incumbents often develop cold feet and

start bogging the new venture’s leadership team down with last-minute

questions and hurdles that hamper execution. This is particularly

common in R&D-intensive industries with high downstream costs,

such as the semiconductor industry, where ﬁrms make signiﬁcant

R&D investments and establish partnerships but then switch rapidly

from seeking opportunity to avoiding risk. This change in direction is

particularly hard to counter if the incumbent company has room to

grow in the market, because investing in innovation inevitably appears

# riskier in comparison.

## The delays from this late-stage hesitation result, most obviously, in

missing an opportunity to become the market leader. A less obvious

but more fundamental downside is the loss of talent. Young executives

who are eager to take action may not wait for top managers to make up

their minds and may instead jump to faster-moving competitors.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Legacy Company’s Guide to Innovation

Four actions can help leadership teams of incumbent ventures avoid

obstacles to scaling up:

Make the CFO a direct stakeholder. As guardians of shareholders’ interests, chief ﬁnancial oﬃcers are predisposed to be cautious about

investing in innovation. They also may not be accustomed to making

decisions based on innovation metrics and leading indicators, such as

daily active users. But if CFOs are brought into the conversation from

the beginning, they become more comfortable with those measures

and with the qualitative data used to evaluate innovation projects.

As a consequence, they tend to be more inclined to “leverage the

balance sheet” to ensure future competitiveness. At both Epiroc and

## Atlas Copco, early involvement by the CFO in major projects—and

## by business controllers in smaller ones—is common. The successful

## acquisition of an environmentally focused vacuum business, the

Edwards Group, by Atlas Copco is a case in point. The move to buy

this innovative business, which was still in the early stages of growth,

was spearheaded by Atlas Copco’s CFO, Hans Ola Meyer. Meyer was well

prepared to assess the risks because he stepped in not when the M&A

decision was being considered but much earlier in the journey, when

the company ﬁrst started testing the viability of the vacuum business.

His understanding of it allowed him to balance the risks of buying it

against the opportunity costs of not doing so.

Pitch a conservative case to the board. Just as a start-up must

build a business case for its investors, the CEO of an incumbent

needs to construct a compelling argument for investing in scaling up

a new venture for the shareholders’ representative, the board. That

requires crafting strategies for leveraging the existing business and its

competitive advantages and hedging against its disruption. Let’s look

at the acquisition of the Edwards Group more closely. During the early

days of evaluating the opportunity, the directors of Atlas Copco voiced

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Legacy Company’s Guide to Innovation

skepticism; they thought the cyclical nature of its primary customers’

business, semiconductor manufacturing, could make sales volatile. So

when ﬁnally seeking approval for the deal, one of us, Ronnie, who was

then the CEO of Atlas Copco, opted to present to the board a moderate

## and reliable growth scenario rather than a highly promising outlook

based on more-speculative evidence. Satisﬁed that their concerns had

been recognized, the directors green-lighted the acquisition, which the

company then turned into an exponential growth opportunity.

Beware the differentiation and synergy traps. Incumbents and their

start-up partners often struggle to let go of product or service features

that don’t scale up well and to prioritize speed over cost synergies.

Once exponential growth starts, they need to avoid those traps. Epiroc

learned to prioritize scale over “nice to have” features when creating

## the service business model for its mining equipment business in the

mid-2010s. For instance, while some fully customized solutions may

have been helpful during the earlier stages of development, once the

scaling phase commenced, Epiroc pivoted to oﬀering solutions that

were replicable across a wide range of customers. Atlas Copco opted to

rapidly grow its service business by giving it autonomy, which meant it

couldn’t share costs with the product side of the company. That decision

was consistent with the general approach the company has taken ever

since the 1980s, when it chose to be organized by product divisions.

As a result, innovation projects, whether developed in-house or with

entrepreneurial partners, either become separate divisions or business

lines or are spun out.

Put an entrepreneur in charge. An entrepreneurial mindset is critical

for driving innovation and overcoming organizational inertia. If you

have already partnered with a start-up, then its founder is the obvious

candidate, especially if that person has a track record in getting

new businesses oﬀ the ground. If the venture is homegrown, a likely

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Legacy Company’s Guide to Innovation

candidate will be the manager who brought you the idea, but that

person must be capable of motivating others to join the ride and very

entrepreneurial in outlook. When Ronnie was looking for a leader to

grow a new service subsidiary at Atlas Copco, he recognized those

two traits in a young executive, Nico Delvaux. After he was appointed

president of the compressor service division, in 2009, Delvaux scaled

## up a physical service business and then a digital service business, later

becoming president of the construction business area. He eventually

moved on to become the CEO of two multinational companies.

Unfortunately, corporate leaders capable of building a new business,

rather than just managing an existing one, are few and far between,

which means that you may have to look outside for one. That isn’t easy

and can be expensive, but it’s often necessary.

. . .

As we have shown, large companies can play a critical role in bringing

groundbreaking ideas to life. While incumbents may lack the creative

## spark of classic entrepreneurial ventures, they can partner with them.

As the ventures develop, they can carefully increase their support and

shape the projects to leverage their resources and better suit their

customers’ needs. Once a new business begins to take oﬀ, incumbents

have the capital, resources, and capabilities to grow it rapidly. Although

the entrepreneurial mantra “move fast and break things” may not be

suitable for incumbents, “collaborate and scale up quickly” works very

well for them—and can unlock underexploited sources of value.
