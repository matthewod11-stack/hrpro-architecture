When you’re feeling behind on tasks and pressed against deadlines,

catching up with and connecting with colleagues is about the last thing

you feel like doing. You just want to put your head down, check oﬀ tasks

on your to-do list, and get things done.

There are absolutely times when you should put on blinders and

focus solely on your tactical objectives. But exclusively interacting in

a transactional manner with your coworkers could cause you to lose

any sense of personal connection, especially if you work remotely. By

taking even a few minutes each day to foster a sense of rapport at work,

you could unlock the key to a greater sense of purpose and well-being,

reduce burnout, and even improve your performance.

So how do you make time for people without feeling more stressed and

overwhelmed? As a time management coach, I’ve seen that with just a

little more intention, you can make much more meaningful connections

without investing much time.

# Chat in One-on-One Meetings

If you already have one-on-one meetings scheduled with your team,

take a few minutes at the start of the discussion to ﬁnd out how they’re

doing before jumping to the business agenda. You don’t need to spend

the whole time on personal updates, but even reserving ﬁve minutes

to ask about their recent vacation, ﬁnd out if their mom is out of the

hospital, or to see how they’re recovering from surgery can make a

# diﬀerence.

You can use the same strategy for one-on-one meetings with colleagues

who you regularly work with on projects. Depending on the length of

the meeting and how much you need to cover, you may not have time

to catch up each time. But if every few meetings you use a few minutes

at the beginning or end to talk about more than the projects at hand,

you can strengthen those ties. This could include bonding over your

excitement about a particular sports team, talking about your families,

or discussing anything else that gives you space to connect beyond a

# one-dimensional, task-oriented level.

If remembering details about people’s lives doesn’t come naturally

to you, make a private note in your calendar with memory cues,

such as asking them about their new puppy, about their kids’ latest

extracurriculars, or how their side venture is going.

# Encourage Group Sharing During Meetings

In a large team meeting, there won’t be much space for personal

catchups. But if you have a smaller team, it may be appropriate to

take some time on a weekly or monthly basis for updates. This could

be as simple as a quick share at the beginning of a meeting about a

recent event, such as attending an industry conference. This can also

happen organically if you work in person and have a speciﬁc forum

designated for it: for example, if you bring in coﬀee and bagels on

Monday mornings and have breakfast together, or if there’s a Friday

afternoon happy hour. Even 15 to 20 minutes of unstructured talk can

## lead to a greater sense of team engagement.

If you’re part of a remote or hybrid team, it may be harder to connect

organically. Consider hosting a virtual happy hour or have a few people

share during a team meeting. Just keep these updates short so that the

highs and lows don’t turn into a viral meme.

# Turn Breaks into Informal Social Time

Grab a bite to eat with colleagues over your lunch break. Your meeting

schedule may not allow a proper lunch break every day, but blocking out

at least a couple of days a week where you’re not multi-tasking at your

computer can make your lunch more enjoyable and more social. This

could be planned out in advance, where you meet up with someone in

another department who you don’t get to see often, or it could be more

informal with a team member who works right by you. If you’d like to

have a relaxed approach, simply ask someone if they want to join you

when you’re heading out the door or reheating your leftovers.

## Social breaks can also eﬀectively combat mental fatigue in the mid-

afternoon slump and help you feel refreshed for the ﬁnal work stretch

before you’re done for the day. When you notice your eye lids drooping and your head bobbing, stand up and get moving. If you’re in the oﬃce,

this is an excellent time to walk the halls and connect with a few people

or invite someone to grab a cup of coﬀee. Similar to lunch, you can stop

by to chat with members of your own team or drop in on a diﬀerent

department. The movement and conversation will wake you up and

## serve as a time of connection and potentially internal networking. If

you’re working remotely, send a friendly Slack message to a colleague,

rather than turning to scroll social media. Even if they’re too busy to

respond, they may oﬀer to catch up with you later.

# Make Calls During Your Commute

If you commute into the oﬃce or travel for business, some of your

travel times could oﬀer an ideal opportunity to catch up in an informal

manner with colleagues. One of my clients who was an executive with

a packed meeting schedule used his drive home to reach out and have

informal conversations with his leaders. This helped him get a more

personal view on their thoughts and concerns, as the company was

going through a major transition.

When you’re on the road, you can call from airports, Ubers, or hotels

or send messages when you’re waiting in lines or on trains. Even a

ﬁve- to 10-minute conversation can increase your rapport and, most

importantly, show that you care.

# Take Advantage of Virtual Messaging

If you’re working exclusively remotely, the options for informal social

connection will be limited. In these cases, you can simply send a quick

chat message or text asking how someone is doing or share a quick

# update with them.

These conversations can end up taking a lot of time if you’re not

conscious of how long they go, so you’ll want to limit how frequently

you engage in purely social messaging. But reaching out a few times a

week can be fun and help you feel connected. Consider pinging people

at natural times when you would have said “Hello!” to coworkers in the

past, such as when you ﬁrst get to your desk, around lunch, or when

you’re waiting for a meeting to start.

It can be a challenge to ﬁnd time to talk with people when you barely

feel like you have time for completing tasks and projects. But there are

beneﬁts to connecting with your coworkers. Rather than keeping your

head down and focusing only on work, ﬁnd those pockets of time in

your schedule where you can thoughtfully connect with colleagues.
