From investment committees weighing major capital expenditures to

R&D stage gate reviews, organizations rely on committees to make

high-stakes go/no-go decisions. The logic seems sound: Bring together

diverse expertise and viewpoints, and one will identify comprehensive

solutions to help make high-stakes decisions.

Yet, while assembling the “right people” in the room is necessary for

solid decision-making, it is only the ﬁrst step. Even the most qualiﬁed

experts can fail to share crucial insights. This is because committee

dynamics and unwritten norms can discourage open disclosure, leaving

critical information and dissent trapped inside individuals’ heads,

never making it into the collective discussion. From self-censorship, to

interpreting silence as agreement, to the suppression of dissent, groups

of experts routinely struggle to surface the information needed during

discussions to make a sound decision. The result is a graveyard of

## spectacular and catastrophic misjudgments, from the Challenger Space

## Shuttle disaster to the Bay of Pigs invasion.

Why do committees often fail at surfacing pertinent information? And

how can their fates be reversed?

Our research on the Food and Drug Administration’s Advisory

Committees reveals that not only is who sits at the table important,

but also how the committee process is structured. Simple changes to

committee protocols can fundamentally shape the incentives to share

information, dramatically improving decision quality and unlocking

# collective intelligence.

# Why Committees Fail

Despite the many advantages that committees bring, decision-making

groups are known to face several challenges in surfacing and processing

information. At the core are cognitive, psychological, and social costs to

sharing the information that is privately held by individual members of

the committee. All these challenges stem from a common root: sharing

## unique information incurs signiﬁcant costs to the individual.

Cognitive costs. Our human cognitive limits often make the sharing of

private information less likely. This is because unique, or “unshared,”

data often requires greater cognitive eﬀort to recall and articulate—

especially when its relevance to the current discussion is uncertain. The

result is that individuals in groups naturally gravitate toward shared

and common information as it is easier to retrieve, validate, and discuss.

This bias toward the “easily available” can lead teams to privilege

# redundancy over discovery.

Psychological costs. Sharing private information introduces a form of

psychological vulnerability that individuals prefer to avoid. Voicing a

divergent viewpoint or raising a previously unmentioned concern risks

being wrong—or worse, it may be perceived as out of sync with the

group. This phenomenon, known as evaluation apprehension, can be

## especially acute in hierarchical or high-status teams where mistakes

carry reputational and career penalties. Individuals may self-censor not

because they lack valuable insights, but because the psychological toll

## of potential judgment or dismissal outweighs the perceived beneﬁts of

# contributing.

Social costs. The social dynamics of group settings may further

discourage the introduction of unshared information. Groups tend

to reward consensus and cohesion, creating subtle pressures that

reinforce conformity. Discussing commonly held knowledge helps build

rapport and reinforces a sense of alignment, while injecting new or

contradictory data can feel disruptive. Social motivations like mutual enhancement, where members gain credibility by aﬃrming shared

understanding, can lead to a cycle where members seek validation over

## accuracy. In such environments, the very norms that foster harmony

may also suppress the diversity of thought necessary for rigorous

# decision-making.

When committee processes fail to actively encourage the surfacing of

diverse perspectives, participants naturally default to safer behaviors:

discussing what everyone already knows, seeking consensus, and

minimizing personal risk by limiting contributions. These failures are

not inevitable consequences of group decision-making. Rather, they are

predictable outcomes of ﬂawed committee design. As our research on

the FDA shows, subtle changes in how committees operate can lead to

powerful improvements in information sharing, unlocking the genuine

potential of the collective expertise assembled in the committee.

# A Simple Change in the Voting Protocol

## As part of its regulatory authority, the FDA convenes Advisory

Committees (AdComs) to assist its decision-making. These AdComs

are expert panels whose purview includes evaluating new drugs

and medical devices, and making recommendations on product

approvals before they enter the U.S. market. For example, in December

2020, the Vaccines and Related Biological Products AdCom met to

## discuss Emergency Use Authorization for the Pﬁzer-BioNTech Covid-19

Vaccine. Given the consequential nature of the recommendations, a

typical AdCom meeting lasts a full day, with the vast majority of time

spent on presenting, scrutinizing, and debating data and evidence on the product’s safety and eﬃcacy. Following these extensive discussions,

the meeting typically culminates in a vote of the AdCom’s conﬁdence in

# the product.

In 2007, the FDA made a seemingly minor procedural change to the

way its AdComs operated. Prior to the change, post-discussion voting

was typically conducted in a sequential manner: each committee

member would visibly and audibly cast their vote and explain their

position in turn, one after the other. After the change, voting was to be

## simultaneous: members would all vote at the same time, and only after

voting closed would they go around to reveal their votes.

The FDA’s stated goal with the change was to mitigate the possibility

that members were “herding.” When voting happens sequentially, early

votes can initiate a bandwagon eﬀect and unduly inﬂuence voters later

in the voting order. By contrast, simultaneous voting eliminates this

possibility, freeing each member to render an independent judgment

based on their unique perspective.

This procedural change created a powerful quasi-experiment for us to

study committee dynamics. We analyzed over 500 verbatim meeting

transcripts before and after the voting protocol change using natural

## language processing techniques and linguistic analysis. What we

discovered oﬀers valuable lessons for any organization that relies on

committees to make important decisions.

## Better Discussions, More Dissenting Voices, and Better Decisions

## After the implementation of simultaneous voting, FDA AdComs

exhibited a substantial decline in unanimous voting outcomes: the

proportion of unanimous committee recommendations decreased from

45% to 27%. This shift appears to reﬂect the FDA’s intended goal

of reducing “herding” behavior and promoting greater independence

# among members.

Our analysis reveals a more nuanced explanation. In fact, the decrease

in unanimous voting outcomes was primarily driven by concurrent

changes in discussion content and dynamics. By applying a word

embedding model to analyze the meeting transcripts, we see that under

the new voting procedure, committees tended to discuss a greater

breadth of topics. In other words, the experts were more likely to

share their private information, and the committee discussion tended

to scrutinize the problem more comprehensively. Because committee

members now explored the issue from multiple, fresh angles, they

unearthed previously hidden insights. Those fresh perspectives and the

surfacing of unshared data translated directly into a wider distribution

## of viewpoints and, therefore, vote outcomes.

Why did discussions change so markedly? By removing the possibility

of viewing their peers’ leanings before voting, the revised protocol

realigned individual incentives towards engaging in information

sharing and fact ﬁnding. Without the possibility to glean other

members’ votes before having to cast their own, the experts now had

a stronger motivation to probe, share their own privately-held data, and

## test assumptions throughout the discussion.

We further investigated what kinds of behaviors drove this expansion

in discussion breadth and found clear evidence that experts actively

changed their interaction patterns. Members began to “pull” more

information from one another by purposefully directing a higher

proportion of questions to peers. They also redistributed speaking time

more evenly amongst themselves, and they adopted language that felt

## authentic, positive, and free of status-laden cues. These behavioral

shifts and changes in linguistic patterns ultimately helped reduce

the psychological and social costs typically associated with oﬀering

unshared or dissenting information, encouraging a richer and more

# open exchange of ideas.

Importantly, these changes also translated into better decisions. After

the change in voting protocols, drugs recommended for approval by the

AdComs were signiﬁcantly less likely to be associated with post-market boxed warnings or full withdrawals due to safety or eﬃcacy concerns.

In other words, the AdComs made more sound recommendations as to

which products should be allowed in the market.

In sum, a simple procedural change altered the incentives for

individuals to overcome the “costs” and expend the eﬀort needed

for solid discussions, triggering a cascade of behavioral adaptations.

By removing early visibility of peer votes, experts compensated

by proactively uncovering one another’s views during discussion.

This led to greater information revelation which, more than voting

independence alone, appears to underlie the improvement in decision-

making performance.

# Towards Better Group Decision-Making

Organizations seeking to improve the quality of their collective

judgments must look beyond selecting expert participants. They

need deliberate mechanisms that motivate members to surface and

## assimilate diverse insights, challenge assumptions, and collaborate

constructively. Our research oﬀers three key insights to structuring

# group meetings:

## Focus on committee process, not just outcomes. Eﬀective committee

decision-making depends not only on who is in the room, but on

whether the meeting structure encourages members to contribute

their knowledge fully. A key insight from our research is that how

meetings are run (especially the incentives embedded in procedures

like voting protocols) shapes how deeply members engage, share private

information, and seek out diverse perspectives. Too often, organizations

focus on the decision outcome while overlooking the mechanics that

produce it. This leads to focus on achieving consensus and moving on.

But sustainable decision quality hinges on creating protocols that lower

barriers to contribution and encourage learning.

## Address status and communication barriers head-on. In high-

performing committees, we found more balanced speaking time

and greater use of language that promoted fact-ﬁnding and sharing

of viewpoints. These features are not accidental: they reﬂect

an environment where psychological safety is actively cultivated.

Leaders play a key role here. They must monitor and manage

participation patterns, encourage genuine engagement, and positively

reinforce contributions that challenge the consensus or introduce new

information. When members feel safe to speak and are invited to

question each other, they are more likely to surface unshared insights

# critical to robust decisions.

## Structure pre-vote discussions deliberately, and adopt simultaneous

## voting. The richest moments of value creation in group decisions

happen before the vote, when diverse viewpoints collide, overlap,

and cohere into a shared understanding. Encourage committee

members to direct questions to one another. One surprisingly powerful

tactic is to implement simultaneous voting using electronic buttons,

which prevents members from seeing how others vote in real-time.

Unlike the common practice of going around the room round-robin,

## simultaneous voting reduces social inﬂuence and “herding” eﬀects.

When participants know they must form an independent judgment,

they engage more actively during discussion. Our research shows this

simple procedural change can signiﬁcantly enhance the quality of

# collective decisions.

You cannot guarantee perfect group decisions. But, you can stack the

deck by deliberately engineering processes that incentivize candor,

# curiosity, and critical challenge.
