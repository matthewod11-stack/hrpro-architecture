Whether to disclose your long Covid, or any other nonapparent

condition or disability, to your employer is a deeply personal

and consequential decision. While disclosing may help you access

accommodations, it carries risks stemming from stigma and ableism.

You might get support, but you might also be met with suspicion,

resentment, and accusations of making it all up.

Consider a composite case study. Ali developed long Covid while

working at an international consulting company. He worried about

disclosing it at work, but symptoms including extreme fatigue and

dizziness were interfering with his travel for in-person projects.

He eventually conﬁded in the department head, who made

accommodations, assigning Ali to remote consulting and research

# projects.

However, even though Ali contributed extra work and ensured his

output was impeccable, coworkers began to make snide remarks,

perhaps resenting that they had to travel while he did not. When a new

department head came in, colleagues upped their complaints about Ali

being a “ﬂake,” and when he disclosed his illness to the new manager,

he was met with a suspicion of faking it. The additional stress caused

Ali’s health issues to ﬂare and he was ultimately forced to resign.

Unfortunately, research indicates it’s not rare for a disability disclosure

to lead to accusations of faking and other negative attitudes, both

conscious and unconscious. Many studies have also documented high

## rates of workplace bullying and stigmatization of disabled people.

(Note: disability communities generally favor identity-ﬁrst language.)

As an autistic woman (misdiagnosed, like many, with depression for

much of my life), I’ve navigated various disclosure options and fear

of mental health stigma for over 25 years while also encountering

additional, more physical challenges. In most work settings I haven’t

disclosed or asked for accommodations, relying instead on job matching

and job crafting to use my strengths to excel. Successful matching

meant that I faced misalignment between my work and abilities

oﬀers that didn’t come with access to quiet space, natural light, or

# hybrid work.

When I do disclose my health needs, most people are considerate, but

some have laughed in my face, dismissed the information, or even used

it against me. I’ve learned many lessons the hard way, and over time

stopped trying to blend in and have become increasingly open. In the

last several years this “radical disclosing” has taken the form of autism,

neuroinclusion, and disability advocacy via social media. I write on

## topics of neurodiversity and disability at work in both academic and

# general forums.

In this article I’ll discuss why disclosure is a risk, how to decide whether

it’s one worth taking, and how a network of supporters at work can help

you minimize the potential downsides.

# Deciding Whether to Disclose

Unfortunately, disclosing a disability or neurodivergence information is

often a “damned if you do, damned if you don’t” situation. Research

shows that 61% of disabled employees have experienced some form of

workplace discrimination, including hiring biases, pay gaps, bullying,

## and mistreatment. And when people with nonapparent conditions

share their struggles, they often get a “You look ﬁne” response, adding

to their reluctance to disclose.

Ableism, or the belief that a disability makes a person inferior to or less

valuable than others, can lead to discrimination and exclusion. While

## hostile ableism manifests in rude treatment and bullying, benevolent

ableism — a form of paternalistic bias — may result in people limiting

others’ opportunities for participation and professional development

to “protect” them. For example, the boss of a disabled employee may

assume the person will face resentment if promoted, and withhold

information about leadership development opportunities “for their own

good” — taking away the employee’s choice. Regardless of motivation,

both hostile and benevolent ableism can undermine a person’s career.

## Legislation such as the United States’ Americans with Disabilities

## Act (ADA), Australia’s Disability Discrimination Act 1992, and other

countries’ equivalents can somewhat protect a disabled employee

from blatant discrimination, such as being ﬁred speciﬁcally because

of their condition. But it does not prevent more insidious forms

of mistreatment, such as gossip, social exclusion, being assigned an

impossible workload, or being excluded from professional development

# and advancement opportunities.

How can you determine whether it makes sense to disclose your

condition at work? Here are the key steps.

Clarify your priorities. Disclosure involves many uncertainties since you

can’t control others’ reactions and biases. Rather than attempting to

predict how people will feel, tie your decision-making to your personal

guiding principles. To start, ﬁgure out your nonnegotiable needs for

your health and well-being. A few questions can help:

- 1. What are the health risks? Ask yourself, “Is continuing to work

without necessary accommodations risking my health, safety, or

# energy levels?”

- 2. What are the career risks? Ask, “What’s the worst that could happen

if I face ableism, and how does it compare to the potential risks of not

advocating for my needs?”

- 3. What are your essential needs? Ask, “What’s core to my survival and

to maintaining a basic quality of life?”

Once you’ve identiﬁed your key needs, look for alternative ways to meet

them in case your work situation does not improve or your disclosure

backﬁres. Ask yourself, “What other sources of support or earnings

have I not considered?” This could involve exploring job roles with the

## necessary accommodations or alternative income sources.

It’s hard to see all the options when you’re stressed; a friend, a family

member, or a trusted colleague can provide new perspectives. Ask them,

“Can you see alternative solutions I might have missed?” or “How would

you approach this situation?”

Weigh the pros and cons of disclosure. With your priorities and backup

plan in mind, consider the pros and cons of disclosing your condition

in your current job. Here are some typical ones; the odds of speciﬁc

outcomes may depend on organizational culture and power holders.

# Pros:

- Legal protection from blatant discrimination

- Opportunity to openly discuss health-related needs and proactively

# manage symptoms

- Access to accommodations

- Potential for a supportive workplace environment

- Potentially higher likelihood of maintaining employment

# Cons:

- Risk of stigma and subtler forms of discrimination and exclusion

- Privacy concerns about medical information

- Coworker envy, resentment, and bullying in response to

# accommodations

- Uncertainty about how disclosure will be received

- Potential bias from supervisors or coworkers

- Potentially lower likelihood of advancement

- Possible obstacles to professional development

## HBR / The Big Idea / How to Weigh the Risks of Disclosing a Disability

Consider your timing. There are also pros and cons to when to disclose.

For example, while job candidates are not required to disclose during the hiring process, many hiring managers feel aﬀronted by a lack of

disclosure. And yet many hiring managers also discriminate against

# disabled applicants.

There is no one-size-ﬁts-all advice here. Many people believe that

disclosing early allows them to live according to their values and to ﬁlter

out organizations that might be a poor ﬁt. At the same time, others lack

the economic safety net to allow for a prolonged job search.

Think about these factors for diﬀerent timing options:

# In the application or cover letter:

- Pros: Allows the employer to prepare for accommodations

- Cons: May harm your chances of getting to demonstrate your

capabilities and be hired

# During the hiring process:

- Pros: Gives you an opportunity to address questions about your

# condition

- Cons: Risks drawing attention away from your strengths and abilities;

risks lowering your chances of getting the position

After getting an offer or being hired, but before beginning work:

- Pros: Possibly provides you with legal recourse if the hiring decision

# changes unjustly

- Cons: Employer may distrust you for not disclosing earlier

After beginning work:

- Pros: Gives you an opportunity to establish your competence before

disclosing

- Cons: May cause you anxiety about your ability to perform without

accommodations; potentially harms your health due to working

without needed accommodations; employer potentially has a negative

# reaction to the delayed disclosure

After a problem arises, when new job requirements are introduced, or when your need for accommodations becomes clear:

- Pros: Gives you an opportunity to prove your capabilities before

disclosing

- Cons: Potentially harms your health due to working without needed

accommodations; employer potentially has a negative reaction to the

delayed disclosure

# Never:

- Pros: Reduces the risk of discrimination based on stigma • Cons: Increases your risk of being ﬁred or suﬀering other adverse actions if your disability impacts your performance; potentially harms

your health due to working without needed accommodations

Your decision about timing may depend on the extent of your need for

accommodations and whether you have the resources to continue a job

search until you ﬁnd a disability-inclusive company. Your desire to help

normalize disability and disclosure may also come into play.

But what if you develop health issues while employed and need to

disclose, but are worried about the employer’s lack of understanding?

The next strategy can help reduce the risks.

# Creating a Network of Disclosure

People often want to disclose just to one person — maybe their

supervisor or someone in HR — and only if they must. But as Ali’s story

earlier in the article illustrates, having limited support can backﬁre.

What happens if that person leaves your team or company?

## HBR / The Big Idea / How to Weigh the Risks of Disclosing a Disability

Creating a network of disclosure — in other words, disclosing your

condition to two or more people — can be a part of the solution, though

it may sound counterintuitive. After all, doesn’t it increase your chances

of experiencing bias? Possibly, but it can also increase the chances you’ll

get the support you need, and research shows that people who make a

commitment known to others are more likely to keep that commitment.

If your accommodations are discussed with your manager, HR, and the

accessibility oﬃcer, any one party will have a harder time going back on

# their word.

Caution is advisable because it’s not always possible to predict how

people will react to your disclosure. Your friendly supervisor may end up showing a cold and suspicious side, but a gruﬀ coworker

could turn into your staunchest champion. So, much like when you

took stock of your guiding priorities, start with the basics. Consider

your organization’s overall culture and standard procedures. Are there

policies or practices in place to assist disabled employees? Are there any

examples of people who received help for health issues? If so, can you

ﬁnd out which units and individuals were most considerate of them?

Then, decide who to reach out to. Here are the people and groups you

might look to for support, albeit with downsides for some:

Your manager. Disclosing your health challenges allows your manager

to better understand your needs and provide accommodations that

contribute to your well-being and productivity. These could include

ﬂexible work arrangements, aligning your assignments and tasks with

your abilities, or access to assistive technology. Disclosure could also

help build trust and open the door for better communication. In most

cases, it’s important to have your manager as part of your disclosure

network. That said, not all managers are equipped to support employee

disability needs; this is why a network of other potential advocates

might be necessary.

Human resources. Discussing your health challenges with HR usually

maximizes the likelihood that your rights under disability laws like the

ADA will be protected. In many organizations, HR is best positioned

to provide guidance on available accommodations and resources.

Unfortunately, in others HR accommodation procedures are extremely

diﬃcult to navigate; getting assistance from some of the oﬃces below

might be useful.

Accessibility ofﬁce. At some organizations, ensuring that work

environments meet employees’ needs is the responsibility of a separate

oﬃce. The accessibility oﬃce or oﬃcer can help you navigate

the accommodation process, ensure that your needs are addressed promptly and eﬀectively, and provide resources and guidance.

DEI or DEIA ofﬁces. While disability is not always prominent among

DEI (diversity, equity, and inclusion) initiatives, it is a form of diversity,

and disability inclusion is a DEI responsibility. The DEI team can serve

as an advocate and ally to promote your well-being and professional

growth. This is particularly likely if your DEI oﬃce is explicitly

responsible for “A,” the accessibility part of DEIA.

Coworkers. Disclosing your health challenges to at least some of

your colleagues allows them to understand any accommodations or

adjustments you may need, and this understanding may help them

develop a more empathetic perspective. Sharing your experiences with coworkers can also create a network of allies who can oﬀer support

when needed.

Disability employee resource group. An employee resource group (ERG)

can connect you with a community of peers who understand your experiences and can oﬀer empathy, guidance, and encouragement. It

provides a safe space to share your concerns; work through any feelings

of anxiety, self-doubt, or shame associated with internalized ableism;

and develop a positive identity around disability, chronic illness,

or neurodivergence. Some ERGs also help organizational leadership

improve accessibility and accommodation processes and otherwise

# advocate for inclusion.

Outside disability organizations. These can range from national to

local, and from formal associations to informal groups. Participating

in them can validate your experiences, help you feel less alone,

and provide many practical tips. For example, the American Lung

Association has online mutual care communities, including one for long

Covid, and the Long Covid Alliance provides links to a variety of support

# groups.

Having the backing of your manager, HR, an ERG, and/or multiple

colleagues can provide a much stronger foundation for building a

## positive work environment despite your health challenges. In some

cases you may also consider a “radical” disclosure (such as educating

colleagues about your condition in a meeting, explaining how it impacts

your communication in your email signature, or “coming out” via social

media) to both live out your authentic identity at work and help reduce the stigma surrounding health diﬀerences. While not without risk,

radical disclosure can expand your network in ways that prevent the

potentially catastrophic consequences of losing a sole supporter.

# Focus on Strengths

If you decide to disclose a medical condition or a disability, the next

step often involves working with your manager, team, or organization

to develop a strengths-based plan for your work. The plan should be

tailored to what you do best and what you can do well regardless of

# health challenges.

A comprehensive ﬂexibility framework that I created suggests aligning

what people do with their strengths and how they do it with their

health needs and energy levels. Rather than focusing on deﬁcits, this

approach calls for focusing on what people can do (for example, working

on project planning versus attending client meetings, or negotiating

over the phone versus doing it in person). Here’s what comprehensive

ﬂexibility might look like when applied to a dynamic disability such as

## long Covid or many mental health conditions:

- 1. Identify the individual’s strengths and what they can do with or

# without accommodations.

- 2. Match their strengths to speciﬁc tasks and responsibilities.

- 3. Ensure access to professional development, accommodations, or tools

as needed.

- 4. Provide maximum ﬂexibility in how and when the work is done.

- 5. Evaluate, reassess, and adjust as needed.

A version of this approach can even be used by entrepreneurs or self-

employed people who are managing themselves. Some adjustments

might be more substantial than others, but a strengths-based, ﬂexible

approach to work can be a foundation for building a rewarding and

productive career even while dealing with health challenges.

Of course, organizations have an important role in helping all talent

thrive. Principles for developing ﬂexible organizations and examples of eﬀectively overcoming barriers to disability inclusion are described in

more detail in my HBR article “The Radical Promise of Truly Flexible

Work” and my book, The Canary Code: A Guide to Neurodiversity,

## Dignity, and Intersectional Belonging at Work.

. . .

I’m still ﬁne-tuning my own approach to disclosure. As of this writing

my neurodivergence is radically shared with the world, but with more- physical diﬀerences I am using a network of disclosure at work. Both

strategies seem to be working much better than the “quietly pushing

through” approach, which on several occasions has led me to the

dangerous extreme of overworking while trying to prove myself. They

also work better than disclosing only to a supervisor.

You may follow a similar path, or you may not. Disclosure decisions

are deeply personal. But it’s important for all of us to remember: Our

worth and human dignity far surpass our ability to perform speciﬁc

tasks. The responsibility for ableist behavior lies on those who exhibit it

— not on us. Our health should come before having to prove ourselves

to others. Advocating for inclusive workplaces isn’t just about securing

accommodations; it’s about creating organizations where every person

is valued for their unique talents, experience, and insights. And we all

can do our part by validating each other’s experiences and believing

# each other.
