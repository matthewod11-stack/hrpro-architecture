As technology like generative AI reshapes the workplace, it’s easy to

assume that pursuing greater technical competence will help ensure

a long and lucrative career. Additionally, by this logic, ﬁrms should

be searching for those with specialized knowledge when seeking to

ﬁll entry level roles amid a tough market. But according to our

## new research, foundational skills—like collaboration, mathematical

thinking, and adaptability—may prove much more important for both

# individuals and companies.

In our new study, we analyzed large-scale U.S. data on over 1,000

occupations across industries from 2005 to 2019, including 70 million

job transitions, capturing hundreds of skills. We organized skills into

foundational skills (including reading comprehension, basic math skills,

and the ability to work well in teams) and more specialized, advanced

skills (for example, competence with blockchain). We examined how

people’s skills changed and developed over time, and over the course of

# their careers.

We found that those who scored highly on basic skills were more

likely to earn higher wages throughout their careers, move into

more advanced roles, learn specialized skills more quickly, and were

more resilient to industry changes. The presence and development of

foundational skills didn’t just make workers more competitive for entry

level jobs—they determined how far they could climb the career ladder.

## Foundational Skills Help Raise a Worker’s Ceiling

To help leaders understand the full value of these skills, we also

examined the ways they shape long-term performance, adaptability,

and advancement. Our study found that people with broad, strong

foundational skills, including reading comprehension, basic math, and

communications skills, tend to learn faster and master more complex

# abilities over time.

Think of the NBA draft. Teams don’t always pick the top college scorers.

Instead, they look for players with high potential—those with the

## right foundations like speed, agility, ball control, positional sense, and

shooting form. These players may not shine on day one, but they often

develop into stars because their foundation gives them room to grow.

The same logic applies in the workplace. Some ﬁrms, like Jane Street

## Capital, famously hire people for their raw quantitative ability—not

because they already know how to trade derivatives, but because they

have the foundational math skills to learn fast and go far.

## Of course, not every organization bets on potential. Startups, for

example, may favor candidates with job-ready expertise, since they

need people who can contribute immediately. In other cases, ﬁrms

in low-trust or high-turnover environments tend to deprioritize

foundational skills because they don’t expect long-term retention.

Still, for companies thinking beyond the next quarter, foundational

skills matter. They shape a person’s growth path—and their long-term

ceiling. But there are reasons beyond individuals’ performance for ﬁrms

to consider fundamental skills.

## These Skills Provide Flexibility in a Fast-Changing World

Our study found that workers with a broad range of foundational skills

were more adaptable to industry changes. This adaptability is especially

## crucial as specialized skills rise and fall with surprising speed.

For example, Adobe Flash was once the gold standard for interactive

web content, supporting a whole generation of developers. But when

Flash was discontinued and browsers phased it out, only those who

could pivot to HTML5 and JavaScript remained in demand. More

## recently, niche technical skills like Hadoop engineering and blockchain

development have experienced steep rises and falls. HackerRank’s 2025

Developer Skills Report lists Hadoop among the fastest-declining skills,

and LinkedIn data show blockchain-related job postings and developer

activity have dropped by over 40% in just one year as investment and

interest shifted toward AI.

These rapid cycles are no longer rare. Researchers estimate that the

“half-life” of technical skills—the time it takes for half of what you know

to become outdated—has dropped from about 10 years in the 1980s to

four years today, and may soon fall below two.

Specialized skills can spike and vanish this quickly, but our ﬁndings

suggest that the people who ride out each wave shared the same toolkit:

strong abilities to problem-solve, clear communication styles, and the

ability to work well with teams. These core strengths help workers

relearn faster, let companies redeploy talent without starting from

## scratch, and ultimately anchor performance when the next technology

arrives. In a world of constant disruption, organizations should pay even

closer attention to their employees’ foundational skills—because those

are what make long-term adaptability possible.

# Foundational Skills Knit Talent Together

Our study also found that one subset of foundational skills, in

particular, helped workers to achieve the highest levels of professional

attainment: social skills. Work today is woven from many threads—

cross-functional projects, remote teams, and tools that update every

quarter. The more moving parts a ﬁrm has, the more it relies on people

who can align goals, share knowledge, and keep friction low.

Previous research helps reveal why social skills are particularly

important today. David Deming’s landmark study of U.S. jobs shows

that positions requiring a high level of social interaction grew by almost

## 12 percentage points between 1980 and 2012, while math-intensive but

low-interaction roles shrank. Wages followed the same pattern: jobs

that blend cognitive ability and social skill pay the highest premiums

according to his study.

This trend is even more pronounced within the ﬁeld of management.

A recent paper by one of us—a large-scale analysis of 34 million U.S.

## managerial job postings, along with millions of résumés and employee

reviews—shows that since 2007, employers have tripled the share of

postings that emphasize collaboration, coaching, and inﬂuence, while

language related to traditional supervision has steadily declined.

Concrete examples show why. Amazon’s Upskilling 2025 initiative

invests over a billion dollars to help hundreds of thousands of

employees build new capabilities—from technical training to programs

that strengthen language skills—highlighting how soft skills are as

critical to advancement as technical know-how. Spotify’s “squad”

model likewise rewards engineers who can bridge design, product, and

marketing in autonomous, cross-functional teams. Google reached the

same conclusion in its Project Oxygen study: after analyzing thousands

of performance reviews, it found that its best managers excel at

## coaching, communication, and collaboration across teams, and it now

## uses those soft-skill behaviors as core promotion criteria. No company

can aﬀord talent who works in isolation; they need connectors.

Put simply, as technical complexity rises, the glue that keeps talent

productive is social skill—communication, empathy, conﬂict resolution,

and the ability to coordinate diverse expertise. But our work suggests

## that, in additional to social skills, other fundamental capabilities such

as critical thinking, complex problem solving, and reasoning, are also

## crucial components of dynamic and collective work environment in the

modern enterprise. Together, they oﬀer the shared platform that unlock

the full value of individuals’ specialized know-how, allow adapting

ones’ expertise as technology and markets shift, and have become

# increasingly in-demand.

## Putting It into Practice: What Leaders Can Do

Hire the right candidates. Screen for foundational strengths—

## like problem-solving, adaptability, and communication—even in

specialized roles. These qualities are often harder to evaluate, and

unstructured behavioral interview questions have little predictive

power. Still, companies shouldn’t ignore them. Ask targeted questions

to get at how candidates learn, collaborate, and respond to uncertainty,

even if the skill itself isn’t easy to quantify. Our work ﬁnds that, in

the long-run, candidates with a base of foundational skills will prove

more valuable than those who have hyper-specialized and speciﬁc

knowledge, but lack soft skills.

Develop your people. Invest in early-career development that

strengthen communication, collaboration, and learning agility—not

just technical proﬁciency. Foundational skills are far harder to build

later in life. Someone struggling with math, for instance, won’t become

ﬂuent through a few online tutorials; the same holds for social skills

like critical thinking and empathy, which develop over years through

school, peer interaction, and mentorship. To build a workforce that

can adapt to future disruption, organizations—and society—need to

## support foundational skill development from the start.

Lead your teams. Managers can play a key role by modeling and

reinforcing foundational skills in day-to-day work. That includes

recognizing and rewarding behaviors like thoughtful communication,

## collaborative problem-solving, and cross-functional learning, and

putting young employees up for opportunities where they might

strengthen these skills. Tools like peer feedback, mentoring, and

team retrospectives can be structured to emphasize the importance

of cultivating soft skills, thus embedding their development into team

In an age when technical expertise can become irrelevant in just a

## few years, foundational skills matter more than ever. Abilities like

## collaboration, problem-solving, and a solid grounding in math transfer

across jobs and help teams adapt to new challenges. The key to

eﬀective human resource management is to prioritize these skills in

both hiring and employee development. This builds a workforce that is
