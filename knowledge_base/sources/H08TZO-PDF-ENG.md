For decades, companies built entire strategies around the pursuit

of youth. Automakers, for example, sold independence to Baby

Boomers coming of age—the Ford Mustang, Dodge’s “join the rebellion”

campaigns, and Volkswagen’s Beetle all signaled that youth wasn’t just a

stage of life; it was a valuable new market category.

But time moves on. Those consumers are now in their 60s and 70s.

Meanwhile, fertility rates are falling worldwide, youth pipelines are

shrinking, population growth is slowing or reversing in many nations,

and people are living longer and working later.

A new market has emerged—deﬁned not by age alone, but by longevity,

## reinvention, and the realities of multigenerational living. Businesses

that cling to youth-centric product and talent strategies alone risk

missing out on one of the greatest growth opportunities of the 21st

## century: designing for the full life course.

# The Demographic Tipping Point

The numbers are stark. Globally, according to the United Nations, one in

six people is now over the age of 60, and this ﬁgure is expected to double

by 2050. In the United States, adults aged 65 and older are expected to

outnumber children under 18 by 2034. Fertility rates have fallen below

replacement level in more than 100 countries. China, Japan, Italy, and

South Korea are already experiencing population decline.

As life expectancy has increased, so have the capabilities and

aspirations of older adults. Today’s 60- and 70-year-olds are starting

businesses, caregiving for family members, and running marathons.

They’re not fringe cases—they’re the future mainstream, and

they’re underrepresented in workforce planning, product design, and

# marketing.

Yet many companies still treat aging as a risk to be managed, not

a consumer and talent opportunity to be embraced. Internal KPIs

prioritize short-term wins. Leadership pipelines overlook the potential

of late-career professionals. Advertising often defaults to youthful

## imagery or treats older adults as burdens or punchlines.

This mindset is not only outdated but also contrary to market forces.

In the U.S., according to AARP, adults over 50 control nearly 70%

of household wealth. Globally, they account for 42% of consumer

spending. And, according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, labor force

participation among people over 65 has nearly doubled since 2000,

outpacing all other age groups.

Some companies are waking up to this reality. Nike has made

moves to attract older consumers, including the development of new

product lines. Apple has quietly embedded inclusive features across

its devices, like large-text interfaces, fall detection, and even hearing

aid functionality, without singling out older users. Dove’s “Beauty

never gets old” campaign features women over 60 and reframes aging

as aspirational, challenging outdated beauty standards. The luxury

fashion brand Jacquemus’s recent advertising stars 67-year-old Jon

Gries, demonstrating the cultural power and credibility that older

celebrities bring to brands. Even Nestlé, better known for confections

and baby food, announced that it plans to diversify its product oﬀerings

to include older adults.

Yet these remain the exceptions, not the rule.

## Shifting from Generational Targeting to Life-Course Design

What’s needed now is a wholesale shift in how companies think about

age, not as a demographic silo, but as a design and strategy imperative.

That means moving beyond generational targeting (Boomers, Gen X,

Millennials, Gen Z) to life-course design: a framework that reﬂects

the dynamic, nonlinear paths people take through education, work,

caregiving, health, and reinvention.

Life-course design recognizes that a 67-year-old startup founder, a

## 55-year-old caregiver, and a 72-year-old retiree-turned-consultant all

have diﬀerent needs, behaviors, and aspirations, despite all being over

- 50. It also acknowledges that intergenerational collaboration—across

teams, households, and marketplaces—is becoming the norm, not the

# exception.

To stay competitive in a world shaped by longevity, population aging,

and, in some cases, population decline, businesses should make two

## strategic product shifts and two workforce shifts:

- 1. From youth-centric to age-inclusive product design

Older adults are often treated as edge cases in product development,

if they’re considered at all. But designing with age in mind doesn’t

mean designing only for older people. It means building for a range of

## abilities, life stages, and preferences from the start.

# Product design leaders should:

- Replace generational stereotypes with behavioral segmentation,

building strategies around what motivates people to take action or

make a purchase, or marketing around speciﬁc life events, like having

a child. McKinsey & Company found that companies using behavioral

and psychographic segmentation in their marketing campaigns saw

returns up to three times higher than those relying solely on

# demographic or age-based segmentation.

- Use inclusive design principles that beneﬁt everyone (e.g., clearer

interfaces, easier grip, adjustable lighting). A study by Accenture

found that companies that have led on key disability inclusion criteria

saw 1.6 times more revenue, 2.6 times more net income, and twice

the economic proﬁt of other companies. Apple’s default approach

—embedding inclusive design across all devices—shows that age-

inclusive innovation can be seamless and desirable for all users.

- Invite older adults into the research and design process early and often

to test usability, relevance, and desirability.

- 2. From age as decline to age as reinvention in marketing

Too often, marketing frames aging as a loss of youth, beauty, or

relevance. This narrative is not only inaccurate but also commercially

## self-defeating. Slogans like “erase ﬁne lines and wrinkles” and

descriptors like “age-defying” can make older adults feel as if

there’s no point for them to purchase products. For example, Dior’s

## “Capture Youth” campaign in 2017 featured 25-year-old Cara Delevingne

promoting anti-aging products, drawing widespread criticism for

reinforcing ageist ideals by using a model decades younger than the

# target audience.

# Instead, marketing leaders should:

- Showcase ambition, vitality, and reinvention at every age.

- Normalize longevity, not as an exception, but as the new standard.

- Feature age-diverse brand ambassadors across product lines.

Aspirational marketing doesn’t have to be young; it has to be honest,

bold, and deeply human. An older demographic has diﬀerent priorities

and is often willing to pay more to protect their retirement, their health,

# and even their time.

- 3. From career ladders to career landscapes

Traditional career models assume people peak in their 40s and retire

by 65. But those assumptions no longer hold. Longer lives mean longer

working years, but not necessarily in the same roles or with the same

cadence. In 2017, CVS implemented a “Talent Is Ageless” program in

which they actively recruited employees 50 years or older, who are often

in their second or third career, while emphasizing the importance of

hiring people who can relate to their customers. (They note that 90%

## of Americans 65+ take at least one prescription.) Similarly, Caterpillar

created a Returning Professionals Development Program to support

people restarting or shifting careers. Measures like these can strengthen

an organization’s talent pipeline and ensure a more representative

# workforce.

# Forward-looking talent leaders should:

- Redesign roles and workﬂows to accommodate physical, cognitive,

# and lifestyle changes.

- Introduce phased retirement, part-time leadership roles, and mid-

# career reskilling.

- Extend leadership development to late-career professionals who still

have decades of contribution ahead.

These models not only retain institutional knowledge but also foster

loyalty in a workforce that increasingly values ﬂexibility and purpose.

- 4. From age-segregated teams to intergenerational collaboration

The future of work is multigenerational. Today’s workplaces often

span four generations, from young Gen Zs to older Boomers. Rather

than treating age diﬀerences as a challenge, leading organizations

understand that diverse perspectives can drive innovation and are

leveraging them as an asset. General Electric’s reverse mentorship

program—in which younger employees helped seasoned executives

strengthen their digital experience—was so successful it was ultimately

incorporated into the broader company strategy. PwC and Moody’s have

developed cross-generational programs in which older and younger

generations from diverse backgrounds are paired up to learn from each

# other.

Popular culture is starting to reﬂect this reality, which is important if we

want to change the prevailing narrative. Intergenerational friendships

like the ones portrayed on hit TV shows like HBO’s Hacks and ABC’s

Abbott Elementary are examples of the power and mutual beneﬁt

intergenerational relationships can have on people’s lives and careers.

The stories highlight the ways that young and old frequently beneﬁt

from working together while also rewriting outdated stereotypes that

tend to portray older adults as crazy or outdated and younger adults as

# irresponsible or careless.

Company leaders can learn from these plot lines and should:

- Structure teams with age diversity as an intentional design element.

- Establish mutual mentorship programs that value experience and

# innovation equally.

- Train managers to navigate generational expectations around

## communication, work-life balance, and performance.

Research shows that age-diverse teams drive better ﬁnancial

performance and are more resilient, particularly in industries where

institutional knowledge and adaptability are critical.

## A Strategic Checklist for Getting Started

Companies ready to embrace age inclusion can begin by assessing their

blind spots and opportunities. Here are ﬁve practical steps:

- 1. Conduct a demographic risk audit. Evaluate whether your

workforce, leadership, and customer strategies align with projected

# population trends, not past ones.

- 2. Redesign talent models for longevity. Plan for longer tenures,

encore careers, and succession pipelines that include employees in

# their 60s, 70s, and even 80s.

- 3. Build inclusive products and services. Apply inclusive design from

## the outset, test products with users across the age spectrum, and

make accessibility an innovation metric.

- 4. Institutionalize intergenerational collaboration. Set age-diversity

## goals. Structure teams for a generational mix. Make mentorship

# programs reciprocal, not one-way.

- 5. Tell better stories about age. Invest in advertising agencies

## and campaigns that elevate older consumers and professionals as

# creators, not caretakers of the past.

. . .

Demographic change isn’t coming—it’s here, and it’s reshaping labor

markets, consumer behavior, and economic growth. The question for

business leaders is no longer whether to respond to these changes, but

# how fast and how comprehensively.

Age inclusion isn’t a corporate social responsibility initiative, but a

strategy for resilience, relevance, and growth. Companies that design

for the full life course will not only tap into the wealth and wisdom

of older adults but also build stronger intergenerational systems that

# beneﬁt everyone.

As the adage goes, demographics is destiny. But it’s also design, and the

future belongs to those who build for it.
