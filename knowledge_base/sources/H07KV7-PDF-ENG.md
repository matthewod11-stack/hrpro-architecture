Irene was the type of employee every manager dreamed of.

Hardworking and dedicated, she excelled in her role as lead project

manager. Her conscientious nature meant tasks were done on time

and that every detail was accounted for. Her knack for spotting

and navigating nuance was invaluable in the organization’s matrixed

environment. Many even joked that Irene was the “heartbeat” of the

team – the one who everyone turned to for compassion, care, and moral

# support.

But at times, Irene’s deep thinking and feeling nature got the better

of her. Last-minute changes sent her into a tailspin and compromised

her productivity. Irene shied away from confrontation and sometimes

avoided giving necessary feedback to other colleagues, which blocked

# the team’s results.

Irene is among the one in ﬁve people who is highly sensitive. High

sensitivity, also referred to as sensory processing sensitivity, is a

trait that’s been researched for more than 30 years. It relates to

having a more reactive nervous system, attuning to subtleties in the

environment, and processing information more deeply.

Studies have shown that high sensitivity is linked to genetic diﬀerences

in how the brain processes neurochemicals like serotonin, dopamine,

norepinephrine. Researchers believe the trait evolved as a way to stay

free from harm, since pausing and observing led to picking up on

threats and opportunities that others missed.

In a business world dominated by automation, digitalization, and

increasing incivility, the need for highly sensitive people has never been

greater. In one survey, those who test highest for sensitivity are not

only the most stressed, but they are also the best rated by managers.

This highlights the fact that highly sensitive people — when managed

correctly — can be among your workplace’s greatest assets.

Yet the majority of managers not only lack awareness of the trait, but

also lack tools to properly supervise, nurture, and retain their sensitive

leaders. Managing a highly sensitive person (HSP) involves a learning

curve, but here is how to leverage what they have to oﬀer your team and

# company.

See sensitivity as a strength, not a shortcoming.

## Neurodiversity (i.e. diﬀerent mental processing styles such as high

sensitivity) leads to better results. But too often, HSPs are seen as weak

and categorized as fragile, overly emotional employees who need a lot of

hand-holding. This outdated perspective ignores the unique strengths

that HSPs bring to the workplace, such as creativity, problem-solving,

# and empathy.

To eﬀectively lead and manage HSPs, managers need to shift their

perspective and recognize that sensitivity is a natural variation in

personality and not a ﬂaw. Rather than viewing sensitivity as a

weakness, consider the strengths your sensitive employees bring to the

table and how they could be applied. For example:

- HSPs are skilled at spotting patterns, reading between the lines, and

picking up on subtle cues, which makes them well-suited to identify

opportunities or risks that others miss.

- Because HSPs are attuned to others’ emotions and needs, they can

be savvy persuaders, inﬂuencers, and negotiators as well as experts at

fostering teamwork and camaraderie.

- HSPs listen to multiple perspectives and ﬁnd common ground, which

can be invaluable during conﬂict resolution.

# Prioritize clarity.

Highly sensitive people are wired to look for danger. This vigilance was

helpful in prehistoric days and can come in handy for identifying risks

that threaten the team or business’s safety and security. But it can cause

## excess stress and overthinking in the face of ambiguity.

It’s no secret that today’s leaders need to know how to operate in

unprecedented uncertainty and ﬂux. HSPs thrive when they have

structure and clarity, which allows them to focus on their work and

perform at their best. To help highly sensitive employees stay balanced,

it’s essential to provide clarity about the scope of their role, goals, and

exactly what is expected of them. This could include:

- Drafting a “me manual” — a guide to working with you as a leader,

which includes preferences and expectations around communication,

# work style, and more

- Creating a RACI chart, outlining who on the team is Responsible,

## Accountable, Consulted, and Informed on certain projects or decisions

- Setting aside a one-on-one meeting each month to discuss

# professional development

Don’t put them on the spot.

Thinking before acting is a hallmark of high sensitivity. This can be a

valuable asset in many situations, as it allows HSPs to consider diﬀerent

perspectives and potential outcomes before taking action.

You’ll get better ideas and performance out of your sensitive employees

if they have an opportunity to deliberate on and formulate responses

versus being put on the spot. This could involve:

- Sending agendas and thought-starters in advance of meetings

- Allowing for asynchronous responses in writing

- Providing a heads up when important decisions are coming down the

pike so they can adjust and acclimate

Likewise, coach your sensitive employees to cope with challenges. Perhaps you rehearse diﬃcult conversations so they feel prepared, or

chat through how they might handle roadblocks so that they feel more

# in control.

# Provide refuge from overstimulation.

If the average person’s brain takes in 100 pieces of information, the

sensitive person’s brain takes in 1,000. It’s no wonder then why many HSPs experience overstimulation — diﬃculty concentrating, irritability,

restlessness, fatigue, headaches, and more. If sensory overload sets in,

an HSP may shut down or retreat altogether, which can have major

# consequences for your team and projects.

No one can work at an unsustainable pace, but the need for

decompression is even more urgent for HSPs. Here are a few ways I’ve

seen leaders and workplaces provide refuge:

- Designate a “no meeting day” once a week and/or deﬁne “do not

# disturb” times

- Allow for an audio-only option during certain meetings

- Encourage sensory accommodations — like noise-canceling

headphones and adjustable lighting — as well as periodic screen

# breaks

Finally, rely on your HSP employee’s insights. HSPs’ heightened

awareness allows them to spot burnout and disengagement. For

example, an HSP may notice when a colleague seems more withdrawn

or may pick up on changes in the tone or energy of team meetings. Don’t

dismiss their concerns — validate and take action before it’s too late.

By recognizing and valuing the contributions of highly sensitive

team members, managers can create a more inclusive and supportive

workplace culture that beneﬁts everyone.
