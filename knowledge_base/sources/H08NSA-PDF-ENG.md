At age 29, Nick LoManto led a busy life. He was moving up in his

job as a manager of investment analysts at the ﬁnancial services ﬁrm,

Vanguard. At home, he and his wife were settling into their marriage

and starting to think about growing their family. “There I was, a ﬁnance

professional with every gift a person could wish for,” he told me. But

despite all he was building, LoManto couldn’t shake the feeling that

something was missing.

That nagging feeling led him to ask himself deeper questions: What

am I contributing to my community? How can I make a bigger impact?

Around that time, a ﬁreﬁghter friend asked if he’d ever thought about

volunteering at the local station. The idea stuck.

Now, eight years later, LoManto spends three to 10 hours a week at

the Ludwigs Corner Fire Company, doing drills and responding to

emergency calls. To earn his certiﬁcation, he completed 196 hours of

in-person training. Volunteering as a ﬁreﬁghter allows him to give back

to his community and set a positive example for his two small children.

LoManto said the community service aspect of being a ﬁreﬁghter fulﬁlls

him beyond what he gets from his regular job, now as head of high

net worth advice at Vanguard. “It gives me an even deeper sense of

purpose,” he said.

While the physical, mental, and emotional challenges of ﬁghting ﬁres

aren’t for everyone, LoManto is one of many young professionals

seeking fulﬁllment beyond their careers through volunteering. In

the U.S. alone, nearly one-third of people aged 25 to 44 volunteer

## through formal organizations, such as charities, schools, or religious

## groups—while over half participate in informal volunteering, like

helping neighbors, assisting friends, or oﬀering unpaid support in their

# communities.

## My MBA students at Northwestern University’s Kellogg School of

Management tell me that volunteering satisﬁes their drive to “give

back.” Others seek it out as a way to ﬁnd personal purpose—especially

those early in their careers. The ﬁrst few years in the workforce can

sometimes feel like “doing what you’re told” rather than actually

“making a diﬀerence.” Volunteering can help people bridge that gap,

adding meaning and positivity to their lives—not to mention the added

## beneﬁts of improved physical and mental health.

If you similarly feel called to make an impact beyond your day job, here

are three simple ways to tap into the power of volunteering, based on

the advice I give to my MBA students and other young professionals

looking for greater purpose.

- 1) Don’t quit before you start.

The magnitude of problems in our world can make it easy to feel

hopeless. Despite your desire to “give back,” you may wonder if you,

as one person, can really make a diﬀerence. I have seen this in my

## students, as well as people at later stages of their careers.

If this feeling resonates with you, try not to get discouraged. Remind

yourself that every meaningful change starts with individuals. A single

person may not have the power to solve every problem, champion every

cause, or save every life. But when many people take action, they can

quickly become a critical mass and achieve great things.

## The concept of the “circle of inﬂuence” vs. the “circle of concern,”

is a useful way to think about this. Popularized by professor and

author Steven Covey, it’s meant to help people focus their eﬀorts

where they have the most impact. The idea is that many of us may

care deeply about large-scale issues—such as poverty, climate change,

## gender discrimination, and other inequities—but many of these things

fall outside of our direct control. They live in our circle of concern.

On the other hand, the things we can control live in our circle of

inﬂuence. These are the areas in our lives where our actions, choices,

and involvement can directly make an impact. In the context of

volunteering, if enough people focus their eﬀorts in these areas—like in

## their local communities or through smaller-scale initiatives—they can

# collectively create positive change.

Take the example, Patrick Lee, one of my former executive MBA

students, who found a way to make a diﬀerence within his circle of

inﬂuence. Passionate about healthcare, Lee has always believed that

“health is a human right.” He also recognizes the scale of health

disparities around the world is too great a challenge for one person to

tackle. So, he started small.

While attending the UCSF School of Medicine, Lee met Jim Yong Kim,

a cofounder of Partners in Health—an organization that advocates for

## health, human rights, and social equality in Haiti, across Africa, and

in other low-income regions. Through this connection, Lee began to

get involved in some pro bono work. He spent three years alternating

between his shifts as a hospitalist in Boston and serving with Partners in

# Health in rural areas in Rwanda.

What started as small, focused eﬀorts eventually grew into a leadership

role where he drives larger-scale change. In the end, his volunteer work

inﬂuenced his career choice to promote health equity. Lee now works

as president and CEO of Central Health in Austin, Texas, improving

## healthcare access in an area with about a 10% poverty rate.

- 2) Start small and start now.

Once you accept that, yes, you can make an impact, how do you

decide where to start? Many of the young people I speak with face this

dilemma. They want to volunteer in a meaningful way, but don’t know

where or when to begin.

Several believe that their greatest contributions will come after they’ve

reached professional success—when they have more money, more

accomplishments, or greater inﬂuence. But that’s simply not true. If

they keep waiting for the right time to act, they could be waiting forever.

That’s why my advice is to start now, right where you are. Within

## your own network, community, or even in your neighborhood, there

are likely people, projects, and organizations working to create positive

change—whether it’s supporting those in need, advocating for a cause,

or strengthening local areas.

If you want to get involved in a way that feels purposeful, you need to

identify what matters to you. Take some time to self-reﬂect and gain

clarity on the causes that align with your values or the problems you feel

driven to help solve. From there, you can explore meaningful ways to

contribute. To narrow your focus, use these questions as a guide.

What local issues or causes do I feel connected to, and why?

Perhaps you’ve been personally aﬀected by a social issue that you now

feel compelled to help address. Or maybe there are speciﬁc groups of

people—such as children, seniors, or underserved communities—that

you feel particularly drawn to. Self-reﬂection may help you dig deeper

## into the “why” behind your interests or passions.

What local organizations align with the interests, causes, or communities I want to support, and how can I learn more about their volunteer needs?

## Explore local nonproﬁt websites, social media pages, or community

boards. Attend informational sessions at organizations that draw your

attention or reach out directly to learn about their volunteer needs. This

will help you discover the diﬀerent types of volunteering, which can

range from hands-on service to advocacy or fundraising. It can also be

useful to share your unique skills with the places you’re interested in.

Whether it’s problem-solving, communication, leadership, or technical

expertise, the abilities you’ve gained through personal and professional

experience could end up fulﬁlling a need, especially if the place is

# underresourced.

What volunteer activities do my friends or colleagues participate in?

If you’re struggling to ﬁnd the right opportunities, but are still eager

to get involved, consider tapping into your network. Your friends and

colleagues may participate in volunteering eﬀorts that you can join to

gain ﬁrsthand experience and explore what feels like the right ﬁt.

- 3) Save room for inspiration.

Over time, like Lee and many other people I’ve connected with, you

may ﬁnd that your volunteer experiences start inﬂuencing your career

choices. Volunteering gives you the freedom to explore new interests

and passions outside your job. This can help you uncover (or rediscover)

what truly fulﬁlls you. As your values evolve, you may even ﬁnd a cause

worth pursuing professionally—leading to a career that aligns with your

# purpose.

As a ﬁnal example, I’ll share the story of Sahar Jamal. Before becoming

one of my students, Jamal was as a senior manager at Johnson &

Johnson where she also volunteered in corporate social responsibility

(CSR) activities. Through her CSR work, she became interested in global

health issues, particularly those aﬀecting women and children. The

experience changed the trajectory of her entire career.

Jamal left her job to pursue an MBA at Kellogg and interned with

Jacaranda Health in East Africa. She learned that many women

struggled with breastfeeding their children while also working to

support their families. This inspired her to start Mazima (“milk” in

Swahili), a social enterprise in Kenya that provides women a discreet,

portable, and low-cost breast pump. “I wanted to make sure I was

directly making a diﬀerence in the lives of women,” she told me.

No matter how or where you volunteer, you can experience greater

purpose while also making a meaningful impact. By reﬂecting on

your values and the causes that resonate with you, you can discover

opportunities that are both rewarding and enjoyable. In the end,

volunteering not only enriches your life but also creates a positive ripple

eﬀect that extends far beyond your own experience.
