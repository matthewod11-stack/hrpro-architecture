Jenna is stressed. She has to perform some research for a client report,

write up part of the report, and leave the oﬃce by 5 PM so she can

pick up her son from after-school care. Working furiously, she feels she

is ﬁnally hitting her stride when Seth — her colleague who sits on the

same ﬂoor — stops by her oﬃce to say hi and ask how her weekend

was. Jenna smiles and, politely but curtly, states that she had a good

weekend. She does not return the question, and Seth leaves. As soon as

he exits, she quickly returns to the report.

# The Research

This sort of experience was common among the parents we studied in our research across professionals at three diﬀerent organizations:

## a pharmaceutical company, a professional services organization, and

a university. We interviewed and observed 72 of these workers, who

were almost all extremely devoted to excellence in their work. We found

that a subset — speciﬁcally, the workers with young children who were

the primary caregiving parent or shared this role with their spouse —

felt short on time. This, of course, is no surprise to parents of kids

or anyone else who has extensive caregiving responsibilities such as

eldercare. What we also found, however, was that in addition to the

sorts of “typical” management of time one might expect to ﬁnd (e.g.,

scheduling), these workers tried to manage interactions.

# Managing Interactions When Time Is Short

The parents in our study, like Jenna, handled interactions through a

series of strategies we labeled interaction practices:

- They avoided interactions by turning down invitations to lunch,

not going to departmental social hours, and never initiating casual

# conversations.

- They hid from coworkers by working at home or even sneaking oﬀ to

the bathroom at a time when everyone else was in a work meeting.

- They organized interactions strategically by booking meetings back-to-

back so they could promptly end an earlier meeting by pointing out

they had to stop to talk to someone else (as opposed to simply saying,

“I am sorry, I don’t want to talk anymore,” which parents recognized

would be interpreted as rude).

- They focused interactions by redirecting conversations in meetings

## from non-work activities to the tasks at hand.

# The Costs for Relationship-Building

These interaction practices achieved what they aimed to do: namely,

cut out interactions at work that were not purely task-focused to

save time for caregiving. Despite being devoted professionals, these

workers generally spent the morning, evenings, and weekends with

their children while achieving professional success.

However, these interaction practices had a cost. Parents who extensively

tried to control interactions through these strategies ended up having

weak relationships with colleagues, which extensive research has shown

is important to being successful in the workplace. While they sometimes

had one or two close friends — which research shows is important even

if one cannot maintain a large social network — they did not feel they

had many close friends, did not feel a sense of belonging at work, and

were out of the loop on workplace gossip.

There was a tradeoﬀ between saving time for family and developing

relationships, as we saw by studying the set of workers who did not have

such caregiving responsibilities (men and women without children, and

the subset of fathers who had a wife who took charge of organizing care

for the kids — no mothers in our research had such a spouse). These

workers did engage more socially at work: taking longer lunch breaks

at restaurants, chatting in the hall, popping by one another’s oﬃce to

discuss work gossip, and going to the bar after work. However, because

they also had to get their work done, this meant less time for hobbies,

non-work friends, and — for these fathers — their children.

# What to Do

While there are no easy answers to solving the lack of time problem

many parents experience, our research provides some suggestions for

# both parents as well as managers.

# Tips for Parents

- 1. Be aware. Many of the parents in our study did not recognize that by

systematically limiting interactions, they were curtailing workplace

relationships to a great extent. They were so far outside of the social

network, they did not know how well their coworkers had bonded.

It is important to be aware that limiting interactions has a relational

cost, and to know what that cost might be.

- 2. Take the time hit. While engaging in extensive daily social

interactions is not plausible for many parents, making some time —

whether on a weekly or monthly basis — to talk with coworkers is

important. Many of the professionals we studied preferred scheduled

lunches for such connection, as it allowed them to plan their workday

in advance to accommodate this non-work time.

- 3. Dads, pull your weight. In our research, moms were much more

likely to experience this shortness of time and cut out interactions

than fathers, reﬂecting the fact that they performed more extensive childcare (e.g., pickup and drop-oﬀ). These ﬁndings are consistent

with extensive research that shows mothers perform more childcare

than fathers. Dads need to step up and help moms so that the burden

of care — and the relational costs of it — does not solely fall on

# women.

# Tips for Managers

- 1. Recognize and acknowledge. Managers are a core part of creating

and maintaining a family-friendly workplace. Having read this

article, you might understand why some of your employees come oﬀ as busy, rushed, or harried at times. Now, you can acknowledge

to parents — particularly those of young children — that you

understand why they cannot always make the 7 PM social hour or

lunchtime birthday party. Hand in hand with this, of course, is not

pressuring parents to engage in such activities given their family

# demands.

- 2. Structure relationships in a way that works for parents. In our

research, parents most preferred pre-arranged formal relationships,

such as mentorship programs, because this cut down on the time, eﬀort, and small-talk required to build these connections more

organically. This type of relationship can provide parents with a way

to get advice on both professional and personal (e.g., managing work

and family) issues, while saving time for their family.

- 3. Focus on results, not hours. Managers sometimes focus on hours

put in rather than results achieved. Focusing on how well your

employees are performing — rather than the hours they put in — will

help you to reward parents instead of dinging them for making time

# for their kids.

There are only so many hours in the day, and parents often cut

casual interactions to make time for their children. While this has

clear beneﬁts, there is of course a relational cost. Both managers and

professionals should consider ways to develop workplace relationships

that are amenable to the demands of caregiving.
