The gender wage gap has been in existence at least since the U.S.

Civil War era, when an 1869 letter to The New York Times exposed

unfair treatment of women working in government and argued that

“equal work should command equal pay without regard to the sex of

the laborer.” Fast forward 156 years and women still only earn 83 cents

for every dollar that men make, a number that has barely budged over

the past two decades and is consistent across OECD countries.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Gender Wage Gap Tipping Point

While there are numerous proposed explanations for this persistent

gender wage gap—including women choosing to work in lower-

paying jobs or working fewer hours than men, leaving the workforce for

caregiving responsibilities, or facing gender bias and discrimination—

some have argued that simply increasing the representation of women

in the workforce is enough to naturally eliminate the gap.

We know that this “add women and stir” approach is important and can

yield some improvements, but it isn’t enough on its own to solve the

persistent wage gap problem. However, we wondered whether there is

a speciﬁc point where the proportion of women in a given occupation

meaningfully aﬀects how much they’re paid compared to men.

## Our research, published in Equality, Diversity, and Inclusion: An

International Journal, found that having more women in a job category

does, in some capacity, help close the wage gap. But there’s a tipping

point: Once women make up a certain proportion of an occupation, the

wage gap narrows more slowly. This shift suggests the relationship is

more complex than it might appear; it is not as simple as “the more

# women, the smaller the gap.”

# The Research

Our analysis focused on the Canadian labor market, which compared to

the U.S. oﬀers a more representative view of OECD countries based on

## the World Economic Forum’s (WEF) Global Gender Gap Index. The data

is also widely inclusive of 40 diverse job categories like professional occupations, senior and middle management, oﬃce support, and care

providers across diﬀerent industries, making it particularly useful for

examining the wage gap. The 40 job categories cover nearly all of

Canadian employment. We analyzed 22 years of annual data from 1997

to 2018 for each of the job categories. For each job category, the gender

wage gap is deﬁned as female full-time workers’ median earnings

divided by male full-time workers’ median earnings.

Our results showed that the gender wage gap closed more quickly when

there were fewer than 14% women in the category—in other words,

when women were more underrepresented. But once women made up

a certain proportion of the occupation—the “tipping point”—progress

continued but at a much slower pace. For example, before the tipping

point, adding just 1 percentage point more women to a job category, say

from 8% to 9%, shrinks the wage gap noticeably. But after that point,

progress slows such that it takes adding about 3.6 percentage points

more women, say from 20% to 23.6%, to achieve the same improvement.

# Why Is There a Tipping Point?

The 14% data point we identiﬁed echoes ﬁndings from Harvard

## Business School professor Rosabeth Moss Kanter’s landmark work

on tokenism. Kanter’s research examined group dynamics when one

group heavily outnumbers another, deﬁning a “skewed” group as one

where there’s 85:15 majority-to-minority ratio. Up to the point of 15%,

underrepresented individuals are known to face polarization from the

majority or be pressured to conform to stereotypes. Ultimately, these

people are often seen as symbols or “tokens” rather than individuals,

and may feel isolated based on how they are treated.

However, their sparse presence and anomaly status also heightens their

visibility. And when there are social or legal pressures to improve equity

or to achieve diversity goals—in our case, to improve gender equity

speciﬁcally—the incentives to protect the organization’s reputation and

image may motivate companies to increase the proportion of women

and/or improve pay equity. In short, a more deliberate eﬀort is made to

close the gap and early gains are made.

However, once these initial gains are achieved and the pressure lessens,

organizations may assume the problem is resolved and scale back their

eﬀorts too soon. As women become better represented, it can create a

perception that gender barriers are breaking down and that equity is

improving. Akin to reaching a “false summit,” where a hiker mistakenly

believes they have reached the top of a mountain when there is still

more to climb, organizations might make the hasty determination that pay equity has been suﬃciently achieved and cease making changes.

# Making Headway

Despite a slowdown in the closure of the gender wage gap after the

tipping point, there is some good news. Our analysis found that by

2002, there were meaningful improvements in the wage gap across

almost all occupations compared to 1997. This improvement continued

throughout the rest of the years studied, and by 2018 the wage gap

was smaller for 36 of 40 occupations. As noted by Harvard economist

and recent Nobel laureate Claudia Goldin, “equalizing earnings within

each occupation matters far more than equalizing the proportions by

each occupation.” If pay equity within occupations is achieved, the

## overall wage gap shrinks, even if more societally embedded practices

# like occupational segregation remain.

That said, we also found that those occupations with a rising share

of female workers exhibited more improvement in the closure of the

gender wage gap. Across the years of the study, for 31 of 40 occupations

with improving female representation, the wage gap closed by an

average of 10.6 percentage points from 1997 to 2018, almost twice the 5.6

## percentage point average improvement for the nine occupations with

declining female representation.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Gender Wage Gap Tipping Point

Ultimately, closing the wage gap is about ensuring equal pay for equal

work in concert with representation, and organizations not lessening

eﬀorts before real progress is made.

. . .

The false summit illusion we’ve identiﬁed doesn’t mean pay equity

is out of reach; it just means the journey takes longer than it ﬁrst

appears and organizations may be easing their eﬀorts toward pay

equity too soon. After the tipping point, our research also showed

## continued improvements in the wage gap closure, just at a slower

pace, indicating that closing the gender wage gap requires both

increasing representation and ensuring equal pay for equal work.

Organizations must stay committed, push beyond early progress, and

avoid complacency to achieve the sustained goal of pay equity.
