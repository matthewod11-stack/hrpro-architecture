Giving performance feedback is a part of every people leader’s job.

And yet, in my work with these leaders and teams, I’ve found that they

often have negative mental models of what a feedback conversation is

supposed to look like. Those pre-conceived notions can act as a barrier

to giving timely, helpful, and honest performance feedback. Part of my

job as a coach and facilitator is to help challenge people’s mindsets

about what makes giving feedback so hard.

Here are three of the most common pre-conceived notions I hear that

contribute to feedback anxiety, and what to do about them.

- 1. The feedback conversation is going to be long and drawn out.

Let’s say you have a colleague with whom you have a good working

relationship. You care about the other person’s perspectives, and they

care about yours. You have observed that they care about the quality of

their work, and the impact they have on other people and projects. In

addition, when you’ve given them feedback in the past, they’ve received

it without defensiveness and made the changes you requested.

Guess what? You’re likely working with a “feedback magnet” —

someone who readily accepts and acts on feedback. When you’re

working with a colleague like this, you don’t necessarily need to have

long, drawn out feedback conversations. You might be able to give

fast feedback — simply sharing the behavior or performance you’re

observing.

For example, you might say “I noticed that you weren’t able to answer

the regulators’ question about new risks in our meeting yesterday”

— and then stop talking. If you’re working with a feedback magnet,

they’re likely to acknowledge their misstep, and oﬀer their own plan for

remedying it. For example, “I know. I wasn’t as prepared as I needed to

be for that question. I’m following up today with the regulators, and for

the next meeting, I’ll have done a deep dive into new risks so that I’m

ready.” And then, you can thank them for their proactivity, and oﬀer to

make yourself available if and when they need you.

Of course, not every feedback conversation you’ll have will be with

someone who is self-aware, self-motivated, and self-directed. In those

cases, you have a longer conversation ahead of you. But don’t assume

that every conversation needs to be long or multifaceted.

- 2. I need to make the feedback perfect.

Most performance feedback is a combination of objective input

(observed through measurable data, facts, and backed up by veriﬁable

evidence) and subjective input (inﬂuenced by personal opinions,

feelings, or experiences). This means that your employee might see

things diﬀerently than you do, and you may or may not be “right”

the ﬁrst time. If you’re willing to having a feedback dialogue rather

than a monologue, you’re likely to get new information, additional

## perspectives, and even reactions to the feedback that you should

consider. This means that your planned 30-minute meeting might

become a series of discussions for the feedback to be more useful for

# both of you.

Feedback might take more than one conversation when:

- The feedback is nuanced or complex.

- You’re not sure that the other person understands the feedback, and

you want to help them get it.

- You’re not sure you understand the other person’s perspective, and you

want to really listen.

- The recipient has a negative reaction to the feedback, and you want to

give both of you time to regroup.

- There’s disagreement about the feedback.

- You realize that you didn’t have enough context and want to update

# the feedback.

- You made a mistake in the feedback and need to ﬁx it.

This will make feedback easier in the short term when you can free

yourself from needing to get it perfect right out of the gate. It can also

make it easier in the long run, when your colleague learns that that

you’re going to give them the opportunity to share their perspective.

- 3. My feedback is going to be taken the wrong way.

In my workshops on giving and receiving eﬀective feedback,

participants regularly share their concerns that they will hurt the other

person’s feelings or make them angry. In fact, their anxiety about how

employees will respond often delays or prevents them from giving

helpful, timely, and direct feedback. This means that their colleagues

don’t know what they’re doing well, where they need to develop, what

the expectations are, and how to get there.

It’s understandable that you don’t want to upset your direct reports

— or anyone else for that matter. Nevertheless, other people’s

reactions and responses to feedback are largely out of your control

(and sometimes out of their own). Whether an employee takes it

personally, gets defensive, bursts into tears, rejects it, questions it,

or accepts the feedback is based on a number of extenuating factors

including personality, current context, overall life experiences, cultural

# background, and much more.

And while you have a contribution to how they experience the feedback,

you are not in total control of it.

So, while it’s helpful to know that you can’t “make” someone feel sad or

angry, you do need to commit to making your part of the conversation

# as helpful and productive as possible.

This includes articulating a positive intention for the feedback, being

clear about what you’re observing and requesting, naming the impact,

focusing on strengths, developing actionable next steps, and delivering

# the feedback with care and curiosity.

For example, you might say, “Kyle, I’d like to give you some feedback

on your communication style so that you can have more productive

conversations with your team members. Before we begin, please know

that any feedback I’m giving you is because I want to help you make

the strongest impact you can on the team, and I want to discuss any

obstacles you’re experiencing or resources you might need.

I notice that when Scott and Shira make suggestions in weekly staﬀ

meetings, you often respond with “Here’s why that won’t work” instead

of really listening and being curious about their perspectives. One

impact of this is that they are starting to participate less in meetings,

meaning you’re not getting diverse ideas — and they’re going to

disengage. I know you to be an inclusive leader, and someone who truly

cares about the team, which is why I am bringing this to your attention.

How do you see it? What might you do diﬀerently moving forward? And

how can I best support you?”

It also includes asking for feedback on your feedback, so that you can

improve your impact as well. This could sound something like, “Kyle, I

want to make sure that the feedback I’m giving you is helping you grow

and succeed in your role and career. The best way for me to do that is

to ask you for feedback on my feedback style and approach. Would you

share with me one or two things that I could do diﬀerently in giving you

feedback that would be more helpful? And what am I doing that I should

keep doing?”

Keep in mind that, with a power diﬀerential, you may have to ask

a direct report for this kind of upward feedback more than once, or

oﬀer speciﬁc examples of feedback skills you know you need to work

on, or tell the story of a time when you helped your boss give you

more productive feedback by sharing what worked and what didn’t with

# them.

Giving feedback isn’t optional for people leaders but making it harder

than it needs to be certainly is.
