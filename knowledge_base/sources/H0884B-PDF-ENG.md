When stafﬁng a project, asking your team to work overtime, or ﬁnding

someone for a last-minute task to meet a deadline, it can sometimes feel

like you need to get your employees to say “yes” at any cost. But what

is that cost? When employees feel pressured or guilted into agreeing

to a request they personally ﬁnd disagreeable it can lead to feelings

of regret, frustration, and resentment. An employee who begrudgingly

agrees to a request in the moment may provide lower-quality assistance

or back out of their commitment at a less convenient time.

Maintaining employee commitment and engagement, not to mention

ensuring that you do not cross lines by unintentionally pressuring

employees to do things they would rather not, takes more than seeking

mere compliance or acquiescence with your requests. It takes obtaining

genuine, voluntary agreement. But many of us don’t know how to make

requests in ways that don’t put pressure on the person we are asking.

# What the Research Shows

Research shows that people feel more pressured to agree to requests

than we realize, frequently agreeing to do things they would rather

not do, such as taking on burdensome, low-promotability work tasks,

allowing access to private digital information, and even engaging in

unethical acts. Simply by asking for something — particularly when we

are in a position of power — we can put someone on the spot because

people frequently ﬁnd it hard to say “no.”

To combat the pressure people feel to agree to requests, numerous

researchers and practitioners have proposed strategies that targets of

requests can use to say no. For example, targets have been counseled to

use self-aﬃrmations, refusal frames (e.g., saying “I don’t do X” instead

of “I can’t do X”), and “positive no’s,” or “yes, no, yes,” strategies to help

them say no to requests they would rather not agree to.

However, such interventions place the burden of saying no entirely

on the target of the request. Further, these interventions can be questionably eﬀective and impractical, often requiring targets to

come up with elaborate multi-part responses that are unrealistic to

implement when they’re put on the spot in the moment.

As an alternative approach, then, how might requesters formulate

requests that leave targets feeling more empowered to make their own

genuinely voluntary choices? A common strategy requesters use is to

add something along the lines of “but you are free to say no” at the end of a request. Yet research ﬁnds that such assurances have little eﬀect on

how free targets actually feel to say no. Targets generally know they can

turn down a request; the real problem is knowing how to do so — that is,

ﬁnding the words in the moment to say no while saving face.

# How to Make a Request

Here are three research-backed suggestions for how to elicit a more

voluntary “yes” when making a request:

Give people time to respond.

It can be hard for people to come up with the words to say “no”

when they are put on the spot. The loss for words we experience in

the moment can ultimately make agreement feel like the path of least

resistance. To ensure that someone isn’t agreeing simply because they didn’t have enough time to come up with the words to say “no,” oﬀer

them time to think. You can do this by making your request and then

adding, for example, “Don’t answer right now. Think about it and get

# back to me tomorrow.”

Ask them to respond over email.

Email isn’t a perfect medium, but it does have its advantages. One of the

advantages is that it allows you to write and rewrite a potential refusal as

many times as you would like until you feel satisﬁed with your response.

Whether truly necessary or not, some people feel the need to say very

speciﬁc things to make themselves feel comfortable enough to say no.

Email allows for that. An obvious way to allow someone to respond to

a request via email is to ask via email. But even if you want to make

your case in-person, you can still tell the other person to email you their

# response.

Share an example of how to say “no.”

In our research, we have identiﬁed another way to formulate a request

so that it leads people to feel freer to say “no,” even when issued in

person: Giving them the words to say “no” as part of your request.

In two studies, we had trained research assistants ask participants a

sensitive request that most people would prefer to refuse: to unlock

## their password-protected smartphones and hand them over for the

research assistant to look through in another room. In one condition,

the researcher assistants told the participants they could refuse: “If

you’d like to refuse, you may do so.” In another condition, they told

participants how to refuse by giving them a speciﬁc phrase they could

use: “If you’d like to refuse, please say the words, ‘I’d rather not.’” While

this intervention had little impact on whether participants ultimately

agreed to this request, those who were given speciﬁc words to say no felt

freer to do so, suggesting that their agreement felt more voluntary.

If your goal is to solicit an employee’s genuine preference, rather than

simply pressuring them to agree, the above strategies can help you get

# to more than just yes.
