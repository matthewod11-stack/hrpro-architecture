Research shows cross-cultural experience may help people spot opportunities. by Peter Vandor and Nikolaus Franke

## What do Arianna Hufﬁngton (Hufﬁngton Post), Dietrich Mateschitz

## (Red Bull), Elon Musk (Tesla, SpaceX), and Sergey Brin (Google) have in

## common? Apart from their success as entrepreneurs, they all share one

## distinct characteristic: extensive cross-cultural experience. Huﬃngton

grew up in Athens and studied in London before starting her career

as a politician and media entrepreneur. Mateschitz spent considerable

time overseas as a marketing salesman prior to founding Red Bull. Musk

migrated from South Africa to the U.S. as young adult. Brin left the

Soviet Union with his family after facing growing anti-Semitism and

moved to the U.S., where he later cofounded Google.

Their stories are prominent examples of a widespread pattern. In the

U.S., immigrants are almost twice as likely to become entrepreneurs as

native-born U.S. citizens. Immigrants represent 27.5% of the countries’

## entrepreneurs but only around 13% of the population. Similarly, about

one-fourth of all technology and engineering companies started in the

U.S. between 2006 and 2012 had at least one immigrant cofounder.

And this pattern extends beyond the U.S. — data from the 2012

Global Entrepreneurship Monitor showed that the vast majority of

the 69 countries surveyed reported higher entrepreneurial activity

## among immigrants than among natives, especially in growth-oriented

# ventures.

## HBR / Digital Article / Why Are Immigrants More Entrepreneurial?

Research has suggested that selection and discrimination eﬀects may

be driving this phenomenon. It appears plausible that entrepreneurial

individuals are more likely to migrate and that immigration policies

in many countries favor highly motivated and capable individuals.

## Additionally, discrimination against immigrants in labor markets may

exert pressure on them to seek self-employment.

In a recent study, we investigated a diﬀerent explanation: Cross-

cultural experiences may increase individuals’ capabilities to identify promising business ideas. By living in diﬀerent cultures, they encounter

## new products, services, customer preferences, and communication

strategies, and this exposure may allow the transfer of knowledge

## about customer problems or solutions from one country to another. By

applying this kind of arbitrage, a temporary or permanent migrant can

decide to replicate a proﬁtable product or business model available in

one country but not in another. Successful companies such as Starbucks (inspired by coﬀeehouses in Italy) and the German online retailer

Zalando (inspired by Zappos) exemplify the potential of this strategy.

Cross-cultural experiences may also stimulate creativity. Interacting

with two or more cultural contexts can help immigrants combine

diverse ideas, solutions, and customer problems in order to create

something entirely new. This principle is illustrated by the origin story

of Red Bull. When Dietrich Mateschitz traveled to Thailand in the

1980s, he observed the popularity of a cheap energizing drink called

Krating Daeng among truck drivers and construction workers. Finding

that it helped ease his jet lag, he decided to license the product and

sell it in Austria under the name Red Bull Energy Drink. Rather than

simply importing the product, Mateschitz realized the opportunity

to combine the newly obtained knowledge about a product (a drink

## popular among truck drivers) and the knowledge about his home

market (conservative beverages market, growing clubbing scene) into

an entirely new business idea. By adapting size, taste, and brand,

he created the ﬁrst energy drink for the alternative clubbing scene

## — something previously unseen in the Thai and Austrian markets.

We conducted two experiments to ﬁnd evidence that these eﬀects can make immigrants more entrepreneurial. First, we analyzed the eﬀects of

## short-term cross-cultural experiences in a longitudinal ﬁeld experiment.

We tested the entrepreneurial capabilities (i.e., the ability to identify

## proﬁtable business opportunities) of 128 students before and after a

semester of living and studying abroad by asking them to come up with

business ideas in the context of media and food retailing. We did the

same for a control group of 115 students that continued their studies at

their home university. The business opportunities they came up with

were rated by four venture capitalists and industry experts blind to the

source. Results showed a clear pattern (see Figure 1): The group that

gained cross-cultural experience received signiﬁcantly higher VC and

expert ratings (+17%) on their business ideas after their semester abroad,

while the ratings of the control group’s business ideas actually declined

## slightly (-3%) at the end of the semester.

We also conducted a laboratory experiment in which we tested these same eﬀects with a sample that had long-term cross-cultural

experiences — 96 migrant entrepreneurs in Austria. We randomly

assigned them to two groups. Applying a technique called priming,

we asked the experimental group to recall particular experiences

while living abroad, thereby activating the memories and associations

connected to their cross-cultural experience. The control group was

asked to recall neutral experiences that were not related to cross-

cultural memories. Both groups were invited to come up with business

ideas that were then rated by experts. The business ideas of the group

with activated cross-cultural experience were rated signiﬁcantly higher

## (27%) by experts than the ideas of the control group.

In order to better understand this phenomenon, we interviewed all

96 participants after the experiment, asking them to describe how

they generated ideas. These interviews were coded independently by

two raters. Results showed that many participants had indeed applied

## knowledge arbitrage (e.g., “Innovative shop concepts such as [name

of Asian supermarket chain] are missing in Vienna”) and creative

recombination (e.g., “In France, I have seen supermarkets that were so

big that all employees were wearing rollerblades….In my concept I also

tried to use space as design concept to impress”) to identify proﬁtable

# business opportunities.

The ﬁnding that cross-cultural experiences increase opportunity

recognition capabilities has clear implications for businesses,

entrepreneurs, and policy makers. It highlights the value of cross-

## cultural work experience or a migration experience for entrepreneurs

and entrepreneurial companies. Entrepreneurs and managers can

actively seek to build such experiences by living abroad and

systematically comparing what they observe in other markets. In

## multinational businesses, human resource management tools such as

expatriate assignments or international job rotations can help build opportunity recognition skills. To make these tools even more eﬀective,

managers can complement them with entrepreneurship training prior

to an international assignment. Furthermore, priming instruments like

the ones in our experiments could be used while living abroad and

afterward to spur business ideation.

For companies, ignoring the positive eﬀect of cross-cultural experience

on opportunity recognition may be harmful. If expatriates with good

ideas receive no chance to exploit them within a company, they might

choose to do so outside of it. Previous research has identiﬁed that many

expatriates choose to leave their organizations soon after ﬁnishing an overseas assignment, when they suﬀer from a lack of promotion

opportunities, career counseling, and status. Our results suggest that

some of them might do this in order to exploit opportunities to become

# entrepreneurs.

Implications of our research also extend to the ﬁeld of immigration

policy. The United Nations estimates that there are over 240 million

temporary and permanent migrants and refugees worldwide. Our

results help explain the above-average entrepreneurial activity of this group and highlight the positive eﬀects that immigration can have

on an economy. We show that migration does not need to be a

## zero-sum game or a “war for talent,” with migrating entrepreneurs

increasing entrepreneurial activity in one country at the expense of

another. Instead, migration can help nurture entrepreneurial abilities

by fostering the learning and application of cross-cultural knowledge

that helps someone identify proﬁtable opportunities.

Since immigration is increasingly seen by some people as a threat,

the insight that more immigration may result in an overall gain in

entrepreneurial activity may be a useful reminder of the opportunities

associated with migration. It suggests that public money may be

## better spent on building incubators for migrant entrepreneurs than on

building border walls.
