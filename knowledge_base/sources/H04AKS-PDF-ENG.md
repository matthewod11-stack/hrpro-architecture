## How People Analytics Can Help You Change Process, Culture, and Strategy

It seems like every business is struggling with the concept of

transformation. Large incumbents are trying to keep pace with digital

upstarts., and even digital native companies born as disruptors know

that they need to transform. Take Uber: at only eight years old, it’s

already upended the business model of taxis. Now it’s trying to move

from a software platform to a robotics lab to build self-driving cars.

And while the number of initiatives that fall under the umbrella

of “transformation” is so broad that it can seem meaningless, this

breadth is actually one of the defining characteristic that differentiates

transformation from ordinary change. A transformation is a whole

portfolio of change initiatives that together form an integrated program.

And so a transformation is a system of systems, all made up of the

most complex system of all — people. For this reason, organizational

transformation is uniquely suited to the analysis, prediction, and

## experimental research approach of the people analytics field.

People analytics — defined as the use of data about human behavior,

relationships and traits to make business decisions — helps to

replace decision making based on anecdotal experience, hierarchy and

risk avoidance with higher-quality decisions based on data analysis,

prediction, and experimental research. In working with several dozen

Fortune 500 companies with Microsoft’s Workplace Analytics division,

we’ve observed companies using people analytics in three main ways to

help understand and drive their transformation efforts.

In core functional or process transformation initiatives — which are

often driven by digitization — we’ve seen examples of people analytics

being used to measure activities and find embedded expertise. In one

example, a people analytics team at a global CPG company was enlisted

to help optimize a financial process that took place monthly in every

country subsidiary around the world. The diversity of local accounting

rules precluded perfect standardization, and the geographic dispersion

of the teams made it hard for the transformation group to gather

information the way they normally would — in conversation.

So instead of starting with discovery conversations, people analytics

data was used to baseline the time spent on the process in every

country, and to map the networks of the people involved. They

discovered that one country was 16% percent more efficient than the

average of the rest of the countries: they got the same results in 71

fewer person-hours per month and with 40 fewer people involved each

month. The people analytics team was surprised — as was finance team

in that country, which had no reason to benchmark themselves against

other countries and had no idea that they were such a bright spot. The

transformation office approached the country finance leaders with their

findings and made them partners in process improvement for the rest of

# the subsidiaries.

It’s unlikely the CPG company would have been able to recognize and

replicate these bright spots if they had undertaken transformation with

a top-down approach. And, perhaps more importantly, it involved and

engaged the people on the ground who had unwittingly discovered a

better way of doing things.

In bottoms-up cultural transformation initiatives, the how things are done is equally or more important than what is done. Feedback loops

and other methods of data-driven storytelling are our favorite way that

people analytics makes culture transformation happen. Often times,

facts can change the conversation from tired head-nodding to curiosity.

One people analytics team in an engineering company was struggling

to help develop the company’s managers, for example. Managers often

perpetuated a “sink or swim” culture that didn’t fit the company’s

aspirations to be an inclusive, humane workplace. The data analysis

found that teams whose managers spent at least 16 minutes of one-on-

one time with each direct per week had 30% percent more engaged

direct reports than the average manager, who spent just 9 minutes per

week with directs. When they brought that data-driven story to the front

lines, suddenly a platitude was transformed into a useful benchmark

that got the attention of managers. In this way, data storytelling is a

lightweight way to build trust among stakeholders and bring behavioral

# science to culture transformation.

Top-down strategic transformation is often made necessary by

## market and technology factors outside the company, but here people

analytics is a critical factor for execution. A people analytics team can

serve as an instrument panel of sorts to track resources, boundaries,

## capacity, time use, networks, skill sets, performance, and mindsets that

can help pinpoint where change is possible and can measure what

happens when you try it.

One people analytics team at a financial services company was trying to

help the CEO manage growth while he worked to instill a new culture in

which departments would be asked to run leaner and more competitive

in the market – “scrappy” and “hungry” were terms that often came

up. As the transformation accelerated, teams were asked to do more

with less, generate more data, and make decisions faster. Amid this,

department leaders began to hear anecdotes about burnout and change

fatigue and questioned whether the pace was sustainable. To address

this, the people analytics team provided their CEO with a dashboard

showing the number of hours that knowledge workers were active for in

different teams. When an entire team is over-utilized, he knows they

can’t handle more change, while under- or unevenly utilized teams

might be more receptive. He can also slice the dashboard by tenure,

to learn whether recent hires have been effectively onboarded before

approving new hire requests to absorb extra work.

As organizations increasingly look to data to help them in their

transformation efforts, it’s important to remember that this doesn’t

just mean having more data or better charts. It’s about mastering

the organizational muscle of using data to make better decisions; to

hypothesize, experiment, measure and adapt. It’s not easy. But through

## careful collection and analysis of the right data, a major transformation

can be a little less daunting – and hopefully a little more successful.
