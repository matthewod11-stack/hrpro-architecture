Project managers, in theory, are some of the best candidates to

become CEOs of their organizations. In their daily work, they must

bring together all the disparate aspects of theory, reality, vision,

process, ﬁnances, value, politics, and human nature to create successful

outcomes. When you demonstrate success in managing enterprise-level

## projects and organizational resources from a holistic perspective, you

should be a viable candidate to move up to a CEO-level position.

Especially now that we have entered the project economy.

# HBR / Digital Article / The Leap from Project Manager to CEO Is Hard — But Not Impos…

However, in reality, CEOs hardly ever come from a project management

position. The journey from project manager to CEO is often challenging,

marked by what I call the “Gantt ceiling.” This is the barrier that

represents the hurdles and limitations that project management

professionals encounter as they aspire to reach the highest echelons

of executive leadership. To illustrate this phenomenon, let’s look at two

real-life stories of talented individuals who faced career stagnation in

## their respective roles as project manager and as director of a project

# management oﬃce (PMO).

# Sarah’s Struggle

Sarah, a highly skilled project manager with a decade of experience,

had successfully overseen numerous complex projects. Her planning,

discipline, strong execution capabilities, and ability to navigate across

silos were widely recognized within her organization. However, despite

her stellar track record, Sarah found herself hitting a roadblock in her

# career.

Despite her competence, Sarah struggled to break through the Gantt

ceiling. Her aspirations to climb the corporate ladder and reach an

executive position were met with resistance. Her project management

background, while valuable, was not enough to be considered for an

open C-level role. Her application was turned down due to a lack of

broader strategic experience that was expected for an executive role.

Sarah’s career appeared stalled, leaving her with unanswered questions

# about her professional future.

# John’s Dilemma

John, another accomplished professional, had risen through the ranks

to become the director of a project management oﬃce (PMO) in a

large multinational corporation. His role involved overseeing project

portfolios, optimizing processes, and ensuring project alignment with

organizational goals. While John excelled in his PMO role, he had

ambitions of one day becoming the CEO.

However, as he sought opportunities for advancement, John

encountered a dilemma: The path from PMO director to CEO was not

well deﬁned, and his career progression seemed to stall at the level of

PMO leadership. Despite his managerial skills and strategic thinking,

John struggled to convince stakeholders that he possessed the qualities

required to lead the entire organization.

These real-life stories are poignant examples of the challenges project

management professionals face when aiming for the CEO position.

Before looking at the reasons for this stagnation, let’s look at the typical

## career paths of CEOs and project managers.

## Divergent Career Paths: CEO vs. Project Manager

CEOs typically follow a sprawling path that leads them through

various traditional functional areas such as ﬁnance, sales, marketing,

operations, or research and development. They are groomed for

leadership roles from early in their careers. They must provide

direction, make strategic decisions, and inspire their teams. As

they progress through their careers, they gain exposure to diverse

organizational functions and often international experience, equipping

## them with a holistic understanding of how the business operates and

relevant expertise to the organization’s strategic needs. They may have

opportunities to serve as chief operating oﬃcers (COOs) or in other

high-level positions before assuming the CEO role. This transitional

phase allows them to develop executive competencies, which we’ll

# outline shortly.

In contrast, the career path of a project manager is often characterized

by a more conﬁned, linear progression. They typically begin as

project coordinators or junior project managers, gaining experience in

planning, execution, and reporting. Advancement often means taking

on larger and more complex projects, but the focus remains primarily

on project management skills. Project managers also exhibit leadership

skills but primarily within the scope of their projects. Their focus is

on eﬃcient project execution and stakeholder management rather than

broader organizational leadership. While project managers may work on projects across diﬀerent departments, they often have limited exposure

## to the overall functioning of various business units.

## Why Project Managers Get Stuck at the Gantt Ceiling

Despite possessing valuable skills and competencies, a project

manager’s career shift toward an executive role is hindered by four

# common factors.

Clear trajectory versus conﬁned path.

As seen in the previous section, CEOs have a more straightforward

trajectory than project managers. Their career path emphasizes speciﬁc

expertise that also resonates with the organization’s broader needs,

giving these candidates an unbeatable advantage.

## Specialized expertise versus broad leadership.

Project managers’ know-how lies in projects, which are often far from

the daily challenges of running an organization. Transitioning to top

leadership positions, such as CEO, usually requires broader leadership

skills encompassing strategic vision, ﬁnancial acumen, and strong

commercial capabilities. Project management professionals often lack

## exposure to these aspects in their specialized roles.

Limited role models versus countless examples. Visionary CEOs like Steve Jobs, Elon Musk, and Warren Buﬀett are

celebrated for their exceptional leadership. However, when it comes to

CEOs with a background in project management, the examples are far

less common. While there are exceptions — such as Klaus Kleinfeld,

who served as CEO of Siemens, and Jorgen Vig Knudstorp, who became

the CEO of LEGO — these instances are relatively rare. This scarcity

of visible PM-turned-CEO role models makes it challenging for project

managers to envision their path to CEO positions.

# Tactical versus executive mindset.

Moving from a project management role to an executive position requires a diﬀerent mindset. CEOs are known for their executive

attitude, encompassing a holistic view of organizational strategy, solid

## ﬁnancial judgement and insight, and adept navigation of complex

business landscapes. In contrast, project managers often operate with

a tactical mindset, which is crucial for eﬃciently executing projects but

is a limitation to reaching higher levels in the organization.

# Outstanding Exceptions

While Sarah, John, and countless others faced career stagnation, some

exceptions highlight the potential for project managers to reach the

# pinnacle of corporate leadership.

Alan Mulally is one of the most remarkable examples of a project

management expert becoming a CEO. He began his career as an

engineer at Boeing, where he gained experience managing large

projects related to aircraft development. Later, he was appointed as

## the president and CEO of Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Mulally’s

project management background and ability to lead large-scale

initiatives positioned him as the ideal candidate to eventually take

the helm at Ford Motor Company in 2006. As Ford’s CEO, he steered

the company through a ﬁnancial crisis, implementing successful

turnaround strategies. His sharp project management sense was crucial

in revitalizing Ford.

Another great example is Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft, who has

roots in project management. Nadella joined Microsoft in 1992 and held

various leadership roles, including leading the company’s cloud and

enterprise division. His background in managing complex technology

projects and his strategic vision were instrumental in his appointment

as CEO in 2014. Under Nadella’s leadership, Microsoft transitioned

into a cloud-ﬁrst, mobile-ﬁrst company and experienced signiﬁcant

growth. His project management skills played a role in orchestrating

# this transformation.

Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann is another example of a renowned leader

with a background in leading transformative projects. She served as the

CEO of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, one of the world’s largest

philanthropic organizations. In her role, she oversaw numerous projects

and initiatives to improve global health, reduce poverty, and expand

access to education. Prior to joining the foundation in 2014, she was

## chancellor of the University of California at San Francisco, where she

oversaw an in-depth review of their business model and developed a

comprehensive strategic plan, which she successfully implemented.

The career path of these remarkable CEOs is a vivid demonstration

of how project management expertise can be leveraged to lead

# organizations.

## Nine Attributes to Boost your CEO Potential

If you’re a project manager who is looking to transition to executive

leadership, it’s important to understand and develop the essential skills.

Russell Reynolds, a leading executive search company, analyzed the

characteristics of nearly 4,000 executives, including more than 130 CEOs, and found they possessed the following nine diﬀerentiating

# attributes:

- 1. Forward thinking

In project management, forward thinking involves creating

comprehensive plans while considering long-term goals. To transition

to a CEO perspective, actively participate in strategic planning sessions,

contribute to deﬁning the organization’s future direction, and align your

projects with these strategic objectives. Stay informed about industry

trends and emerging technologies that can shape the future of your

# business.

- 2. Calculated risk taking

In projects, risk management is crucial. To develop a CEO’s comfort

with calculated risks, take on projects where you need to assess and

mitigate risks strategically. Gradually expand your risk tolerance and

## learn from the outcomes of your risk-management decisions.

- 3. Bias toward action

Project managers are action oriented by nature. To align with a CEO

mindset, focus on the broader impact of your actions. Participate in

decision-making processes beyond your project’s scope and engage in

cross-functional initiatives to inﬂuence outcomes. Continuously reﬁne

your project leadership skills, emphasizing eﬃcient execution.

- 4. Optimism

Optimism in project management involves maintaining a positive

outlook during challenging project phases. To elevate this mindset,

mentor and motivate your project team members, emphasizing chances

for learning and growth. Cultivate a positive outlook by focusing on

opportunities rather than obstacles. Develop a collective resilience to

## bounce back from setbacks and inspire perseverance in your team.

- 5. Constructively tough-minded

Project managers need to be resilient when facing project setbacks. To

further develop this trait, actively seek feedback, even when critical.

Train yourself to handle criticism and adversity with composure. Seek

mentorship from experienced leaders who can guide you in developing

# resilience and tough-mindedness.

- 6. Efﬁcient reader of people

Interpersonal skills are vital in project management. To become a better

## reader of people, practice active listening during project meetings and

cultivate an understanding of team dynamics — work on resolving

conﬂicts constructively. Practice empathy to better understand diverse

perspectives within your team and stakeholders. Develop emotional intelligence to navigate complex interpersonal dynamics eﬀectively.

- 7. Measured emotion

Maintaining composure during high-stress situations is essential in

projects. Enhance this skill by practicing mindfulness and stress-

management techniques. Learn to express emotions appropriately

while maintaining control. Avoid impulsive, emotional reactions.

- 8. Pragmatic inclusiveness

Project managers often collaborate with diverse teams. To be

## pragmatically inclusive, actively seek input from team members with

varied perspectives and backgrounds. Involve team members in critical

decisions while maintaining the ﬁnal authority as needed. Promote an

inclusive work environment where diverse viewpoints are valued and

considered.

- 9. Willingness to trust

Trust is foundational in project management. Build trust by

consistently delivering on commitments and being transparent in your

communication. Extend trust to team members and stakeholders and

foster an environment of mutual reliance. Develop strong relationships with individuals across diﬀerent functions and backgrounds. Be reliable

and trustworthy in your interactions, earning the trust of your

# colleagues and superiors.

The stories of Sarah, John, and leaders like Alan Mulally, Satya Nadella,

and Dr. Susan Desmond-Hellmann shed light on project managers’

challenges and opportunities when aiming for the CEO’s oﬃce. While

the Gantt ceiling may seem like an insurmountable barrier, it’s essential

to recognize that project management skills, strategic thinking, and

leadership acumen can pave the way for remarkable career transitions.

The path from project manager to CEO may not be straightforward,

but it is achievable. It requires a proactive approach, continuous skill

development, and the ability to demonstrate value beyond the conﬁnes

of project management. Aspiring leaders can draw inspiration from

those who have successfully made the journey, turning their project

## management roots into the foundation for impactful CEO careers.

To address the Gantt ceiling project managers should actively practice

the nine executive attributes, seek opportunities to develop a holistic

skill set, gain exposure to diverse business functions, and communicate

their readiness for leadership roles. At the same time, organizations

should proactively identify and nurture those project managers with

leadership potential. In the project economy, CEOs are often de facto

project managers during times of change and crisis. Let’s redeﬁne career

paths for project managers that reﬂect this reality.
