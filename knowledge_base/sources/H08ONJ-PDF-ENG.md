In January, the Chinese startup DeepSeek rattled the AI world, tech

stocks, and Wall Street darling NVIDIA when it released an open-source

model that was smaller, more eﬃcient, and signiﬁcantly cheaper to

build than products from leading U.S. companies. DeepSeek quickly

jumped to the top of app-store charts, and the moment was declared a

# wakeup call for western AI companies.

## HBR / Digital Article / What DeepSeek Can Teach Us About Resourcefulness

While the tech industry wrestles with DeepSeek’s implications, the

excitement risks overshadowing its deeper and broader insights for

# companies and industries.

Resourcefulness, not resources or technology, is the real story and

insight behind what DeepSeek achieved.

# Resources vs. Resourcefulness

Resources are what most companies ﬁght for internally. It’s why they

court investors and capital markets. It’s what the budgeting process is

all about. Resources can be ﬁnancial, physical, human, or intellectual

property. They are everything one ﬁnds on the asset side of a company’s

# balance sheet.

Resourcefulness, in contrast, is not about the resources a company has,

it’s about the ability to creatively leverage the world’s constellation of

knowledge, expertise, resources, and capabilities, even without owning

them. Resourcefulness allows you to achieve much more than you could

accomplish using only your own resources and capabilities—and to do

so at lower cost, with less capital, and often with greater expertise and

# speed than you could on your own.

In the case of AI, while the industry espoused the need for hundreds

of billions of dollars in investments, DeepSeek reportedly didn’t use the

best GPU chips. It didn’t invest 10 years and billions to develop. And

it didn’t rest on the most advanced hardware. DeepSeek was developed

at a fraction of the cost and time of what investors have been told is

necessary to build a powerful AI model.

# How?

DeepSeek prioritized creativity instead of brute-force scaling like the

rest of the industry. The company saw that it could bypass the expense

of the most advanced AI hardware by leveraging synthetic data and

creative algorithms, and distilling knowledge from existing AI models,

building on top of them rather than starting from scratch.

Yet, resources are the metric most companies focus on to move the

## needle. And the more competitive or “hot” the industry—think a

bloody red ocean or fast-growing AI—the greater tend to be cries

for more resources. Far fewer prioritize or understand the paths to

# resourcefulness.

This is a tremendous missed opportunity.

# Four Paths to Mastering Resourcefulness

## Our research over the last decades on Blue Ocean Strategy and Beyond

Disruption drives home the central role of resourcefulness to dial up

value and lower costs in realizing opportunities. It allows companies

to create—often rapidly—a win for the market and for themselves by

leveraging creativity and ingenuity.

What if instead of focusing on resources, companies put as much

focus on resourcefulness? How could a focus on resourcefulness

potentially increase the value a company is able to deliver and lower

# the costs of its business model?

Here we explore four ways blue ocean companies regularly leverage

resourcefulness to realize opportunities, and you can too.

- 1. Harness online knowledge to build your capability.

It has never been easier to do your own research, ﬁnd answers, or

develop new capabilities. At no cost you can learn sales techniques from

a podcast,3D printing for mass manufacturing on YouTube, coding from

Khan Academy, or skills such as design, sourcing, ﬁnance, packaging,

or taxation. There’s a whole world of free knowledge and education

out there for anyone to take advantage of—though most people and

organizations don’t. With OpenAI, online knowledge is further enriched

and ready to be tapped at little-to-no cost.

Consider the company Not Impossible Labs. It set out to create a

brand-new opportunity for the deaf to experience live music just as the

nondeaf do. It called the project Music: Not Impossible.

## Neither Mick Ebeling, the head of Not Impossible Labs, nor Daniel

Belquer, who led the project, had the requisite expertise to make

this happen. Neither is a scientist, a brain specialist, or a doctor

of audiology, but they scoured the internet for scientiﬁc studies on

vibration and the auditory functioning of the ear. They learned that

it’s not the ears, it’s the brain that “hears” as vibrations are captured

through the ear. This revelation, among others, led them to the

realization that while vibrations can’t be captured by the ears of the

deaf, they could be relayed to the brain via the skin to simulate

the experience of music. With this knowledge they created wearable

technology to realize Music: Not Impossible.

Through resourcefulness, Ebeling and Belquer were able to leverage—

essentially at no cost—the best knowledge out there to make Music: Not

Impossible possible and overcome obstacles as they built it.

Ask yourself: What knowledge do you need to realize your business

model and opportunity? Make a list and start searching the internet or

leveraging AI. Begin with broad parameters to cast your knowledge net

wide. Then narrow your search as you gain clarity on the speciﬁcs you

need to zoom in on and which key players may have the expertise that

you can learn from.

- 2. Identify and utilize outside resources to your advantage.

Resourcefulness often comes from identifying and taking advantage of

## resources, talents, expertise, and capabilities outside your organization.

For example, when Jim McKelvey and Jack Dorsey set out to create the

market of credit card payments for microbusinesses and individuals,

they had the idea for the Square Reader—a small, unencumbered

little device that people could use anywhere to swipe a credit card for

payment. Only how could the payment be processed and relayed to the

# credit card company?

Instead of betting on resources, McKelvey started looking outside for

what he could leverage. He observed that the iPhone could act as a

newspaper, a TV, a camera, a map, a photo album, and even a stereo. So

why couldn’t Square leverage the technology inherent in this device to

# process credit cards?

That’s exactly what Square did. The Square Reader plugs straight into

## the headphone jack on the iPhone or any smartphone. Because the

headphone jack is a universal and open standard, Square didn’t need to

partner with or pay Apple or Samsung for the use of their device. In this

way, what could easily have been a costly element to build came at a

# price tag of near to zero for Square.

Ask yourself: Who from outside your organization has the resources

you lack? Which organization or organizations have the technical

expertise or capabilities you need? How can you creatively leverage

## their expertise, capabilities, and economies of scale to substantially

pare down your costs and close any capability gaps you may have at

# a substantially lower cost?

- 3. Look to other ﬁelds and industries for innovative ideas and solutions. Resoucefulness can come from purposefully looking beyond your

## business to other industries, other ﬁelds, or parallel situations to

identify creative practices that could be applied to realize your

# opportunity.

## Perry Chen, Yancey Strickler, and Charles Adler, who founded

Kickstarter, looked far back in time to understand how artists had

historically gotten their work funded. They found that it wasn’t simply

a matter of the Medici family or the church coming in to fund artistic

work. In a number of instances, a large audience had funded a creative

## work—such as Alexander Pope’s translation of the Iliad from Greek to

English. For that endeavor, 750 people provided funding and in return

got their names inscribed in the ﬁrst edition. That was an important

clue to how Kickstarter could get around monetary incentives for funders and instead oﬀer other rewards, such as recognition on an

artist’s website.

## Likewise, to realize Sesame Street, Joan Ganz Cooney borrowed

practices from the advertising industry—from songs to color to speed

to alliteration—to hold kids’ attention and get ideas to stick in their

minds. And the video gaming industry looked to worldwide sports to

gain insight into how to realize e-sports leagues and host global e-sports

championship competitions, including how to create the hype, get the

word out, and monetize the competitions through broadcast licensing.

Ask yourself: What other industries, domains, analogous situations, or points in time might oﬀer insights into how to solve your challenge?

Think freely and broadly as you answer this question to ﬁnd innovative

ideas or ways to overcome the hurdles you confront and ﬁll in the

missing pieces of the puzzle you set out to solve fast and at lower cost.

- 4. Leverage social capital to realize your opportunity.

## “Social capital”—the norms, understandings, bonds, and mutual

commitments of people who live in a particular society or community—

can be another opportunity for resourcefulness.

In the late 1970s, Muhammad Yunus wanted to ﬁnd a way to provide

credit and banking services to Bangladesh’s rural poor. To get around

the fact that his customers had no collateral, he leveraged their tight

social bonds to ensure that loans were repaid and that the funds

borrowed were used for productive means to help break the cycle of

# poverty.

Yunus founded Grameen Bank, the ﬁrst microﬁnance institution, with

the requirement that at least ﬁve villagers had to come together to form

a mutually supportive unit before the bank would extend a tiny loan to

one member designated by the group. Only after that person regularly

repaid the loan for several months could another member of the group

request a loan. This practice created not-so-subtle peer pressure for

no member to default and naturally incentivized groups to select only

members who feel a sense of kinship and a high moral obligation to not

let the other members down. The codependence also inspired members

to step up and help any member of the group who may be struggling,

making each borrower more reliable in the process.

By uncovering and leveraging existing but unutilized social capital,

Grameen Bank not only made ﬁnancial capital accessible for the ﬁrst

time to the extremely poor, it also achieved a repayment rate that’s

consistently above 90%. Furthermore, it took the costs attached to loan

## approval, enforcement, collection, and contracts down signiﬁcantly.

Ask yourself: Beyond market-based economic means, is there social

capital you can leverage? What social norms, established bonds of

## trust, mutual commitments, or high-level aligned interests might you

leverage to realize your business opportunity?

. . .

Resources are a key hurdle faced by many organizations—not

only small, bootstrapped ﬁrms, but also large ones where ﬁghting

for resources can be just as tough. Especially in today’s resource-

constrained environment, mastering the paths to resourcefulness

couldn’t be more valuable. Beyond AI, the success of DeepSeek reminds

## us of the importance of resourcefulness as a key component of strategy.
