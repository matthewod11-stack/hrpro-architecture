its own software to record how long employees spend on Zoom calls,

## emails, and spreadsheets, among other activities.

These real-world examples are part of a growing movement to track

employee productivity through increasingly sophisticated technology,

such as desktop surveillance, biometric smart badges, location tracking,

or desk heat sensors. While this trend preceded the pandemic, it’s only

accelerated with employees’ continued interest in hybrid or remote

work arrangements. One recent report suggested that nearly 80% of

employers were engaging in some electronic monitoring of employees.

The ultimate decision to use these technologies typically comes from

upper management. However, the reality is that implementation and

utilization of such systems typically falls on supervisors.

With this in mind, we set out to better understand two critical questions:

First, to what extent do employees blame their supervisors for the

monitoring? Second, can the supervisor do anything to alleviate the

# repercussions of monitoring?

We suspected that if supervisors could not control whether to use the monitoring systems, they may be able to control how they use the

information from these systems. Speciﬁcally, we expected that whether

supervisors used the system for control (i.e., performance evaluation)

or feedback (i.e., performance development) purposes would determine whether their relationship with their subordinates would suﬀer from

using monitoring systems.

We conducted two studies to assess our predictions. First, we conducted

an online experiment with 186 U.S.-based participants, recruited from

the crowdsourcing platform Proliﬁc Academic. Half were told that a

study administrator would access their webcam to record their activities

and monitor their computers to prevent cheating on a work test. To

increase the believability of the experiment, we temporarily activated

the participants’ webcams to simulate recording; in reality, participants’

experimental activities were not recorded.

About half of the participants received positive and constructive

feedback from the study administrator following the initial test. Those

who had been monitored were told that this feedback was speciﬁcally

based on the study administrator’s observations.

We also conducted a ﬁeld study with 298 full-time employees and

## their supervisors across a variety of U.S.-based companies. Employees

were asked over several months to complete a series of questionnaires

that measured the extent to which they were being monitored and

how they perceived their relationship with their supervisor. We also

asked supervisors of these employees to rate their subordinates’ work

## performance and counterproductive behavior (deviance).

In both studies, we found that electronic monitoring can erode the

# supervisor-subordinate relationships.

Our results show that when supervisors used monitoring for control

purposes, employees were more prone to engage in deviant behavior

(e.g., time thievery, inattentiveness, cyberloaﬁng, tardiness, etc.) and

their performance decreased.

These ﬁndings didn’t emerge when supervisors used the data for

developmental purposes. When supervisors used information obtained

from monitoring as developmental feedback, employees continued

to trust and maintain positive relationships with their supervisors.

They also performed better in their jobs and engaged in fewer

# counterproductive behaviors.

While employee-tracking software can be intrusive, it also presents

opportunities for gaining profound insights into employee behavior,

such as which applications employees use most frequently or whether

employees are at risk of overworking based on their work patterns and

# productivity.

Based on our research, we oﬀer three suggestions to help organizational

leaders achieve the beneﬁts of these systems while preventing the

# backlash against supervisors.

- 1. Be transparent about using monitoring for developmental feedback.

First, organizational leaders — particularly decision-makers — should

set up monitoring systems to be developmental, and they should

be fully transparent about that purpose. Giving employees advance

notice helps them to mentally prepare for surveillance and to develop

expectations that put pressure on employers to use monitoring in a

# developmental way.

A survey from Gartner Insights showed that employee acceptance of

monitoring surges to 70% when companies simply explain the scope

and purpose of monitoring. This means implementing these systems

with signiﬁcant advance warning, respecting privacy boundaries, and

tracking data that easily translates into developmental tips.

For example, Microsoft’s Viva Insights collects employee data across

various Microsoft platforms (e.g., Teams, Outlook, etc.) to provide

supervisors insights into workﬂow and communication patterns across

entire teams, as well as actionable recommendations for addressing

ineﬃciencies. These types of systems — which emphasize barriers to

success and strategies for improvement — encourage supervisors to use

employee monitoring in a developmental way. They also have greater

potential to be used to promote employee well-being, as they also focus

on unit- and system-level issues that harm individuals.

- 2. Train supervisors on how to deliver feedback derived from monitoring in a developmental, non-punitive way.

Supervisors should be trained to hold discussions about information

collected through monitoring separately from overall performance

evaluations. This helps separate the developmental message from any

rewards or punishments typically associated with formal evaluations.

Discussions based on monitoring data should focus on speciﬁc

behavioral incidents or trends. This allows for feedback delivery using eﬀective frameworks like the Situation-Behavior-Impact (SBI) model.

For example, supervisors should describe the task the employee was

working on, the activity observed through the monitoring system, and

the results this activity contributed to at the time and throughout the

day. This feedback could include observations of both positive and

negative behaviors, emphasizing how to improve in each area.

- 3. Highlight the benefits of performance monitoring — and deliver on your promises.

Because monitoring leads employees to believe their manager is “taking

away” desired beneﬁts, such as autonomy, for monitoring to not “blow up” in supervisors’ faces, the organization must oﬀer something in

# return.

## For example, development-oriented performance monitoring may

provide companies with data about how employee teams can maintain

productivity while working remotely at times, which could be used to oﬀer employees greater remote ﬂexibility.

Additionally, since employee monitoring can empower employees with

## greater knowledge of how their work contributes to higher-level unit

success, supervisors may be able to grant greater authority over their performance goal-setting. Each employee will have diﬀerent views on

what they value, but it’s incumbent upon organizations to consider ways

they can compensate for employees’ lost autonomy.

## While our research oﬀers valuable insights into how supervisors can

best utilize employee monitoring technology, it does not suggest that developmental electronic monitoring is universally eﬀective. As

previous research strongly indicates, certain forms of monitoring can be

highly invasive and may result in a loss of personal agency. Employers run the risk of their monitoring eﬀorts backﬁring, undermining the

very beneﬁts they aim to achieve, such as increased productivity and

reduced deviant behavior, if the monitoring is excessively intrusive and

controlling. Our points relate simply to steps organizations and their

supervisors can take to avoid costly losses associated with monitoring.

In addition to preparing supervisors to use monitoring technology in a

developmental manner, employers should consider the broader context

in which monitoring is introduced. Existing research suggests that

employees are much more likely to accept monitoring and not respond

adversely if they already believe their employer is generally fair.

Companies frequently cast supervisors as passive participants in the

monitoring process, merely tasked with observing and regulating

employee behavior. This type of messaging can pose risks, both to the overall eﬀectiveness of the monitoring process and the relationships

these supervisors have with their subordinates. To address these

risks, organizations that rely on employee monitoring should make

thoughtful choices in how they conduct monitoring and ensure that

supervisors are adequately prepared to utilize the collected information
