Reskilling workers has become a key challenge for many businesses.

Korn Ferry estimates that there will be an 85-million-person talent

shortage by 2030. McKinsey likens the challenge to the shift from

agricultural work to manufacturing that occurred during the early 20th

century. No surprise, then, that training employees tops the agenda

in many organizations, according to a LinkedIn report. The market

for global corporate learning and development (L&D) is $350 billion,

and increasing. Despite this massive industry-wide investment, one

study determined that 75% of senior managers at organizations were

dissatisﬁed with their L&D initiatives. Conversely, Gartner reports that

70% of employees feel they lack the skills required to do their jobs.

There are three systemic reasons for this paradox: 1) an over-reliance

## on classroom training rather than the on-the-job behavioral practice

required by most jobs, 2) a failure to recognize the importance of peer

learning and modeling behavior: most adults learn best by watching

how the best of their peers perform key tasks, and 3) a lack of ongoing

feedback through relevant performance management processes.

In this article we will examine why the shortfall has occurred, what

companies have done to train employees in a more eﬃcient and

interactive way, and how technologies can help make L&D processes more eﬀective.

## Simulation Training and Management Development

Approaches based on proven learning techniques and new technology can improve the eﬀectiveness and eﬃciency of skills training. One

approach is simulation training: putting people in immersive, true-to-

## life scenarios where they practice skills acquisition in situations that

replicate job conditions. These immersive scenarios often incorporate

gaming elements that increase motivation, attention, and learning.

This approach has long been part of skills training in certain sectors.

A study of laparoscopic surgery found that surgeons who trained using

simulations had a 29% increase in speed, a 9 times lower likelihood

of experiencing a stall during surgery, and they were ﬁve times less

likely to cause patient injury. Brigham Women’s Hospital now uses

## the technique for multiple procedures via its STRATUS Center for

upgrading in new conditions, and the on-going motivation that is a by-

product of a good developmental process. Or, as stated more bluntly in

## the “8Ps” of the U.S. Air Force, “Proper Prior Planning and Preparation

# Prevents Piss-Poor Performance.”

Simulation training can help improve core skills in two critical

## components of management development: 1) decision-making and

# collaboration, and 2) change management.

- 1. Decision-Making and Collaboration

A global digital agency sought to improve Managing Directors’ (MDs)

decision-making in three areas: when to collaborate with other MDs,

how to price projects, and staﬃng project teams. In most organizations,

these skills are seen as something you only learn through experience

and, if you’re lucky, with mentors. But it’s no coincidence that

experiential learning is called the “school of hard knocks.” In most

ﬁrms, on-the-job learning is a euphemism for an ad hoc process, not

# a deliberate practice.

The agency had training programs in place, but a game-based solution

called Financial Fitness Simulator enabled more than 300 MDs to

work through scenarios involving discovery conversations with clients,

enlisting support from other service lines, and managing projects while

building a pipeline of prospects. After this initiative, 88% of the MDs

reported a much better understanding of their responsibilities and

improved decision-making skills; 90% said their ability to collaborate

with other lines of business had also improved. These are compelling

results compared to most training initiatives.

The simulation scenarios involved narratives, or plotlines depicting

common work situations. This is a key element in promoting durable

learning. As one summary of the research puts it: “Narrative provides

not only meaning but also a mental framework for imbuing future

experiences and information with meaning, in eﬀect shaping new

memories to ﬁt constructs of the world and ourselves.” Learning

theorists call this “active retrieval.” When people must respond to

diverse circumstances, learning involves the ability to retrieve a

relevant model or scenario, and this ability is extended with each

iteration. In fact, there’s some evidence that this process reshapes

# neural pathways over time.

At the digital agency, the participants moved through scenarios representing diﬀerent stages of the ﬁscal year, types of prospects,

and client projects. They had to balance executing ongoing projects,

adding relevant prospects, coordinating required ﬁrm resources, and prioritizing decision criteria based on trade-oﬀs like focusing resources

## on a smaller repeat customer or a larger but riskier deal. Scenarios

occurred within an immersive environment involving dialogue and

online interaction with other MDs, new and experienced, which gave participants access to collective knowledge about trade-oﬀs and likely

# consequences.

The simulations outperformed any previous classroom training. MDs

engaged with the simulation six times on average, because they could

access this on-demand tool when it ﬁt into their schedules, unlike

scheduled classroom instruction, and with feedback each time they

participated (as opposed to the end of a month-long seminar). With

responses to multiple scenarios captured online, participants develop

situational awareness and identify areas for improvement. This, in

turn, creates more productive learning as participants bring speciﬁc

questions to subsequent sessions. Across ﬁelds, research shows that

people become high performers via deliberate practice of speciﬁc skills

in safe environments. “Role plays” are part of many training initiatives but are typically one-oﬀ sessions with a manager, not easily scalable,

and hampered by fear of judgment from one’s superior. The Financial

Fitness Simulator involved practice in a context where the stakes of

initial failure did not include career risks.

The simulations also incorporated gaming principles. Participants

gained or lost points based on their decisions and with visual and

## audio reﬂections of success or error (e.g., green points and celebratory

## noises for correct answers; red points with a negative sounding

noise for wrong answers), while leaderboards displayed the highest

earners (unless they chose to remain anonymous), allowing learners

to compete for global bragging rights with peers and establish virtual

but real social ties. These gamiﬁed elements are proven techniques for

increasing engagement and motivation. Numerous participants echoed

## the comments of one MD: “I like the interactive nature [and] ability

to go back and try it again, thus learning the ‘why’ behind the right

# answer.”

- 2. Change Management

Dealing with change was a challenge facing Merck in upskilling

650 frontline sales managers in its Healthcare Business. Speed was

important: In this business, a patent clock is ticking, so time and money

are closely correlated. More generally, studies indicate that “I’m too

busy” is the most frequently cited barrier to managerial participation

in training. The ability to deal with diverse buying and regulatory

circumstances was important, too: the initiative involved 40 virtual-

reality simulations for managers across 65 countries, translated into 7

## languages with attention to cultural nuances.

Topics ranged from goal-setting and problem-solving to coaching and

performance reviews. In the simulations, managers met a range of reps with diﬀerent personalities, capabilities, and challenges. Some

are demotivated, while others have diﬃculties getting client meetings,

managing sales conversations, or handling scenarios like a breach of

client data. The simulations are played on managers’ laptops, and

each takes place in a realistic setting like a doctor’s oﬃce, conference

room, oﬃce environment, or on a train. The manager must select

the most appropriate approach to the issue in that setting, weighing

the information available, and then receives feedback about best

practices in that context. The simulation includes more than 200 minigames at diﬀerent levels that build managers’ knowledge of

speciﬁc topics, as well as realistic dialogues with avatars representing

internal and external stakeholders. The dialogues change based on how

managers respond to each scenario, which determines their unique

journey through the simulation — a contrast to the lowest-common-

## denominator approach in much traditional leadership training and

# itself an important motivator.

## Chetak Buaria, Vice President of Global Commercial Operations for

Merck’s Healthcare Business, described the initiative as a “phenomenal success which signiﬁcantly improved the eﬀectiveness of Merck’s sales

# leadership team.”

The reasons for that success are relevant to other upskilling situations.

Compared to training in a classroom setting, Buaria says this new

approach “reduced the training time by 70%, saving over 2,000 working

days of frontline managers’ time.” That’s important in professional development, especially in functions like sales. An eﬀective learning

process should not take net time away from productive selling activities.

The approach also motivated participant engagement. Some managers

devoted dozens of additional hours of their personal time to the

simulations — a remarkable feat for busy sales managers with quotas,

one that is not typically observed in e-learning initiatives. A simulation

approach recognizes a key facet of adult learning: Professionals tend

to pay attention to information when they need it, not weeks earlier

or later in a training seminar. In sales, for example, this is typically

when preparing for a sales call or coaching session or during those

conversations. The simulations allow for just-in-time learning in

contexts and time frames connected to actual job tasks.

Finally, upskilling typically involves frequent updating of content to

changing circumstances. Sales training is an example. Training here

must be a process, not an event. At any point in time, sales reps

and managers are dealing with multiple accounts and a changing

array of people and buying criteria. And the learning must recognize diﬀerences across countries and categories. Compared to other training

initiatives, a virtual simulation can be more easily modiﬁed and in

formats conducive to the manager accessing and practicing skills when

that practice has the most impact.

Simulation opportunities are expanding. The so-called “metaverse” may

or may not deliver on its current hype, but the investments being

made by companies in virtual reality increase training and simulation

options. Meanwhile, outside a classroom, which is where most adults

earn a living, learning is itself a learned behavior. These examples,

grounded in sound theory and supported by increasingly accessible and

ﬂexible technologies, indicate how companies can take advantage of

these developments and address a major societal workforce issue while

getting more from their training investments.
