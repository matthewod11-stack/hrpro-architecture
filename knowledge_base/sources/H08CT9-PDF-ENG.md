There comes a moment in almost every organizational transformation

— even the successful ones — when the program goes oﬀ course and

leaders need to intervene. As researchers who study transformations,

we are often approached by C-suite executives, who ask questions like:

What do I do when things go wrong? How can I detect when things may

be going oﬀ track? Is there a way to use these pivotal moments to my

# advantage?

We refer to these interventions — the moment a leader changes

course when a transformation program has veered oﬀ track — as

“turning points.” Investigating how to identify turning points in a

transformation, and act on them, formed the basis of our new research.

On the face of it, we were surprised by just how ubiquitous turning

points are: Our research, which involved surveys of 846 senior leaders

and 840 workforce members involved in transformation programs,

indicated 96% of all transformations face signiﬁcant challenges that can

derail the whole program, with executives forced to step in. Turning

points can come in the wake of exogenous shocks, such as inﬂation,

supply chain disruption, or political events; operating model issues,

such as the need to change technology, governance, or ways of working;

## or human dynamics, such as employee conﬁdence in or ownership of

# the change.

But perhaps the ubiquity of turning points shouldn’t have been such

a surprise. After all, when a transformation program is launched, the

organization is tipped into liminal space between an old operating

model and a new one that’s yet to be implemented. It’s hardly going

to be a linear process.

## Meanwhile, because of the volatility of today’s world, the organization

is quite likely to be hit by one or more external shocks, be that a

pandemic, supply-chain disruption, hyperinﬂation, rising interest rates,

or geopolitical uncertainty. All of these have happened in the past ﬁve

# years alone.

This is the internal and external context in which turning points

happen, and 80% of executives we surveyed agreed that how they

navigate a turning point — and how early they intervene — can

determine whether the overall transformation continues to stagnate or

if it accelerates performance and improves the outcome. Our research

found successfully navigating a turning point means the transformation

program is 1.9 times more likely to overperform its target KPIs.

# Understanding the Team’s Emotional Energy Is Crucial to Navigating a Turning Point

Our research has focused on transformation as an emotional journey,

and emotions — particularly when negative — provide the earliest

indicator that a transformation is veering oﬀ course. They give leaders

an insight into issues hitting the program; for example, a frontline

worker who is frustrated that a new system doesn’t allow them to serve a

# customer well.

## Emotional energy refers to the collective mood, vibe, and intensity of

emotions within a group. Changes in a group’s emotional energy are

serious and are often a signal of an issue that could require a turning

point. The below chart shows how emotional energy can track against

# the progress of a transformation.

In our research, we pinpointed how a shift in emotional energy was

acted on at Applied Materials. The company had embarked on a ﬁnance

transformation using robotic process automation (RPA). The purpose

was to optimize ﬁnance processes and free up time for team members

to focus on higher-order work. The company had brought in one of the

world’s leading suppliers of RPA to lead the transformation.

But, as with most programs, it didn’t go exactly to plan, and the

transformation leader noticed issues surfacing with this supplier early

on. He later reﬂected:

I was sitting through those workshops at the back, listening to the

interaction and judging how the supplier was answering the tough

questions from the Applied team…They didn’t have an answer. The

Applied Materials team asked two questions and then went silent.

Their internal ﬁlter was saying: “This person doesn’t know what

they’re talking about.”

In this case, there was no hard data for the leader to fall back on. But his

presence — sitting in the workshops, speaking to colleagues outside the

meetings — enabled him to detect a shift in the team’s emotional energy

that would harm the transformation eﬀorts. He saw his workforce had

lost conﬁdence in the supplier. Before it was too late, he was able to act,

bringing in a new external team that engaged more eﬀectively with the

# Applied workers.

## How Successful Leaders Navigate a Turning Point

So, what did we see in our data that allows organizations to

navigate these ubiquitous turning points successfully? Our model

identiﬁed a dynamic three-step process that, if followed, increases the

likelihood that a turning point intervention will signiﬁcantly improve

## transformation performance by 12 times: from 6% to 72%.

- 1. They look for shifts in the team’s emotional energy.

The ﬁrst step is leaders sensing for signals that something is amiss, that

there’s been a shift in energy among the workforce. Transformations

often begin with optimism — even excitement. But when the reality of this diﬃcult work hits home, there is a danger of energy becoming

stagnant — or in the worst cases, becoming so negative that people start

to work against the program.

Most organizations use dashboard metrics to track progress and detect

problems. However, these are lagging indicators that reﬂect past

performance rather than leading indicators to inform future action. The

behavior and emotional energy of transformation teams are the early

warning system.

Leaders should look for shifting energy in two places. The ﬁrst is within

themselves: their visceral reaction to where a group has moved to. It

might be a feeling in the gut, or a tingling of the skin, but it’s a personal,

instinctive reaction, which is the most immediate data anyone can

acquire. Second, leaders can sense signals from their interactions with

people. How are they behaving? Has their emotional energy changed? If

that is the case, it is the signal something has gone wrong and needs to

# change.

## Our research identiﬁed six speciﬁc emotional and behavioral signals

leaders should look for in their teams:

- Lack of clarity on how to proceed, often accompanied by a spike in

anxiety or static energy levels as teams can’t make progress.

- Delays, slow progress, or missed milestones, which can trigger

frustration, stress, and anxiety, and lead to teams stopping working

or pulling away from the program.

- Ineﬀective collaboration, or when groups retreat to silos instead of

working together to solve complex problems. In this case you might

see the language shift from “we” to “you” as teams regress to an “us vs.

them” mindset.

- Increase in negative emotions, such as anger or frustration, as

problems go unaddressed or employees feel close to burnout.

- Mistakes and misunderstandings, which occur when people start to

doubt themselves or don’t feel psychologically safe.

- Decreased engagement or communication, when employees go

quiet, as they did in the Applied Materials example above.

- 2. They dig into the underlying issue at play.

Once a signal has been picked up, it means there is a threat to the

transformation program and leaders must make sense of why. This is

vital because at this moment, they have only identiﬁed behaviors and

emotions; they haven’t got to the root cause.

At this point, it’s essential to bring people together — the workforce

as well as leadership — to decide the course of action. Our research

found that those who successfully navigate turning points are 1.4x more

likely to involve the full team in next steps. We advise bringing the team

together in person to establish a shared understanding of the challenges

and a shared sense of ownership over the outcome.

For example, Volvo, another one of our case studies, transformed its

trucks division by introducing electric vehicle (EV) models. In doing

so, it opted for a mixed-model assembly in which EV trucks would

roll oﬀ the same line as traditional internal combustion engine trucks.

This meant old and new ways of working collided, and engineers and

managers were unclear on deliverables amid the pace of change on the

# factory ﬂoor.

To ease the mounting anxiety and frustration of the workers, the

factory transformation leader organized in-person meetings with the

mixed-model assembly team members. Known as “Kaizens,” named

## for the Japanese practice of continuous improvement, the meetings

allowed employees to share the challenges they faced and to co-develop

solutions, as well as align on the “why” of the program. What the

transformation leader ultimately realized was that the people working

on EV trucks needed to be solely focused on that particular product.

- 3. They get to action — quickly.

The second and third steps — sense-making and acting — are deeply

intertwined. Our research also uncovered a number of speciﬁc actions

that can help leaders navigate a transformation turning point:

- Create team alignment, deﬁning short-term and long-term goals,

getting the right people in place to solve problems, and designing

processes that reinforce collaboration. Organizations that successfully

navigate turning points are 1.6x more likely to do this.

- Bring people back on board with a compelling transformation

vision that shows they listened to and learned about the reality on the

ground. Organizations that successfully navigate turning points are

2.1x* more likely to do this.

- Adjust organizational priorities, pausing or shutting down projects

to make capacity for the transformation. Organizations that

successfully navigate turning points are 2.1x* more likely to do this.

- Nurture an operating environment that supports

experimentation and autonomy, encouraging trial and error and

making it clear that it’s ok to learn from mistakes. Organizations that

successfully navigate turning points are 1.9x* more likely to do this.

- Invest in the skills and mindset needed for the transformed

company, addressing capability shortfalls. Organizations that

successfully navigate turning points are 2.2x* more likely to do this.

These actions are about creating the conditions where people can

thrive. The important thing here is for leaders to continue sense-making

as they try diﬀerent actions, in order to keep track of what’s having an

impact and what’s not. As a leader from Rio Tinto, which carried out a

global supply chain transformation, told us:

The way to do it, from my own experience, is ﬁrst you listen to

[employees] and then you agree with them what would need to

be done differently. You commit and you deliver. Then you do

that several times and eventually, when people see that there is

genuine interest, they are empowered to choose solutions to their

problem, they get the support that they need, and that support is

predictable. Then you build more and more trust, and that trust

helps create a better work environment…and a psychologically safer

# work environment.

. . .

The heart of a successful transformation beats around reading,

nurturing, and acknowledging emotions. Leaders who achieve

successful transformations create and maintain an environment where

people can experiment, learn, and take ownership of their work —

and ultimately feel good about their eﬀort. As one frontline worker

at Applied Materials told us of his experience: “I think the support is

# everything.”

After all, transformation is such a human process. It can only work if it

## brings those humans right to the center of the program.
