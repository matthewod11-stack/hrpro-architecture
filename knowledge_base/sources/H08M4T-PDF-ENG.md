You sit down at your computer ready to tackle the work you’ve been

promising yourself you’d do. But inevitably, your inbox pings and your

phone rings. Then, just as you’re about to dive in, you reﬂexively reach

for your phone, scan headlines, and scroll social media — your focus

fragmenting with each digital detour.

These interruptions, both external and self-inﬂicted, are no longer the

exception; they’ve become our default mode, says Zelana Montminy,

a positive psychologist and the author of Finding Focus: Own Your

Attention in an Age of Distraction. “We’ve trained our brain to need

and want interruptions,” she says. “It’s almost like we’re addicted to

# distractedness.”

It isn’t accidental. Our devices are engineered to exploit this

vulnerability. “They provide ﬂeeting hits of dopamine through

notiﬁcations, likes, and messages, keeping us in a constant cycle of

seeking digital validation.”

Many of us believe we’re adept at juggling interruptions, but research

tells a diﬀerent story, according to Gloria Mark, Chancellor’s Professor

## of Informatics at the University of California, Irvine, and the author of

Attention Span: A Groundbreaking Way to Restore Balance, Happiness,

and Productivity. “Think of your mind as a whiteboard,” she says.

“Each task or topic you focus on is like writing on that whiteboard.

When you multitask, you’re constantly erasing and rewriting diﬀerent

# information.”

All that switching comes at a cost. Studies show that multitasking leads

to longer completion times, more errors, and increased stress. “Your

executive function — your brain’s CEO — gets fatigued,” says Mark.

“And it struggles to ﬁlter out distractions or make decisions, leaving you

# even more susceptible to interruptions.”

So how can you strengthen your focus skills and stay on track? What

simple techniques can help you cut down on interruptions? And how

can you create an environment that supports better concentration?

Here’s what experts suggest.

# Lay the groundwork.

Optimizing your brain for focus starts with fundamental self-care,

according to Montminy. “You need to prioritize foundational habits like

sleep, hydration, and physical activity,” she says. “You could try all the

mental health hacks in the world, and you’re not going to get anywhere

if you’re not sleeping well and not hydrating.”

Creating consistent environmental cues is also key. Montminy

recommends establishing “focus rituals,” or signals that tell your brain it’s time to concentrate — like a dedicated workspace, a particular desk

setup, or a consistent routine that primes you for deep work. Mark

suggests practical steps to eliminate distractions: turn oﬀ notiﬁcations,

lock away your phone when working, and use app blockers to hide

digital temptations. The goal is to “create friction” and make it harder to

be distracted, she says.

Train your brain’s attention.

With the fundamentals in place, you next need to harness your natural

focus. Our attention is goal-directed, meaning we naturally concentrate

on what aligns with our objectives and priorities, explains Mark. This

principle is rooted in the work of William James, widely considered the

father of American psychology. “If your goals are very clear, that’s going

to keep you focused.” To tap into this attentional bias and selectively

focus on certain stimuli while ignoring others, Mark recommends a

concrete approach: “Write down your goals and put them in a place

where they’re in your visual ﬁeld,” she says. “Put them on a post-it if

that’s what it takes for you to be constantly reminded of what you’re

trying to accomplish.” Surrounding yourself with visual reminders of

your goals helps train your brain to zero in on what’s essential.

# Direct your emotions.

Goal setting isn’t just about accomplishing tasks; it’s also a powerful

strategy for regulating and managing emotions. “People who feel more

positive can actually focus better, do more, and be more creative,” says

Mark. She recommends envisioning your desired emotional state to

guide behavior. So, ask yourself: “At 7 PM, how do I want to feel?” You

might, for instance, picture yourself peaceful and relaxed, enjoying a

## quiet moment on the couch with a book, or happily unwinding with

friends. By setting emotional goals, you’re creating a neurobiological

roadmap that helps your brain seek balance and reduce stress. “Picture

the end result,” Montminy advises. “Visualize what it looks like, sit in

the feeling of it, and imagine the relief.” The aim is to preemptively

savor a sense of accomplishment, which can sharpen your focus.

# Interrupt your autopilot.

Attention comes in diﬀerent forms, says Mark. There’s the intentional

kind, where we’re consciously focused on a speciﬁc task, such as

writing a complex report; and the automatic kind, where actions occur

without deliberate thought — like when you reﬂexively grab your

phone, swipe it open, and scroll through Instagram mid-workday. To

break these unconscious habits, Mark says you need to cultivate meta-

awareness: observing your mental processes as they unfold. “It’s like

slapping yourself awake and saying, ‘Pay attention!’” When you feel

the impulse to check social media, pause, and ask yourself: What’s

driving this behavior? Am I procrastinating? Am I avoiding challenging

work? Asking these questions transforms an unconscious habit into

a deliberate choice. “Meta-awareness is like a muscle — the more

you practice catching and redirecting your attention, the stronger it

becomes.”

Montminy suggests keeping alternatives to your phone nearby — a

magazine or notepad, for instance — to satisfy your underlying need

for escape or stress relief. “Don’t use your device as a paciﬁer,” she says.

# Tune into your energy patterns.

Your attention at work has a rhythm, says Mark. Your peak focus times

are aﬀected by your chronotype, or your natural circadian rhythm.

Mark’s research ﬁnds that most people have peak focus times around

11 AM and mid-afternoon, though this varies depending on whether

you’re an early bird or night owl. To discover your personal rhythm,

keep a diary tracking your energy and concentration levels throughout

the day. “The desire to scroll or check your socials is a sign of your focus

starting to quiver, usually toward the end of one of your cycles,” says

Montminy. Then, schedule demanding tasks during your peak cognitive

hours and reserve less-complex work, like email, for when your energy

dips. “Understanding and adapting to your energy ﬂuctuations helps

you align your work schedule with your personal rhythm,” she says.

# Practice active listening.

One of the places where many people lose focus is during conversations,

notes Montminy. This occurs in team meetings on Zoom (you really

think no one notices when you check your email in another tab?)

and can happen even in person when you’re talking with a colleague

one minute, and the next, you’re mentally elsewhere, distracted

by your phone. “We’ve become accustomed to not being present

with each other,” she says. “Shallow interactions have become the

norm.” To improve your focus and rebuild connection, Montminy

recommends making a deliberate eﬀort to practice active listening. This

involves maintaining eye contact, tuning into what the other person

is saying, and asking thoughtful questions. By doing so, you not only

sharpen your concentration but also deepen your connections. “Make

intentional changes to prioritize your relationships,” she advises.

Replenish your attention reserves.

Negative space, an art term that refers to the empty areas around the

main subjects in an image, oﬀers a metaphor for an essential focus skill:

managing mental energy. Just as artists use negative space to create

balance, you can learn to strategically recover your cognitive resources

by taking purposeful breaks, says Mark. “We tend to pack our days with

tasks,” she notes. “We don’t realize we have to build in time for when

we’re not working that will help us refuel.” When your reserves are

running low, give yourself permission to rest and reset. “But resetting

does not mean scrolling socials,” says Montminy. “Consuming content

is not taking a break.” Instead, she recommends stretching, meditating,

reading poetry, or taking time to stare out a window. “Give your brain

time and space to regroup.”

Recognize the value of your attention and make conscious choices

about how you allocate it, adds Mark. “You have limited cognitive

resources. They’re very precious.” The crucial question is: “How do you

want to distribute them over the course of your day?”

# Principles to Remember

# Do

- Cultivate meta-awareness by pausing to question your impulses,

and redirecting your attention to transform unconscious habits into

# deliberate choices.

- Track your daily energy levels to identify your chronotype and

schedule demanding tasks during your peak hours, and less-complex

# work for when your focus dips.

- Set emotional goals by visualizing how you want to feel at the end

of your day — calm, proud, or energized — and let those desired

emotions guide your behavior and your focus.

# Don’t

- Let your goals remain abstract or out of sight; write them down

and keep them visible in your workspace to help train your brain to

concentrate on what’s most important.

- Assume shallow interactions are inevitable; instead, practice active

listening by maintaining eye contact, tuning into what others are

saying, and asking questions.

- Mistake scrolling or consuming content for an actual break. A true

break allows your brain to reset and recover.
