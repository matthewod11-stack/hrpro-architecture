Artfully managing expectations is one of the most important skills

a project manager (PM) can develop. When expectations are properly

managed, teams are better equipped to deliver exceptional results, from

executing on a behemoth campaign to meeting small, daily deadlines.

The earlier this skill can be developed in one’s career, the better.

Yet training on “expectations management” is fairly limited within

professional development curriculum and new hire onboardings. It’s

a diﬃcult concept to package into a single educational experience

because everyone’s expectations are unique and often deeply personal.

PMs need to use a combination of intuition, listening, iterating, and

learning on the ﬂy to address them successfully.

I’ve spent the past few years gaining a deep understanding of

how people work through setbacks while interviewing leaders across

industries and researching the psychology behind this phenomenon

for my book, The Setback Cycle. Part of working through that cycle is

developing a clear understanding of expectations.

## So much of our workplace anxiety, confusion and ambiguity —

particularly when managing projects — stems from this great

expectations gap. But directly addressing it can have a signiﬁcant

## impact: A Gallup study on employee engagement estimates that

setting clear expectations would reduce turnover by 22%, reduce safety

incidents by 29%, and increase productivity by 10%.

Here are the ﬁve main principles PMs can use to work through setbacks

and close the expectations gap in the workplace.

Consider the root of everyone’s expectations.

Managing expectations can be a delicate balance. Set them too high, and

risk disappointment. But aiming too low can leave people and teams

# complacent.

To start managing expectations, you need to understand where they

come from. “Expectations can be deeply rooted in our own insecurities

## or our own self worth,” explains Morra Aarons-Mele, author of The

Anxious Achiever. “They may potentially stem from a formative

experience in life. Expectations can make us vulnerable.”

This can spill over into our work. It is also part of the reason that, when

workplace expectations aren’t clear, anxiety and stress seep in.

That’s why it’s critical to be clear, deliberate and decisive from the

outset. “People become anxious when there are unsaid expectations that

are not explicit,” Aarons-Mele says. “So, align on terms and meanings.

What does ‘good’ mean? What does ‘ready for next steps’ mean? What

does ‘ready for client approval’ mean? What does ‘draft’ mean? My

‘good’ might be your ‘terrible.’”

In other words, don’t make people guess, or everyone will start

operating based on assumptions, not facts. Your colleagues cannot read

your mind. Setting clear expectations prevents work moving forward

based on assumptions, especially as logistics and timelines inevitably

# shift.

“Leaders tend to have the expectation that everyone thinks the way

they do,” says Lindsay Dunphy, founder and project management

lead at Fireﬂy Consulting Services. “So they don’t necessarily set the

groundwork for employees to work within the systems they’ve created.

Being able to articulate that expectation can be challenging.”

To prevent confusion, a team can collectively set goals and understand

what it will take to meet key performance indicators (KPIs). Equally

as important is continually re-evaluating these goals. As a project

moves along, is the team meeting expectations? Do the goals still feel

reasonable to achieve? Or is working towards them demoralizing the

team? If the latter, how can you reconﬁgure those goals or adjust

expectations in order to meet those KPIs?

## Approach project management as couples therapy.

A common argument among couples is that one partner can’t read the

others’ mind. The same rings true for most colleagues.

That’s why executive coach Shoshanna Hecht suggests project

managers take a cue from the job of couples counselors: to establish

that they are not on the side of either party. The counselor’s role is to

remain on the side of the relationship as a whole. As such, the project

manager is on the side of the project.

“The PM is in service of the business. That doesn’t always mean

appeasing the client, but understanding the job to be done and the

overall business goals,” she says. “They are responsible for getting the

# project to the end zone.”

Further, PMs often become experts at delicately navigating the moods

of various stakeholders, another skill that enables them to properly

manage the expectations of the entire team.

“PMs become couples counselors, mediators, and therapists,” says

Hecht. “They need to make everyone feel valued and heard, explaining

what’s possible while clearly outlining the limitations. Clear is kind.”

To do this successfully, recap conversation takeaways in detail. For

example, the way a client digests a conversation can signiﬁcantly

vary from how a creative team digests it. An all-too-familiar scenario

happens when a client approves a creative concept, a team begins work

and comes back to present ideas to the client. The feedback isn’t great.

The PM needs to re-brief the team, set new deadlines, and present

again. Minds are changing, self doubt is creeping in, the PM is trying

to motivate employees as deadlines are shrinking.

“I need to make it very clear that certain things will only be possible

if pieces fall into place as anticipated,” says Sandy Binjour, a senior

project manager at a global advertising agency. “At the 11th hour, if things are still oﬀ the rails, it’s time to have a candid yet collaborative

conversation that gets everyone to weigh in on the decision that needs

to be made.”

To foster that collaboration and manage the expectations of key

stakeholders prone to making unrealistic demands, Hecht suggests

trying this script. “I hear that you want X, and we can deliver X to a

point.” Clearly and candidly state how far you can go. Then, ask how the team can work together to come up with a diﬀerent solution so everyone

feels like they are co-creating the new path forward, even as folks are

dealing with high stress and strong emotions.

## Create and foster relationships with your team.

Project management requires a signiﬁcant level of emotional

intelligence. PMs need to develop an understanding of various

work styles, strengths and weaknesses, and build structures – and

relationships – accordingly.

So how do PMs like Binjour foster those relationships in a way that

builds trust? The answer might sound counterintuitive.

“I lie all the time,” she says. “There’s the deadline I tell people, and

there’s the real deadline. I tell the production team one deadline and the

account team another and hope it lands somewhere in the middle.”

To be clear, Binjour isn’t exactly lying; rather, she’s managing expectations and building buﬀers to ensure ﬂexibility throughout the process. She’s addressing diﬀerent work styles to move the project

forward without delays. This is a tactic many seasoned PMs use to accommodate the needs of diﬀerent people across various departments.

“My priorities are making my creative team feel supported, ensuring the

production team has the most relevant information, and that everyone

understands what their expectations are,” says Binjour. “I make friends

and build sincere relationships. It can be emotionally draining, because

people trust you with personal information, but at the end of the day,

I’m a safe space to blab to.”

Protecting the psychological safety and comfort of a team is also critical

to fostering collaboration. The more people trust the PM, the more

comfortable they are speaking up when issues arise, leaving more room

to make adjustments, reset timelines, and manage the broader team’s

expectations, especially as the project evolves. Psychological safety

on a team also provides a comfortable environment for employees

to give and receive feedback. Respectfully addressing this feedback

reinforces expectations with clarity and helps prevent communications

# breakdowns.

“Communication is always number one, but so is making sure that

people say what they mean,” says Dunphy. That’s why, “as a PM, you

can usually see the ﬁnish line before everyone else can.”

Build a structure that’s sturdy but flexible.

One of the best methods of expectations management is balancing

structure with ﬂexibility. Even with the most organized structure, the

## strongest team, the best project management software, and the most

skillful communicators, a project can still go awry.

“Milestones, time, and money depend on me keeping everything on

track,” says Binjour. “But all of that structure needs to be nimble,

because for as many plans as I make, it can easily fall apart.”

The easiest way to do this is to break projects down into small functional

steps. The structure needs to be sturdy enough to move a project

forward, but nimble enough to adapt in case that timeline shifts.

“It’s really about making it super tactical at this point, almost down to

every second of the day so that the time feels productive and everyone

knows where to focus,” says Binjour. “Once a timeline shrinks down to

the last few days before a project is due, a bulleted to-do list just isn’t

enough. I send 15 minute calendar blocks to those who need to know

what they need to do and when it needs to be done.”

At some point, the PM needs to make sure the team can step away from

the project and deliver the work in a way that enables them to feel like

they did the best they could under whatever constraints they needed to

work within. Those environments can actually fuel creativity, but that

ﬂexible structure is key to keeping the project on track and fostering the

# best possible work output.

## “Build in as much backstop and infrastructure as you can and

communicate it as clearly as you can,” says Aarons-Mele. “What you

can control are the structure and the process.”

Keep the team grounded in the overall vision.

The best way to motivate teams, especially during tumultuous times, is

to make sure everyone feels like they’re working toward a common goal.

“When you get everyone thinking they’re part of the larger vision,

it improves performance,” says Dunphy. “People take more initiative

when they feel more involved in every step.”

Psychologist Angela Duckworth notes in her book, Grit, that purpose is

## one of the strongest human motivators.“At its core, the idea of purpose

is the idea that what we do matters to people other than ourselves,” she

## writes. Studies from the National Institute of Health to Pew Research

have supported the concept that leading a purpose-driven life correlates

## not only with success, but happiness and overall life satisfaction. How

can PMs inject that sentiment and motivation into a team’s day to day

# work?

“You think progress at altitude looks like a straight line, but really it’s

shark teeth,” says Hecht. “Sometimes we get hung up on a tooth. We

need reminders to pull our perspective back out to altitude.”

That’s the project manager’s role. To move a project forward through all

the bumps, hiccups, setbacks and shark teeth while keeping everyone

focused on the bigger picture. That’s especially critical when the rest of

the team loses sight of that overall mission, which happens frequently

amidst frantic scrambles to meet deadlines.

To keep everyone focused on the common goal, Hecht suggests

continuously asking, “What’s in alignment with the mission, vision,

values and goals of what we’re trying to build?”
