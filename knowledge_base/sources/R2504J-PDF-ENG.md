On December 1, 2014, Cypress Semiconductor announced that it was

acquiring fellow chipmaker Spansion for $1.6 billion. When then-CEO

Thurman Rodgers presented the deal, the stock market responded

approvingly. An analysis showed that once other confounding

inﬂuences had been ruled out, the share price of Cypress had jumped

up 13% after the deal’s announcement. Clearly, investors believed in the

company’s rationale for the purchase.

An examination of the longer-term consequences of the deal suggests

that their optimism was warranted. When we looked at the value of the

company a full year later, we found that its market cap was still 13%

higher than it had been before the acquisition. The stock market had

accurately anticipated the deal’s potential.

## Two years earlier, by contrast, on December 12, the pharmaceutical

ﬁrm the Medicines Company had announced that it was going to buy

the specialty drugmaker Incline Therapeutics. It turned out to be very

similar to the Spansion deal in terms of value creation: A year later

the combined entity’s market cap was also 13% higher. But when Clive

Meanwell, the CEO of Medicines, had presented the deal to the ﬁnancial

markets, the response was lukewarm: The share price rose by only 1.8%.

Clearly, investors hadn’t understood the reasons for the purchase.

This turns out to be a pattern. When we analyzed a sample of 654

large deals in the United States that had taken place from 2012 to 2017,

we frequently found this kind of disparity between comparable deals.

With any given acquisition or merger, the markets might or might not

immediately factor in the value that the company predicted it would

# add.

What determines whether investors believe in CEOs’ presentations?

To ﬁnd out we conducted a statistical analysis using event study

methodology, in which researchers determine what characteristics of

an acquisition (“the event”) explain how the stock market responds to

## it. And among the acquisitions in our sample one seemingly simple

but signiﬁcant factor emerged: When presentations were accompanied

by a slide illustrating the strategic rationale for a deal, investors were

more than twice as likely to give it an immediate thumbs-up. The

positive impact of strategy visualizations, as we will call them, on

postannouncement valuations was four times larger than the impact of

## other visual tools such as photographs, maps, logos, and even bar charts

# and line graphs.

In this article we’ll explain why visualizations are so important to the

communication of strategy and describe, using a detailed example,

how to create one that will win buy-in from employees and investors

alike. We’ll conclude by showing that despite the powerful eﬀect

that a strategy visualization can have, only a quarter of corporate

presentations on deals include one, and when they do, it often isn’t

designed to have impact. All told, fewer than 20% of visualizations do an

eﬀective job of describing companies’ strategic decisions.

# Why: Seeing Is Believing

Most executives agree that business strategy is a set of choices regarding

how and where a ﬁrm wants to create value and compete. But what

many forget is that strategy also requires an interpretation of what the

choices imply, which needs to be explained simply and clearly.

## Through a process that the University of Michigan organizational

psychologist Karl Weick calls “sensemaking,” executives develop an

understanding of their business context and how their ﬁrm will operate

in it. This generally involves categorizing types of competitors and

potential customers and identifying the ﬁrm’s key resources and

## capabilities and the main cause-and-eﬀect relationships among them.

This understanding is organized into what we call “a cognitive map.”

A good strategy reﬂects such a map. In fact, executives usually create

a draft of one as they develop their strategy. While discussing and

debating what direction the company should go in with colleagues,

consultants, board members, and others, they often draw circles, boxes,

and arrows that represent important elements of the proposed strategy

## and the relationships among them on ﬂip charts and slides.

Once executives reach agreement on a strategy, they need to

communicate it to other stakeholders, who must understand it and act

on it. The daily decisions of employees, for example, need to be guided

by the same understanding of the ﬁrm’s strategy. If they don’t make

diﬀerent choices as a result of a new strategy, then you don’t have a new

# strategy.

This is when executives must switch from sensemaking to sense giving:

They need to transfer their cognitive map of the ﬁrm’s strategy to

the minds of employees and investors. Our research suggests that

reinforcing a verbal presentation with a visualization of the strategy and

how it works is the most eﬀective way to do that.

# What: The Case of Capitec

The story of Capitec—which is now the largest retail bank in South

Africa and was named the best bank in the world by the Laﬀerty Group

## for two years in a row—provides ideal material for an eﬀective strategy

visualization. Let’s look in more detail at the company’s strategy.

Capitec was founded in the early 2000s. Analyzing the landscape for

consumer banking in South Africa, which had long been dominated by

the same four big banks, its founders realized that to gain a foothold

in the market, they had to focus—at least initially—on a customer

segment that had been neglected by the incumbents. Those customers

were low-income people who often did not have a bank account. The

founders described them as “lacking ﬁnancial literacy.” This was their

# ﬁrst strategic concept.

Next the founders thought through the value proposition that those

customers would require. The strategic concept they came up with here

was “a single, simple account” that would serve the customers’ basic

needs and nothing more. To deliver that proposition they decided to

focus explicitly on four mutually reinforcing subconcepts: aﬀordability,

## simplicity, accessibility, and personal service.

These were not hollow, abstract terms but would be translated into

## concrete customer beneﬁts and ways of operating. Aﬀordability meant

charging fees low enough to tempt people to switch from cash to

banking: Capitec’s fees were half its competitors’. To be able to oﬀer

them and still make a proﬁt, Capitec had to keep its costs down. (The

bank broke even the year after launching.) To do that, it needed to

have scale, and to achieve scale it kept its oﬀering and operations

very simple (the second subconcept). For example, it oﬀered just one

type of account, which could be used only for saving, borrowing, and

making cashless transactions. The founders believed that the simple oﬀering suﬃced for low-income customers, who would beneﬁt little

## from ancillaries like insurance, credit cards, and currency exchange.

The third subconcept, accessibility, addressed the need to lower the

barriers preventing the target customers from using the bank’s services.

To that end, Capitec would rely on face-to-face service in a large

network of physical branches. Each would have an entirely open

## storefront, some very simple self-service machines, and a color-coded

scheme (including red and blue carpets) that indicated to people (who

might not be able to read) where to go. Crucially, Capitec would employ

people from the local community so that customers would be served

by someone who spoke their language and behaved according to their

# customs.

That brings us to the fourth subconcept, personal service. Capitec

hired people from the retail and hospitality industries rather than

from banking because it wanted to emphasize service. It could do this

because its technology platform was so simple to use. What’s more, the

founders reckoned that these employees’ local market knowledge and

networks would deliver more sign-ups and very low loan-default rates.

The staﬀ would know who the good prospects were and who was likely

to pay back unsecured loans—and who wasn’t. The combination of high

sign-ups and low defaults would make for a happy combination of low

# branch costs and high lending margins.

## Collectively, the value proposition and its

four subconcepts determined a third main

# strategic concept: the resources and

capabilities the bank would need to invest

in. For instance, as we’ve noted, the value

proposition presupposed a large network of

## branches with a particular layout. It also

would require a technology platform

# Ryan Carl

(Capitec stands for “capital” and

“technology”) that would make activities

like opening an account extremely simple for the staﬀ and customers

# alike.

In addition, the value proposition deﬁned the internal culture the bank

needed to foster. Traditionally, ﬁnancial institutions in South Africa

favored a formal, almost stiﬀ, and often hierarchical culture—perhaps

because they wanted to convey a sense of seriousness to employees and

customers. This was reﬂected in their interactions with customers and

the design of their branches. Capitec wanted its employees to present

an informal, welcoming face to low-income customers, who might feel

uncomfortable, even scared, going into a bank.

A verbal description of this strategy, while compelling in the moment,

may be hard for people who did not develop it to internalize. But it is

possible to capture almost perfectly in a single slide the relationships

and causalities among all the concepts making up the strategy, as you

can see in a slide that we developed, which is shown in the exhibit “The

Right Way to Design a Strategy Visualization.” In it you can easily see

the three main strategic concepts. In the center is the value proposition

(“a simple, single account,” with its four subconcepts and their tangible

manifestations). The key customer segment (people “lacking ﬁnancial

literacy”) is on the right, and the necessary resources and capabilities

(“a local branch network” and what it would oﬀer) for meeting the

segment’s needs are on the left. The visualization also shows how

each of the three concepts feeds into the others to create a proﬁtable

# dynamic.

Any manager who sees this visualization as part of a presentation would almost certainly internalize it. Employees could pin it on their oﬃce

walls, and it could serve as a foundational slide for any presentation of

a strategic recommendation they’d like to make. Investors who see it

would get a very clear idea of how the company creates value.

So how can you make sure that a visualization of your strategy will be as

# eﬀective?

# How: What Makes a Great Strategy Slide

Humans are visual creatures. More than 50% of our brain is involved in

processing what we see, which may explain why research shows that we

## absorb visual information more quickly and accurately than other types

of information—provided that it’s organized properly.

To understand how best to communicate visually in the context

of strategy making, we recruited 57 executives (from our London

Business School executive MBA program) to study a total of 60 strategy

visualizations, which we obtained from various companies. We asked

the executives to assess about 15 each, and as they did so we used eye-

tracking technology to see where they directed their attention. Then we

asked them how much they had gotten out of each visualization they’d

looked at (whether they had “learned something,” “gained insight,” or

had acquired “enhanced understanding”) about the ﬁrm’s strategy. Of

course, this is somewhat subjective. Even if participants thought they

had learned a lot, we don’t know for certain whether they really had or

if they just felt they had. But we’re conﬁdent that at least the converse

holds: If multiple executives said they hadn’t learned anything about a

company’s strategy by studying its visualization, it was probably not a

# very eﬀective one.

We also measured several properties of each of the visualizations and

then statistically analyzed them, using a regression model, to see which

of their characteristics enabled the executives to understand the ﬁrm’s

strategy better. We combined those insights with the data from the

study on how stock prices moved when acquisitions were announced

with and without an accompanying strategy visualization. The results

pointed to ﬁve concrete design rules:

- 1. Group your ideas into three or four main concepts that can serve

as a base of the strategic model. In our sample we saw many

frameworks that contained a lot of components—sometimes dozens of

them. That’s understandable, as business environments and strategies

often are complex. However, a good visualization—and therefore a

## good framework—consists primarily of a few main components that

allow people to logically ﬁll in the details, like the operational choices

that must be made to support them. Our analysis showed that simple

visualizations with fewer components got a much more positive

## reaction from the stock market than the complex ones with many.

That ﬁnding aligns with a study by Michigan State University professor

Gerry McNamara and colleagues, who examined executives’ mental

models about types of competitors in their industries and found that

the companies of executives whose models had fewer elements had

signiﬁcantly better ﬁnancial performance. It also aligns with studies

by Jennifer Summerﬁeld using fMRI imaging, which show that people

need only three concepts to create rich, coherent stories.

# Ryan Carl

In our study with the 57 executives, we also examined the degree to

which the strategic components were independent. We found that when

the main components were not in some way connected to one another

in a visualization, the executives began to have trouble understanding

# the ﬁrm’s strategy.

This phenomenon is a result of the way the human brain has evolved

to process views of landscapes. Although a landscape may have distinct

## elements—mountains, forest, a river, and grassland—those components

are also intertwined, forming one coherent picture. A good strategy

visualization mimics that: It displays a limited number of clearly

identiﬁable components that are, nonetheless, also clearly linked to one

# another.

- 2. Create layers with increasing detail. When we look at a landscape,

we see its components, but we can then zoom in on each one of them to

discern more detail. For instance, we might examine a mountain range

to see where the terrain is least steep and rocky to ﬁgure out where we

can best pass through. Similarly, a visualization works best if each of its

main components contains more detail that we can zoom in on to learn

# more.

Consider our Capitec visualization again. If you look at the ﬁrm’s value

proposition in it, you clearly see the four subconcepts deﬁning it.

For each subconcept you can then go down into a further layer. For

instance, you can see what constitutes the subconcept accessibility: the

## physical openness of its branches, the color coding of diﬀerent service

areas within them, and transparency, which comes from practices like

making employees and customers look at the computer screen together

when ﬁlling out a loan application.

The layers move the framework beyond abstraction: They show the

concrete implications of the bank’s conceptual choices and thus tie the

# strategy to implementation.

- 3. Use color and shading only to distinguish the layers. In nature we

## discern individual features, depth, and layers through color diﬀerences.

Forests and mountains, for instance, have diﬀerent colors, and relief

and depth have diﬀerent shading. We found that colors play the same

role in visualizations. When we analyzed the eﬀect that multiple colors

and diﬀerent shading in a visualization had on people’s comprehension

of a strategy, we found that the more they were used, the harder it

became for people to understand the strategy. The exception: When

colors and shading were used to distinguish layers in the model,

comprehension improved. This is another reason our visualization of

Capitec’s strategy is easy to understand.

- 4. Indicate a clear sequence of relationships among the elements

of the framework. In our study of strategy presentations around the

time of acquisitions, we examined whether visualizations of frameworks

contained connectors that provided information on the relationships

among the components. Such graphics are known as ﬂow diagrams. We

found that adding elements indicating ﬂows to a visualization increased

## the stock market valuation of a strategy by 64%.

The fMRI studies conducted by Summerﬁeld reveal that stories have

a ﬂow too. They’re about one thing leading to another, and they’re

processed in the part of the brain that conceptualizes cause-and-eﬀect

## relationships. So the ﬂows in a good visualization parallel and reinforce

the story the company wants to tell. The ones shown in our Capitec

slide, for example, mirror the story about how the bank built a network

## of accessible branches with people from the local community so that it

could deliver a value proposition of banking services that were simple,

unintimidating, and aﬀordable for low-income clients opening their

# ﬁrst-ever bank accounts.

- 5. Organize your framework horizontally. Finally, we discovered that

the executives found it signiﬁcantly easier to gain insight into a

ﬁrm’s strategy if its framework was presented in a predominantly

horizontal fashion. This eﬀect was strong, and it probably reﬂects the

context humans evolved in again: Landscapes are horizontal. So it’s not

surprising that our horizontal peripheral vision is 180 degrees, whereas

our vertical peripheral vision is only about 135 degrees.

Indeed, research on visual cortex sensitivity pioneered by David Hubel

and Torsten N. Wiesel, who received the 1981 Nobel Prize in Physiology

or Medicine (shared with Roger Sperry) for this work, revealed that the

neurons in our visual cortex are more attuned to horizontal orientations

than to other orientations. Horizontal layouts, therefore, are easier for

# the brain to process.

Most of the 170 presentations (out of our sample of 654) that included

strategy visualizations did conform to some of our recommendations.

About 65% of them were organized in a predominantly horizontal

fashion. (They were probably prompted to do so by the default

landscape orientation of PowerPoint.) About 90% also displayed

framework components that were visually distinct. (In the remaining

10% the individual components weren’t clearly separated but were

lumped together in, say, a matrix or a graph.) And 71% illustrated the

## connections among the parts of their models with arrows, overlaps, or

# similarity in colors.

However, we found that fewer than half the visualizations presented a

horizontally oriented framework with clearly distinguished components

and explicit interrelationships among them. But the most dramatic

shortcoming was the absence of layering: Only 32% of ﬁrms provided

extra layers of detail in their model. All told fewer than 20% of the

visualizations—that is, just 32 of the 170 we looked at—made it easy

for employees and investors to develop a clear understanding of the

# company’s strategy.

# Yes, Design Rules Do Matter

We then decided to test just how much of an eﬀect following our

guidelines would have on people’s understanding of a strategy. We

recruited 150 people with at least three years of management experience

and divided them into two equal groups. We provided a very short

description of Capitec (anonymized as “T-Banc”) and then showed them

either the good visualization we had created or a ﬂawed version. While

this second version contained the exact same concepts as the ﬁrst one,

it was organized in concentric circles, and it was unclear what the

strategy’s main concepts and subconcepts were and how they related

to one another. (See the exhibit “The Wrong Way.”) The second graphic

deliberately ignored our rules but is nonetheless a common strategy-

# slide structure in our experience.

After the subjects had studied the visualization given them, we asked

them several questions about how well they thought they understood

to have perceived the visualizations as equally useful in providing

an understanding of the bank’s strategy. But when we asked the

participants to give us a short description of the strategy, we observed

major diﬀerences: On average, the people who had seen the good

visualization scored more than a full point higher (on a scale of one

## to seven) on their comprehension of the strategy than the people who

had seen the ﬂawed visualization.

So the respondents who had seen the eﬀective version had indeed

gained a signiﬁcantly better understanding of Capitec’s strategy,

though they were not necessarily aware that they had. In other words

people often don’t realize how much they’re inﬂuenced by the visual

# characteristics of a strategy framework.

. . .

When executives present strategy, they often do so with the aid of

visuals, particularly PowerPoint decks. But they need to understand

how much the design of their slides matters. Strategies are the

key mechanism through which people coordinate and create value.

Communicating them well—with the right visualizations—allows

everyone to travel the business landscape in tandem rather than work

in isolation. A well-designed visualization could easily double the

stock market’s reaction to a strategy, immediately adding tens, even

hundreds, of millions of dollars to a company’s market value. And it can

have a far bigger impact on the long-term performance of the employees

tasked with implementing the strategy.
