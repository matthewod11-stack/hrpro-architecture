In today’s rapidly evolving business landscape, strategic innovation

should not be restricted to boardrooms or corporate leaders. In this

era of gig work and changing demographics, everyone, from white-

shoe consultants to steel-toe customers, has the potential to contribute

## meaningful ideas and strategies — as do computers.

Of course, we’ve been using computers and the internet for years, but

our applications have largely been restricted to statistical analysis and

search. We’ve not been using them to generate ideas — at least not

until very recently, and certainly not systematically. But that’s all about

to change. And, yes, it is all because of the generative AI that powers

# ChatGPT.

To many people, the idea that AI can be a source of new ideas

## sounds counterintuitive. After all, ChatGPT essentially just collates and

processes the sum total of all the answers to a question that people

have already come up with. It seems almost inevitable that ChatGPT’s

strategic advice would simply parrot the most common solutions to a

## problem in a sort of reversion to the mean.

Welcome to your newest strategy team member

The reason why that isn’t inevitable became apparent when Wolfram

linked ChatGPT to its Mathematica software. When people ﬁrst tried to

use ChatGPT to solve math problems, they quickly found that it wasn’t

very good at math problems because it primarily relies on language

recognition. Although the AI could write a good university motivation

letter, perhaps, it sure couldn’t come up with an original proof for

Pythagoras’s theorem.

But that changed as soon as people cross-connected GPT to Wolfram’s

software, and the AI proved able to solve complex math showing

progress step-by-step. Inspired by that, we wondered what would

happen if we cross-connected ChatGPT to a strategic framework. What

we’ve discovered is that the virtual strategist turns out to be quite

original, and certainly deserves a place on your company’s team.

The strategic framework we chose for this purpose was the Blue Ocean

Framework developed in the 1990s and early 2000s by INSEAD’s W.

Chan Kim and Renée Mauborgne. It is a framework that has about two

decades of research behind it and has proved enduringly successful. It

also has an extensive kit of heuristic tools that help strategists in their

decision making. By connecting these tools to ChatGPT’s AI we would

both provide a ﬁlter for ideas and generate a format for presenting

them. Let’s look at what happened when we assigned our enhanced Blue

## Ocean AI strategist a speciﬁc strategic challenge.

Is there a market?

As Americans living in France, we decided to ask the AI to create a

## bagel bakery in Paris, an international food capital unaccountably (we

thought) devoid of good bagels. How might we bring them to the City of

# Lights?

The core Blue Ocean concept of value innovation encourages strategists

to look at what features of a product or service oﬀering might be

deterring people who are not customers of your existing oﬀering —

and which of them might become customers. When we asked our Blue

Ocean AI what might be putting consumers oﬀ from buying bagels,

it quickly replied that tourists “may feel disappointed by the lack of

availability, variety, and authenticity.” That rang true to us as U.S.

expats. But the AI also suggested that health-conscious and gluten-

sensitive French individuals — who didn’t usually buy many traditional

French bakery products either — might be interested in buying bagels,

observing that “[T]he bagel bakery in Paris has the opportunity to tap

## into new markets and create uncontested demand in the blue ocean

# space within its industry.”

We then asked our virtual assistant for ideas on what new features

might work to attract the categories of noncustomers it had identiﬁed. It came up with speciﬁc ideas, including oﬀering truﬄe-infused

cream cheese or raspberry ﬁllings. Maybe “late night passers-by crave

munchies?” it suggested. Our interface enables a person to ask the AI

to delve deeper. We asked: “Are there really many late-night revelers

in Paris with the munchies?” The reply? “… an express window grab-

and-go setup around Champs Elysees clubbing hubs could potentially

maximize untapped sectors eﬀectively.”

The AI also proposed diﬀerent approaches to reaching customers: “Oﬀer

not just bagels but an experience,” it suggested, and “Think about large

conferences or business meetings.” The AI further proposed adding

other American bakery items and sourcing local ingredients.

So how, exactly, should we be oﬀering bagels in Paris?

Building the value proposition

To develop a new value proposition, whatever your strategy process,

you ﬁrst have to identify the list of essential factors traditionally found

in the product/service oﬀering that your target market is using. This is

normally a time-consuming, tedious task. But the AI created a list of

factors for us to review and edit in less than a minute, leveraging the

## search and analytic power of the basic ChatGPT program.

In the next step, the AI leveraged, via a custom programmed interface,

the Blue Ocean framework connected to its basic programming to

identify which of the factors on the edited set should be eliminated,

reduced, raised, or created to produce a value proposition that

would attract the target noncustomers, presenting it as a 2D value

curve at the bottom of the screen that we could manually adjust

ourselves. Once adjusted, the AI exported the data for us to produce

a classic presentation-ready set of Blue Ocean value curves presenting

propositions that might attract noncustomers.

Mapping the ecosystem

Looking toward execution, we trained the AI to map the extended

ecosystems in which we would need to operate. The AI was quickly

able to present the leading players in the bakery industry generally

and the products and services they oﬀered, along with suppliers of non-

bakery products that bakery goods customers might turn to instead.

The players identiﬁed comprised a highly diversiﬁed set of businesses,

including street food vendors, ethnic grocery stores, sushi bars, candy

stores, ice cream parlors, and gourmet markets oﬀering anything

from croissants, sandwiches, pastry rolls ﬁlled with cream cheese, and

# quiche.

Next, the AI created sortable, editable lists of potential suppliers,

## distribution channels, and potential customer segments. The suppliers

included a dough mixer, malt extract producers (a key ingredient

in good bagels), and bagel cutters. Potential distribution channels

included retail bakeries and cafes, but also airport kiosks. Possible

customers included hotels, catering companies, and tourists. Finally,

it identiﬁed inﬂuencers that included travel bloggers and food critics,

## but also fashion inﬂuencers, a counterintuitive but thoughtful insight.

Like the other tools, the elements of the ecosystem are next sorted,

amended, and easily changed by humans via a custom intuitive

computer interface. When ﬁnished, humans select which results they

want by clicking and the system immediately creates a PowerPoint

slide with the traditional blocks and arrows of an industry value chain,

clearly mapping out the players in the ecosystem and how they related

## to each other in the value creation process.

How did the AI compare?

All told, the AI ideation process took about 60 minutes, most of which

was taken up by the human activity of inputting the questions and

then editing the responses. By the end of it, we had a ready-to-go

presentation for investors. To get a sense of how good the results were,

we ran the same exercise the old-fashioned way.

We got a group of MBAs to develop a Blue Ocean strategy proposal

over the course of a week, using traditional paper-based tools, such

as ﬂipcharts, and standard software (Google, PowerPoint). They did

their own research individually and brought their ﬁndings back to

brainstorming meetings. They collectively drew and discussed value

curves — spending as much as three hours agreeing on a single one —

and spent about two days mapping their ecosystems. At the end of this,

they manually put together their PowerPoint presentation — which took

multiple iterations, depending on the team.

At the end of this exercise, we compared the results with what the

AI had come up with. The results were, in fact, quite similar. The AI,

therefore, was clearly competitive. The few diﬀerences that we did ﬁnd,

however, were revealing. For example, the AI had suggested that the

bagel shop might oﬀer limited items for short periods of time, rather as

the fashion chain Zara does. That looked unrealistic at face value, but

when we reﬂected on it, we concluded that it was a promising avenue to

explore. We suspected that the reason the MBA team had not come up

with the idea was an unconscious bias at work, as signaled by the simple

fact that the idea had seemed surprising to us in the ﬁrst place.

The conclusion is rather sobering. An AI was able to produce in just

## 60 minutes a strategy very similar to, and in some respects more

original than, one that a team of INSEAD MBA students took a week

to put together. The students — many of whom were considering

careers as strategy consultants — were understandably rattled by the

idea that a high-level task such as strategy-making could, eﬀectively,

be automated. But although it was perhaps the ﬁrst time many of

them had been confronted personally with this idea, the idea is not

that new. Increasingly we’ve found that tasks requiring analytic skills

and experience can, in fact, be automated. It’s a phenomenon that

accountants, bankers, and, lately, doctors — all traditionally regarded

as highly prestigious jobs — are increasingly encountering. And it’s a

trend that will only continue.

Does it mean that humans will be out of a job? Of course, if people

mimic a robot, then a real robot is likely to do a better job, and those

people risk being made redundant. But there is also plenty of evidence

to suggest that strategy-making will still require a human touch, and

that the best way forward is to pair smart machines with smart

humans. In fact, technology has in nearly every ﬁeld increased the

value of the humans using it. By freeing strategists from routine tasks,

AI enables them to imagine and experiment more. Financial analysts became more eﬃcient with spreadsheets, writers more proﬁcient with

word processors. Well-built digital tools eventually enhance human

productivity — and they also typically create new jobs, though the

transformation can be challenging.

- • •

Our hope is that virtual strategists will make their human counterparts

better at their job, enabling companies to create inclusive value

propositions that oﬀer sustainable paths to proﬁtability and more.

And the new and impactful strategies that result will generate more

value and the jobs that come with it. Our Blue Ocean–centric strategic

ideation AI is fairly basic early-stage software, but work continues

at a brisk pace. Future AI strategists will have mastery of multiple

frameworks in addition to Blue Ocean, making them even more value-

adding. We can’t predict every twist and turn but we would not be

surprised if, in a few years, every company strategy team will include a
