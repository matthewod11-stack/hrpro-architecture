The old proverb about teaching people to ﬁsh so they can eat

for a lifetime, rather than gifting a ﬁsh that lasts just a day, also

applies to how organizations can empower, rather than merely help,

disadvantaged groups.

There has been a remarkable surge in diversity initiatives at companies,

fueled by belief in the beneﬁts of a diverse workforce and the collective

ﬁght against discrimination. As organizations strive to build inclusive

workplaces, they often try to tackle overt discrimination and negative

stereotypes against disadvantaged groups.

Yet these well-intentioned eﬀorts often include a key oversight:

Many DEI initiatives are founded on the ﬂawed assumption that

disadvantaged groups are helpless without assistance from those in

power. Such protectionist beliefs give rise to the frequently overlooked

yet deeply concerning phenomenon of benevolent marginalization,

whereby good intentions can lead to harm.

Benevolent marginalization occurs when a dominant group

paternalistically controls a weaker or marginalized group while

portraying their actions as supportive and in solidarity with that

group. Behind the façade of well-intentioned actions aimed at uplifting

marginalized groups, a subtle power imbalance persists. Managers may

even expect gratitude for their aﬀectionate and helpful eﬀorts, while

those who are marginalized ﬁnd themselves pressured into accepting or

internalizing the subordinating order as the norm and even expressing

# gratitude in return.

Our analysis draws upon over a decade of extensive research conducted

in diverse contexts. We utilized interviews, archival documents, and

observations of individuals navigating subtle forms of marginalization.

We also examined the pivotal role of internal activists and managers

who actively support and become allies to overcome benevolent marginalization.

or dissent, thereby hindering their advancement and perpetuating

# organizational inequality.

Imagine the scenario of benevolent sexism. Despite the decline of

overtly sexist attitudes, women still face subtle forms of discrimination

that may contribute to their underrepresentation in executive positions.

Women are often stereotyped as the “weaker sex” needing chivalrous

## protection, but this seemingly favorable treatment conceals male

dominance and can have negative consequences. When women are

shielded from challenging assignments at work, for example, it

inadvertently encourages stereotypes and fosters self-doubt, ultimately

hampering their professional performance.

In a three-year study examining benevolent sexism, we took a closer

look at women-only networking initiatives. These initiatives, touted

as essential components of diversity guidelines within organizations,

are often devised by male managers to assist women. However,

women frequently perceive them as a superﬁcial attempt or mere

tokenism aimed at fulﬁlling diversity quotas and creating a facade

of inclusivity. Many such initiatives place the burden of overcoming

gender disparities on women, often treating them as a homogenous

group while failing to address the underlying systemic bias that fuels

## gender inequality. Paradoxically, in our study, these women frequently

found themselves obligated to participate in such initiatives, only to

## experience feelings of patronization and occasional polite dismissal.

They also encountered instances of “mansplaining,” where men

condescendingly or patronizingly explain the intricacies of networking,

assuming women to have lesser or inferior knowledge of the subject.

These experiences can result in women feeling disillusioned and

disengaged from such initiatives.

Yet, a remarkable transformation can occur when women take charge of

these initiatives and tailor them to meet their individual needs. This can

be achieved through collaborating with women across diﬀerent levels of

seniority to foster an inclusive networking environment that promotes

diverse voices, oﬀers mentorship and sponsorship opportunities, and

creates spaces where women can openly and genuinely engage. Our

research suggests that women need to adopt a strategic, long-term

perspective in their networking endeavors, prioritize follow-ups to

build strong relationships, delineate tangible goals for professional

advancement, and engage in ongoing evaluation and improvement of

these initiatives. As a result, women can gain a sense of empowerment

and ﬁnd their voices to collectively combat gender inequality head-on.

## “Ableist Assumptions” Hinder Efforts to Help Workers with Disabilities

Let us explore another compelling example: benevolent ableism, which

refers to well-intentioned but problematic behaviors such as pity,

## protectiveness, and patronization toward employees with disabilities.

Managers, guided by ableist assumptions, often impose their own

deﬁnitions of disability, attempting to create “inclusive” environments

## that reinforce ableist norms in organizations.

In our longitudinal study of sheltered workshops, published in the

Academy of Management Journal, disabled workers report that many

inclusion initiatives at work are based on power imbalances rooted

in pity. Sheltered workshops provide employment to disabled workers

in segregated facilities with limited exposure to the broader public

under the guise of care and protection. We show that well-intentioned

managers often devise inclusion initiatives based on simpliﬁed

## assumptions that all workers with disabilities share identical needs of

help and assistance — a paternalistic or even infantilizing approach that

# perpetuates inequality.

However, a transformational moment may occur when these managers

confront their own fallibility, let go of their defensive positions,

abandon their patronizing behaviors, and provide opportunities to

people with disabilities to bring out their untapped potential. This

requires a change in communication from telling to listening and a

change in behavior to promote inclusive practices.

One example of a patronizing initiative in this context involved

assigning jobs that could be carried out within the conﬁnes of

the sheltered workshop, limiting public engagement. These jobs

encompassed metal processing, industrial assembly, packaging, and

shipping. In contrast, a successful inclusive practice involved

establishing a farmer’s market in consultation with these workers and

their representatives. Engaging directly with people from outside the

sheltered workshop environment while selling farm produce gave these

## workers newfound self-belief, autonomy, and a sense of empowerment.

This experience was a moment of epiphany that boosted workers’

conﬁdence in their abilities to perform tasks they had never envisioned

or been given the responsibility to perform. Managers also realized that

they had unwittingly stiﬂed the potential of some of these workers

while trying to be protective and creating a secluded environment. This

shift marked a profound turning point as managers transitioned from

## guardians to true allies of workers with disabilities.

## Three Key Strategies to Tackle Benevolent Marginalization at Work

In creating inclusive workplaces, managers need to invest time

and resources in understanding and dismantling benevolent

marginalization to ensure that equality in organizations becomes more

# than just a buzzword.

After studying this phenomenon across diverse settings, we present

three key insights that serve as tools for managers aiming to go beyond

# good intentions:

- 1. Shift your perspective from help to empowerment.

In the pursuit of creating inclusive workplaces, the traditional

approach of providing help can unintentionally reinforce unequal

power dynamics. Managers must view disadvantaged individuals as

equal colleagues. However, this is often easier said than done. Our

ﬁndings reveal that practitioners may resist change, seeking to preserve

deeply entrenched structures and the beneﬁts they bring.

Instead, managers need to call out and confront such resistance to

pave the way to a profound shift from protectionism toward self-

determination and empowerment. This requires introspection that can

prompt managers to scrutinize and challenge their own paternalistic

assumptions and biases. Managers must recognize and address the

often-hidden power dynamics at play when interacting with people

with whom they have a signiﬁcant power diﬀerential. Building trust,

actively listening, and gaining awareness of the emotions behind their

behaviors are crucial steps. Seeking candid feedback from colleagues,

mentors, or coaches about one’s paternalistic behaviors is vital for

self-reﬂection, sensitization, and remediation. Lastly, it is important

to display empathy toward marginalized perspectives, even when they

diﬀer from one’s own, and refrain from making decisions on their

# behalf, regardless of good intentions.

- 2. Harness allies in non-managerial roles.

Eﬀectively addressing benevolent marginalization across an

organization means tailoring initiatives that align with the unique

interests of disadvantaged individuals. However, doing so requires the help of others beyond managers or designated diversity oﬃcers.

It is critical to leverage the power of intermediaries, such as support

staﬀ, close colleagues, and friends, who are closer to the experiences

and challenges faced by their marginalized peers. Identifying and

designating these allies involves seeking out individuals who are known

to have actively supported marginalized communities. One way to

select these allies is by letting marginalized groups participate in

anonymous voting. This allows them to choose and elect individuals

they trust and believe in as champions of inclusion based on their

proven dedication and commitment. For example, at the sheltered

workshop, workers with disabilities were given the opportunity to vote

for their allies, who subsequently collaborated with management to

improve inclusion initiatives. This approach is also seen in academia,

where committees are frequently selected through voting to represent

the interests of junior or disadvantaged faculty members.

Organizations also need to recognize and reward allies who

actively contribute to creating an inclusive environment. Managers

can implement allyship programs or resource groups that oﬀer

tailored training and toolkits for allies, equipping them with the

necessary skills to support marginalized peers. This comprehensive

guidance should address issues such as identifying invisible bias,

uncovering instances of benevolent marginalization, and actively

advocating for and amplifying the voices of marginalized peers in

## their day-to-day interactions and decision-making processes. More

generally, organizations can establish conﬁdential feedback channels

or suggestion boxes where support staﬀ and colleagues can provide

input on potential improvements to policies and practices to avoid

paternalistic behaviors. By regularly reviewing and taking action based

on this feedback, organizations demonstrate their commitment to “walk

# the talk” on inclusivity.

- 3. Create supportive spaces by handing over responsibilities to disadvantaged individuals. Overcoming benevolent marginalization requires the creation of both

formal and informal supportive or “safe” spaces in the workplace

where marginalized groups can freely express themselves and expose

behaviors they perceive as paternalistic or patronizing. However, it

is not enough to unite marginalized employees in, say, an employee

resource group (ERG) and expect them to form an empowering

collective without further support. True inclusion demands a

## recognition of the diverse experiences and unique needs of everyone

within these spaces, and these individuals must have the choice to

# shape these spaces themselves.

Organizations must relinquish control and hand over the reins to

disadvantaged individuals to shape their own professional lives. By

doing so, organizations can become conﬁdence-building, encouraging,

and inspiring environments to challenge the status quo and overcome

existing paternalistic norms.

- • •

Building eﬀective diversity programs can be a challenging endeavor,

especially when hidden barriers hinder progress despite the best

intentions. While by no means exhaustive, these three evidence-based

strategies oﬀer a solid starting point for advancing true inclusion.

Shifting perspectives from help to empowerment, identifying hidden

allies, and handing over responsibilities to create supportive spaces

are crucial steps toward giving a platform to those who have long felt

silenced or not listened to and creating a workplace where everyone

feels heard and valued.
