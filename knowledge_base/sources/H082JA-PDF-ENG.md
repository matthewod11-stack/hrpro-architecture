## Last March, Meta’s CEO Mark Zuckerberg labeled 2023 the “Year of

Eﬃciency” in a company-wide email, noting that “ﬂatter is faster.”

According to Zuckerberg, “It’s well-understood that every layer of a

hierarchy adds latency and risk aversion in information ﬂow and

# decision-making.”

The consulting ﬁrm, McKinsey & Company, has echoed these

sentiments, describing how unstructuring your organization can unlock

massive value through the promise of increased collaboration, agility,

and employee empowerment. Research ﬁndings lend further support to

these ideas — a meta-analysis of 54 published studies involving 13,914

teams found that hierarchy tends to harm performance.

Although experiments with ﬂattening the hierarchy in high-proﬁle

companies like Zappos and Google have yielded mixed results —

leading some to claim that certain types of ﬂat structures are “hella

crazy” and “rarely work” — the fact remains that ﬁrms are gradually

becoming less centralized. Thus, successfully organizing for the future

requires a deep understanding of how to design, implement, and assess

# ﬂatter organizational structures.

We (the ﬁrst two authors) have reviewed hundreds of internal

documents, videos, presentations, and employee surveys provided to

## us as part of an ongoing collaboration with the third author, Juan

## Pablo Sánchez Celi, the CEO of Avinsa, a food processing company

in Santander, Colombia, with roughly 350 employees. Avinsa is in the

midst of a change initiative — referred to internally as Avinsa Viva —

aimed at ﬂattening the hierarchy.

This corpus of information, meticulously documented over a three-

year span, illustrates the fact that leading this type of organizational

change is messy, nuanced, and really hard. The path is riddled with

complexities, from managing employee expectations and redeﬁning

leadership roles to reconﬁguring communication channels and

# decision-making processes.

By integrating the CEO’s personal experiences leading this change

initiative with our review of internal company records, we shed

## light on some of the challenges, learnings, and strategies that can

guide organizations in their quest to ﬂatten hierarchies without

compromising on eﬃciency, growth, and employee well-being.

Speciﬁcally, we focus on two areas: structural and people dynamics.

# Structural Dynamics

These are the dynamics related to the structural and operational

challenges facing organizations that are transitioning to a ﬂatter

structure. They include:

# The persistence of zombie structures.

Old habits are like the undead; they just won’t stay buried. As

companies aim to ﬂatten structures, the ghosts of past hierarchies can linger, haunting the change eﬀort. These zombie structures manifest

in various ways – a decision-making process that still seeks approval

from the top, or a communication ﬂow that remains bottlenecked

## through speciﬁc channels, reminiscent of the before times. This

inadvertent reversion can stiﬂe the very essence of ﬂat structures:

## agility, empowerment, and direct communication.

## During the early days of Avinsa’s transformation, for example, teams

would unconsciously defer to the historically dominant quality control

and internal control departments during process redesigns, spotlighting

deep-seated habits and perceptions that the organization needed

to unlearn. Furthermore, the former head of the safety and health

at work department found herself navigating the complexities of

operating alone as a safety coach. Meanwhile her former aides, now part of diﬀerent “circles” — autonomous work units where members

collectively make decisions regarding their speciﬁc operational tasks

without external supervision — faced diﬃculties adapting to their new teams. Addressing these challenges required signiﬁcant eﬀort,

including coaching, physical relocation, and role redeﬁnition.

To truly ﬂatten an organization, it’s not enough to build anew; one must

## also actively dismantle and guard against the resurrection of the old.

Regular audits, feedback sessions, and reorientation programs can help

eliminate these lingering tendencies.

# The integration imperative.

As some work units transition to a ﬂat model, they may need

to interface with units still operating under traditional hierarchies,

creating potential friction and misalignment. At Avinsa, this dynamic was evident when units with diﬀerent structures tried to collaborate.

While middle managers and senior leaders — who company leaders

believed were best positioned to adapt to decentralization with minimal

disruption to their day-to-day work — were incorporated into the

decentralization initiative, frontline workers, responsible for processing

100,000 chickens and 50 tons of ice per day, continued to work under

a hierarchical structure. This dual approach led to palpable disparities:

as some employees enjoyed newfound autonomy, frontline workers felt

left behind. Such inconsistencies can be taken personally, making it

crucial to navigate communication gaps without seeming contradictory.

Avinsa’s journey spotlights the importance of context and adaptability.

Although the company’s leaders aspire to design a completely ﬂat

organization, they are unsure when, if ever, they will extend the

decentralization initiative to the frontline workers. Similarly, not every

organization ﬁts neatly into theoretical molds, and decentralization

decisions must be tailored to speciﬁc challenges, personnel, and

organizational objectives. Company leaders can make progress in this

regard by slowly and organically incorporating more decentralized

principles into some parts of their organization without expecting these eﬀorts to look the same in other parts of their organization.

By pursuing deliberate and incremental change that gives employees

the time to make sense of and adjust to their new work environment,

company leaders can alleviate, though not entirely eliminate, feelings

of disorientation, threat, or anxiety that some employees may have. If executed eﬀectively, organizations can not only prevent potential

conﬂicts but also harness the strengths of both models, fostering a more harmonious and eﬀective collaborative environment.

# Uneven progress. Diﬀerent departments, with their unique histories, cultures, and

operational nuances, may not transition at the same pace. Avinsa

experienced this unevenness ﬁrsthand. For instance, while stringent

regulations regarding processing poultry for human consumption

reduced the occupational health and safety department employees’

decision-making latitude that decentralization seeks to expand,

maintenance department employees were quick to embrace their

newfound autonomy. Before decentralizing, maintenance employees implemented an oﬀsite manager’s decisions without having input. For

example, the manager could unilaterally require employees to use a

particular brand or style of equipment based on a crude cost analysis without fully understanding how this decision aﬀected the employees

who had to use it. After decentralizing, the employees who worked on

the plant ﬂoor and best understood their area’s needs collectively made

# those decisions.

Avinsa’s leaders could have avoided some growing pains if they

had been more sensitive to these unique departmental factors. More

generally, a tailored transition strategy might involve extended training

for one department, a phased rollout for another, or even the provision of additional resources where needed. Importantly, these eﬀorts may

## increase employee engagement and sense of ownership over the

# transition process.

Juggling multiple change initiatives.

Organizations frequently manage several change initiatives at once.

Balancing the shift to a ﬂat structure with other organizational changes

can feel like changing the tires on a moving car, leading to potential

# clashes and misalignments.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Challenges of Becoming a Less Hierarchical Company

After investing considerable time in the decentralization process,

a surge in demand from Avinsa’s largest client necessitated other

operational adjustments, including transitioning from one 12-hour work

shift to two 9-hour shifts. Faced with extended hours and new roles,

employees began associating the disruptions from this operational shift

with the broader decentralization initiative. As a result, support for the

decentralization initiative began to wane among some employees; the

fragile groundwork the company had laid was on the verge of collapsing.

In hindsight, assuming that employees would intuitively discern the eﬀects of the two changes was an oversight and underscores the

importance of using clear and consistent communication to guide

## employee perceptions in the face of concurrent change initiatives.

More generally, companies can provide clarity to their workforce by

delineating the sequence and interrelation of various change initiatives.

This might involve phased rollouts, where one change is solidiﬁed

before introducing another, or designating speciﬁc teams to champion

each initiative. Prioritization, based on factors like urgency, impact,

and feasibility, ensures that resources are optimally allocated. Regular

## communication about the progress and rationale behind each change

can further align employees.

# People Dynamics

These dynamics highlight the human aspects of the transition, emphasizing the importance of eﬀective communication, training, and

leadership in inﬂuencing the organization’s culture and its people. They

# include:

The razor’s edge of empowering leadership.

In the dynamic landscape of ﬂat, decentralized organizational

## structures, the role of leadership undergoes a profound transformation.

## The conventional paradigms of command-and-control give way to a

## more nuanced, and arguably more challenging, model of leadership.

Leadership in such a structure becomes an intricate dance. Leaders

are expected to be visionaries, setting the direction and inspiring

their teams, yet they must carefully calibrate their inﬂuence. Exerting

too much control can stiﬂe the empowerment and initiative that ﬂat structures aim to foster. Conversely, being too hands-oﬀ can leave teams

directionless, craving the clarity and decisiveness that leadership is

supposed to provide.

The challenges of this delicate balance were vividly illustrated at

Avinsa. Here, leaders continually navigated the tightrope between

asserting their views and encouraging independent decision-making

among team members. In their enthusiasm to drive progress, leaders

inadvertently dominated discussions at times, thereby curtailing the

very autonomy they sought to promote. In other situations, their

reluctance to intervene led to a lack of clear direction, resulting in

# confusion and ineﬃciency.

Such experiences are not unique to Avinsa, but rather are inherent

to the nature of decentralized leadership. They underscore the need

for leaders to develop a heightened sense of self-awareness and a

willingness to adapt their style. Regular feedback from team members

and consultants involved in the decentralization process becomes

crucial. This feedback loop helps leaders gauge how their actions and

decisions are perceived and whether they are successfully maintaining

## the equilibrium between guidance and empowerment.

At a deeper level, leaders in decentralized organizations must adopt

## a learning orientation and embrace this complexity. Mistakes and

missteps are inevitable. The key lies in being open to feedback,

reﬂecting on one’s leadership style, and continuously ﬁne-tuning the

approach to meet the unique demands of a ﬂatter, more empowered

# organizational structure.

Adapting external ideas to the internal culture. Determining how to eﬀectively ﬂatten an organization’s structure can

be daunting. Enter consultants, who can provide guidance and best

practices. To gain initial traction, Avinsa’s leaders partnered with an

organization that helps companies and other collectives learn how to

organize in a decentralized way. However, it soon became apparent

that adopting an established model for decentralization like holacracy,

sociocracy, or teal — as the consultants had suggested — would not

# work at Avinsa.

Likewise, separate communication consultants hired by the

company seemed somewhat detached from the nuances of Avinsa’s

transformation. While they provided essential technical expertise,

their suggestions occasionally misaligned with the company’s culture

and overlooked local challenges. As a result, Avinsa’s in-house

communications team decided to ignore several of the external team’s

recommendations and chose not to renew their contract.

Overall, external consultants’ advice should be assessed in light of

the organization’s core values and capabilities, ensuring alignment

and authenticity. This can motivate employees when they see familiar

values reﬂected in new practices.

# The jargon jungle.

Organizational change often brings with it a wave of new terminologies.

While intended to streamline and deﬁne the transition, new terminology can sometimes have the opposite eﬀect. Instead of

facilitating clarity, these new terms can become barriers, muddying

understanding and creating divides among employees. Such disparities

in understanding can hinder collaboration and impede the very

progress these terms were meant to support.

## The architects of Avinsa’s decentralization eﬀort dealt with this

challenge by promoting new terms like “circles,” “sub-circles,” and

“coordinators,” while steering clear of other relevant, yet potentially

confusing terms like “holacracy,” “sociocracy,” and “teal,” opting instead

to couch the essence of those terms in more familiar concepts like

“power,” “autonomy,” and “decision-making” when communicating

with employees. Furthermore, company leaders attempted to embed

these concepts in Avinsa’s culture through repetition in the form of animated videos that explained the decentralization eﬀort and its

## rationale, as well as videos of employee interviews and testimonials

featuring the new terminology.

## A clear glossary of terms, orientation sessions, and regular workshops

can ensure that employees not only understand the terminology

but also grasp its relevance and application. Through these

measures, organizations can achieve a shared language that enhances

# collaboration.

# The reskilling requirement.

As roles evolve, so too must skills. While potentially empowering, this

shift can be challenging for many. For instance, after adopting a ﬂatter

management structure, Avinsa’s budget responsibilities shifted from

## former department heads to sub-circle coordinators, some of whom

lacked experience managing budgets. Accordingly, Avinsa grappled

## with budgetary challenges for several months until the “Financial Club”

was born. Led by the ﬁnance team, this initiative provided tailored

coaching on budget management, empowering the new ﬁnancial

stewards with essential knowledge related to P&L, cash ﬂow, and

# proﬁtability.

The company also administered formal assessments across the

company more broadly, which identiﬁed other gaps between current

## technical and interpersonal skills and desired competencies. They

followed these up with training modules related to topics such as

## communication, ﬁnancial analysis, negotiation, and customer service

that employees were incentivized to complete.

More generally, organizations may oﬀer a mix of workshops, mentorship

initiatives, and hands-on projects, aimed to equip employees with the

tools they need to thrive in a less structured setting.

Setting the right pace.

As companies adopt ﬂatter structures, an excessive emphasis on

collective agreement can slow down decision-making processes,

diverting employees from their main duties and negatively impacting

# essential business functions.

Two insights were crucial to improving Avinsa’s decision-making

process, which relied on collective consent. First, it was essential

for employees to understand the scope of their responsibilities and

decision-making authority. When role boundaries were clearly deﬁned

and collectively understood, employees felt empowered to swiftly

execute tasks without seeking approval. Second, when a large or

particularly profound issue (e.g., an ethical decision) demanded group

input, it was helpful to break down the subject into digestible pieces,

## examine each, and secure collective agreement step-by-step.

Staying patient and committed to the broader goal was also key.

## At Avinsa, external facilitators from other areas of the company

play a crucial role, not only in guiding the discussions but also

in emphasizing the rationale and beneﬁts of the company’s chosen

approach. Facilitators assist in ensuring that commitments are recorded

and that these commitments are reviewed and followed up on in future

meetings. For example, individuals from corporate communications,

ﬁnance, or accounting have served as facilitators in circles related

to operations. The idea is that these employees merely facilitate

conversations, but do not participate with comments and judgment.

Demonstrating short-term agility while maintaining a long-term vision.

Adopting a ﬂat structure can bring enhanced collaboration,

empowerment, and adaptability, but recognizing these beneﬁts requires

participants to adopt a long-term view, especially when immediate

results are elusive. At the same time, organizations must be equipped

to pivot, adapt, and recalibrate their strategies in real-time.

Avinsa discovered that providing employees with structured

opportunities to reﬂect on and share the ways in which Avinsa Viva

impacted their roles, perceptions, and job satisfaction helped them

connect their experiences in the present with their desired future —

# both individually and collectively.

For example, what began as informal reﬂections on the structure and

## impact of Avinsa Viva during routine circle and sub-circle meetings

evolved into a structured forum for employees to share their reactions and ideas related to the decentralization eﬀort. Company leaders also

administered surveys every three months to assess employee attitudes

related to the change at the sub-circle level, and facilitated a one-time

reﬂection exercise for all employees aimed at uncovering employees’

## sources of motivation and purpose at work and outside of work, the

results of which company leaders sought to align with the anticipated beneﬁts of the ongoing decentralization eﬀort.

When employees see the bigger picture, understand the nuances, and

believe in the transformative potential of a ﬂat structure, they become

more than just participants — they become co-owners. This sense of

## psychological ownership increases commitment, fosters resilience, and

ensures that every step taken is imbued with collective purpose and

# conviction.

. . .

Three years in and Avinsa’s eﬀorts to decentralize continue. Although

there is no single, obvious metric by which to assess the company’s

progress, the tone is hopeful internally. By documenting Avinsa’s

journey, our aim is to help leaders of other organizations considering

similar change initiatives to anticipate and avoid the setbacks Avinsa

encountered and identify and achieve the beneﬁts that a ﬂatter

organizational structure can provide.
