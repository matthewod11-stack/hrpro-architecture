For decades, workplace stress was viewed primarily as an individual

concern to be managed by HR—often through wellness programs or

## stress management workshops—rather than as a systemic, business-

critical risk that warrants executive oversight. The consequences of this

outdated perspective persist today—not due to a lack of awareness, but

because workplace stress is often still treated as peripheral to business

# strategy rather than as integral to it.

In a Deloitte survey, 94% of C-suite executives agreed on the

importance of being health-savvy leaders. However, 68% admitted they

aren’t taking suﬃcient action to safeguard employee and stakeholder

health. This indicates a signiﬁcant gap between acknowledgment and

implementation. Meanwhile, data from Aﬂac shows that although 54%

of employees in 2024 felt their employer cared about their mental

health (up from 48% in 2023), 38% reported high stress at work (a rise

from 33% in 2023) suggesting that current investments are missing the

mark on addressing stress-speciﬁc needs.

Why aren’t these investments working? We argue that one of the

root causes of rising stress levels—despite investment—is companies’

limited ability to measure and quantify the problem. Just as companies

## rigorously measure ﬁnancial, operational, and reputational risks, we

## suggest that they must also measure and manage stress as a business

# risk.

We introduce the Stress Risk Thermometer—a new framework

to help organizations assess and track stress-driven business risk —and oﬀer actionable strategies for building resilience through

structured measurement, cross-functional accountability, and targeted

# interventions.

# What Stress Costs Organizations

## In our recent study of 1,005 full-time professionals across high-intensity

industries in the U.S. and UK, we found that high levels of stress

## translate into an added $5.3 million annually in costs for every 1,000

employees at a company. Our analysis also found that the cost of

stress for employers can be seen across three areas: cost control, risk

mitigation, and sustained performance.

# Cost Control

Our data shows that employees experiencing high stress ﬁle 2.5 times

more health claims than their low-stress counterparts, creating a direct

ﬁnancial burden for businesses that self-insure. Rising health insurance

## costs, identiﬁed in Mercer’s People Risk Report 2024 as the number one

business risk globally, are accelerating the urgency to address the cost

risk. From 2020 to 2024, per-employee premium costs in the U.S. have

surged by 28%, with annual increases averaging 6.5%.

# Risk Mitigation

Additionally, 12% of employees in our study admitted to making

mistakes, missing deadlines, or cutting corners in ways that could

jeopardize regulatory compliance—and employees under high stress are

11 times more likely to do so. The ﬁnancial penalties for non-compliance

can be devastating, and we believe that what might be even harder to

recover is the loss of stakeholder trust and reputational damage that

stress-driven failures can create.

# Sustained Performance

Our data shows that chronic stress drains workforce productivity.

Highly stressed employees take 8 times more sick days and disengage

at 4 times the rate of their low-stress peers. The combined cost of

absenteeism, presenteeism (working while unproductive), and turnover

results in an average of $12,000 in productivity loss per highly stressed

## employee, per year—a silent but substantial drag on proﬁtability.

## Stress-related turnover accounts for the largest share of cost—

approximately $3.5 million annually—based on the assumption that

one-third of employees who intend to leave will do so within

a year, with turnover costs estimated conservatively at 100% of

salary. Presenteeism costs employers around $1 million annually,

using Gallup’s benchmark that disengagement-related productivity loss

equates to 18% of salary. Lastly, stress-related absenteeism costs an

estimated $778,000 per year, driven by the six additional sick days taken

annually by high-stress employees, calculated over a 260-day work year.

## A Tool for Quantifying and Mitigating Stress-Induced Risks

The ﬁrst and arguably most important step in managing stress risk is

## an accurate measurement of stress within your own organization. Many

leaders tell us that they view stress as too subjective or personal to

## quantify. Traditional tools like engagement surveys and pulse checks

typically capture only snapshots of sentiment and rarely connect

stress to the business outcomes that executives care about most like

## productivity, cost control, and risk exposure.

## Our Stress Risk Thermometer provides a diﬀerent approach. Produced

as a method of analysis for our research study, it delivers a structured,

tiered assessment of employee stress which enables leaders to calibrate

their interventions—prompting targeted strategies when a signiﬁcant

portion of the workforce falls into high-stress zones linked to

# measurable risks.

# How to Get Started

Companies can begin assessing stress risk internally by asking a simple

question like, “How often do you feel stressed, anxious, or overwhelmed

at work?” once every 6-12 months. Employees can be prompted to select

between “none of the time,” “rarely,” “sometimes,” “frequently,” or “all

of the time.” These data allow leaders to segment their workforce into

low, medium, and high-stress zones, and should be held to high privacy

standards which we will discuss in greater detail below.

- Low zone: Employees are experiencing low stress and risks are

low. They report feeling stressed “rarely” or “none of the time.”

They operate in a sustainable performance state with minimal

operational vulnerability. Our research shows they take fewer sick

days, submit fewer health claims, and report collaborating more eﬀectively. Organizations with higher concentrations of employees

in this zone tend to see more focused, resilient, and engaged teams.

In our research, this group made up 14% of employees who were surveyed. (While these numbers may diﬀer in your company, we oﬀer

this number as an initial benchmark to see how your workforce stress

breakdown compares to our sample.)

- Medium zone: Stress is elevated at times but not critical, risks

are elevated but can be managed. Employees in this group report

feeling stressed “sometimes.” While often appearing productive,

## persistent moderate stress—without adequate recovery—can erode

focus, creativity, and teamwork. Over time, this zone is likely to

become a source of hidden performance risk, marked by an increased

risk of disengagement, strained relationships, and health-related

challenges. Our data suggests this group makes up about 41% of the

# workforce.

- High zone: Stress is continual or severe enough to aﬀect employees

chronically, making risks likely. Employees report feeling stressed

“frequently” or “all the time.” This group represents a crisis zone with

compounding costs and operational vulnerabilities. Compared to low-

stress peers, these employees take 8 times more sick days, are 3.7 times

more likely to consider leaving, 4 times more likely to be disengaged,

11 times more likely to make compliance-related mistakes, 2.5 times

more likely to ﬁle health claims, and 7 times more likely to report

interpersonal conﬂict with their colleagues. Our data suggests that this

group makes up about 45% of the workforce.

After seeing where their workforce falls, companies can analyze how

## these stress zones correlate with operational data that they already

track, including revenue, compliance failures, and client satisfaction.

This involves comparing patterns to see whether particular departments

experience higher stress and also have more errors or declining

customer feedback compared to less stressed departments or teams.

The goal is to identify whether elevated stress is concentrated in areas

tied to critical business outcomes, and whether this elevated stress is

associated with increased risk or reduced performance.

Finally, to act on these insights, companies can pinpoint the underlying

factors that predict stress. These factors can be assessed by asking

employees questions such as: “To what extent do your workload

and deadlines feel manageable?” or “Do you feel psychologically safe

raising concerns or asking for help?” These additional insights can help

organizations design targeted, structural interventions that address the

## critical predictors of this stress-related risk.

For example: One multinational client that we worked with used the Stress Risk Thermometer framework to gauge how diﬀerent levels of

stress related to resilience across the organization, broken down by

department and region. After conducting an initial stress survey, they

ran a follow-up survey asking questions such as “How conﬁdent are you in your ability to manage stress eﬀectively?” to assess levels of stress

# resilience.

Analyzing resilience reveals how well employees can recover and

sustain performance under stress—providing a forward-looking

## measure of risk and readiness, especially in leadership roles. The

company found that managers were experiencing higher levels of

perceived stress than others, but also reported higher resilience—

highlighting the importance of equipping future leaders with stress

# resilience skills.

The survey also revealed company-wide risk areas like prolonged

sedentariness, reduced perceived productivity, and a lack of conﬁdence

over ability to cope with stress. These insights were shared in leadership

team meetings and resulted in strategic interventions including

scheduled movement breaks and a healthy habits campaign. These

initiatives saw signiﬁcantly higher engagement than previous well- being eﬀorts, with 54% of interventions delivering in-the-moment stress

# reduction.

Based on these insights, we co-designed a habit formation program

tailored to ﬁt the needs of each region and department. To encourage

regular participation, we created a central leaderboard that celebrated

every time someone chose to show up and engage in these stress-

lowering programs.

# Formalize Stress in Risk Management

To be eﬀective, managing stress as a material liability requires shared

ownership. Integrating stress into formal risk management frameworks

ensures regular assessment, reporting, and discussion at the leadership and board levels. In our work, the most eﬀective organizations bring

## together leadership across HR, ﬁnance, and risk management teams

to co-own stress-risk mitigation—breaking down traditional silos to

protect, equip, and motivate their workforce.

When HR’s understanding of employees is combined with analytical

rigor, organizations can build sophisticated approaches that track

## absenteeism trends, performance ﬂuctuations, and other early warning

signs of disengagement. Formalizing this collaboration ensures that

stress is reviewed alongside ﬁnancial and operational risks at the

# leadership level.

For example, one global commercial law ﬁrm integrated mental health

and stress into its broader risk management framework, aligning

## with recommendations from the ISO 45003, the global standard

for workplace mental health and burnout management, to address

psychosocial risk from poor mental health. They developed both

leading and lagging indicators—drawing on insurer and broker data—

and linked these to cost and performance metrics. This allowed them

to demonstrate the ROI of their current well-being interventions. This

approach enabled more targeted, evidence-based actions, reinforced

psychological safety, and built a strong, cross-functional case for

sustained investment in mental health.

A note on privacy: We believe that stress data should always be collected

anonymously and reported in aggregate, for example, at the team or

department level, rather than at the individual level. Any measurement eﬀorts should be transparent, with employees clearly informed about

what’s being measured, how the data will be used, and how it will

beneﬁt them.

Most importantly, we believe that this work must focus on system-level

change, not individual blame. The purpose of a tool like the Stress Risk

Thermometer is not to monitor employees, but to provide leaders with

visibility into where structural changes are needed, so the root causes of

stress can be addressed in ways that have the potential to improve both

# health and performance.

. . .

Organizations can no longer aﬀord to react to events as they unfold.

Instead, they must build and embed resilience as a long-term capacity—

## through individual support and organizational design.

Resilience isn’t a program—it is a system embedded into how

organizations lead, operate, and grow. Building it requires a shared

commitment: employees need support to build sustainable health

habits, while organizations must take responsibility for shaping

environments that reduce stress and build psychological safety.

We believe that organizations must regularly use data on work stress

to reassess policies, practices, and cultural norms, if they want to

prevent employee stress from becoming a chronic and costly concern.

By embedding resilience into the fabric of the organization, we believe

that leaders can reduce the likelihood of disruption, protect workforce

health, and unlock a long-term competitive advantage.
