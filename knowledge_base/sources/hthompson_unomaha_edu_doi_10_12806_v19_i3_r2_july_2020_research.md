## THE EVOLUTION OF INCLUSIVE LEADERSHIP STUDIES: A literature review

# Abstract

# The dramatic on the concept of

increase of diversity on US college campuses has coincided with greater academic

# inclusive

# leadership. The present

literature provides a systematic analysis of

# interest

# literature

# from

# its

# forming phases

# in the early 1990s to

its present condition. Priority publications were selected

rigorously and then examined

in order to better determine what theoretical emphasis each of the three

decades might have yielded and which what these studies reveal about the evolution of this relatively new

leadership paradigm. From the review themes were identified and observations were made for future research purposes.

Researchers Shore, et al. (2011) can be credited for

providing

# the first cogent

# framework of

# inclusion

# in the

literature we reviewed. This team of authors

focused on managerial practices that lead to inclusion

and built from the work of Brewer (1991) to do so (p.

1263). The authors used this theory-building article

to present a framework for inclusion (see Figure 3).

The authors show how they postulate four possible

outcomes when considering overall group

# inclusion.

- 1) Exclusion

# for

# those whose belongingness and

uniqueness needs are not met, 2) Assimilation for

those who feel they belong but are not valued for

# uniqueness, 3) Differentiation

# for

those who are

and 4) Inclusion for those who have both needs met.

In subsequent work, Shore et al. (2018) advanced an

# organizational

framework. The article provides an

# effective review of the

literature before setting out

to better frame the experience of inclusion as it is

aided and developed by leadership. They go beyond

their previous work to introduce a new model that

represents an inclusive organization. As a review and

theory building article, this work also provides a more

# in-depth analysis of

# leadership styles

# in comparison

# to

# the

# inclusive

# leader designation.

It does not,

# however, address

# the

# intercultural competency of

leaders nor the climate that might facilitate inclusion.

## them, resulting in some of the red lining practices that

# •

we know have wrought drastic social consequences.

When differences are viewed and modeled as

polarizing forces it can be expected that they will trend

toward creating civic conflict rather than productive

understanding. When society minimizes differences

we tend to mute the numerous benefits they actually

## bring to the educational and civic context. This review

has also highlighted

# the

# function

# that

# inclusion

can serve

# in all contexts.

It also demonstrates that

colleges can model and encourage this

# important

## dynamic. In the preamble to the US constitution our

national goals are clearly stated. We are all striving

to form a more perfect union; civic engagement, we

know, is established as the social function reserved to

promote and ensure that ultimate output.

Inclusion,

it seems, best provides us the sensible process to

facilitate a more perfect union. This is especially true

because there are so many voices that need to be

considered and represented

# in the vast tapestry of

our national landscape. When this happens, we have

every reason to expect positive change. We can expect

# that

individuals will experience personal acceptance

and positive personal distinction. We can expect that

nationally we will learn how to accept differences as

we experience them and adapt to them in countless

# healthy and meaningful ways.
