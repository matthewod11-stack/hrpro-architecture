But global teams do not come without their challenges. Apartfrom physical distance and miscommunications, culturalmissteps can cause frustration and misunderstandings that canhinder building strong relationships with your colleagues in otherparts of the world. While you may be convinced that your studies,your travels, or even your own

multicultural background haveprepared you to work on a global team, there’s more to considerthan you might expect, especially if you’re new to the workforce.Building relationships across cultures on your team will taketime, effort, and care. Here’s how to connect with your colleagues,communicate more effectively, and collaborate for success.

“If you go into every interaction assuming that culture doesn’tmatter, your default mechanism will be to view others throughyour cultural lens and to judge or misjudge them accordingly,” asprofessor Erin Meyer explains in her book

The Culture Map.We are all the products of different cultures: education,ethnicities, national, regional, academic, workplace culture, andwork experiences. If you want to form lasting relationships andwork together effectively with an intercultural team, you need tofirst do your homework and get to know your colleagues better.

While asking your colleagues questions about their backgroundcan be helpful, you should try to do some of your own researchfirst about the countries they live in or identify with: the location,

capital, culture(s), language(s), and main historical facts. It canalso be helpful to research potentially taboo topics in theircountries, like religion, politics, gender orientation, money, andmore. It’s important to think twice before discussing these topicsat work and learn how to talk about them with sensitivity andunderstanding if they do.While you can certainly find some of this information online, itcan also be helpful to take an intercultural training course. Thesecourses can help you get to know your own culture better andunderstand the way different cultures communicate, buildrelationships, or even react to risks. Another insightful frameworkyou can use is

Geert Hofstede’s Country Comparison Tool, whichcan help you learn about general cultural values in differentcountries.

Another important aspect of connecting with your colleagues andpaving the way for collaboration is

getting their names right — thepronunciation, first and last name, nicknames, and titles.If you’re unsure about someone’s name or how to pronounce it,you can ask:

Do you prefer to be called [ﬁrst name] or [nickname]?

Could you pronounce your name for me, please?

Did I pronounce your name correctly?I have often found it useful to ask colleagues to send me a voicenote with the pronunciation of their name. It helps me learn thename and rehearse it.

Also, remember that different cultures may be more, or less,formal with how they address colleagues. For example, when Iworked in Japan, I used last names more than first names. And inthe UAE, India, or Germany, the title Doctor (holder of a Ph.D.) is amark of respect, and it’s important to always use it for someonewho has earned that degree.

As you get to interact more with your colleagues, you can begin toask respectful questions to get to know them and their culturebetter. But don’t let your curiosity put them in an uncomfortableposition. Before leading with questions about someone’sbackground, for example, challenge your assumptions first. Areyou assuming someone’s nationality or origin based on just theirlast name? Are you assuming someone’s religion based on thelanguage they speak or country they live in?For example, I’ve often been asked “So, how long have you beenliving in France?” The irony? I was born in France. I‘ve also beenasked the usual, “Where are you from?” When I answer, “FromFrance,” they follow up with, “Nice, and where are your parentsfrom?”

Questions like these — ones that are based in assumptionsrather than reality — can be othering and can hurt yourrelationships more than help them.After you’ve checked your own assumptions, consider yourcolleague’s comfort level. Maybe they’ve been open in the pastabout their background, or maybe you’ve already asked themmore general questions about their country, culture, or workplacepreferences. Over time, you will gain a better picture of wheretheir boundaries are. You can also ask them upfront if they’recomfortable with you asking a question about a specific topic.Here are some examples of questions you might ask:

I learned from your out of oﬃce message that our oﬃces inChina were closed for [festival name] last Thursday. How do youcelebrate [festival name]?

Languages fascinate me. What about you? How many languagescan you speak?

I heard you mention [word/phrase]. I’m not familiar with thatword. Would you mind explaining it to me, please?Questions like these can help you forge a strong relationship withyour colleague — both on a personal and professional level.

Getting to know your colleagues is just the first step in buildinglasting relationships across cultures. To collaborate effectively,work with your colleagues to find ways that are respectful ofeveryone’s preferences and cultural norms.

In addition to getting to know your colleagues better on anindividual level, you should also try to understand how differentcultures think about work. For example, Spain gets really hot insummers, so people tend to finish their work days earlier. DuringRamadan in Jordan or Egypt, people may start or leave workearlier to accommodate for early-morning meals. Meanwhile,different summer and winter working hours don’t apply in placeslike Africa or Japan.If you’re trying to keep track of many different schedules on yourteam, it can be beneficial to create a spreadsheet of yourcolleagues’ different working hours or holidays. This can help yoube more mindful of not organizing meetings during their lunchbreaks or other off hours. Keeping a shared calendar of your

team’s holidays, festivals, and time off can be another helpful wayto show your respect.If you’re not sure what hours a colleague follows, you can askthem:

I’d like to plan our next meeting. Do you have ﬁxed hours foryour lunch break?

I’d like to plan the kickoﬀ meeting in the ﬁrst week of June. Canyou let me know what your working hours are this summer?

We plan to beta test in the week of July 1-5. Do you have anyholidays or are you taking any time oﬀ I should know about?

On a global team, it’s important to discuss the way you prefer towork, and open the door for others to share their preferences aswell. For example, when I begin to collaborate with newinternational colleagues, I’m open about the way I communicate,and the influence my culture may have on the interaction. InFrance, for example, we tend to interrupt each other duringconversations, but that can be considered impolite or distrustfulin American work cultures. Letting others know ahead of time canbe helpful to avoid any miscommunications.You can also ask your colleagues directly about theircommunication preferences. For example:

Do you prefer communicating via phone, email, or is instantmessaging better?

Are you comfortable being on video during our meetings?

What should I know about you that will help us communicateeﬀectively?

If one of us makes a mistake, how will we recover?

How do you prefer to handle conﬂicts if they arise?Another thing to keep in mind when setting communicationground rules is to be aware of different factors out of yourcolleagues’ control. For example, the internet speed andbandwidth may differ from one country to another. Electricityshortages may happen in other countries. There can bedisconnections and other communication issues that do notreflect on an individual’s professionalism or preparedness.Discuss these potential issues ahead of time and have a game planfor moving forward when they do happen.

When working on an intercultural team, everyone will likelyspeak the same language — but not always at the same level, orwith the same confidence. That’s why it’s important to makecommunicating with each other as easy as possible.Take the English language for example. One way native speakerscan help their colleagues is by using “

Globish,” or Global English— a simplified version of English used for communicationpurposes.Some do’s and don’ts of Globish include:

Do explain the meaning of acronyms

Don’t say: “I’ll be OOO next week.”

Do say: “I am on vacation next week and will be unavailable.”

Avoid jargon or provide

# a glossary

Don’t say: “What’s your bandwidth for this project?

Do say: “How much time do you have to work on thisproject?”

Don’t use idioms (or give an explanation when you do usethem)

Don’t say: “You can call the shots on this project.”

Do say: “You’ll be the main decision-maker on this project.”

Do reformulate to use

# Globish words when you can

Don’t say: “Let’s catch up about that later.”

Do say: “We can talk about the project later.”It’s also important to speak slowly and articulate well whenspeaking Globish, and to make any jokes with caution. But evenwith Globish, miscommunications can happen. Again, it can behelpful to set some communication guidelines, such as “Don’thesitate to interrupt me if something is unclear. I tend to speakquickly,” or “I’ll take notes during the meeting to be sure we areon the same page and I’ll send out the minutes later.”

Building relationships across cultural boundaries is not a one-offexercise. It takes time, perseverance, and courage. And odds are,you will make mistakes. The key to moving forward when culturalmissteps happen is to highlight what’s at stake, talk transparentlyto avoid grudges, and confirm humbly that you’re eager toimprove and work together.
