# Successful vs. Effective Real Managers

## Fred Luthans University of Nebraska, Lincoln

hat do successful managers — those who have been promoted relatively quickly — have in common with effective managers — those who have satisfied, committed subordinates and high performing units? Surprisingly, the answer seems to be that they have little in common. Success- ful managers in what we define as ‘real organizations” — large and small mainstream organizations, mostly in the mushrooming service industry in middle America — are not engaved in the same day-to-day activities as effectrve man- agers in these organizations This is probably the most impor- tant, and certainly the most intriguing, finding of a compre- hensive four-year observational study of managerial work that 1s reported in a recent book by myselt and two col- leagues, titled Real Manayers !

The startling finding that there 1s a difference between successful and effective managers may mercly confirm for many cynics and “passed over” managers something they have suspected for years. They believe that although manag- ers who are successful (that ts, rapidly promoted) may be astute politicians, they are not necessarily effective Indeed, the so-called successful managers may be the ones who do not in fact take care of people and get high performance trom their units

Could this finding explain some of the performance problems facing American organizations today? Could it be that the successful managers, the politically savvy ones who are being rapidly promoted into responsible positions, may not be the effective managers, the ones with satisfied, com- mitted subordinates turning out quantity and quality per- formance in their units?

This article explores the heretofore assumed equiva- lence of “successful managers” and “effective managers ”’ Instead of looking for sophisticated technical or governmen- tal approaches to the performance problems facing today’s organizations, the solution may be as simple as promoting effective managers and learning how they carry out their jobs Maybe its time to turn to the real managers themselves for some answers

And who are these managers? They are found at all levels and in all types of organizations with titles such as department head, general manager, store manager, market- ing manager, office manager, agency chief, or district man- ager Inother words, maybe the answers to the performance problems facing organizations today can be found tn their own backvards, in the managers themselves in their day-to- day activities

# The Current View of Managerial Work

Through the years management has been defined as the tamous French administrator and writer Henri Fayol said, by the functions of planning, organizing, commanding, coordinating, and controlling. Only recently has this classical view of managers been challenged.2 Starting with the land-

mark work of Henry Mintzberg, observational studies of managerial work have found that the normative functions do not hold up. Mintzberg charged that Fayol and others’ classical view of what managers do was merely ‘folklore 3 On the bass of his observations of five CEOs and their rr atl, Mintzberg concluded that the manager’sjob consisted of many brief and disjointed episodes with people inside and outside the organization. He discounted notions such as

re tlective planning. Instead of the five Fayolian functions of management, Mintzberg portrayed managers tn terms of a typology of roles. He formulated three interpersonal roles (figurehead, leader, and liaison), three informational roles (monitor or nerve center, disseminator, and spokesman),

and four decision-making roles (entrepreneur, disturbance handler, resource allocator, and negotiator). Although Muntzberg based this view of managers on only the five managers he observed and his search of the literature, he did ask, and at least gave the beginning of an answer to, the question of what managers really do

The best known other modern view of managerial work 1s provided by John Kotter His description of managers 15 based on his study of 15 successful general managers Like Mintzberg, Kotter challenged the traditional view by con- cluding that managers do not so simply perform the Fayohan

functions, but rather spend most of their time interacting with others. In particular, he found his general managers spent considerable time in meetings getting and giving information Kotter reters to these get-togethers as “network building” Networking accomplishes what Kotter calls a manager's “agenda” — the loosely connected goals and plans addressing the manager’s responsibilities. By obtaining relevant and needed information from his or her networks, the etfective general manager ts able to implement his or her agenda Like Mintzberg, Kotter’s conclusions are based on managerial work from a small sample of elite managers. Nevertheless, his work represents a progressive step in an- swering the question of what managers do.

# Determining What Real Managers Do

The next step in discovering the true nature of managerial work called for a larger sample that would allow more meaningful generalizations. With a grant from the Office of Naval Research, we embarked on such an effort.4 We used trained observers to freely observe and record tn detail the behaviors and activities of 44 “real” managers. Unlike Mintzberg’s and Kotter’s managers, these managers came fromall levels and many types of organizations (mostly in the service sector — such as retail stores, hospitals, corpo- rate headquarters, a railroad, government agencies, insur- ance companies, a newspaper office, financial institutions, and a few manufacturing companies).

We reduced the voluminous data gathered from the free observation logs into managerial activity categories using the Delphi technique. Delphi was developed and used during the heyday of Rand Corporation’s “Think Tank.” A panel offers independent input and then the panel members are given composite feedback. After several iterations of this process, the data were reduced into the 12 descriptive behavioral categories shown in Exhibit 1. These empirically derived behavioral descriptors were then conceptually col- lapsed into the four managerial activities of real managers:

# Successful vs_ Effective Real Managers

- 1. Communication This activity consists of exchang- ing routine information and processing paperwork Its observed behaviors include answering procedural ques- tions, receiving and disseminating requested information, conveying the results of meetings, giving or receiving rou- tine information over the phone, processing mail, reading reports, writing reports/niemos/letters, routine financial reporting and bookkeeping, and general desk work.

- 2. Traditional Management. This activity consists of planning, decision making, and controlling. Its observed behaviors include setting goals and objectives. defining tasks needed to accomplish goals, scheduling employees, assign- ing tasks, providing routine instructions, defining problems, handling day-to-day operational crises, deciding what to do, developing new procedures, inspecting work, walking around inspecting the work, monitoring performance data, and doing preventive maintenance.

After the nature of managerial activity was deter- mined through the free observation of the 44 managers, the next phase of the study was to document the relative fre- quency of these activities. Data on another set of 248 real managers (not the 44 used tn the initial portion of this study) were gathered. Trained participation observers filled out a checklist based on the managerial activities at a random time once every hour over a two-week period. We found that the real managers spend not quite a third of their time and effort in communication activities, about a third in traditional man- agement activities, a fifth in human resource management activities, and about a fifth in networking activities. This relative frequency analysis based on observational data of a laige sample provides a more definitive answer to the ques- tion of what real managers do than the normative classical functions and the limited sample of elite managers used by Mintzberg and Kotter

- 3. Human Resource Management This activity con- tains the most behavioral ~ategories: motivating/reinforc- ing, disciplining/ punishing, managing conflict, staffing, and training/developing The disciplining/punishing category was subsequently dropped from the analysis because it was not generally permitted to be observed The observed behaviors for this activity include allocating formal rewards, asking for tnput, conveying appreciation, giving credit where due, listening to suggestions, giving positive feed- back, group support, resolving conflict between subordi- nates, appealing to highe: authorities or third parties to resolve a dispute, developing job descriptions, reviewing applications, interviewing applicants, filling in where needed, orienting employees, arranging for training, clarifying roles, coaching, mentoring, and walking subordinates through a task

4 Networking This activity consists of socializing/ politicking and interacting with outsiders The observed behaviors associated with this activity include non-work- related “chit chat”, informal joking around; discussing rumors, hearsay and the grapevine, complaining, griping, and putting others down, politicking and gamesmanship; dealing with customers, suppliers, and vendors, attending external meetings; and doing/attending community service

# events

These four activities are what real managers do. They include some of the classic notions of Fayol (the traditional management activities) as well as the more recent views of Mintzberg (the commun ation activities) and Kotter (the networking activities) As a whole, however, especially with the inclusion of human resource management activities, this view of real managers’ activities is more comprehensive than previous sets of managertal work.

## How the Difference Between Successful and Ftfective Real Managers Was Determined

Discovering the true nature of managerial work by exploding some of the myths of the past and extending the work of Mintzberg and Kotter undoubtedly contributes to our knowledge of management. However, of more critical importance in trying to understand and find solutions to our cutrent performance problems ts singling out successful and ef ective managers to see what they really do in their day-to- day activities. The successful-versus-effective phase of our real managers study consisted of analyzing the existing data based on the frequencies of the observed activities of the real managers. We did not start off with any preconceived notions or hypotheses concerning the relationships between successtul and effective managers In fact, making such a distinction seemed like “splitting hairs” because the twa words are so often used interchangeably Nevertheless, we decided to define succ ess operationally in terms of the speed of promotion within an organization We determined a suc- cess index on a sample of the real managers in our study. It was calculated by dividing a manager’s level in his or her organization by his or her tenure (length of service) there. Trus, a manager at the fourth level of management, who has been with his or her organization for five years, would be rated more successful than a manager at the third level who has been there for 25 years Obviously, there are some potential problems with such a measure of success, but for our large sample of managers this was an objective measure that ould be obtained

The definition and measurement of effectiveness 1s even more elusive. The vast literature on managerial effec- tiveness offered little agreement on criteria or measures To overcome as many of the obstacles and disagreements as possible, we used a combined effectiveness index for a sample of the real managers in our study that represented the two major — and generally agreed upon — criteria of both management theory/research and practice. (1) getting the yob done through high quantity and quality standards of performance, and (2) getting the job done through people, which requires their satisfaction and commitment.”

We obviously would have liked to use “hard meas- ures” of effectiveness such as profits and quantity/quality of output or service, but again, because we were working with large samples of real managers from widely diverse jobs and organizations, this was not possible.

# What Do Successful Real Managers Do?

To answer the question of what successful real man- agers do, we conducted several types of analyses — statistical (using multiple regression techniques), simple descriptive comparisons (for example, top third of managers as meas- ured by the success index vs. bottom third}, and relative strength of correlational relationships.® In all of these anal- yses, the rmportance that networking played in real manager success was very apparent. Of the four real manager activi- ties, only networking had a statistically significant relation- ship with success. In the comparative analysis we found that the most successful (top third) real managers were doing considerably more networking and slightly more routine communication than their least successful (bottom third) counterparts From the relative strength of relationship anal- ysis we found that networking makes the biggest relative contribution to manager success and, importantly, human resource management activities makes the least relative contribution.

# What Do Effective Real Managers Do?

Once we answered the question of what successful managers do, we turned to the even more important ques- tion of what effective managers do. It should be emphasized once again that, in gathering our observattonal data for the study, we made no assumptions that the successful real managers were (or were not) the effective managers. Our participant observers were blind to the research questions and we had no hypothesis concerning the relationship between successful and effective managers.

We used the relative strength of correlational rela- tionship between the real managers’ effectiveness index and their directly observed day-to-day activities and found that communication and human resource management activities made by far the largest relative contribution to real man- agers’ effectiveness and that traditional management and — especially — networking made by far the least relative contribution.°

These results mean that if effectiveness is defined as the perceived quantity and quality of the performance of a manager's unit and his or her subordinates’ satisfaction and commitment, then the biggest relative contribution to real manager effectiveness comes from the human oriented activities — communication and human resource manage- ment. A representative example of this effectiveness profile is found in the following manager’s comments:

What does this mean? It means that in this study of real managers, using speed of promotion as the measure of success, tt was found that successful real managers spent relatively more time and effort socializing, politicking, and interacting with outsiders than did their less successful coun- terparts. Perhaps equally important, the successful real man- agers did not give much time or attention to the traditional management activities of planning, decision making, and controlling or to the human resource management activities of motivating/reinforcing, staffing, training/developing, and managing conflict. A representative example of this profile would be the following manager’s prescription for success:

“Both how much and how well things get done around here, as well as keeping my people loyal and happy, has to do with keeping them tn- formed and involved If | make a change in procedure or the guys upstairs give us a new process or piece of equipment to work with, | get my people’s input and give them the full story before | lay iton them Then | make sure they have the proper training and give them feedback on how they are doing When they screw up, | let them know it, but when they do a good job, | let them know about that too ”

“1 find that the way to get ahead around here is to be friendly with the right people, both inside and outside the firm. They get tired of always talking shop, so ! find a cormmon interest — with some it’s sports, with others it’s our kids — and interact with them on that level. The other formal stuff around the office is important but | really work at this informal side and have found it pays off when promotion time rolls around ”

This manager, like our study of real managers in general, found that the biggest contribution to effectiveness came from communicating and human resource management

# activities.

In other words, for this manager and for a significant number of those real managers we studied, networking seems to be the key to success.

# Successful vs Effective Real Managers

Equally important, however, was the finding that the least relative contribution to real managers’ effectiveness came from the networking activity This, of course, is in stark contrast to our results of the successful real manager analysis. Networking activity had by far the strongest relative relation- ship to success, but the weakest with effectiveness. On the other hand, human resource management activity had a

## Implications of the Successful versus Effective Real Managers Findings

If, as our study indicates, there 1s indeed a difference between successful and effective real managers, what does it mean and what should we do about it? First of all,we need to

strong relationship to effectiveness (second only to com- munication activity), but had the weakest relative relation- ship to success. In other words, the successful real managers do not do the same activities as the effective real managers (in fact, they do almost the opposite) These contrasting proftles may have significant implications for understanding the current performance problems facing American organt- zations. However, before we look at these implications and suggest some solutions, let's take a look at those real manag-

pay more attention to formal reward systems to ensure that effective managers are promoted Second, we must learn how effective managers do their day-to-day jobs.

The traditional assumption holds that promotions are based on performance This is what the formal personnel policies say, this is what new management trainees are told and this ts what every management textbook states should happen. On the other hand, more “hardened” (or perhaps

## more realistic) members and observers of real organizations

ers who are both successful and effective

## What Do Managers Who Are Both Successful and Effective Do?

The most obvious concluding question 1s what those who were found to be both successful and effective really do This “combination” real manager, of course, 1s the ideal — and has been assumed to exist in American management

# over the years.

{not textbook organizations or those featured tn the latest best sellers or videotapes) have long suspected that social and political skills are the real key to getting ahead, to being successful Our study lends support to the latter view

The solution ts obvious, but may be virtually impossi- ble to implement, at least in the short run Tying formal rewards — and especially promotions — to performance tsa must if organizations are going to move ahead and become more productive Ata minimum, and most pragmatically in the short run, organizations must move to a performance- based appraisal system Managers that are effective should be promoted In the long run organizations must develop

Since there was sucha difference between successful and effective managers ir our study, we naturally found relatively few (less than 10% of our sample) that were both

among the top third of succ essful managers and the top third of effective managers Not surprisingly, upon examining this special group, we found that their activities were very similar

to real managers as a whole. They were not like either the

cultural values that support and reward effective perform-

ance. not just successful socializing and politicking. This goes hand-in-hand with the current attention given to corporate citure and how to change tt An appropriate goal for cul- tural change in today's organizattons might simply be to make effective managers successful

successful or effective real managers. Rather, it seems that real managers who are bath successtul and effective use a fairly balanced approach m terms of their activities. In other words, real managers who can strike the delicate balance between all four managerial activities may be able to get ahead as well as get the job done

important is the fact that we found so few real man-

agers that were both successful and effective This supports our findings on the difference between successful and effec-

tive real managers, but limits any generalizations that can be made about successful and effective managers It seems that more important tn explaining our organizations’ present

performance problems, and what to do about them, are the implications of the wide disparity between successful and effective real managers

Besides the implications for performance-based appraisals and organizational culture that came out of the findings of our study 1s a lesson that we can learn from the etfective real managers themselves. This lesson ts the mpor- tance they give and effort they devote to the human- ouented activities of Communicating and human resource management. How human resources are managed — keep- ing them informed, communicating with them, paying attention to them, reinforcing them, resolving their conflicts, training/developing them — all contribute directly to managerial effectiveness

The disparity our study found between successful and effective real managers has important implications for the performance problems facing today’s organizations. While we must move ahead on all fronts in our search for sclutions to these problems, we believe the activities basic to the effective real managers in our study —- communication and human resource management — deserve special attenton.
