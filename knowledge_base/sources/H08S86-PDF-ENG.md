Boards know the importance of careful succession planning. The

beneﬁts of a strong transition to a new CEO are obvious, but a

failed succession can cost companies billions in shareholder value, be

distracting and disruptive for employees, and cause other top talent to

head for the door. In a new study, we discovered a way boards can help

their appointees drive value: start them at the beginning of the calendar

# or ﬁscal year.

In new research, published in the Journal of Management, we studied

## CEO “phase entrainment”—in other words, the synchronizing of the

## appointment of a new CEO (ﬁrm cycle) with the beginning of a

yearly cycle (dominant cycle)—to see whether it had an impact on the

ﬁrm’s post-succession performance. Our sample consisted of 690 CEO

successions carried out by S&P 500 ﬁrms between 2005 and 2019.

We compared start dates of new CEOs against ﬁrms’ return on assets

(ROA) over the 12 quarters following the succession (as past research

has found that it takes three years to fully capture the eﬀects of a

new leader). We found that when CEOs began their tenures within 10

days of the calendar or their ﬁrm’s ﬁscal year (which is around 25%

of successions in our sample), their ﬁrms experienced, on average, a

0.4% higher ROA than ﬁrms whose CEOs started at any other point in

the year. This eﬀect might seem small but it equates to a nearly 31%

diﬀerence in ROA compared to our sample’s average ROA and begins

to fade after the ﬁrst 10 days. We also found that this synchronization

resulted in heightened net income for these ﬁrms, on average, over

the same post-succession period—and the eﬀects were even stronger

for CEOs who were ﬁrm outsiders, under 46 years of age, women, or

## members of racial or ethnic minority groups.

# Why Synchronization Matters

In analyzing our data—and conducting additional surveys and

interviews with incoming and outgoing CEOs, CHROs, board members,

and other stakeholders, we found that appointing a new CEO to

## synchronize with the beginning of the calendar or ﬁscal year creates

# beneﬁts for three reasons:

# Alignment of Goals and Objectives

The end of the calendar or ﬁscal year marks a time in which results are

expected to be achieved, and the beginning of the year is when new

goals are set. Appointing a new CEO in the new year allows them to set

the company’s goals and objectives according to their own vision for the

ﬁrm. Temporally aligning the eﬀorts of organizational members with

the goals and objectives of the new CEO allows organizational members

to work in a more coordinated manner towards the realization of those

# goals.

# Minimization of Disruption

The appointment of a new CEO is a major disruptive event for any

company regardless of the reason for the CEO change. The beginning of

a calendar or ﬁscal year presents a natural breakpoint to interrupt the

work of organizational members. Synchronizing a new CEO succession

with the beginning of the calendar or ﬁscal year allows enough time

for organizational members to regain focus and attention on tasks and

projects before results are expected, thus reducing disruptive eﬀects

associated with CEO succession.

# Decrease in Time Pressure

There is always pressure to perform—particularly if you’re a new CEO.

However, this pressure is especially strong closer to the end of a

calendar or ﬁscal year, when ﬁrm results are more closely scrutinized

and employees often have performance reviews. CEOs that begin their

tenures in the middle of the year are, for example, more likely to feel

the pressure of earnings management, which can negatively impact

their decision-making. Thus, appointing CEOs at the beginning of the

calendar or ﬁscal year can alleviate time-induced pressure, enhancing

## decision-making and ultimately operational performance.

Additionally, employees, too, feel the end-of-year crunch to prove in

numbers their successful fulﬁllment of goals. If new goals or directions

were handed-down mid-year, this gives them less time to make progress

toward them by the time they’re evaluated—not meeting goals can feel

demoralizing and risks hurting employee engagement.

## Why The Effects Are Stronger for Atypical CEOs

Although our analyses revealed that ﬁrms reap operational performance

beneﬁts regardless of who they choose as successor, we found that these

eﬀects are particularly strong when the new CEO is “atypical,” meaning

that they have characteristics that are not commonplace in the broader

CEO population. Speciﬁcally, we considered CEOs as atypical when they

were outsiders (i.e., appointed from outside the ﬁrm), young (46 years

## old or younger), women, or members of racial or ethnic minority groups.

## A new calendar or ﬁscal year—more than just a marker of time—is

imbued with meaning for people, often making them feel like they’ve

been given a fresh start. At the beginning of these cycles, employees

are more open-minded and willing to learn new skills or accept new

ideas. As previous research has shown, atypical CEOs are more likely to

enact major strategic change; we propose that aligning ﬁrm cycles with

this period of heightened openness means that atypical CEOs’ strategic

initiatives are more likely to be accepted or enacted. We believe this

helps explain ﬁrms’ stronger performance when atypical CEOs’ start

dates are phase entrained.

# Some Caveats

We recognize that appointing a new CEO at the start of the calendar

year or the ﬁscal year might not always be possible for ﬁrms. At times,

companies need to dismiss their CEOs and rapidly appoint new ones.

Or a CEO might need to suddenly step down for health or personal

reasons, hindering ideal appointment times. This said, we believe that

even those ﬁrms that must make more sudden changes could beneﬁt

from our studies’ insights; for example, considering how they might

frame a succession as a fresh start or adjusting employee performance

evaluations to give them more time to execute on a new vision.

Additionally, our study was based on calendar events that are

## particularly relevant to Western societies (e.g., January 1 as the New

Year in the Gregorian calendar). However, such dates may not have the

same meaning in other non-Western countries. Boards should assess

what times are relevant to their particular contexts.

. . .

After long and often laborious search processes, boards want to do

everything in their power to ensure their appointee is successful in their

new role. Our study provides strong evidence that synchronization is

an important mechanism that boards can use to give their new CEO

a competitive advantage, helping them to align their vision with their

employees while driving operational performance.
