Inspired by the results of the famous orchestra study — where

symphony orchestras began hiring more women by having people

audition from behind a screen that concealed their gender — some

major organizations are now using a “blind hiring” strategy to help

achieve goals related to diversity. The typical blind hiring process

involves stripping information from job application materials before

review that could signal applicants’ memberships in speciﬁc groups

and cue discrimination. Though not yet widespread, this de-biasing

strategy is gaining traction: A recent survey of over 800 U.S.-based HR

practitioners indicated that about 20% worked for organizations that

used blind hiring and about 60% were familiar with it.

What many practitioners may be unaware of, however, is the large span

of new research on blind hiring that has been published since that

orchestra study in 2000. Over the past two decades, the eﬃcacy of blind

hiring as a strategy to boost hiring outcomes for members of historically

disadvantaged groups has been tested in the “ﬁeld” — that is, in real

hiring decisions in real organizations — in various settings across

Europe, Canada, and the U.S. By understanding the results of these

recent studies, decision-makers in organizations can now determine, at

a very granular level, whether a blind hiring strategy is likely to help or hinder their organizations’ eﬀorts to diversify pools of new hires.

# What Is “Blind Hiring”?

As a decision-making strategy more broadly, “blinding” involves

blocking evaluators from receiving potentially biasing information

about a target of evaluation until after an evaluation is complete. Blind

hiring policies typically implement this strategy at the initial screening

stage of the hiring pipeline, when hiring managers or other decision-

makers decide which applicants to interview and which to screen out of

# the pool.

Organizations using blind hiring policies single out information

conveyed in job application materials like resumes and application

forms that is irrelevant to the job but could cue unconscious biases in

managers. They then strip that information from materials before they

are reviewed. Names, for instance, communicate nothing about people’s

skills but often communicate their gender and/or race; receiving

this information can lead decision-makers to unconsciously favor

applicants of certain groups, like white people. Thus, an organization

concerned about this type of discrimination might use a blind hiring

approach, removing applicants’ names from their materials before

letting managers see them. Other types of information, like college

graduation years (which communicate age) or hobbies (which can signal

social class), are similarly candidates for blinding.

The logic underlying a blind hiring approach is simple: Discrimination

against members of certain groups cannot occur at a given hiring

stage if evaluators at that stage cannot discern applicants’ group

memberships. Accordingly, decision-makers tasked with increasing the

diversity of new sets of hires in their organizations may wonder whether

a blind hiring approach could help them achieve that goal.

# The State of the Science

Over roughly the past two decades, careful academic studies exploring

the eﬃcacy of a blind hiring approach have been undertaken across

Europe, Canada, and the U.S. In these studies, researchers have

compared the proportions of job applicants from disadvantaged groups

who are selected for interviews — at organizations in both the public

and private sectors — when application materials are blinded or

evaluated in the normal fashion. Generally (but not entirely), these

studies have found that more applicants from disadvantaged groups

advance to the interview stage when a blind hiring approach is used.

In one study in the public sector in Sweden, researchers found

that more women and ethnic minorities were selected for interviews

when their applications were anonymized versus when names were

maintained. Another study in the Swedish public sector found that

women who uploaded their credential information to a database used

by potential employers were more likely to receive interview invites

when their gender information was blinded. And in the Netherlands,

researchers found that people of non-Western origin, who represent a

traditionally disadvantaged, Dutch job-seeker group, were more likely

to be advanced to interviews for public sector jobs when application

materials were evaluated in a blind fashion.

## Across the Atlantic, a comprehensive study by the Canadian

government explored whether blinding information, including

## applicants’ names and also their citizenships, addresses, educational

institutions, and religions, would impact interview selection rates for

minority applicants to the public service. Results indicated that, while

non-minority applicants were selected for interviews at a slightly higher

## rate than minority applicants under the traditional process, minority

applicants were selected at a higher rate under the blind process. And in

the U.S., a study in a restaurant chain indicated that older workers were

more likely to be advanced to the interview stage when they submitted

applications online, which blinded applicants’ ages.

Some studies, however, have been less positive on the eﬀects of blind

hiring. For instance, employers in France were less likely to select

applicants from minority social groups for interviews when applicants’

names were blinded versus when they were provided on materials.

Consistent with this ﬁnding, a large study in Germany found that blind

hiring only boosted interview rates for job applicants from minority

groups when employers tended to discriminate against applicants from

those groups under a traditional process. For employers who were more

## likely to interview applicants from minority groups under a traditional

process, however, the use of a blind hiring policy negated that tendency,

leading to worse interview selection rates for applicants from minority

# groups.

Viewed together, these recent studies suggest that a blind hiring process

often helps, but may sometimes hinder, organizations’ goals related

to diversity. Informed by these ﬁndings, decision-makers should ask

themselves three questions to understand whether a blind hiring policy

is right for them.

Question 1: Does my organization systematically under-select applicants from traditionally disadvantaged groups for interviews?

Research suggests that blind hiring only boosts interview rates

for members of traditionally disadvantaged groups when used by

## companies that typically under-select applicants from these groups for

interviews. This makes sense intuitively — blind hiring will only help

if there is bias to eliminate. Thus, if decision-makers are operating in

organizations that are failing to diversify pools of new hires overall

but are succeeding at diversifying pools of interviewees, adoption of a

blind hiring policy to govern the initial screening stage will not help diversity hiring eﬀorts. Instead, they should focus on solutions that

## address biases during interviews and selection decisions afterward.

Conversely, in organizations that have a history of selecting mostly

members of advantaged social groups (e.g., men, white people) for

interviews, using blind hiring at the initial screening stage could help.

Question 2: Is the job in question one where being from an advantaged group predicts having the preferred credentials?

Blind hiring blocks unconscious biases by ensuring that decisions

about whom to interview are based on credentials alone. However,

## due to systematic inequities in access to resources and opportunities

between groups in society, members of traditionally advantaged groups

are disproportionately likely to attend prestigious undergraduate

universities, secure sought-after internships, and achieve a post-

graduate (e.g., master’s) degree. Thus, if the job being hired for is one

where people with fancy credentials are especially likely to be selected

## for interviews — for example, a management position — members of

advantaged groups may still have a leg-up under a blind hiring process,

even though discrimination is seemingly blocked.

In these cases, adopting a blind hiring policy to support diversity

hiring goals may backﬁre. Instead, decision-makers might consider

either broadening the span of “preferred” credentials for a position, or

incorporating applicants’ social identities into interview decisions, so

that complicated credentials can be evaluated through the lens of the

hurdles — or privileges — applicants may have experienced along the

way to achieving them.

Conversely, if interview decisions are based less on having fancy

## credentials and more on straightforward evaluations of relevant skills

and experience — for instance, if the job being hired for is an entry-

## level position — the discrimination-blocking beneﬁts of blind hiring

will likely lead to greater interview rates for members of disadvantaged

# groups.

Question 3: Are complementary de-biasing strategies being used at other stops along the hiring pipeline?

Say you have a job where, in the past, members of disadvantaged

groups have been under-selected for interviews, and group membership

doesn’t predict applicants’ likelihood of having the “right” credentials.

This job would clear the hurdles in questions one and two and could

seem like a good match for a blind hiring approach. Even in this

situation, however, a blind hiring approach on its own might not lead

to more diversity in the ultimate pool of hires. Blind hiring can only

be fully leveraged at the initial screening stage if paired with other

de-biasing strategies operating before and after initial screens.

One complementary strategy that should be paired with a blind hiring

approach is targeted recruitment of members of disadvantaged groups,

such as through pipeline programs at HBCUs. This strategy pairing

addresses the fact that discrimination reduction in interview-selection

decisions may not boost the diversity of interviewee pools if few

members of disadvantaged groups apply in the ﬁrst place. Blind hiring

policies should also be paired with de-biasing strategies at the interview

stage, since interviews are generally conducted in an unblind fashion.

Indeed, in some of the studies described above, blind hiring boosted

interview selection rates for members of disadvantaged groups but did not ultimately increase their likelihood of getting job oﬀers after

interviews. One especially promising strategy to reduce discrimination

at the interview stage involves the use of structured interviewing, which

keeps interviewers focused on job-related questions only and reduces

the impact of homophily — our natural preference for people who are

like us — on interview assessments.

By asking themselves these three questions, decision-makers can

determine whether a blind hiring approach to the initial screening process will help or hinder their eﬀorts related to diversity in hiring

overall. And even for those organizations that do not clear these

hurdles, a blind hiring approach can still be leveraged if modiﬁed

carefully. For instance, an organization might still wish to use a blind

hiring strategy even though the job being hired for is one where being

from an advantaged group predicts having the “target” credentials,

## like a graduate degree or an Ivy League pedigree (question two). In

this case, organizations can consider using a “blind-then-see” approach

— hiring managers can form initial evaluations of applicants based

on credentials alone, then learn information that was blinded, like

## demographics, and re-weight their initial appraisals, re-considering

applicants’ credentials through the lens of the hurdles they may have

had to overcome to achieve them. Research suggests that a blind-

then-see approach like this can reduce bias in favor of members of

The key takeaway is that blind hiring is not a one-size-ﬁts-all solution.

In some cases, it may even be detrimental when it comes to goals related

to hiring more applicants from disadvantaged groups. However, the

state of the science surrounding blind hiring suggests that, for the right

jobs in the right organizations, this strategy can open the door to the

## achievement of diversity-related hiring goals.
