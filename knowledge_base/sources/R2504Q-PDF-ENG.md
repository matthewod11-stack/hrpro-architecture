Building Everyday Bravery Three new books offer advice on how to be more courageous. by Susan Catterall Francis

When my elementary-aged child faced a medical issue more than

a decade ago, I encountered unsolicited advice and pushback from

## everyone—family, education and care providers, even our pediatrician.

A thorough search for information on the topic yielded only two books

and limited published research. When a Boston hospital hosted a

relevant conference, I sat in the audience thoroughly overwhelmed,

alternating between teary sniﬄing and frantic note-scribbling. But

there was one speaker who made me feel hopeful. When I tracked him

down after his talk to thank him, I found all the wonders and worries

I’d carried for six years spilling out of me. He listened intently, put

his hand on my arm, and said, “You have a great story. Have you ever

considered doing any public speaking?” I’d laid bare my utter confusion

and uncertainty about the high-impact decisions I was making with so

little expert guidance, and here he was, a leader in the ﬁeld, saying that

others could learn from me? I laughed but gave him my number.

Since that day, I’ve given hundreds of speeches and interviews about

my experience. I’ve gained courage and conﬁdence along the way. But

what I tell my audiences is that true bravery in parenting is rarely of

the headline variety—jumping into freezing water to save a drowning

child or hoisting a car to liberate a pinned leg—nor is it about getting up on a stage to oﬀer advice. It is also quotidian. My ﬁrst brave acts

did not involve deadlifting or ﬁreﬁghting; for me, beginning to be brave

meant prioritizing what my child was telling me, listening to my own

gut, and making one small decision at a time with no clear path amid

# many obstacles.

Whether you’re a parent facing a healthcare challenge, a manager with

a supply chain failure, or a CEO trying to lead through an economic

crisis, it takes great fortitude to navigate shifting contexts with scant

data and no handbook. Three new story-driven, research-backed books

could have helped me do so more easily, and they can help you now. The

authors assert that courage is a skill you can develop and strengthen in

yourself and on your team, and they provide insights and inspiration on

how to be brave—in both everyday and extraordinary situations that call

for you to be and do more than you think possible.

## In How to Be Bold, Harvard Business School professor Ranjay Gulati

argues that courage is not an innate trait reserved for heroes but

a mindset that anyone—introvert or extrovert, young professional or

seasoned leader—can adopt. He presents an array of strategies—the

9 C’s—to help: for example, “coping,” where you either conduct a risk/

## beneﬁt analysis for known dangers or draw strength from an external

structure like faith when faced with deep, unanalyzable uncertainty.

“You can’t optimize the unknown,” Gulati writes. But these practices

can help you feel like the world is an orderly, comprehensible place,

and allow you to push on. Other C’s include “connection”—emotional

support, pep talks, inside information, reassurance that you’re on

track, and a feeling of community; “comprehension,” which involves

taking small steps then observing, learning, gaining understanding, and

adapting; and “commitment” to personal narratives about your life and

goals that embolden you. “Tell yourself a story in which you’re the hero

who takes on risk not just for its own sake,” Gulati writes, “but to do

# some good in the world.”

## Shannon Watts, founder of gun-control advocacy group Moms Demand

Action, employed some of these strategies to bravely face what she

calls the “most powerful special interest that had ever existed”: the

## U.S. ﬁrearms industry and its lobbyists and political backers. With

her new book, Fired Up, she aims to help people identify, light, and

feed the ﬁre inside them, and while the target audience is women, it

## feels widely applicable, especially for those at inﬂection points such

as early career, job loss, or retirement. Watts urges folks to read her

book with a journal beside them and use it to answer thought-provoking

end-of-chapter questions and respond to list prompts designed to

spark personal transformation. She details societal and structural traps

(such as happiness and achievement) and individual ones (including

martyrdom and people-pleasing) and provides a framework to guide

readers toward taking risks, both big and small, so that they can build

and maintain a ﬁre as bright and steady as hers. The process starts with

identifying your desires (heat), values (oxygen), and abilities (fuel) and

then bringing the three into alignment. “Living on ﬁre might lead you

to do extraordinarily ambitious things, but it also may compel you to

ﬁnally act on ordinary things that are meaningful to you,” Watts writes.

“Courage is the value of anyone who pushes past their doubts and fears

# and moves forward with conﬁdence.”

For those in search of an even more practical primer on how to build

## bravery muscles, Conﬁdent by Choice, by leadership development expert

Juan Bendaña, provides an actionable strength-training plan. Each

chapter ends with a summary and an exercise, making it easy to put

what you’ve learned into practice before you’ve even ﬁnished the book.

Consider his “conﬁdence cycle,” which encourages incremental moves.

With a goal in mind, make three decisions: 1) What will you focus your

“micro-energy” on? 2) How will you ﬁnd the “micro-courage” to move

through the discomfort? 3) What “micro-action” will you take to get you

closer to your goal? And then what are the results—the “micro-proof”

that your focus, courage, and action revealed?

Like Gulati and Watts, Bendaña emphasizes the importance of

controlling your own narrative. Reframe your ﬂaws, he advises.

Acknowledge that you might fail but that failing doesn’t make you a

failure. You have the power to take everything that has happened to you

and shape it into a hero’s journey.

Taking ownership of my own story—and sharing it with a wider

audience—was certainly a catalyst for me. The more I spoke to others,

the wider my circle grew, the more my identity evolved, and the

more connected I became to this new community. I was able to act

courageously because my purpose grew beyond helping my own child

to supporting families like ours. I gained conﬁdence from those ahead

of us who lifted and guided us, and then I reached back to help those

starting out on their own scary, uncertain journey to feel a little more

# brave.
