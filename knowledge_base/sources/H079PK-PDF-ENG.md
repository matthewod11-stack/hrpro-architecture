We work with professional women all the time on their career

negotiations: training them, advising their employers, and studying

their successes and pitfalls. One of us (Kathryn) is a negotiation coach

and trainer and the other (Hannah) is a scholar and educator. Over and

over again, we hear three negotiation myths that we fear are hampering

women’s potential to seize opportunities and overcome barriers in their

careers. As organizations redeﬁne the future of work, it’s time to dispel

these myths about negotiation so leaders can make their employee

# negotiations more equitable.

# Myth #1: Men Negotiate and Women Don’t

The truth is that both men and women have a hard time negotiating for

resources that are counter-stereotypical for them, particularly because

they are more likely to encounter resistance for doing so. Following

traditional gender roles (that are in many respects outdated), men are

## the breadwinners and women the caregivers, and these stereotypes spill

over into the workplace. As a result, women tend to encounter more

challenges than men when negotiating for higher pay, and men more

challenges than women when seeking access to family-friendly work

practices. Moreover, men from historically marginalized groups also

face challenges negotiating their pay.

In studies examining what managers and professionals negotiate

in their career, both men and women overwhelmingly recounted

negotiating their roles — and with about equal frequency. But

case examples focused on pay or workload showed men recounting

more job-oﬀer negotiations and women recounting negotiating more

around work and family. (If negotiation scholars had focused ﬁrst on

how people access family-friendly work practices, they might have

concluded that men don’t negotiate at all!)

For gender equality, it’s critically important that women have as much

potential to negotiate their pay as men, and men as much potential to

## access family-friendly work practices as women.

## Myth #2: Women Should Always Negotiate Pay

The second misconception is that women need to negotiate their pay in

order to close the gender wage gap. As one client Kathryn worked with

said, “Given everything I’ve read about the gender pay gap, it feels like if

I don’t push for higher pay, I’m letting women down.” This is an unfair

burden to place on women, particularly because the gender wage gap

is more about the types of jobs that men and women are in than about

# diﬀerentials in pay for the same work.

The gender wage gap is calculated by comparing the earnings of male

and female full-time workers. Jobs dominated by men tend to be higher

paid and more time-intensive, on average, than those dominated by

women. To be sure, there are situations in which women are unfairly

paid, and those should be addressed. However, negotiating for women’s

occupational advancement is likely to have a greater impact on the

gender wage gap than negotiating solely for more pay in current roles.

The keys to closing the gender wage gap are to support women’s

occupational advancement into higher-paid jobs and to decrease the

costs workers pay for seeking family-friendly work arrangements. In

other words, let’s redirect the emphasis toward supporting women’s role

negotiations and toward problem solving around work and family for all

workers — and stop pressuring to women to focus on pay negotiations

# only.

# Myth #3: Backlash Is Inevitable

Many professional women approach career negotiations with

trepidation, fearing social backlash such as being alienated from co-

workers or even being disinvited from work teams. Organizations can ward against this through education and norm setting. For example,

they can educate managers about potential biases — such expecting

men, not women, to self-advocate for their career advancement — while

also encouraging them to actively resist expectations that people will

or should act in gender-stereotypical ways (e.g., that women should be

modest about their ambitions or that men should be more concerned

about work than family). As part of this education, companies should

encourage both employees and employers to think broadly about

what can be negotiated in career conversation, including roles (e.g.,

advancement or developmental opportunities) and workload (e.g.,

assignments, schedules, etc.), as well as pay.

## How Women Can Advocate for Themselves in the Meantime

While companies have a responsibility to make their negotiation

practices more equitable, there are also strategies women can use to

reduce the risk of backlash and increase their chances of success.

Best practice in negotiation suggests doing two things to be more

persuasive and build relationships. First, explain why your request

is appropriate and justiﬁed. Second, share why your proposal serves

the interest of both parties. For example, in Kathryn’s negotiation

training, she advises that instead of saying “I deserve a promotion,”

try explaining why your performance meets the criteria (e.g., “I’m on

track to exceed my sales target by 10%, which will help the department

hit our end-of-year goal”) and advances the company’s goals (e.g., “The

credibility that comes with a VP title will help me land and convert more

accounts”).

This is what Jackie, one of Kathryn’s clients, reported after she

negotiated a new job oﬀer. “I was thrilled about the company, but the

compensation was too low, and the role itself was a level below my

qualiﬁcations. I met with them and highlighted that, given my past

experience, I could add more value to the company at a higher level,

where I would be able to contribute to our growth strategy. As a result

of that conversation, I was given an amended oﬀer with a higher title, a

## 40% increase in compensation, and a clearer career progression.”

We’re in an unprecedented moment for employee negotiations. The

pandemic accelerated the transformation of work practices, and we’re

living through a historic labor migration and uncertain economic times

in which organizations are struggling to attract and retain talent. In

the subsequent surge in negotiation, if women and men are conﬁned

to outdated gender expectations, we could come out of this in an

even more inequitable place. We can’t let myths about gender and

negotiation stand in the way of co-creating a more equitable future of
