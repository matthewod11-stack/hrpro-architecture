## HBR / The Big Idea / Every Employee Should Have Access to Paid Parental Leave

paid family leave in the United States. This is an edited version of our

# conversation in mid-August.

. . .

Why did you decide to make paid parental leave your cause?

I honestly hadn’t thought much about it until my daughter was born.

At Reddit, we oﬀered 16 weeks of leave, and, in using all of it, I saw

ﬁrsthand how important it was. My wife and I have tons of advantages

— help at home, supportive families, and other resources. But after the

life-threatening complications she faced following childbirth, I couldn’t

imagine having to leave my family for my job or being told to decide

between the two. It really hit home. I saw that this shouldn’t be a

privilege aﬀorded only to folks lucky enough to work at companies with

good policies. It should be required.

Why had you already decided to oﬀer a relatively generous policy at

# Reddit?

When I came back to the company in 2014, after stepping back from

a full-time executive role for several years, we had no HR. Katelin

Holloway was willing to come on as head of people and culture, and she

brought with her a plan, including paid leave, and I thought it seemed

reasonable. Within the tech industry, 16 weeks of leave is table stakes.

But that speaks to an important issue. Tech companies have these

beneﬁts because we’re in a war for talent. The reason tech companies

are able to grow hundreds of millions of dollars in revenue and billion-

dollar valuations is because they’re attracting and retaining people

who are high performers. I’m proud that tech is on the frontline of

supporting paid leave. And it should be a bellwether for other industries

that want top talent, especially with technology skills. You’re going to

have to attract them by oﬀering as much or better.

How do you demonstrate the return on investment?

Well, we know that when Google expanded its paid leave [from 12 to

18 weeks], attrition decreased by 50%. Of course, that’s correlation,

not causation, but it’s a material change. And when you consider the

expense of recruitment and training new workers, it would amount

to a fantastic cost savings. We saw in one survey from the advocacy

## organization Paid Leave for the United States that 77% of respondents

said that the amount of paid leave employers oﬀer would aﬀect their

decision to pick one company over another. Again, it’s something that

will help you win talent. But we should also realize that it creates value

that won’t always be reﬂected in the short-term numbers.

What would you say to leaders of startups or small businesses or

non-tech companies who argue that they just can’t aﬀord to keep

paying people to be away from work for several months?

I would point to a company like sweetgreen, the fast-casual salad chain.

The salad business is deﬁnitely not the software business, and they

made the math work on ﬁve months of fully paid parental leave —

even longer than ours at Initialized Capital. And I think that’s because

they, and other employers like myself, realize that they will get more

## loyalty and productivity out of employees as a result. Humans, whether

software engineers or people preparing food, can only do their best work

if they have peace of mind that their home and family are secure. If

they are instead distracted or stressed or frustrated, there will be costs

to that. I work with many entrepreneurs now, and I have yet to have one

of them come back to me and say that a paid leave policy was a bad idea.

Apart from oﬀering several months or more of time oﬀ after the

birth or adoption of a child, what makes for a good corporate paid

# leave policy?

Flexible scheduling. I didn’t realize Reddit had this until Katelin

Holloway explained to me that you can allocate those 16 weeks in the

way your family needs. So, as a dad for the ﬁrst month, it’s great to be

home and fully supportive. But then maybe you arrange to be in the oﬃce Monday through Wednesday and home Thursday and Friday to

stretch out the rest of those days and give you and your family time to

# adjust.

Also: equal treatment for mothers and fathers. It can be longer for

women if there are health complications related to the pregnancy or

labor and delivery. But we’re deliberate about calling it “family leave”

because I and lots of dads believe we have an equal responsibility

in parenting. And this sets us up for more equality in the workplace

because there’s less worrying — which, unfortunately, you do see — that

female hires will get pregnant. If we just assume that any man or woman

we bring on might one day have a kid and take time oﬀ for that kid,

we’re in a nicer place.

I want to be clear, though, that none of this means prescribing speciﬁc

roles and responsibilities for any parent. It is more about the freedom

to decide. The biggest criticism I see is tweets from people who say,

“I don’t need more than a week oﬀ after having a kid.” That’s ﬁne. It’s

your choice. But the opportunity should be extended to every single

expecting parent.

## In fast-paced, high-pressure, highly competitive industries or

companies, how do you persuade people — both women and men —

that it’s okay to use all the time made available to them?

A big push for me is not just encouraging more private-sector leaders

to adopt these policies, but also to urge fellow business dads, especially

those in executive positions, to take advantage of them. This gives air

cover to people in the rest of the organization, so they can take time

oﬀ without thinking it will hurt their careers. Instead, it lets them know

it will be the best decision they’ll ever make. I think social media has

helped to normalize this. Men being proud to be dads is as old as

time, but historically it’s a thing we didn’t always talk about. That’s

changing. This generation is more able to be vocal and open. A good

example is the “Dad Reﬂexes“ subreddit, which hundreds of thousands

of people are on every day, sharing and watching videos of things like

a kid almost falling oﬀ a sofa and the father catching him without his

partner even realizing it happened. We now have ways to share these

little vignettes of dads protecting, playing with, feeding, spending time

# with our children.

So I hope the surprise starts to go away. I want to see men taking their

responsibilities as fathers seriously in my companies. I want us all to

have the conﬁdence to say, “I’m leaving early today to pick up my kid.”

No one could look at my history and accuse me of not being a hard-

charging and career-driven entrepreneur. But I really, really believe that

these things are not mutually exclusive. And I think this shift is good for

# society.

Why are you also advocating for public policy change?

America is the last developed country to have this. The fact that a

quarter of women in this country go back to work two weeks after giving

birth because there is no policy in place to guarantee they can spend

time with their newborns is unconscionable. This includes women who

had C-sections, who still have semi-open wounds. How are we — as a

nation that believes in the importance of family values — okay with

that? But I’ve been encouraged by the organizations ﬁghting for it, and

the data behind it, and the fact that there are so many voices from the

private sector — entrepreneurs, CEOs — as well as lawmakers on the left

and the right who also want this to happen.

Which lawmakers are you partnering with and what speciﬁc

legislation would you like to see passed?

My team and I are going to DC in October, and we’re still ﬁnalizing

the folks we’ll meet with, but there are senators and congressional

## representatives, Republicans and Democrats, such as Senators Joni

Ernst and Kirsten Gillibrand, who have already tried to bring various

versions of this legislation forth — for example, the CRADLE Act and the

FAMILY Act. It looks like the biggest issue now will be about funding

it — whether it’s reallocated from other policies, how it’s subsidized.

There are diﬀerent ways diﬀerent countries have approached it. Also

seeing if we can get a clean bill without anything extra layered on. I’d

like to see a federal law for paid family leave of six months, as that’s what more and more research says is ideal. | THE BIG IDEA
