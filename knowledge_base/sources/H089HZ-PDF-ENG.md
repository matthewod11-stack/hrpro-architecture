## A steady stream of high-proﬁle companies across a wide range

of industries — including Google, Farmers Insurance, Disney, UPS,

Boeing, IBM, and Amazon — have required employees to return to their

oﬃces. While their messaging about these RTO mandates has ranged

in form and tone, much of it has felt tone-deaf at best and in many

cases adversarial or even dictatorial. Unsurprisingly, the result has been

## backlash from employees and an explosion of social media fervor, as in

the case of the viral appeal of Internet Brands’ recent video message to

# employees.

There is no easy solution for companies trying to craft policies that

balance in-oﬃce and ﬂexible working, as there are undeniable beneﬁts

to both approaches. Not only that, recent research at Microsoft, SpaceX,

and Apple found that the way RTO mandates were introduced and

implemented had a signiﬁcant impact on departures, particularly

among employees with longer tenure. To be successful, one thing is

certain: Companies need to engage in dialogue with employees and be

explicit and honest about which outcomes are most critical.

What’s clear from our discussions with executives and employees is that

how the issue is framed is an oft-overlooked — but very important —

piece of the puzzle. Framing refers to how an issue is presented; it’s

the meaning layered onto an issue or situation that shapes how people

think about its objective facts. More precisely, it’s about re-framing:

deliberately replacing taken-for-granted cognitive frames with more

helpful ones. Consider the example of framing a tricky situation as an

# opportunity instead of a problem.

## How to Reframe the Flexibility Conversation

We know from social science research that how a problem is framed has

a huge impact on outcomes. Framing an issue in terms of loss-versus-

gain changes decision outcomes, just as thinking in terms of ﬁxed-pie

## versus win-win shapes negotiations, and growth-versus-ﬁxed mindsets

# enable stretch goals and learning.

When the media presents endless headlines about the “ﬁght,” “battle,”

or “war” over ﬂexible work, it matters. Framed with organizations’

## interests on one side (e.g., the need for innovation, concerns about

culture) and individual interests on the other (e.g., work-life balance,

lower cost of living, less time spent commuting), the issue becomes

harder to solve, because “wars” resist settlement and “contests” are

either won or lost, not redesigned.

Our conversations with executives and employees echo this and reveal

a core assumption that wins for one side mean losses for the other.

One of us, Mark, has studied remote and hybrid work for over 20 years

and found ample evidence that framing the situation not as us-versus- them but as a communal objective requiring collective eﬀort works.

Meanwhile, Amy has found that how an innovation or improvement opportunity is framed aﬀects its implementation success. Today’s

leaders need to reframe their own narratives accordingly as they create

and communicate ﬂexible work policies. Here’s how.

Step 1: Acknowledge the bind, and be patient.

Given the prevailing sense that the ﬂexibility conversation is one of

employees versus organizations, leaders must start by acknowledging that there are trade-oﬀs to manage.

To begin with, the ﬂexible work policies some organizations put in

place during and immediately after the Covid pandemic prompted

many employees to make signiﬁcant life changes that are not easy to

undo. Some moved away from high-cost cities, while others shifted

care responsibilities for children or other family members. Altering

these arrangements may take time and come with ﬁnancial and other

# repercussions.

Leaders must publicly recognize these very real ramiﬁcations,

acknowledge how the organization contributed to them with past policy

decisions, and commit to collaborating to ﬁnd solutions. This does not

mean walking away from policies because they’re unpopular, but rather

recognizing that your employees may be facing very real and scary

challenges and considering ways to help solve them.

As you do this, be mindful of the language you use. Framing the

ﬂexibility conversation using adversarial language like we mentioned

## above — RTO versus WFH, the “battle over RTO,” etc. — solidiﬁes

the framing that this is a winner-take-all contest. If we frame work

design instead as a collaborative, community problem-solving process,

we stand a much better chance of starting the discussion on the right

foot. Changing language is deceptively challenging, so don’t hesitate to

use some of the tricks of the presentation trade that have been proven to

work in eliminating other unwanted language.

## Step 2: Focus on mutual value, not just organizational beneﬁts.

Next, it’s critical to recognize that there remains a tremendous amount

of mutually beneﬁcial value left on the table.

Take, for example, the common argument from leaders that corporate

culture is at risk because of remote work. Framed this way, employees are faced with an adversarial trade-oﬀ: I want to spend time on

what’s important to me, but leadership thinks company culture is more

## important than me spending time with my family.

This frame fails to take into account and communicate to employees

the signiﬁcant research showing that being an active part of a

strong community has substantial beneﬁts for individuals, not just

organizations. In our own work on the integrated employee value

proposition, we ﬁnd that feeling connected to one’s organizational

community is an important part of what employees want and need

from their work. Similarly, the longest study on human happiness found

that happiness, health, and longevity come ﬁrst and foremost from

high-quality relationships, including those with colleagues.

Or consider the oft-used argument that face-to-face work boosts

innovation. Yes, there is strong evidence of this, as seen in the case of

the video-gaming industry. Although innovation is typically seen as an

organizational beneﬁt rather than an individual one, remember that, as

individuals, we also experience psychological beneﬁts from being a part

# of an exciting innovation or success.

It’s important to note that the same holds true in the other direction:

Many of the arguments advocating ﬂexibility focus on employees’

desire for more control over their work. Foundational research on

the job characteristics model, however, shows that designing jobs

with more employee autonomy has real and meaningful beneﬁts

for the organization as well — and not just by making employees

happier and thereby reducing turnover. A greater sense of personal

## responsibility and ownership translates into higher performance and

more eﬃcient task allocation — which are real, meaningful beneﬁts for

# the organization.

## Step 3: Approach the process as data-driven, co-created, iterative learning.

There’s no universal playbook for working arrangements, as every

organization’s work design must be informed by speciﬁc factors

including its competitive landscape, industry norms, employee

demographics, and history. What’s needed is an iterative, collective

approach that brings organization leaders and employees together.

## Frame this as a data-driven, collaborative journey toward mutually

# beneﬁcial progress.

Equally important, you need to accept that you won’t get it right the

ﬁrst time, and that’s ok. An iterative learning process takes time, and

missteps along the way are a critical part of learning. Don’t assume

that the ﬁrst policy you create is the right one, or even that what

is right today will remain right in the future — in fact, go into the

process expecting any plan to need adjusting. A critical part of your

process is recognizing — and communicating — up front that periodic

reassessment of any policy will be needed.

. . .

The leadership side of the RTO discussion has been dominated by sticks

rather than carrots — as in, employees need to get back into the oﬃce

or else — with punishments for noncompliance ranging from reduced

pay to ﬁring.

Leaders must stop trying to push employees into the oﬃce against their

will and focus instead on making the oﬃce an energizing environment

where employees want to be. Take a framing lesson from the social

media playbook, in which FOMO (fear of missing out) has proven to be a

massive driver of behavior and try to create FOMOO (fear of missing out

# on the oﬃce).
