As Pat quickly walked back to his oﬃce, the echo of his own angry

words was still ringing loudly in his ears. Just a few minutes earlier, Pat

had publicly berated a product lead after a botched test, calling them

“incompetent” and a “disgrace” in front of the entire team. Even worse,

this wasn’t the ﬁrst time Pat had lost his temper in such spectacular

fashion. His pattern of explosive outbursts, followed by periods of

remorse and contrition, had become all too familiar for his colleagues,

who often wondered aloud which version of Pat — “Good Pat (Dr.

Jekyll)” or “Bad Pat (Mr. Hyde)” — would show up today.

As Pat slumped into his chair, the guilt began to creep in. “I’ll make

it up to them,” he muttered to himself, convincing himself that by

acting especially kind and fair over the next few days, he could erase

the damage of his outburst. But little did Pat realize he was playing a

dangerous game, with the stakes much higher than he realized for his

# team’s performance.

Although both prevailing wisdom and existing research have often

supported the idea that managers can “make up” for abusive behavior

by subsequently acting ethically, our recent study reveals a much diﬀerent story. When leaders oscillate between abusive and ethical

behaviors, it has a more detrimental impact on employees’ performance

than abuse alone. This “Jekyll and Hyde” leadership style leads

to greater uncertainty and emotional exhaustion among employees, damaging their ability to perform their duties eﬀectively, reducing their

willingness to engage in important organizational citizenship behaviors

(e.g., helping a colleague), and increasing the likelihood that they

will engage in counterproductive work behavior (e.g., stealing oﬃce

# supplies).

## What the Research Shows About “Jekyll and Hyde” Leaders

To explore the impact of leaders who alternate between abusive and

ethical leadership over time (i.e., practicing both abusive and ethical

leadership styles), we recently conducted three studies involving more

than 650 full-time employees in the U.S. and the UK using both

survey and experimental data. Our ﬁndings are published in the

Journal of Applied Psychology. In this research, abusive behaviors —

characterized by a leader’s hostile verbal and nonverbal actions —

represent leader injustice. Conversely, ethical leadership exempliﬁes

## leader justice through fair treatment and reinforcement of appropriate

conduct. Although these behaviors seem unlikely to coexist in the same

leader, evidence shows that leaders can alternate between these fair and unfair behaviors in their interactions with employees across diﬀerent

times and situations. For instance, a leader may respond abusively to

an employee’s project mistakes but show care toward that employee the

next day. While this may seem manageable in the short term, repeated

swings between these behaviors can have signiﬁcant consequences — a

# focus of our research.

Abuse is certainly bad by itself, but employees can at least anticipate

## the actions of a more consistently abusive leader and either attempt

to avoid them or interact with them in ways that protect themselves

and their well-being. However, leaders who alternate between abusive

and ethical behaviors increase their employees’ uncertainty about their

leaders’ future behavior, resulting in employees’ emotional exhaustion

# and decline in job performance.

Additionally, these detrimental eﬀects on employees’ performance

are evident even when employees are not the direct recipients

of such inconsistent leadership. When employees hear about their

immediate supervisors being subjected to cycles of both abuse and

ethical leadership by higher-level managers, they begin to doubt their supervisors’ ability to serve as an eﬀective link between the team and

higher-level managers. Thus, employees begin to have concerns about

their supervisor’s ability to represent the team to and inﬂuence higher-

level managers (e.g., secure valued resources), thereby reducing their

motivation to perform and contribute to the team. Our research shows

## that when a higher-level manager alternates between ethical leadership

and abusive behavior toward the supervisor who reports directly to

them, it creates more uncertainty in the supervisor’s followers about

the supervisor’s abilities than if the supervisor were only abused by the

# higher-level manager.

## Reducing the Prevalence of Abusive Behavior

The key message is clear: Ethical leadership cannot shield employees

from the negative impacts of manager or supervisor abuse. If anything,

it may only make things worse. Given these ﬁndings, what might

leaders, organizations, and employees consider doing to reduce the

# prevalence of abusive leader behavior?

We suggest leaders like Pat must either consistently eliminate all future

instances of abusive behavior or reconsider the beneﬁts of trying

to “restore” their image after cyclic acts of abuse. Leaders should

recognize that attempts to “make up” for past negative behavior by

“doing good” — unless they eliminate future acts of abuse completely

— can backﬁre, exacerbating the situation rather than ameliorating it.

For leaders, consistency in positive and fair leadership behaviors is

the only way to go. As unfair leadership behaviors often stem from

## poor emotional regulation, techniques such as mindfulness, stress

management, and cognitive-behavioral strategies can help leaders

better manage their emotional responses and thus prevent abusive

supervision from happening, particularly in high-pressure situations.

For organizations, it is essential to use all available HR tools — such

as training, selection, rewards, and disciplinary actions — to address

and reduce instances of Jekyll and Hyde leadership. Leaders across hierarchical levels should receive training on eﬀective self-regulation

to prevent abusive behavior that might follow their ethical actions,

or the other way around. Additionally, selecting individuals with high

self-control and emotional stability can help ensure consistent, fair

leadership. Organizations should also create channels for employees to

report abusive behavior and have clear protocols for holding leaders

accountable. Organizations must adopt zero-tolerance policies for

abusive behavior, with strong protocols for handling such instances to

ensure their employees’ safety and well-being.

Finally, although the lion’s share of responsibility for preventing Jekyll

and Hyde leadership falls on leaders and organizations, employees

also have an important role to play. Some leaders may believe that

“good makes up for bad,” leading to repeated instances of Jekyll and

Hyde behavior. In such instances, it is crucial for employees to address

## their concerns and discomfort with the leader through open and

honest communication. While some research suggests that by directly

communicating their discomfort with the leader, employees will

alleviate their distress, there is also reason to believe that leaders will

retaliate, thus exacerbating the problem. If the leader retaliates and/or

does not adjust their behavior after these conversations, employees

should escalate the issue to HR or senior leadership, potentially requesting a leadership change. If such measures prove ineﬀective, it

may be necessary for employees to consider leaving the organization for

# their own well-being and future success.

Ultimately, leadership is not a balancing act between right and wrong —

it’s about building trust through unwavering consistency. When leaders try to oﬀset abusive actions with ethical ones, they risk deepening

distrust and damaging their teams and organizations in ways that can have long-lasting, far-reaching impact. To be eﬀective managers,

leaders must therefore commit to being consistently ethical, fair, and

just, knowing that only those who embody this steadiness of behavior

will truly be successful as leaders, and build a team of high-performing

# followers, in the long run.
