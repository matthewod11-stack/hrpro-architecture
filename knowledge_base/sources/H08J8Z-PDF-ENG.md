Imagine arriving eagerly on your ﬁrst day at a new job, only to ﬁnd that

you’re immediately asked to install location-tracking software, sign a

## mandatory arbitration agreement, or close your social media accounts.

Perhaps you are even asked to allow your routine work communications

— emails, chats, and shared documents — to be collected and analyzed

to train emerging generative AI tools. Anxious to get started and make

a good impression, you comply — despite not fully understanding

these terms. Over time, however, you start to feel that you were

not fully informed about the conditions you agreed to. Your trust in

and commitment to the organization begin to waver. You might even

consider leaving or taking legal action over what now feels like an

unfairly procured agreement.

This situation is not unusual, and it can have important consequences

## for both employees and organizations, as recent high-proﬁle examples

## illustrate. Employees at a large telecommunications company who

initially agreed to carry company-issued phones that tracked their

location eventually sued their employer upon realizing this meant

they were being tracked both on and oﬀ company property. Reality

TV contestants who signed away their right to privacy on hastily

administered legal agreements ultimately ended up suing the network.

Even recording superstar Taylor Swift eventually came to regret legal

terms she had initially agreed to when six of her albums were sold

“without her knowledge and consent.” Swift retaliated by re-recording

her catalog and funneling millions of dollars away from her old record

# label.

In each of these cases, an employee’s or client’s legal consent was

secured, but their feeling of consent was not. In other words, these

organizations succeeded in getting the signatures they needed on

their legal documents, but they failed to ensure that the signatories

themselves were fully aware of and committed to whatever it was

they were agreeing to. As these examples illustrate, the strategy of

expeditiously locking in a legal agreement can ultimately backﬁre when

one party ends up feeling duped and the relationship between the two

parties is irreparably damaged.

## How could well-intentioned solicitors of consent ﬁnd themselves

blindsided by the other party’s discontent with an agreement that

seems to have been obtained freely and transparently? In new research,

forthcoming in Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes,

we examine why and how these breakdowns happen — and what

employers can do to minimize risk while bolstering trust with their

# team.

## Psychological Biases Can Cause Miscalculations

Several psychological biases point to the mistakes we make when

assessing others’ subjective experiences. For one, we tend to gauge

people’s internal states from their observable behaviors, even though

the two are not always aligned. This means that when we observe

someone’s behavioral agreement, as we do when we see them sign a

document, we assume a corresponding psychological agreement.

We also tend to anchor too much on our own knowledge and experience

when assessing what others know and feel. If we understand and agree

with the terms of an agreement, we tend to assume others do too.

Taken together, these biases can lead solicitors of consent to

systematically overestimate how informed the consenting individuals

feel about the terms of an agreement. As a result, solicitors may fail

to anticipate consenters’ eventual dissatisfaction with the agreement,

believing they surely must have “known what they were getting into”

when they consented.

We examined this possibility in a series of studies in which participants

reacted to scenarios involving consent in the workplace, negotiated

agreements in real time, and reﬂected upon the extent to which they

felt they truly understood and consented to the terms of their own

# employment.

# How Informed Do Employees Really Feel?

In one study, participants read several vignettes, including a description

of an employee named Skylar who signed a mandatory arbitration

agreement as part of her company’s onboarding process, and a patient

named Alex who agreed to have a medical procedure despite being

informed that his insurance would not cover the cost. Participants

who read these scenarios from the perspective of the human resources

representative who obtained Skylar’s signature and the doctor who

obtained Alex’s consent believed Skylar and Alex were more informed

about these agreements. They also thought their decision to agree was

more consensual than did participants who read the same scenarios

# from Skylar’s and Alex’s perspectives.

To ensure these ﬁndings were not simply due to the relatively

undesirable nature of the things Skylar and Alex were asked to agree to,

we conducted another study where participants were given the chance

to agree to a decidedly positive outcome—receiving an unexpected

monetary bonus. In this study, one group of participants was randomly

assigned to receive a ﬁnancial windfall. These participants were then

instructed to propose a distribution of their new fortune to another

participant who would receive the proposed amount of money, provided

they agreed to the proposed allocation. Most participants suggested

a fair 50/50 split of the money, and this proposal was nearly always

accepted. Despite these clearly fair terms, however, participants who

accepted this agreement reported feeling less like they had consented to

the agreement than those making the oﬀer assumed they felt.

Lastly, we examined how these dynamics play out in actual

employment contexts with tangible consequences. We surveyed a

population of hiring managers across various industries and asked them

to indicate the extent to which they believed the last employee they

had hired had truly understood and consented to the terms of their

employment. We then surveyed a group of employees and asked them

the extent to which they had truly understood and consented to the

# terms of their current employment.

While 52% of hiring managers thought their most recent hire was

fully informed of the terms of their employment and 65% thought

they had fully consented to these terms, only 20% of employees felt

fully informed of the terms of their employment and only 39% felt

that they had fully consented to them. Further, employees who felt

uninformed at the outset of their roles were more likely to disengage,

perceive their workplace as unfair, and develop strained relationships

with supervisors. They were also more likely to consider quitting.

# What Companies Can Do to Build Trust

In an organizational context, consent is more than a formality — it’s the

foundation of a trusting, productive relationship. However, our research

shows that people in charge of soliciting consent in organizations often

overestimate how informed employees feel when they agree to policies,

contracts, and even take on extra work tasks. This miscalculation can

have direct costs for organizations in terms of employee disengagement

# and turnover.

Organizations looking to address this “informed consent gap” can

start by focusing on transparency and clarity. Providing employees

with ample time to review and discuss contractual or policy-related

information can go a long way in bridging the gap. Furthermore, using

clear language, avoiding overwhelming amounts of information, and

carefully addressing questions can enhance not only employees’ actual

understanding, but also their subjective sense that they know what they

are getting into. Organizations should also implement regular check-ins

to reassess consent and informed-ness for roles or responsibilities that

evolve over time and strive to create an environment where employees

feel empowered to ask questions or request clariﬁcation without fear of

# negative repercussions.

Some terms of employment may feel inherently coercive to employees,

yet employers may nonetheless deem them necessary. In these cases, it

may be especially important to be transparent about the reasons behind

these undesirable terms and the tradeoﬀs employees are explicitly being

asked to make so that they can assess the pros and cons and make

fully informed decisions. While many people may hesitate to give up

their right to a lawyer, their autonomy to post on social media, or their

data to train generative AI models, they may nonetheless be willing to

make this tradeoﬀ for the sake of employment. However, it is to the

organization’s beneﬁt that employees who make such a tradeoﬀ do so

# from a fully informed place.

. . .

The lesson is clear: obtaining true informed consent requires more than

a signature or a verbal agreement. Organizations willing to go beyond

legal compliance and ensure true informed consent will cultivate a

workforce that feels respected, trusted, and engaged. By closing the

## informed consent gap, organizations not only uphold ethical standards

but also cultivate a more engaged and loyal workforce, leading to

# sustainable success.
