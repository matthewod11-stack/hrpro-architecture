Today it’s difﬁcult to read the news without seeing an announcement

of layoﬀs. Just this week, Morgan Stanley announced it will reduce its

workforce by 2%, Buzzfeed said it would cut headcount by 12%, and

PepsiCo said it plans to cut “hundreds” of jobs. The same is true at

## Redﬁn (13%), Lyft (13%), Stripe (14%), Snap (20%), Opendoor (18%), Meta

(13%), and Twitter (50%). So many companies have initiated layoﬀs

recently that tech and HR entrepreneurs launched trackers like TrueUp

Tech and to Layoﬀs.fyi dedicated to monitoring the staﬀ reductions

# across the tech sector.

Traditionally, employers resort to layoﬀs during recessions to save

money. Companies continue to cling to the idea that reducing staﬀ will

provide the best, fastest, or easiest solution to ﬁnancial problems.

I’ve studied layoﬀs since 2009. In 2018, I wrote an article for HBR

that explored how the short-term cost savings provided by a layoﬀ

are overshadowed by bad publicity, loss of knowledge, weakened

## engagement, higher voluntary turnover, and lower innovation — all of

which hurt proﬁts in the long run.

# What’s Different About Layoffs Today

Those ﬁndings haven’t changed in the last four years. What’s diﬀerent

now is the larger social landscape in which today’s layoﬀs are unfolding. To make intelligent and humane staﬃng decisions in today’s economic

turmoil, leaders must ﬁrst understand three recent trends.

Word travels faster. In the traditional pre-pandemic oﬃce environment, news of a reduction

in force might have spread as workers saw the upset faces of their

colleagues emerging from an unexpected meeting with their boss.

Today colleagues may be dispersed, but a single Slack or Teams message

## can simultaneously and instantly alert tens of thousands of employees

around the world to news of a layoﬀ. Whether companies want it this

way or not, communication is simultaneously internal and external,

spreading from employees to social media, journalists, and trade media

that serve speciﬁc industries and the people who work in them.

## HBR / Digital Article / What Companies Still Get Wrong About Layoffs

Corporate decision-making is under a microscope.

Businesses have always needed to justify their actions, but today

corporate reasoning is subjected to wider scrutiny in both traditional

and social media. This is especially true in tech, whose products and

services are deeply embedded in our daily lives and whose leaders have

achieved celebrity status. A quick glance at any social media platform

will reveal that customers are quick to share their strong opinions about

the strategies companies pursue.

Stories about horriﬁc layoﬀs have always been dismayingly easy to ﬁnd.

I once heard about a company that divided employees into two groups.

One room was ﬁlled with people who were told they were losing their

jobs. Just next door — and so loudly it could be heard — were the

survivors, who were being told: “You are winners! You are why we can

do even better!”

Today, poor treatment of employees looks short-sighted and is contrary

to companies’ own interests. In the past, a company’s decision to

eliminate positions may have been protested by a small group of labor

rights advocates. Today, thanks to social media, anyone can challenge

workforce reduction decisions, and ask, “Can’t they see that no one will

want to work for a company that does that?”

The pandemic showed that companies have other options.

In the early months of the pandemic, some companies announced

mass layoﬀs. But not everyone — Marc Benioﬀ publicly pledged that

Salesforce would make no “signiﬁcant” layoﬀs for 90 days, and asked

other companies to commit to doing the same. Many companies,

including Starbucks, Bank of America, and Morgan Stanley assured staﬀ

that, barring a performance issue, jobs were secure through the end

of 2020. Other CEOs made similar temporary no-layoﬀ pledges to help

# stem workers’ anxiety.

These companies announced a diﬀerent approach, including

salary reductions for executives, furloughing employees instead of

terminating, and even sometimes forgoing base salaries altogether

for certain executives. Some CEOs oﬀered grants to employees facing

ﬁnancial hardship or gave workers extra PTO to help ease increased

# demands of caregiving.

In taking these actions, CEOs communicated that employees mattered.

But these statements also left leaders exposed to charges of hypocrisy

when many of them resorted to staﬀ reductions later in 2020, despite

# record proﬁts and stock buybacks.

# What Hasn’t Changed About Layoffs

Research shows that layoﬀs continue to have detrimental long-term

# eﬀects on individuals and companies.

# Layoffs destroy trust.

Eighty-ﬁve percent of respondents rated job loss as their top concern

in Edelman’s 2022 Trust Barometer. Layoﬀs break trust by severing the

connection between eﬀort and reward. The premise of a layoﬀ is that if

it weren’t for the economic conditions facing the ﬁrm, employees would

keep their jobs as long as they perform them well.

The fact that this is a psychological contract rather than in most cases

a legal one is beside the point. In the domain of trust, what matters is

that employees are being asked to willingly be vulnerable to the power

their company has as an employer, and trust that the company will act

in ways that don’t violate their trust. Research ﬁnds that, once betrayed,

this trust is hard to recover.

Layoffs have a long-term impact on people’s health and ﬁnances.

One study found that being laid oﬀ ranked seventh among the most

stressful life experiences — above divorce, a sudden and serious

## impairment of hearing or vision, or the death of a close friend.

Experts advise that it takes, on average, two years to recover from the

psychological trauma of losing a job.

## For healthy employees without pre-existing health conditions, the odds

of developing a new health condition rise by 83% in the ﬁrst 15 to 18

months after a layoﬀ, with the most common conditions being stress-

related illnesses, including hypertension, heart disease, and arthritis.

The psychological and ﬁnancial pressure of being laid oﬀ can increase

the risk of suicide by 1.3 to 3 times. Displaced workers have twice the

risk of developing depression, four times the risk of substance abuse,

and six times the risk of committing violent acts including partner

and child abuse. The stress induced by a layoﬀ can even impair fetal

# development.

## Displaced workers, as a group, experience income losses that can last

for the remainder of their careers: Workers who lost their jobs during

the 1981 recession saw a 30% decline in earnings at the time of their

layoﬀ. Twenty years later, most still earned 20% less than workers

who retained their jobs — the cumulative eﬀect of unemployment,

underemployment, and an inability to ﬁnd work commensurate with

# their skills.

## Layoffs negatively impact companies in real but hard-to-measure ways.

Since 1990, researchers have studied the eﬀects of layoﬀs on ﬁrm

performance to understand whether planned-for improvements are

realized in practice. The results are less clear than one would expect.

The ﬁndings of two decades of proﬁtability studies are equivocal: The

majority of ﬁrms that conduct layoﬀs do not see improved proﬁtability,

whether measured by return on assets, return on equity, or return on

sales. Layoﬀs are especially hard on the performance of companies with

## a high reliance on R&D, low capital intensity, and high growth. Market

response to layoﬀs was also less positive than might be expected, with

three-day share prices of ﬁrms conducting layoﬀs generally neutral.

Higher valuations were given for layoﬀs perceived as helping ﬁrms

in ﬁnancial distress return to proﬁtability as well as those that were

strategic and forward-looking. Layoﬀs undertaken only for the purpose

of reducing costs tended to lead to drops in share price.

Another study focused on Fortune 1000 ﬁrms between 2003 and 2007 —

a period of economic prosperity — to try to minimize the confounding

## eﬀects of layoﬀs undertaken during diﬀerent economic conditions.

Replicating earlier longitudinal studies, it found that layoﬀs do not,

in general, oﬀer immediate ﬁnancial improvements. Firms conducting

layoﬀs underperformed ﬁrms that did not conduct layoﬀs for the

ﬁrst two years, achieving comparable performance by year three on

## measures of return on assets, proﬁt margin, and economic growth. The

authors conclude, “For downsizing companies to gain a competitive

advantage to outperform their competitors, it probably will take even

longer.”

Layoﬀs have direct costs, including severance and the continuation of

health beneﬁts which can lead to substantial restructuring charges that

eat into hoped-for margin improvements. As a thought experiment,

multiply the salary of 11,000 Meta employees by four months —

increasing it perhaps to ﬁve to account for an open-ended extra week

of severance for every year worked. Add to that the cost of extending

health beneﬁts for six months … you can see how the numbers can add

# up.

But those year-one costs would not fully explain why companies

that conduct layoﬀs underperform for nearly three years longer those

that do not. The reasons are in the well-researched hidden costs of

layoﬀs. Employees who survive the layoﬀ may struggle with anxiety,

insecurity, low morale, sadness, and survivor guilt, which lead to

disengagement and hinder job performance. Research shows show that

anxiety about job security, grief for coworkers who were let go, and

overwork can reduce innovation. Quality may decline as employees

focus on improving productivity to keep their jobs. Managing talent becomes more diﬃcult as existing staﬀ resign. Reputational damage

may make it harder to attract high-quality new hires.

The breadth of these eﬀects explains how post-layoﬀ underperformance

happens — and how it can be missed, since the impacts are dispersed

throughout the ﬁrm in activities and functions that might not appear

at ﬁrst to relate to layoﬀs. There are many important reasons for

restructuring and workforce reductions, including ownership changes through divestitures and M&A activity, eﬃciency improvements, down

## market conditions and ﬁnancial challenges, and geographic and market

# changes.

The underperformance does lead, however, to an inescapable

conclusion: Layoﬀs — and workforce change in general — still can be

done smarter and better.

# How to Be Smarter about Workforce Change

In the wake of the string of recent layoﬀs in tech, one economic

historian observed: “Far from cutting-edge, these layoﬀs mark a revival

of long-discredited corporate strategies. If the trend continues, history

suggests these tech leaders will leave their companies severely crippled,

# at best.”

Recently, a number of CEOs of scaling startups have asked me for

advice about maintaining trust while managing layoﬀs in this changing

landscape. Here are some strategies I shared with them.

## HBR / Digital Article / What Companies Still Get Wrong About Layoffs

Examine your options before jumping into layoffs.

Workforce management requires simultaneous strategies. Layoﬀs are

best used when you need to restructure or make permanent changes.

In a temporary downturn, furloughs and in-company reassignments,

underpinned by eﬀective performance management, may be a better

# option.

Dave Cote, who engineered the turnaround of Honeywell in the

2000s used furloughs rather than layoﬀs to reduce costs during the

Great Recession. Cote’s intact workforce enabled him to continue

product development, earning Honeywell a three-year total stock return

between 2009 and 2012 of 75% — more than 20 points higher than GE,

his nearest competitor. Cote didn’t hesitate to use mass layoﬀs when

exiting underperforming businesses. He also made strategic hires in

areas he was growing, and consistently used performance management

to ensure that the people who worked in the company were ones they

wanted to keep.

# Make fair decisions.

Research ﬁnds that the largest factor employees use to judge a layoﬀ’s

fairness is the reality of who is let go. Following a straightforward

criteria, like seniority or “last in, ﬁrst out,” may make layoﬀs easier to

explain, but realistically, it’s never that simple. You may want to keep

some of your newest employees and not be bound to those who have

been with you longest.

Employee performance, while not the driving reason behind a layoﬀ,

is generally accepted as a plausible reason for selecting individuals to

be let go, but ranking employees based on their relative performance

is hard to do fairly. One laboratory study oﬀered participants proﬁles

of 25 employees and gave them performance evaluation ratings,

## absenteeism records, level of seniority, and data on whether they

possessed skills that could transfer to another role in the company,

as well as demographic data including employees’ sex, race, and age.

Experts “found no support for performance playing a part in layoﬀ

decisions.” Instead, “personal characteristics of the employees are

often used in making layoﬀ decisions, despite the target employee’s

## experience, performance, and skill sets.”

Studies of post-layoﬀ data ﬁnd that companies can lose hard-won gains

## in their number of women and underrepresented employees through

unintentional, unconscious bias that can lead managers to retain people

who are like them. And this goes beyond demographics: A desire to

retain the “best athlete” can also show up in higher incidents of layoﬀs

among people with chronic health conditions and those who are on maternity leave. People who are perceived as diﬃcult or are low on the

list of a manager’s favorites, regardless of their performance, are more

readily let go.

If you decide to move forward with a layoﬀ, studies show three practices

can help ensure fairness. First, make sure that you have budgeted

enough time for deliberation. One study of HR executives found that

they devoted less than an hour to each layoﬀ candidate and as a result,

they believed that at least 20% of people were wrongly terminated

from the company. Second, consider using teams of managers, along

with representatives of HR, to review layoﬀ candidate lists for fairness.

A third best practice is to develop a real-time tracker of the proﬁles

of candidates who were being proposed to lose jobs. This allows for

oversight and provides visibility at levels of departments, divisions, and

# the company as a whole.

Layoﬀs are as much about who is staying as who is being let go, and

managers must be allowed to go to bat for people they want to retain,

while ensuring that the ﬁnal list of layoﬀ candidates is fair — on as

# many dimensions as possible.

Provide a soft landing.

In staﬀ reductions, actions that are perceived as most fair by

employees are also ones that give them choice, like voluntary buyouts

## with severance before layoﬀs, and support for multiple paths to

reemployment. According to unpublished research conducted for

Edelman’s 2022 Trust in the Workplace report, if you’re in the position

of announcing layoﬀs, be prepared to use more creativity and spend a

little more money than you might have before to provide a soft landing for employees.

Nokia got employees to stay for more than a year (some for as long

as two years) after announcing a restructuring in 2011 by oﬀering

both paths to employment inside Nokia and support for ﬁnding jobs

outside the ﬁrm. They also provided funding for individuals and small

teams with credible plans to start their own businesses — 1,000 were

developed — and provided a path to new skills by funding education. As

a result, 60% of 18,000 employees from 13 countries, including the U.S.,

Finland, and India, knew what their next job was going to be before their

job at Nokia ended. The company achieved the same percent of sales for

revenues from new products as they did before the announcement, and

at €50 million (€ 2,800 per employee) the entire cost of the company-

managed program was less than 4% of restructuring charges.

Don’t overlook remaining staff.

Many employees jump ship following a layoﬀ: One study found that

a layoﬀ aﬀecting 1% of the workforce led to a 31% increase in the

rate of voluntary turnover. Today’s robust job market provides ample

alternatives for surviving employees who question the fairness of a

layoﬀ. Employees with low organizational commitment are 2.5 times

more likely to leave a ﬁrm after a layoﬀ occurred.

You’ll need to communicate a compelling case for why people should

stay. Surviving and prospective employees want to hear three messages:

We treated your colleagues well. We have a credible strategy to improve

the company’s prospects. There is a clear role for you to play in the

future success of the company. People trust in actions, not words, so the

real test will be making sure that each of these statements syncs with

things you have done and will keep doing.

Be prepared to publicly apologize.

In the past, corporate leadership refrained from making public

apologies for reducing staﬀ. Today, in contrast, the trend is for CEOs

to apologize for eliminating jobs.

How you apologize matters. When making a company apology,

researchers have identiﬁed three essential elements for restoring lost

trust: 1) Acknowledge harm and say you are sorry for it; 2) explain why

you acted as you did; and 3) make an oﬀer of repair that genuinely helps

the person you harmed. Stripe CEO Patrick Collison’s recent email to

employees in which he announced a 14% reduction of staﬀ succinctly

communicates an eﬀective apology. Collison’s tone conveyed sincerity

in acknowledging mistakes: “We’re very sorry to be taking this step and

John and I are fully responsible … We overhired for the world we’re in.”

It’s hard for leaders to make this type of public apology without inviting

cynicism, and today, social media and online news archives make it

easy for anyone to ﬁnd contradictions in a CEO’s message.

. . .

Successfully managing workforce changes within today’s landscape

ultimately requires evaluating your actions against the backdrop of

trust. Your company will weather the storm of layoﬀs more successfully

if you can maintain trust with three groups who will determine your

success in the future: employees you let go, employees you retain, and

employees who don’t yet work for you.

You have a great opportunity to be better at this than other

companies. Keeping trust at the center of your decision-making can

## lead to surprising, beat-the-odds success, as the above examples from

Honeywell and Nokia show. Centering trust also oﬀers leaders a

reminder: Your actions will have consequences that are more visible

than they’ve been in the past and you will be judged as trustworthy — or

not — based on them.
