You may not have “marketing” or “sales” in your job title, but chances

are, you’re still in the pitching business. That’s because most jobs

require the ability to inﬂuence, persuade, and convince others. Whether

you’re presenting an alternate approach to your team project during the

morning scrum, lobbying for a promotion, or trying to convince your

neighbors to support your idea to turn your cul-de-sac into a pickleball

court, you’re pitching.

If you want to be an eﬀective communicator, you’re going to need to

know how to pitch your ideas, concepts, and perspectives to others in

## both professional environments and day-to-day interactions.

Successful pitching is, ﬁrst and foremost, about your audience. Your

pitch must be understandable, relevant, and readily convincing —

without any strong-arm tactics or perceived gimmicks and tricks. And

in today’s rapid-ﬁre, short-attention-span world, it must also be concise.

There are literally hundreds of thousands of books and lifetimes’ worth

of training courses on pitching skills. But despite this plethora of

content, I’ve found very little advice and guidance on how to pitch

concisely and spontaneously. That’s why I’ve put together a simple,

## easy-to-remember and easy-to-implement structure for a pithy pitch.

These four simple sentence starters allow you to create a concrete,

concise, easily repeatable pitch on the spot if needed:

What if you could… [paints a picture of what is possible through your

# product, service, or idea]

## So that… [connects to a meaningful, relevant goal for the listener]

For example… [makes things concrete and demonstrates existing

# traction]

And that’s not all… [demonstrates potential, additional future

opportunities]

Let’s look at an example of how this structure might be used in a

# traditional sales situation.

Imagine you have a new product that helps users clip and organize

## meaningful moments from their favorite podcasts and videos. Once

clipped, the product saves, sorts, and aggregates them in one place. You

want to develop a pitch for your audience. Your pitch might be:

What if you could capture, collect, and categorize short-form audio and

# video content?

So that you can quickly access and combine content together to make

your own meaningful playlists to help you learn, exercise, and be more

# productive.

For example, athletes are curating playlists that contain snippets of

podcasts and video advice to help them with particular stretching

exercises. Then, they can easily access the content they want, whether

they’re in the gym, at home, or getting ready for a track workout.

And that’s not all. There is a social element to this product. You can

share your personal playlists with friends and even build communities

# of people with similar interests.

Now, let’s look at a non-sales example. Let’s say you’re part of a

committee at work to suggest more eco-friendly initiatives for your entire oﬃce. You have an idea for hiring a local ﬁrm to create an organic

garden in an unused portion of your roof area, and you want to pitch

this concept for adoption by the committee. Here’s what your pitch

might look like:

What if we could have fresh produce available on-demand, onsite?

So that we can oﬀer locally grown, organic fruits and vegetables to our

## employees and role model innovative sustainability ideas.

For example, we could have fresh strawberries, tomatoes, and

cucumbers right from our own garden on our roof for snacking or for

employees to take home.

And that’s not all. The group that manages the garden hires at-risk

youth and also encourages employees to take an active part in caring for

the garden and serving as mentors for their workers. As a result, we’d be

helping the larger community and establishing important relationships

that beneﬁt us all.

These two examples show that pitching your ideas, products, or services

doesn’t have to be uncomfortable or long-winded. The key is using

a strong framework that can serve as a scaﬀolding to support your

# position.

# So in closing…

What if you could deploy a useful, four-sentence structure that allows

you to pitch your ideas clearly, succinctly, and persuasively?

So that you can pique your audience’s interest and motivate them to

# listen.

For example, you can convincingly persuade readers to leverage this

# structure in their upcoming pitches.

And that’s not all. You can use this structure not just in planned

situations where you know you will have an opportunity to pitch, but

## in spontaneous, in-the-moment situations where a pitching opportunity

# arises organically.

By relying on this tested framework, you can be concise, relevant, and

persuasive and actually enjoy sharing your perspectives and passions

# with others.
