When members of multidisciplinary teams are asked to describe their

colleagues, many will say their peers are collegial, professional, and

accomplished. While we would all love to be on a team that’s not

dysfunctional, behind this insipid description lurks a peril that is far

## from bland: the lack of collaboration between siloes.

## HBR / Digital Article / 7 Strategies to Break Down Silos in Big Meetings

It’s very common for representatives of diﬀerent disciplines to continue

to operate in their own compartments instead of contributing to a

cohesive purpose and team. In fact, siloes have only gotten more

prominent since the pandemic began, as the circles we collaborate

with have gotten smaller. And this becomes that much more noticeable

in cross-departmental meetings, where each person focuses on their

own priorities, showing little to no interest in others in the room. In

response, the manager of the overall group tends to become the hardest

working person in the meeting, with others only pulling themselves

out of email to present their respective updates, then disengaging again

when their turn is complete.

This is exactly what was happening to one of my clients, Shanna.

Shanna led a cross-functional team and was struggling to get team

leaders coordinated. During meetings, people would nod in agreement,

but then afterward, nothing would actually get done. Frustrated at

the lack of progress, Shanna asked me to observe her team in action.

She couldn’t understand how to garner commitment when everyone

acted superﬁcially amenable. I noticed in her meetings that Shanna was

carrying all the weight. She asked for discussion items but when no

one responded, she created an agenda all on her own. When others

presented, she invited people to ask questions but, when met with

silence, she’d jump in. It seemed like her team had an unspoken pact,

“Don’t poke around in my business, and I will return the favor.”

Shanna’s problem is not uncommon. To create a coordinated team

from a collection of siloed individuals, you need to generate “cross

## talk” — conversations among team members about each other’s areas

of work. Here are seven strategies to get people talking in your next

# cross-functional meeting.

Become comfortable being uncomfortable.

If you want to change your team’s behavior, start by changing yours.

Allow yourself and others to feel some discomfort. Shanna made a

list of ways she was over-participating and rescuing the conversation.

She then communicated to her team that she would be changing

those behaviors and increasing her patience for processing time as

others considered responses. Yes, there were some awkward silences,

but once people knew Shanna’s changes were for real, they realized

the only way out of the discomfort was to actually participate. For

example, when an engineering colleague discussed their schedule, their

ﬁnance counterpart asked questions to better understand engineering

challenges that impact schedule and sharing the impact of a delay on

# their external stakeholders.

# Set expectations in advance.

Some people prefer to prepare their responses, rather than jumping in

spontaneously in meetings. Inform participants in advance not only

that you’d like their participation but also what type of interaction

you’re expecting. Provide pre-reading if you can. For example, “At our

next team meeting we will discuss topic X. Here is a summary of the

market positioning research. Please come prepared to brainstorm ideas

## for our holiday season plans.” In addition to brainstorming, you might

have meetings to make decisions, receive feedback, or share opinions

or research from diﬀerent vantage points. When people know the topic,

have background information, and know what’s expected of them, they

are more likely to contribute fully, even outside their expertise.

# Ensure participation.

Let people know it will be important to hear from everyone on key

topics. If they agree with someone else, they can say, “plus one” rather

than echoing the idea. If they really don’t have anything to contribute,

they can say, “pass.” By requiring a pass or plus one, we raise the bar for

participation and insert everyone’s voice into the room.

Ask the right questions to generate questions.

Shanna used to solicit questions and, after a pause of about a

microsecond, barrel ahead. She chose a diﬀerent strategy to encourage

interaction. Instead of saying, “Do you have any questions?” consider

asking, “Who has the ﬁrst question?” If there’s silence, follow up with a

joke, “OK, who has the second question?” and then allow the silence to

sit long enough to allow people to come up with rich queries. Shanna

learned not to ﬁll silences and to ask more questions of her audience

instead of the presenter. For example, “If a developer on your team

heard this sales presentation, what questions would they have?” or,

“What do you need to know to vote on this option?” Sometimes it’s how

you invite questions that results in quality responses.

# Introduce response data.

Use the adage “we get what we measure” to your advantage by noting

participation data about halfway through a meeting. Notice who is

speaking, how much, in what order, and what they’re contributing.

Then say, “Halfway into the meeting, only four of us have spoken,” or

“John has been the ﬁrst to speak each time the presenter has asked

for comments.” Simply mention some data points and notice how

participants choose to respond. Some of those who haven’t spoken

will start to participate, or “John” might step back and invite others to

# initiate responses.

# Bridge intersections.

Avoid participants tuning out of topics not related to their speciﬁc

departments by asking them to think about ways their work connects.

For example, “How does what Suneeta shared impact plans for your

department?” “What do you think the IT team will say when we

communicate Y?” or “What do the goals of project X have in common

with your objectives?” Deliberately bridging across departments

increases the relevance of the discussion for a broader set of attendees.

Their responses help shape a more robust solution that works across the

organization and appears more seamless to the consumers of the work.

# Mix it up.

The future of work is hybrid with a blend of in-person and virtual

interactions. Not everyone will be comfortable voicing their opinions

all the time. Create a variety of ways to gather input. In addition to

verbal comments, ask for responses via chat, do a quick poll to calibrate

opinions, or have everyone add text to a shared document. Adding more

avenues for people to interact draws out the best ideas from a broader

spectrum of personality types and increases the novelty of interaction over the drone of daily meetings. It harvests ideas more eﬃciently than

always requiring contributors to vocalize them.

Shanna’s team now engages actively on each topic. People rotate taking

notes and facilitating. And they have recently made signiﬁcant progress

in deﬁning their product strategy, which had been stalled for the last six

# months.

The purpose of a team is to divide the workload across its members

and multiply the beneﬁts of generative thinking across siloes. As

managers, we reduce the pressure we put on ourselves by encouraging

collaboration and communication between departments, starting with

# cross-talk in meetings.
