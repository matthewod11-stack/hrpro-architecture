In today’s business culture, expertise is currency. We celebrate

## mastery, reward pattern recognition, and prize leaders who can quickly

distinguish signal from noise. But in doing so, we’ve created an

unexpected trap for ourselves: The more you become “somebody” in

your chosen ﬁeld (recognized, accomplished, authoritative), the more

your thinking tends to calcify, limiting your ﬂexibility and creativity.

The management scholar Erik Dane has called this problem “cognitive

## entrenchment,” and the researchers Huy Phan and Bing Hiong Ngu

have documented it widely across professions.

The antidote to this problem is surprisingly simple: Consistently put

yourself in situations where you are a complete beginner. Consider

taking up a new pursuit outside of work, whether it’s learning a

language, playing an instrument, trying stand-up comedy, or exploring

ceramics. Seek out situations in which you have no prior knowledge to

leverage, no past successes to fall back on, and no external achievement

metrics to chase. Those are conditions that will allow your brain to

rewire itself for agility and innovative thinking.

Neuroscience suggests that this practice, which I call strategic

amateurism, is essential to becoming a dynamic leader. Researchers

have shown that when we try something unfamiliar, the brain’s

reward system activates, releasing dopamine and forging fresh

neural connections, which are the building blocks of neuroplasticity.

Experiencing novelty doesn’t just stimulate the brain; it pushes it to

reconﬁgure itself in real time, expanding cognitive ﬂexibility. Other

studies suggest that new challenges can not only accelerate skill

development but also sharpen the range of thinking leaders draw on

# in their day-to-day jobs.

In a landscape of accelerating global change, tapping into this trait is

emerging as an advantage for leaders. The World Economic Forum’s

2025 Future of Jobs Report highlights creative thinking, ﬂexibility,

curiosity and lifelong learning as skills future employers will prize most.

It also shows that by 2030 almost 40% of workers’ skills will need to

be updated. As AI takes on more technical and pattern-recognition

tasks, the human edge will come from creativity and adaptability,

reinforcing the value of developing this kind of mental plasticity over

# static expertise.

But keep in mind that strategic amateurism isn’t about fundamentally

reinventing yourself. It’s about temporarily escaping from your

established leadership persona to expose your mind to conditions

it rarely encounters: novelty, uncertainty and productive discomfort.

These experiences don’t just challenge you, they naturally cultivate

## creative qualities such as openness, humility, curiosity and wonder.

When you have no expertise to lean on, your mind ﬂexes in directions

your day to day rarely demands. And if you engage in that practice

actively and consistently, you don’t just reconnect with those qualities—

you strengthen the cognitive agility you carry back into your regular job.

# Escaping the Proficiency Plateau

I discovered the value of strategic amateurism accidentally, in my role

as the chief marketing oﬃcer of Intuit Mailchimp. I had been in the job

long enough to have reached what’s known as the “proﬁciency plateau”

—the point where skills that you’ve spent years mastering now deliver

consistent results, but the thrill of discovery has begun to fade. It’s not

## burnout, but something more subtle: practicing reliable excellence with

## a tacit acceptance of repetition and routine.

I hit this plateau at a high point in my career. The work I was doing

with my team was sharp—strategically sound, rich with insight and

delivering strong results. Two years earlier getting those kinds of results

in similar projects would have ﬁlled me with delight and pride. But

now I couldn’t help but feel that the creative leaps my team and I

were making were becoming incremental and predictable. We weren’t

recycling work, but we were recycling our ways of thinking. I knew we

had the talent and vision to push further; we just needed to break out of

# a familiar groove.

During that period, I had coﬀee with a mentor who recently retired.

He shared advice he’d been given as he went through this transition:

Say yes to everything new for a year. I liked the idea. But why wait

for retirement? I decided to throw myself into a couple of pursuits

outside of work where I had zero expertise: watercolor painting and

karaoke. Doing each made me highly uncomfortable at ﬁrst, but that

was precisely the goal, so I stuck with them—and over time I sensed a

new kind of energy in myself. Freed from the weight of being “someone

who knows,” I discovered the alertness and absorption that mastery

often dulls, and I felt more curious and more receptive to new ways of

# thinking and working.

I didn’t expect much, just that these pursuits would make my personal

life feel a tad more expansive. But what happened next surprised me.

At work, my team noticed a subtle shift in how I approached creative

reviews. When my internal agency brought an unexpected reference or

an out-of-left-ﬁeld idea, instead of immediately trying to ﬁt it into our

usual framework, I gave it more space to breathe and develop. Dabbling

in art made me more receptive when our designers pushed for bolder

color choices on our assets. My late-night singing sessions reminded me

how freeing it can feel to create without judgment. That carried over

into how I treated rough early-stage ideas and hypotheses. Together,

these changes helped my team and me create the conditions for some

of our most distinctive work. We challenged B2B conventions, delivered

meaningful business results, and earned industry recognition.

# From Nobody to Somebody

Strategic amateurism doesn’t require major life changes, but it does

require intention. As the economist John Maynard Keynes put it, “The

diﬃculty lies not in the new ideas, but in escaping from the old ones.”

Here’s a three-step approach to operationalize that shift:

- 1. Choose one or two activities with no professional relevance for you.

The further from your expertise, the better. The goal is to escape the

weight of competence and let your brain form new connections.

- 2. Commit publicly.

Share your new pursuit with colleagues, friends, and family—and frame

it as a commitment to learning, not performing. Sharing will help make

## you accountable and stick with your new pursuit, and that framing will

remove the pressure to achieve.

- 3. Embrace “productive discomfort.”

The feeling of being out of your depth is the point. Learn to recognize

it not as a sign of incompetence or failure but as an opportunity

for growth. If the challenge starts to feel easy, or you start to get

comfortable, raise the bar.

. . .

If you stick with something long enough, you’ll naturally improve, of

course, and that progress will feel rewarding. But your goal as a strategic amateur is not mastery. It’s the mental ﬂexibility that emerges from

repeatedly stepping into beginnerhood. For high performers, holding

back the instinct to measure, compare, and outperform is diﬃcult. But

that restraint is what makes this process powerful. Paradoxically, by

regularly making yourself a “nobody” in new contexts, you’ll become a more eﬀective “somebody” in your leadership role. So the next time

you feel you’ve arrived at the proﬁciency plateau, don’t double down on

what you know. Step into something you don’t.
