How often has your team changed lately? A new member joins. A key

player exits. Roles shift. Strategy evolves. A conﬂict brews. Performance

dips. Today’s teams are in constant ﬂux—reshaped by both internal

dynamics and external pressures. And yet many leaders push forward

without pausing to reset after a team change.

The best leaders know that success isn’t static—it requires regular

renewal. Whether driven by restructuring, relationship tensions,

demotivation, or strategic pivots, there comes a moment when a team

needs more than a tweak. It needs a relaunch.

Based on our collective work with hundreds of teams over the past

decade, we oﬀer a roadmap for getting your team back on track.

- 1. Reassess: Diagnose before you act

Leaders often rush to make changes without ﬁrst diagnosing the

underlying issues, only to ﬁnd the problems worsen. Before jumping

into action, consider these questions:

- Is the team aligned on purpose, goals, and priorities?

- Are there unresolved conﬂicts or trust issues?

- Has motivation, engagement, or well-being dropped?

- Are there external pressures impacting performance?

- Does the team have the right resources?

- Is there a shared commitment to investing in relationships?

- Are there issues with your leadership style or perceived fairness?

Not all team members will feel comfortable speaking openly, especially

in group settings or directly with you. Cultural norms, personal history,

and power dynamics can all shape how people express concerns. In

addition to one-on-one conversations, consider using anonymous pulse

surveys, or have one trusted member of the team compile unspoken

themes and report them to you. And if the team’s psychological safety

allows, host a structured dialogue where members can share their

## perspectives in a respectful, inclusive way.

The goal isn’t to force openness—it’s to uncover what’s really going on

in a way that works for your team. Only then can you address the root

# causes and relaunch with intention.

Take one leader we worked with at a European tech company. He

believed a loss of motivation had caused his team to get complacent,

diminishing their performance. We asked him to dive a little deeper

into what might really be going on that could perhaps be unspoken.

An anonymous team diagnostic revealed a deeper issue: A recent

reporting restructure had left several members feeling overlooked

and undervalued, driving their disengagement. Once the true cause

surfaced, the leader could take targeted action to rebuild trust and

reenergize the team.

While individual conversations are helpful for diagnosis, the reset must

happen together. Leaders often rely too heavily on private, bilateral

talks, unintentionally reinforcing fault lines. The real work lies in

building the team’s capacity to face hard truths—collectively.

- 2. Reconnect: Build trust and psychological safety

If your team has been through turbulence, chances are trust has

taken a hit. For example, we recently worked with a senior leader

at a pharmaceutical company who dismissed a team-composition

change as “just one person” and that it was “more or less the same

team.” But the reality was diﬀerent: While only one team member was

replaced, the new person was dismissive and made sarcastic comments,

which fundamentally distorted the whole team’s power dynamics and

# diminished psychological safety.

Relaunching starts with rebuilding psychological safety by creating an

environment where people feel safe to speak up, share their experience,

challenge ideas, and even engage in a “good ﬁght” now and then. Here’s

how to begin:

- Lead with vulnerability by conducting a team check-in to

understand how team members are faring both personally and

# professionally.

- Encourage open dialogue through structured team retrospectives.

Allow each member to speak about their experience and ideas and be

heard and acknowledged by others. Share your own lessons learned

and what you’ll do diﬀerently.

- Allow for constructive feedback through a structured team process

where feedback is considered a shared responsibility.

- 3. Reenvision: What’s our job to be done?

What is your team’s purpose? What does the future hold? What is at

stake? Teams rally around clear, inspiring visions, especially during

periods of change. Frame the relaunch as an opportunity to realign on

the “what,” not just to react to problems.

While leaders often assume their team is aligned on purpose and

strategy, that’s not necessarily the case, and it’s important to make the

implicit explicit. We worked with the CFO of a German manufacturing

company who had attempted a relaunch but been unsuccessful. She had

skipped this reenvision step because her team members insisted that

the vision was “clear,” when in reality, they weren’t on the same page.

To get the alignment you need, be transparent about challenges while

focusing on the future:

- Clarify the overall vision and strategic map to get there. Align on a

few key outcomes that deﬁne success in the short and long term. • Reaﬃrm the team’s purpose and value to the organization and to

# customers.

- Set a forward-looking tone that inspires optimism and agency.

- 4. Recontract: Clarify the team’s ways of working

Misalignment often stems from confusion about roles, priorities, and

how team members will actually collaborate. During a relaunch, renew

and redeﬁne key elements of what McKinsey refers to as the “team

operating system”: “the building blocks for the way team members

collaborate, create change, and support one another.” Consider:

- Roles and responsibilities: Ensure everyone knows what’s expected

of them. This encompasses both written and unwritten expectations of

who speciﬁcally is responsible for which deliverables.

- Decision-making processes: Clarify who makes which decisions and

how input is gathered.

- Team norms and expectations: Consider which behaviors are

expected, what the optimal cadence is for meetings and collaboration,

and when you’ll engage in feedback. It’s especially critical to regularly

realign and reinforce these expectations when working across borders,

# boundaries, and time zones.

We worked with the leadership team of a fast-moving consumer goods

company’s EMEA region on realigning their meeting practices. They

were suﬀering from meeting proliferation, where their entire days were

spent sitting in meetings, leaving little time to get “actual work” done.

We challenged them to be as speciﬁc as possible, considering questions

like: Who must really be in the room, and who can receive the minutes

afterward? What preparation is expected? What are our practices for

virtual and face-to-face meetings, including length, how to ensure all

voices are heard, and how much time to spend on checking in? And

after the meeting itself, is there time for debrieﬁng and sensemaking?

After going through that exercise, the team created—and upheld—new

standards, and meeting quality improved dramatically.

- 5. Reenergize: Build on successes

It’s easy to fall back into old patterns. To make the relaunch stick, focus

on quick wins that demonstrate positive movement and reinforce the

new behaviors. Identify one or two visible, achievable objectives that

can be met in the ﬁrst 30 to 60 days and recognize team members for

doing so. Small successes build conﬁdence and reinforce positive team

dynamics. A team’s energy is shaped by its daily interactions, successes,

and failures. Relaunching is a great time to introduce or refresh rituals

that foster alignment and engagement. Here are some ideas:

- Bi-weekly check-ins: Schedule short, focused team meetings to align

# on priorities.

- Wins and learnings reviews: Celebrate progress and reﬂect on

lessons after completing important milestones.

- One-on-one coaching: Prioritize regular leader–team member

touchpoints with the purpose of having a growth-oriented,

developmental conversation. Equally important are the peer-to-peer

coaching conversations where colleagues help each other with

expansive questions aimed at strengthening skills.

A supply chain team we worked with took time to acknowledge the

progress they were making on active listening. They gave encouraging

feedback to a team member who had previously been dominating

conversations and had practiced stepping back in meetings. This

encouraged him to continue the journey, propelling the team forward.

## These moments of positive reinforcement shape and reinforce team

# culture.

- 6. Readjust: Sustain momentum

A relaunch is not a one-time event—it’s an ongoing process, and the

steps aren’t always linear. Keep the momentum by:

- Tracking progress against the team’s new goals and priorities.

- Providing micro-feedback frequent, brief, and targeted, and holding

each other accountable to new ways of working.

- Regularly reassessing and adjusting what’s working and what’s not,

including roles and responsibilities, decision-making processes, and

# team norms.

The executive board of a logistics solution company we worked with

found itself in a situation where members were frustrated with one of

their peers, resulting in an us-versus-him dynamic. But we found that

the reality was more complicated. The team was consistently violating

an initially agreed-upon norm of turn-taking and sharing the airtime

in discussions. The ﬂipchart that featured this agreement had been

pushed to the corner of the room and subsequently forgotten. The

simple act of asking them to revisit those norms launched the reset. We

asked them to evaluate themselves: “On a scale of 1–10, how well are you

doing on your initial agreement to take turns and share the airtime?”

. . .

Like any living systems, teams need regular care, attention, and

intentional renewal to thrive. Relaunching a team isn’t a sign of failure

—it’s a sign of leadership. By pausing to reassess, reset, and realign,

leaders can reenergize their teams, strengthen trust, and build the

clarity and momentum needed for sustained performance in an ever-

changing environment.
