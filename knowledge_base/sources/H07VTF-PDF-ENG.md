When you work for a struggling company, it’s normal to feel compelled

to work longer hours in hopes of righting the ship. This tendency is

particularly true in business development when you directly impact

# revenue.

This is what my client, James, was facing (not his real name). James

is a VP of business development and had been with his cybersecurity

startup company for 18 months. As he familiarized himself with the

organization, he grew concerned about its strategy and company

direction. Although invited to participate in senior management

meetings, James disagreed with the C-suite’s direction and believed it

jeopardized the company’s growth. While James wanted to challenge

some of the leadership team’s assumptions to help turn around the

company’s performance, he was also conﬂicted about maintaining

## boundaries around his personal and professional time.

When James brought these dilemmas to our coaching meetings, I

shared the following strategies with him, which he was able to leverage

to keep his boundaries intact while also succeeding in his role.

Determine when to offer advice — and when to step back.

Since James had been in the tech industry for more than 15 years

working for several companies of diﬀerent sizes, he’d seen ﬁrsthand

what worked and what didn’t. He wondered if he should step beyond his

deﬁned role to advise the executive team — and if so, how far he should

go — particularly since this would require entering territory where a

CEO with little experience might not welcome his views. It also would

absorb more of his time and energy to take on this additional legwork,

giving him less time for his core priorities.

Your decision on whether or not to advise on matters of company

performance outside of your main role should hinge on if you possess the expertise to eﬀectively and eﬃciently oﬀer your advice. If you do

have signiﬁcant insight into your new company’s problem, then you

may be able to share that in a straightforward way without encountering

a major time suck. Here’s what that might sound like:

- “I’ve been in this industry for 15 years and can help with this pivotal

decision.”

- “My last company encountered a similar situation. I’m happy to share

what worked for them.”

Get specifics before taking on new assignments.

One of James’s struggles with his executive team was their lack of

deﬁned goals. So, when they asked him to take on an additional

assignment, he declined because it wasn’t clear what success would look

like, and he was already concerned about achieving in his primary role.

Before agreeing to take on an extra assignment, seek speciﬁcs: What’s

the objective? How will success be measured? How long will this

assignment last? What exactly will be required of you? How many hours

will it take? Once you have a clear understanding of what’s required,

then you can conﬁdently decide if it’s a good match.

If it’s not a good ﬁt, then decline positively and honestly by saying

something like: “Thank you for considering me for this project. I have to

decline, though. With my current responsibilities, I couldn’t give it my

full attention. It would be best to oﬀer it to someone with the bandwidth

to help it reach its potential.”

See if you can help in smaller, more manageable ways by providing

input on the project plan or oﬀering to attend brainstorming sessions,

for example. By contributing where you can, you’ll showcase your

proactive nature and prove you’re a team player without overloading

# yourself.

Graciously decline new roles if your primary responsibilities will suffer.

Six months into his tenure, the VP of marketing for James’s company

left to take another position. Management came to James and asked

him to ﬁll in. James realized that doing so would distract him from

his current business development priorities, which were critical to the

company’s revenue. The question that James posed to me was how to

decline without giving the impression that he lacked commitment to

the organization and without appearing selﬁsh.

The key is to focus on why saying no is in the best interests of everyone

involved, or as executive coach and author Melody Wilding describes,

it’s about taking a “relational” approach. You might say, “If I devote time

to marketing at this juncture, it will take away from my ability to focus

on revenue generation, which is critical to all of us.”

Find small ways to protect your time

James realized that adding hours to his schedule would not measurably

aﬀect his company’s performance and could lead to burnout. So he

looked for tangible, small ways to establish limits.

He began by blocking out parts of his calendar when he couldn’t attend

## meetings because of his commuting schedule, family responsibilities, or

because he wanted the ﬁrst hour of his day to get organized. His goal

was to protect the time on his schedule to maximize his eﬀectiveness.

If you get a meeting request within the time you blocked oﬀ, suggest an

alternative. If you can’t reschedule the meeting, you’ll need to decide

whether it’s vital for you to attend. In some situations, you may be

unable to change meeting times, such as when the meeting involves

global participants in multiple time zones or if the schedules of a team

need to be coordinated for a consulting project. In these cases, you’ll

need to evaluate the situation on its merits.

Limiting your availability can be especially diﬃcult to do when your

company is struggling — you don’t want to be seen as not pulling your

weight. This is why communication is key. If you plan on setting your

phone on “do not disturb” or are limiting your timeframe of answering

emails after a particular time, clearly relay that to the rest of your team

to manage their expectations of you.

According to Jim Harter, chief scientist for Gallup’s workplace

management practice, speaking up is the best step to setting workplace

boundaries. Let your manager know what is and isn’t working and the

goals you’re trying to achieve. If you have yet to set boundaries and

communicate what you need within your current role, then you’ll just

take that lack of clarity into a diﬀerent setting if you shift to another job,

eliminating the original stressor but not the origin of your stress.

Working longer hours for a struggling company may make you feel like a

hero, but one person’s eﬀorts will not save an at-risk organization. Focus

your energy where you have the most signiﬁcant impact and consider

what makes sense for you in the long run.
