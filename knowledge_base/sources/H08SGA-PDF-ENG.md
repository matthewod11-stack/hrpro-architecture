When you step into a new leadership role, you face a deﬁning moment

—one that often signals how the rest of your tenure will unfold. How

will you approach the team you inherit?

I recently worked with a client, we’ll call her Maya, who joined a new

company and within two months brought in her own leadership team,

sidelining tenured leaders with high social and trust capital. Her goal

was to “raise the level of talent,” but the move created lasting damage.

We started working together six months after the changes when her

engagement survey showed the dust hadn’t settled. She couldn’t shake

the fear and distrust she had sparked, which destabilized the culture as

employees wondered whether their jobs were next.

While bold moves may appear to create momentum, they can also

generate resistance, erode trust, and destabilize culture. The most

eﬀective leaders recognize that immediate upheaval rarely builds

sustainable results. Instead, they adopt a thoughtful and strategic

approach that balances fresh perspective with deep respect for the

organization’s existing talent. Here’s a playbook for how to navigate

this critical inﬂection point, helping you set the right tone, harness

## inherited strengths, and lead purposeful change.

- 1. Lead with curiosity, not conclusions.

The pressure to perform quickly in a new role can lead even seasoned

leaders to make hasty judgments about their inherited team. But

quick assessments and defaulting to replacing people often stem from unconscious biases, not data. Aﬃnity bias can lead you to favor

individuals who feel familiar in background, interests, or experiences.

An availability heuristic can lead you to make hasty judgments based on

## the loudest or most visible data points rather than deep analysis. And

the halo (or horn) eﬀect can cause you to make sweeping judgments

based on positive or negative ﬁrst impressions.

Instead of replacing team members, start by adopting a curious

mindset. Ask questions. Observe dynamics. Listen more than you talk.

People may surprise you once they feel safe enough to reveal their true

capabilities. Give yourself time to spot not only talent gaps, but hidden

# strengths and untapped potential.

- 2. Conduct an objective talent assessment.

To combat bias and quick judgment, take time to conduct a fair talent

assessment. Rather than relying solely on your gut, approach this

evaluation as a structured process. Build a full-picture understanding

of your team by gathering data and conducting a listening tour:

- Look at team members’ performance evaluations from the past 12 to 24

months to understand how predecessors and stakeholders perceived

# their performance.

- Dive into company engagement or pulse survey data from the past

year to understand teams’ sentiments about their leaders, identify

blind spots, and surface patterns that may not show up in performance

# reviews alone.

- Conduct stakeholder interviews within your department and cross

functionally to gather more details about past performance, current

# perception, and any untapped potential.

- Consider asking each leader to participate in a formal 360 review,

or share their most recent one, to gain nuanced insights into their

leadership behaviors and how they’re perceived within the company

# culture.

This approach protects against oversights and ensures that any changes

you choose to make are grounded in evidence, which builds credibility

with your team, shows fairness, and reinforces a culture of performance

and accountability. Fairness doesn’t guarantee that everyone will stay,

but it does mean everyone gets a fair review and evaluation.

- 3. Invest in trust, even if you plan to make changes.

Bringing in leaders you’ve worked with in the past can create a sense

of psychological safety for you—after all, they already understand your

leadership style, share your language, and are predisposed to support

your vision. But if your goal is to lead transformational change without

triggering unnecessary emotional or operational disruption, it’s equally

important to invest in building trust with the existing team you’ve

inherited.

Start by leading with transparency. Clearly communicate your

expectations, the process you’ll use to evaluate the team’s capabilities,

and the values that will guide your decision-making. As you begin

identifying what needs to change, engage in open dialogue. Share

feedback, provide developmental context, and give your team members

a meaningful opportunity to step up under your leadership. This kind

of performance-based runway not only earns you credibility, but it gives

your team clarity, dignity, and a fair chance to contribute.

This may feel counterintuitive if your early assessment suggests that

some current team members won’t be part of the long-term picture.

But even short-term allies, when treated with dignity, respect, and

transparency, can become powerful advocates for your leadership and

the culture you’re trying to shape. Their support can be instrumental

in stabilizing morale and maintaining continuity during uncertain

# transitions.

And don’t underestimate the trust capital your inherited leaders

may already hold. Their relationships, inﬂuence, and institutional

knowledge can serve as bridges between the past and future. Even if you

eventually choose to restructure or part ways, recognizing and honoring

that trust capital allows for more graceful transitions and demonstrates

the kind of respect that reinforces your long-term leadership brand.

- 4. Weigh preservation with transformation.

Even if you know exactly what needs to happen to right-size your

department and set it up for success, abruptly replacing long-tenured

leaders or experienced contributors can lead to signiﬁcant fallout in a

# few areas:

- Psychological safety: As Amy Edmondson notes in The Fearless

Organization, sudden changes can erode team trust and silence voices

—just when you need open feedback and innovation the most.

- Employer brand damage: When respected internal leaders are

terminated without clear rationale, word travels inside the company

and outside, especially when those terminated employees have deep

## relationships with external customers and stakeholders.

- Loss of institutional knowledge: Longtime employees often hold

nuanced, context-rich insights that can’t be captured in handoﬀs

or spreadsheets. Their departure can lead to slower onboarding,

## repetitive mistakes, and hinder decision-making.

Yes, some change is often necessary. But don’t confuse urgency with

recklessness. Smart change honors inherited strengths while addressing

real capability gaps. It’s a balance—not a binary choice between

# preservation and transformation.

- 5. Balance fresh perspective with continuity.

New leaders bring fresh eyes. You may spot talent gaps, ineﬃciencies,

or cultural patterns your predecessor missed. That fresh perspective is

an asset, but the reﬂex to replace existing leaders with those who have

shown allegiance in previous workplaces can signal insecurity rather

than strategic clarity. Dismissing tenured employees quickly without

giving them a chance to adopt the fresh perspectives and be part of the

solution can mean losing the very people who hold cultural continuity,

high-trust relationships, and engage in institutional stewardship.

Sustainable change doesn’t require a clean sweep. It requires a

discerning eye. Who has the will and skill to evolve? Who’s blocking

progress? Who’s quietly carrying the culture? Who could thrive if given

# diﬀerent support or a new challenge?

A high-trust, high-performance team doesn’t have to start from scratch.

It can be built from the pieces you inherit—if you take the time to

understand them.

. . .

The mark of a great leader is not how quickly they act, but how

wisely they decide. When you inherit a team, you’re not just managing

headcount; you’re shaping or reshaping culture. How you show up in

those early days sets the tone for your leadership brand. Do you lead

with empathy and insight, or ego and impulse?

The best leaders lead with both urgency and patience. They make

decisive moves, but only after gathering the right information. They

bring fresh vision, but also honor the work that came before them.

And they recognize that performance, trust, and culture are intertwined

with each one shaping the others. Lead with a vision and the same

thoughtfulness you hope to inspire in them.
