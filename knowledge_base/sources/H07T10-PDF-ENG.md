Hiring is one of the most challenging competencies to master, yet it

is one of the most strategic and impactful managerial functions. A

McKinsey study quantiﬁed that superior talent is up to eight times

more productive, showing that the relationship between talent quality

and business performance is dramatic. Organizations seeking growth

or simply survival during diﬃcult times must successfully recruit A-

list talent, thought leaders, and subject matter experts. This is often

done under time constraints as you must quickly ﬁll a key position.

Essentially you are committing to a long-term relationship after a few

# very short dates.

Now let’s consider the typical process of hiring talent. The primary tool

we use to assess talent is a set of job interviews. The typical interview

process is a Q&A format where some version of the common questions

are asked of the candidate: Tell us about your background. Why do

you want to work for us? Share a challenge you faced at work and how

you dealt with it. What are you most proud of? What impact have you

had? Why are you the best person for the job? What is your greatest

achievement? What are your weaknesses?

While much has been said in favor and against the value of interviews

themselves, the typical Q&A job interview process fails to assess one

of the most important, if not the most important, skills you should be

looking for from people you hire — critical thinking. Critical thinking

is seeking information from various sources, assessing its credibility,

and determining its relevance and veracity. Often classiﬁed as a higher-

order skill, critical thinking is not a single skill but a collection of skills

involving reasoning, constructing sound arguments, and identifying

a situation’s ﬂaws, biases, logic, or inconsistencies. Critical thinking is diﬀerent from creative thinking. Creative thinking is the ability to

generate new, innovative ideas. Critical thinking requires the candidate

to carefully and logically analyze facts and form a judgment.

## Critical Thinking Is Fundamentally a Process of Questioning

A key insight from our research, based on surveying and teaching

thousands of executives, is that the smartest person in the room is

not the one with the answer but the person asking the question.

They are curious, engaged, unafraid, inquisitive, and ready to explore

a new domain that may not have answers yet. By the nature of

their questions, they demonstrate observation, analysis, inference,

interrogation, interpretation, and explanation. Critical thinkers are

curious. Innate curiosity has been shown to be associated with the

following eight traits — avid learners, problem solvers, active listeners,

## self-driven, high productivity, growth mindset, overachievers, and

strong at stakeholder management. The eight traits read like a wish list

of qualiﬁcations for people you want to be part of your team.

Consulting ﬁrms and technology companies have pushed the standard

battery of interview questions by using scenario-based or behavioral

questions: How much should you charge to mow a lawn in Atlanta? Why

are utility holes round? How would you design a wine rack for people who

are blind? If you received $5 million to solve a global problem, what issue

would you address and how?

These are a good step forward in assessing candidates’ ability to

ask questions, but while answers to these questions will analyze a

candidate’s problem-solving skills, ability to deal with ambiguity and

creative thinking, it will not indicate if they are curious, self-starters, or

## passionate about your company, products, culture, or any of the eight

traits referenced earlier.

But how do you identify individuals with this versatile and compelling

mix of critical thinking and curiosity? Boldly ﬂip the interview process.

The oldest and still the most powerful tactic for fostering critical

thinking is the Socratic method, developed over 2,400 years ago

## by Socrates, one of the founders of Western philosophy. The

Socratic method uses thought-provoking question-and-answer probing

to promote learning. It focuses on generating more questions than

answers, where the answers are not a stopping point but the beginning

of further analysis. Hiring managers can apply this model to create a diﬀerent dialogue with candidates in a modern-day organization.

# The Flip Interview

Let the candidate interview you. The ﬂip interview is an alternate

method to uncover a candidate’s intrinsic strengths, preferred ways

of working, and how they think. The interview will showcase the

candidate’s thinking and decision-making process and indicate if the

# candidate exhibits leadership traits.

The ﬂip interview goes beyond letting the candidate ask you open-

ended questions like, What is the company culture? or What is it like

to work for the company? The interviewer comes to the discussion with a

## business scenario, an understanding of relevant information, and an

invitation to the interviewee to guide discovery through a series of

# questions.

The interviewee may use four types of questions, which are increasing

## in their level of complexity and involvement.

- Factual questions: Questions that have straightforward answers

based on facts or awareness.

- Convergent questions: Close-ended questions with ﬁnite answers.

Typically, these questions have one correct answer.

- Divergent questions: Open-ended questions that encourage many

answers. These questions are a means for analyzing a situation,

problem, or complexity in greater detail and stimulate creative

# thought.

- Evaluative questions: Questions that require deeper levels of

thinking. The questions can be open or closed. Evaluative questions elicit analysis at multiple levels and from diﬀerent perspectives to

arrive at newly synthesized information or conclusions.

## Conducting the Flip Interview: A Four-Step Process

Use the following framework to maximize the value of your

# conversations with recruits:

- 1. Framing

Brieﬂy describe a scenario. State upfront you are the source of

information for the scenario and ask the interviewee to drive the

next 8-12 minutes with a straightforward “How would you start this

discovery?” When they inevitably get stuck, prompt them with a branch

of the decision tree that opens the discovery further. Invite them to ask

# questions.

Interviewer evaluation: In the framing step, you evaluate how they

frame the problem. Do they take the situation at face value or probe to

get at the essence of the situation? The quality of the questions they ask should lead to determining the information they need, the eﬀort

required, and uncover the essential decision to be made. This ﬁrst step

is all about problem-ﬁnding more than problem-solving.

- 2. Linking

Once they deﬁne the problem, invite them to ask questions about

context. “Given how they framed the scenario, what other information

would they like to know to work towards a recommendation?”

Interviewer evaluation: You are looking to see if their questions lead

them to put the scenario in context. Context is king. To truly put a

situation in context, their questions should enable them to triangulate

it by looking at it in 1) absolute terms, 2) over time, and 3) relative

to what’s going on across the market, with customers or actions from

# competitors.

- 3. Interpretation

Based on the original scenario, combined with what they learned, ask,

“What is the essential decision that is needed?” or “How has their

understanding of the situation shifted?”

Interviewer evaluation: Are they able to start to formulate the

narrative? You are assessing if their narrative is a summary or a

synthesis: Summary = statement of the data; Synthesis is data +

judgment. The critical thinker will demonstrate how they can consume and synthesize diﬀerent pieces of information in parallel to arrive at a

deeper understanding of the scenario or decision needed.

- 4. Proceed

In this ﬁnal step, ask, “What are the immediate next steps you would

take?”

Interviewer evaluation: If they start to ask questions about key

stakeholders, shadow inﬂuencers, advocates, or swing voters who need

to be convinced, the candidate is thinking critically. Do they seek to

learn about headwinds and tailwinds to enable them to move forward?

Note, this is not about solving the problem or assessing if they develop

a recommendation, but simply how they approach problem-solving and

# decisions.

Using a ﬂip interview, you can evaluate the candidate’s logic and

passion for the role based on their questions. Are the questions

superﬂuous or consequential? Are the questions generic or speciﬁc?

Do they ask not only factual or convergent but also divergent and

evaluative questions? Does the candidate pivot, dive deep, and revisit a topic from diﬀerent angles? Are the questions grounded in the context

of the problem and its environment? As they ask you questions, it will

enable you to determine if they are actively listening by adjusting their

questions in real-time, pivoting, and probing.

A skilled questioner creates a cooperative dialogue to elicit new learning

through a series of questions. They engage the other person. Their

questions should lead to inferences and connections and open up

viewpoints that are not apparent. This exploration mindset encourages

trial and iteration; unexpected learning may originate from the

# discussion.

# Microsoft Changes the Interview Process

While not labeled as a ﬂip interview, a candidate applied for a job

at Microsoft in 1998 and found himself in one. During the interview,

the recruiter asked him to “Sell me a toaster.” The candidate paused.

Without missing a beat, the candidate asked several questions: “How

many people are in the family?” “Are there young children in the

house?” “What is the age range of toaster users in the family?” “Do

they live in a small space, such as an apartment or a large house?” “Are

they big breakfast eaters, or is their main meal dinner?” “How often do

they eat out?” For three minutes, it was a stream of questions about

demographics, psychographics, and physical space. The recruiter asked

the candidate to stop and asked what this had to do with selling her a

toaster. The candidate replied, “Everything.”

It is important to discover and understand the context of the “toaster

environment” to ensure I sell you what you need. If I match the toaster

features and functions to your needs, the success of the sales increases,

and you will be a satisﬁed customer. Do you need a toaster oven, a

pop-up 2-slide toaster, a 4-slice, a wide-slice toaster, a conveyor toaster,

a commercial toaster, or a convection oven? Maybe a panini press would

serve your needs best. The exercise was not about the toaster, the

recruiter was looking to see how the candidate handled ambiguity. Was

he a critical thinker? Did he dive right in with a sales pitch or pause,

pivot, and learn? In case you are wondering, the candidate got the job.

# Building a Curious Culture

Great leaders build great cultures. Great cultures are built on curiosity.

Building a team with balanced curiosity is the path to winning. A team

## with varied backgrounds further ampliﬁes the impact of the curiosity

culture by bringing diverse knowledge sets into the problem solving,

which can build upon each other. Embedding this critical competency

at the outset, starting with the interview process, will quickly enable

you to build a culture of creative thinkers. Individuals who thrive in the

ﬂip interview are continuous learners. They will seize this opportunity

— as individuals and as a dynamic team — and run with it. They

will demonstrate an innate curiosity and constantly ask “why?” or “so

# what?” and, importantly, “now what?”

Asking questions is how we are naturally wired. Eighteen months. That

is the age, according to psychologists, at which children start to seek

information. At about 36 months old, this ﬂedgling curiosity translates

into verbal questions. The questions can seem countless and random,

darting from one topic to the next seemingly indiscriminately. Why

does it rain? What is the moon made of? How do birds ﬂy? Where did the

dog go? When can we go to the park?

But this insatiable curiosity to learn by questioning often takes a pivot

when a child starts grade school. Slowly, the focus of education shifts

from asking questions to having answers. A new habit takes root as

children are asked to raise their hands if they know the answer. This

mindset — the expectation to deliver an answer rather than ask more

questions — only deepens as young people continue their education

# journey.

By the time we start working, it is instilled in us that we need to

have answers. In the work environment, the value of questioning is

frequently, largely, and wrongly overlooked. Answers are championed;

solutions are expected; more questions are implicitly discouraged. Yes,

results matter, but could those results have been more signiﬁcant

and achieved with less risk through a more intelligent allocation of

resources or with a more creative strategy? Too often, we neglect the fact

that top performers are the ones who ask questions and activate critical

thinking that can expose weaknesses in a strategy or reveal an alternate

# path.

The path back to our young, inquisitive self is short. In fact, it

depends on asking ourselves one question that links our professional

and personal lives: How do we grow? This question underpins every

project, every request, every meeting, and even where we choose to

work and live. It is rarely asked as directly as this, but the answer to

this underlying question is what shapes our careers and lives. We grow through questioning. Understanding this point creates the scaﬀolding

that helps determine how to increase personal satisfaction or the

company’s market share, grow our customer base, help increase product

usage, or drive renewals. If you seek growth, you need to stimulate

critical thinking. For that, you need powerful questions. This is the

basis for the ﬂip interview model. While we are wired from a young age to ask questions, we are rarely taught to eﬀectively develop the skill

of questioning. Too often in business, we overlook the importance of

questioning. We fail to appreciate questioning as an integral skill for

doing our jobs. We don’t invest enough time and energy in training ourselves and others to be eﬀective inquisitors.

Successful candidates in the ﬂip interview will demonstrate a critical thinking mindset. This is diﬀerent from knowing analytic tools

and methods. A critical thinking philosophy is a skill that almost

every leader seeks, and many teams have in short supply. Thinking

analytically includes being clear about the purpose of the essential

question rather than wandering in the forest of data, being inquisitive

not from a statistical perspective but questioning the initial face value,

being able to connect the dots via synthesis, and eventually being able

to tell an informed story that is based on deeper truths, judgment, and

context, not just restating the initial facts.

- • •

Reactivity, insight, and ingenuity are needed for companies to

thrive. You seek agile thinkers who can be growth champions,

## truth-tellers, customer stewards, and insight creators. The candidate

who can conceptualize the problem, frame the situation, and ask

more thoughtful questions will outperform those relying on textbook

answers. Hiring talent capable of asking thoughtful questions is the key

to building successful teams.

Finally, once you successfully recruit amazing people, you must create

an environment where employees are motivated to work collectively

yet feel valued and recognized for being curious and inquisitive. An

entire organization with a growth mindset that embraces questions and

curiosity can reframe challenges as opportunities and move more freely

to adjust to business conditions.
