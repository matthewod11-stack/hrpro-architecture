It’s no secret that our jobs can have a major impact on our lives

outside of work. Financially, mentally, and physically, our workplace

experiences can oﬀer a welcome boost — or take a signiﬁcant toll.

But what many employers don’t realize is that the eﬀects of work

aren’t limited to workers’ individual personal lives. To the contrary,

how employees spend their time at work can have substantial spillover

## eﬀects on their friends, partners, and perhaps most critically, their

# children.

To explore the impact of parents’ work on their children’s development,

my team and I conducted a longitudinal study that followed more

than 370 low-wage, working-class families over more than ten years,

## from pregnancy through their ﬁrst several years as parents. (We

intentionally focused on low-wage families, as they generally receive

far less attention in the work-family literature while facing some

of the greatest challenges.) We complemented in-home interviews

## and ﬁrst-hand observations of parent-child interactions with rigorous

## assessments and reports from parents and teachers, and through this

comprehensive analysis, we found that the children’s developmental

outcomes were directly and signiﬁcantly aﬀected by their parents’ work

# lives.

Speciﬁcally, the data showed that parents who experienced more

autonomy on the job and who had more-supportive supervisors and

coworkers were in turn warmer and more engaged when interacting

with their infants. And this has major, long-term implications for those

infants’ development, as a vast body of research has shown that warm

and responsive parenting in a child’s ﬁrst year of life boosts their level

of attachment with their parents as well as their emotional regulation,

social skills, and academic achievement. Indeed, when we checked back

in with these families years later, we consistently saw that the children

of employees who had had more-positive work experiences in their ﬁrst

years as parents had better reading and math skills, better social skills,

and fewer behavioral problems in the ﬁrst grade. Importantly, all of

these results held for both mothers and fathers: Any parent’s experience

in the workplace had a direct and measurable impact on their kids’

## development through infancy and early childhood.

For example, one father in the study — Tyson — worked for a shipping

company that mandated he use a monitor that let his boss track his

every move as he delivered packages. Tyson felt a complete lack of

trust from his company and reported feeling highly stressed, despite

being a top performer. He described how he came home from work

tired and frustrated and, as a result, he explained that “I just don’t have

the energy for a needy baby.” Conversely, Sonya was a home health

aide whose boss empowered her to manage her time independently and

asked for her input on how best to support clients. Sonya felt respected

by her supervisor, and this positivity spilled over into how she parented

her ﬁrst-grade daughter, Kaya: When Sonya returned home from work,

she was hands-on, engaged, warm, and joyful in her interactions with

So what does this mean for employers? From a corporate social

responsibility standpoint, it’s clear that if work impacts employees’

children, employers have a responsibility to ensure that the impact is

as positive as possible. And from a business standpoint, it’s also in

companies’ best ﬁnancial interests to pay attention to the eﬀects of work

on their employees’ families. After all, when workers face challenges

with their partners or kids, this stress inevitably spills over into the

workplace, leading to lower productivity, more sick days and personal

## time oﬀ, and an unhappier, less motivated workforce.

The good news is, providing working parents with the autonomy and

supportive relationships that our research shows can have such a

powerful, positive impact on children’s wellbeing is easier than one

might expect. While many people might assume that low-wage jobs are

inherently stressful, “bad” jobs, the parents we talked to described many

common sense business practices that their employers had used to help

both workers and their families thrive (despite the ﬁnancial stress that

often accompanies these low-paid jobs).

For instance, a hair stylist who participated in our study described a

time when she received a phone call at work with news that her baby

was sick and needed to be picked up right away. She still had three

clients on her schedule for the day, but her boss simply said, “Go, of

course. Go. Family comes ﬁrst. We’ll ﬁgure this out.” This simple act of

humanity and ﬂexibility didn’t cost much, but it made a big diﬀerence,

enabling a parent to care for her child in a moment of crisis.

In addition, beyond making accommodations or oﬀering increased

ﬂexibility, employers can also take steps to ensure work itself is

a positive experience. Another worker we talked to, Linda, was a

shipment packer at a candle manufacturing plant. Her boss discovered

that without prompting, she had begun inserting notes and sample

candle scents in the packages she prepared for her clients. Her boss

hadn’t asked her to do this, and she hadn’t gotten approval to include

these extras in the packages — but her customers appreciated it so much

that they began asking for Linda by name when placing their orders.

In response, rather than ignoring the issue, or worse yet, punishing

Linda for failing to follow standard shipping procedures, her boss asked

her to train her coworkers in her unique approach to customer service,

and gave her an award for innovation along with a promotion. Linda

felt respected and supported, and she described how rather than being

a drain, “work had become fun.” This in turn enabled Linda to come

home feeling upbeat and positive (rather than exhausted and depleted),

with enough energy to fully engage in parenting her infant son.

When it comes to promoting workers’ physical and mental health,

organizations tend to focus on high-level policy changes such as

ﬂexible scheduling options, more paid leave, etc. And to be sure, these

systemic initiatives are certainly important. But our research suggests

that ensuring workers feel respected and supported in their day-to-

day is often just as critical. That means teaching and empowering

supervisors to support parents, ﬁnding creative ways to give workers

more autonomy, and helping managers and workers alike develop

their communication skills. For example, there were supervisors in

my studies who were so disconnected from their employees’ lives that

they weren’t even aware that some of their male workers had become

parents. Healthy organizations give employees the time and space to

share their experiences and ideas, whether that’s through anonymous

## surveys, lunchtime focus groups, or even just informal check-ins. After

all, it is often employees themselves who have the best solutions to the

work-family challenges they are facing — they simply need to be asked.

Ultimately, to build a truly healthy and sustainable workplace,

employers must expand their deﬁnition of ROI to include returns not

just for themselves or their employees, but for employees’ children,

families, neighborhoods, and entire communities. How companies treat

their workers today will determine how the next generation grows up

tomorrow, and it’s up to all of us to invest in our shared future. That

means building workplaces that value the wellbeing of working parents

# — and that of their kids, too.
