While I was supporting the USA women’s volleyball team as a

## performance psychologist during the 2012 London Olympics, Nicole

Davis, a key member of the team, opened up about the relentless

feedback system that governed her every move as an Olympian: “For

eight years, every ball I’ve touched or didn’t touch, every decision

I made on the court, every hour I showed up in the gym has been

observed and statted. It has been transformed into a measure of my

progress, and my potential to stand on the Olympic podium.” Her life

was a proverbial ﬁshbowl.

This feedback wasn’t conﬁned to the physical aspects of the game.

## Nicole’s diet, sleep schedule, mental health, and even her leisure

activities were viewed through the prism of their potential impact on

her performance. The concept of a “day oﬀ” became alien. Rest days

were strategic, not a respite. Her vacations were often more about

recovery and mental health than about leisure or exploration. Nicole,

who is now my colleague as a mindset coach at Finding Mastery, says

the omnipresent pressure to maintain and exceed her performance

standards meant that every life choice she made needed to contribute

# towards her goal of Olympic success.

Living under the weight of constant scrutiny and comparison teaches

these athletes not only how to excel in their sport but also how to

eﬀectively harness feedback for continuous improvement. Learning to

discern which feedback to embrace and which to ﬁlter out becomes

essential for not just surviving, but for thriving — and those lessons are

# equally applicable to all of us.

# Why Feedback Is So Hard to Receive

For most of us, feedback is hard to receive because when self-worth is

tied to performance outcomes, it feels like a direct threat to our identity,

as opposed to rich information about how to get better. Our identity is

often narrowly tied to how we perform in a given domain.

To protect ourselves, we often instinctively dismiss or minimize this

feedback, but in doing so, we miss valuable insights that could help

us grow and improve. Instead of focusing on progress and actively

pursuing our goals, we become preoccupied with avoiding failure,

which ultimately hinders our ability to achieve the success we desire.

Lost in the defensive response is the recognition that the feedback is

## really about the behavior, not the person.

# How Olympians Manage Feedback

I’ve had the privilege of working with teams across the past four

## Olympic Games, most recently in Paris with beach volleyball silver

## medalists Brandie Wilkerson and Melissa Humana-Paredes, and

identiﬁed several feedback strategies that translate from the Olympic

# arena to the business world.

Build a circle of advisors whose feedback you trust.

The foundation of an Olympian feedback strategy is to make a

commitment to getting better each day. Let improvement be your North

Star, guiding every action and decision.

Olympians recognize the beneﬁt of having a team who can see their

blind spots, hold them accountable, construct their practices and

habits, and focus their eﬀorts. To build a team that can provide clear,

honest, and kind feedback about how you can get better, identify that

small handful of people whose counsel you trust. They could be family

members, friends, colleagues, mentors, or experts. Keep the list small.

Make sure that each person is committed to supporting and protecting

# you.

Ask yourself: Who has your back? Who really gets you, not just the

reﬁned and packaged you, but the straining, striving, and vulnerable

version of you that’s trying to ﬁgure out life as you go? Who has ﬁdelity

to the truth? Who can you count on to be honest with you? Who has

lived a life that you respect?

# Separate useful feedback from opinions.

Opinion and feedback may appear similar, but opinions primarily

reﬂect the thoughts and perspectives of the giver, while feedback is

designed to beneﬁt and guide the receiver.

Opinions reﬂect individual viewpoints, shared to convey personal

thoughts or feelings, and they’re are often unsolicited. In contrast,

feedback is speciﬁc, based on close observation, actionable, and given to

## promote growth, typically in response to a request.

When I worked with the Seattle Seahawks, we used to operate under the

maxim that “we know” the truth about what’s happening on our team.

The outside world — the media and the fans — would throw things

out there, and some may have hit a nerve every once in a while, but

they were sharing opinions, not actionable feedback. Olympians are no

diﬀerent. They tune in to the feedback of those who know them — and

the rest becomes noise.

Manage your emotional response.

Beyond your trusted circle, you are your own next best feedback loop.

You are a better tuning fork than most people around you because

only you know whether your thoughts, emotions, and physiology are

working in harmony or dissonance. This awareness allows you to detect

subtle shifts in your mental and physical state, providing immediate

and accurate feedback on what is and isn’t working.

Emotions can distract and obscure the lessons embedded in your

challenges and setbacks. To unlock the valuable information within

your experiences, like Olympians you can learn to manage your

# emotions eﬀectively.

Pay attention to what triggers your feelings and how they aﬀect your

thoughts and actions. When you encounter strong emotions, take a

moment to pause and reﬂect. Instead of reacting impulsively, consider

what the emotion is signaling and how it relates to the situation at hand.

Shift your focus from the emotional turmoil (the noise) to the insights

within the experience (the signal). Ask yourself what went wrong, what

could be improved, and what insights can be learned.

Commit to applying the useful feedback you receive.

## Olympians meticulously incorporate suggestions into their training

regimens and strive to make tangible changes, setting a high standard

for how to eﬀectively use feedback. This commitment to action is what

often distinguishes elite performers from others.

Most people might acknowledge feedback, recognizing its value and

even expressing intentions to change. However, they often fall short

in the consistent implementation of that feedback. This gap between

intention and action can stem from various factors, including a lack of a clear plan, insuﬃcient motivation, or the discomfort of changing

established habits.

To bridge this gap, develop a systematic approach to incorporating

feedback. Outline speciﬁc steps to integrate the feedback into your

routine. Keep a record of your eﬀorts and improvements. Regularly

review your progress to see how well you are incorporating the

feedback. Make it a regular part of your routine, rather than a one-time

eﬀort. If something isn’t working as expected, be willing to adjust your

# approach.

. . .

With an Olympian feedback strategy in place, you don’t have to evaluate

each piece of feedback that ﬂoods in. Recognizing the diﬀerence

between critique aimed to tear you down and guidance meant to build

you up consumes a lot of internal resources.

So, as we navigate through our lives, let’s apply this Olympian mindset.

Let’s be selective about the feedback we internalize and use it as a

tool for personal and professional development. Let’s remember to

separate what we do from who we are, ensuring that while we strive

for excellence in our daily lives, we remain grounded in our inherent

worth. This approach doesn’t just prepare us for the next competition or
