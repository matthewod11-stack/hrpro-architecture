Much has been written about common leadership styles and how

to identify the right style for you, whether it’s transactional or

transformational, bureaucratic or laissez-faire. But according to Daniel

Goleman, a psychologist best known for his work on emotional

intelligence, “Being a great leader means recognizing that diﬀerent

circumstances may call for diﬀerent approaches.”

# HBR / Digital Article / 6 Common Leadership Styles — and How to Decide Which to Us…

Drawing on research and experience, Goleman has identiﬁed six

distinct leadership styles that managers can adapt, depending on the

situations and the needs of their team members. He ﬁrst introduced these styles in his 2000 Harvard Business Review article, “Leadership

That Gets Results,” and they have since been widely recognized as an

essential framework for eﬀective leadership. The six leadership styles

# include:

- Coercive leadership style, which entails demanding immediate

# compliance.

- Authoritative leadership style, which is about mobilizing people

# toward a vision.

- Pacesetting leadership style, which involves expecting excellence and

# self-direction.

- Aﬃliative leadership style, which centers around building emotional

# bonds.

- Democratic leadership style, which involves creating consensus.

- Coaching leadership style, which focuses on developing people for the

# future.

Though the world has changed over the past two decades, these

leadership styles remain relevant. Mastering them will help you

navigate the complexities of diﬀerent situations, boost morale, and

drive your team’s long-term growth.

With that in mind, here’s a closer look at each of the six leadership styles

— and when to use them — updated for today’s business landscape.

# The Six Types of Leadership Styles

- 1. Coercive leadership style

Of all the leadership styles, coercive is the least eﬀective in most situations, according to Goleman. It’s not diﬃcult to understand

why. This style is characterized by top-down decision making, an

## authoritarian approach, and a demanding, do-what-I-say attitude, he

says. While this style may yield short-term results, it has a corrosive

long-term impact on the company culture, leading to high employee

turnover and a disillusioned, disengaged workforce.

When to use the coercive leadership style

This command-and-control leadership style may work in certain crisis

## situations where swift, decisive action and a clear chain of command

are needed: a corporate takeover or in an emergency room, for instance.

In most cases, though, this approach is likely to be detrimental, says

# Goleman.

- 2. Authoritative leadership style

The authoritative leadership style, not to be confused with authoritarian

leadership, involves motivating your team members by connecting

their work to a larger organizational strategy, helping them understand

how their day-to-day tasks contribute to a greater purpose. It’s about

setting clear guidelines; not micromanaging. It’s also about trusting

your staﬀ members to work towards the shared vision with autonomy

and creativity, which creates high employee engagement and increased

job satisfaction. If coercive is the worst kind of leadership, authoritative

## shines as the most eﬀective and inspiring style.

When to use the authoritative leadership style

This leadership style is beneﬁcial in lots of situations, and it’s

## particularly useful during times of change or uncertainty. It can

also be integrated into daily operations by reminding your team

members of your company’s mission in an organic way. For example,

a pharmaceutical executive might say, “Our work will beneﬁt many

patients,” while an insurance leader might say, “We’re helping people

secure their future.” These reminders make the organization’s goals and

## mission tangible and meaningful for the team.

- 3. Pacesetting leadership style

This leadership style involves holding yourself and others to high

standards. While striving for excellence is admirable, the pacesetting

approach backﬁres if the focus is on failures rather than successes. The

constant push for productivity and results can also create a pressure-

cooker work environment, says Goleman.

The extreme focus on perfection can also make it diﬃcult for employees

to see how their individual eﬀorts ﬁt into the bigger picture, which

can lead to increased turnover. “If your best people are leaving because

you’re alienating them or stressing them out, then you’re not acting in

the long-term interests of your organization,” he says.

When to use the pacesetting leadership style

Although this style should be used infrequently, it can work in

certain circumstances where your employees are highly motivated and

exceedingly competent. It may suit specialized groups, like R&D or legal

teams, for instance. But even in these cases, it’s important to balance

pacesetting with other approaches to avoid consequences like employee

# burnout.

- 4. Afﬁliative leadership style

This leadership style involves building strong emotional bonds, creating

a sense of camaraderie and team spirit, and fostering a positive

and supportive workplace. This helps team members feel like they

## belong, can freely share ideas and feedback, and work together towards

# common goals.

According to Goleman, this relationship-oriented style is especially

valuable in shaping a positive work environment, which is particularly

important at a time when some companies are calling employees back to the oﬃce. You can create a caring, cohesive community rather than

an administrative machine by getting to know your employees on a

personal level and celebrating their wins, he says.

When to use the aﬃliative leadership style

This style builds connections and creates a positive company

culture, but it should not be used in isolation. It may not provide suﬃcient feedback to address performance issues or deal with

complex challenges. Combining this approach with the inspirational,

authoritative style creates more balance by oﬀering both support and

# direction.

- 5. Democratic leadership style

The democratic leadership style involves empowering your team to have

a voice in decision-making. By taking the time to gather input, listen to

concerns and diverse perspectives, and incorporate feedback, you show

your team members that their opinions matter, their voices are heard,

and their contributions are valued. This gives them a sense of ownership

# and responsibility.

When to use the democratic leadership style

This style is ideal when you’re unsure about the best course of action

and want to generate ideas. But it’s not a good strategy when your team

members lack experience or information, or in times of crisis.

- 6. Coaching leadership style

The coaching style is focused on individual growth, and involves

dedicating time to understand your team members’ long-term goals,

both for their personal and professional development. “Asking

questions like, ‘What do you want from your life, your career, this job?

And, how can I help you?’ encourages your employees to reﬂect on their

aspirations and work towards achieving them,” says Goleman. By taking

a genuine interest in their development, you help your employees feel

valued and motivated.

When to use the coaching leadership style

This style is especially useful during one-on-one performance

evaluations, but you can also slip it into everyday conversations, he

says. A leader in coach-mode might say, “You’re great at XYZ, but when

you do ABC, it doesn’t work as well because of these reasons. Have you

considered trying this other approach instead?” This real-time feedback

helps employees grow and learn, rather than letting potential problems

# linger.

## How to Adapt Your Leadership Style to Fit the Situation You’re In

Research suggests that the most eﬀective leaders adapt their style

to diﬀerent circumstances — be it a change in setting, a shift in

organizational dynamics, or a turn in the business cycle. That’s why

you need to stay attuned to your environment, understand your impact

on others, and adjust your approach accordingly.

As Goleman writes in his 2000 article, “The most eﬀective leaders

switch ﬂexibly among the leadership styles as needed…[They] don’t

mechanically match their style to ﬁt a checklist of situations — they

are far more ﬂuid. They are exquisitely sensitive to the impact they

are having on others and seamlessly adjust their style to get the best

# results.”

This is how switching styles looks in real life: When launching a new

project, you would use an authoritative style where clear direction and

a compelling vision are needed to bring the team together and inspire

people toward a common goal. You would switch to a coaching style

when an employee is struggling with a certain task and you need to

help them learn a new skill. And you would employ a pacesetting style

when your team of driven and experienced employees needs to meet a

challenging deadline.

But what if you feel like you’re not equipped to take on a new and

diﬀerent leadership style — let alone more than one?

Goleman says that anyone can expand their range of leadership

styles through dedicated practice and repetition. He also recommends

focusing on growing your emotional intelligence, “To expand [their

style repertories], leaders must ﬁrst understand which emotional

intelligence competencies underlie the leadership styles they are

lacking,” he writes in his 2000 HBR article. “They can then

work assiduously to increase their quotient of them. For instance, an aﬃliative leader has strengths in three emotional intelligence

competencies: in empathy, in building relationships, and in

communication… Such advice about adding capabilities may seem

simplistic — ‘Go change yourself’ — but enhancing emotional

intelligence is entirely possible with practice.”

. . .

The good news is that personality is not destiny. Even if you’re naturally

introverted or you tend to be driven by data and analysis rather than

emotion, you can still learn how to adapt diﬀerent leadership styles to

organize, motivate, and direct your team.

“A leader’s success depends on the productivity and eﬀectiveness of the

people who work for them,” Goleman says. “You’re shooting yourself in

the foot if you use a style of leadership that’s counterproductive to their

# performance.”
