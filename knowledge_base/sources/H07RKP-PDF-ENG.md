While trust is taking top billing in many discussions about generative

AI’s design and uses, it’s also important to bring inclusivity and

accessibility into the thick of things early on. That means ensuring that

individuals with disabilities themselves play an active role in shaping

the technology’s evolution, particularly as it pertains to opening job

opportunities and carrying out tasks. The beneﬁts of doing so will lift

your company and society. In this article, I explain those beneﬁts and

oﬀer some essential guidelines to building inclusivity into the design of

# this technology.

# The Potential

Generative AI augments human capability. It can draw from anything

that is conveyed through language. Our research suggests that in the

coming years up to 40% of the time people spend working could be

assisted by AI that understands language and can converse with its

users. In my own life, living with multiple sclerosis, I can already see the

potential of what such a “copilot” could oﬀer those of us working and

living with disabilities — whether ﬁnding and securing employment,

providing information to help us interpret situations more accurately,

or, similarly, oﬀering guidance as we take part in varied tasks that

# involve language.

An estimated 386 million working age people have some kind of

disability; in some countries, despite persistent labor shortages,

unemployment has reached 80% among people with disabilities who

could otherwise work. Generative AI can help individuals ﬁnd —

and do well in — jobs that they couldn’t previously have held. For

example, OurAbility provides an AI-powered platform that utilizes

chatbot technology to assist unemployed individuals in ﬁnding and

securing employment opportunities.

There are many more people with disabilities who are employed than

employers know about. Our analysis (published earlier in HBR) showed

that 76% of employees with disabilities had not fully disclosed their

unique experiences at work (to colleagues, human resources contacts,

or supervisors/managers). At the executive level, the number was

## even greater, with 80% of C-suite leaders and their direct reports

concealing disabilities at work. Regardless of whether individuals

have disclosed their disabilities to their employers, personalized

generative AI-powered services can enhance their contributions to the

# organization.

# The Challenge

The problem is that getting this right isn’t easy. There just isn’t a

good track record to build on. We haven’t done well as a society with

the digital divide that exacerbates the barriers between persons with

## disabilities (as well as other marginalized communities) and others.

There are one billion of us with disabilities in the world. And right now,

less than 3% of the top one million websites in the world oﬀer a fully

accessible experience. And when you broaden the lens to consider the

rapid proliferation of generative AI tools, the picture doesn’t improve.

There’s also a very real risk that if companies are racing to get

“ﬁrst mover” status in this space, they may overlook the lessons

they (hopefully) have learned about accessibility and inclusivity with

previous technologies. That could be costly. According to the Centre for

Inclusive Design, “the relative cost of retroﬁtting a product or service to

become inclusive will increase signiﬁcantly over time and can reach up

to 10,000 times the cost of making it inclusive by design.” A far better

alternative would be to apply the lessons learned so far as broadly and

# as quickly as possible.

# How Companies Can Get This Right

Start with the people who are designing the human-computer

interactions that involve generative AI. Improve their knowledge of

inclusive, human-centric design principles that take persons with

disabilities into account. Remember that disability is highly nuanced

and diverse and user research should be conducted with that in mind.

By working alongside and collecting feedback from individuals with

various types of disabilities and who are neurodivergent, you can ensure

# optimal, accessible experiences for all.

Then consider the following list of basic requirements for inclusive

# interfaces:

# Keyboard Navigation

Assess all functionalities of the chatbot, including menus, options, and

buttons based on WCAG fundamentals for keyboard compatibility. Ask:

What design elements would make these accessible to most? What add-

ons can be personalized for others? One example of such an add-on is

ChatGPT Let’s Talk, a Chrome extension that adds keyboard shortcuts

to the interface, which allows users to talk to and hear AI-generated

# responses in the site.

# Alternative Text

Provide contextual descriptions so that visually impaired users who are

using an audio interface with a generative AI tool such as ChatGPT

can more fully understand the content. For example, Microsoft’s Bot

Framework for developers provides guidelines and features that support

# the inclusion of alternative text.

# Voice-Enabled Interface/Speech-to-Text

## Integrate voice-enabled interfaces that enable individuals with a broad

## range of disabilities (e.g., mobility or motor, visual, cognitive, physical

disabilities) to interact with generative AI. For instance, Google’s

Dialogﬂow has built-in integration with Google Cloud Speech-to-Text

API, allowing developers to create chatbots that support voice-enabled

# input.

# Text/Image-to-Speech

## Include accessibility features such as image or text-to-speech

technology to support people with dyslexia or vision or motor

## impairments. One example is Be My Eyes Virtual Volunteer. Powered by

OpenAI’s GPT-4 language model, it allows users to send images via the

app to an AI-powered Virtual Volunteer, which will answer any question

about that image and provide instantaneous visual assistance for a wide

# variety of tasks.

## Color Contrast, Dyslexia-Friendly Fonts, and Clear Language

Use a high-contrast design of the interface so visually impaired users

can diﬀerentiate among elements. People with dyslexia will beneﬁt

## from the improved readability of text and the enhanced user experience

when you use a plug-in like Dyslexie Font. In addition, it’s important

to use clear and concise language in how to use the chatbot and in the

chatbot’s responses (in the languages provided) to enable users with

cognitive disabilities to understand the conversation easily.

The rewards of designing for accessibility and inclusivity are signiﬁcant.

As an individual living with multiple sclerosis, I have experienced eﬀects that include cognitive diﬃculties such as trouble with memory

## and concentration. In such moments, AI-powered tools such as

ChatGPT are invaluable to communicate eﬀectively and access information eﬃciently. It becomes a supportive companion whether I

need help organizing my thoughts or retrieving vital details. Its iterative

and responsive nature helps me navigate through moments of cognitive

uncertainty, or “brain fog,” assisting me to fully engage in conversations

and tasks that would otherwise be overwhelming. It helps me maintain

my productivity and independence, and ultimately it enhances my

overall well-being despite the challenges posed by my condition.

With regular testing and improvement to ensure that your interfaces

## comply with the latest Web Content Accessibility Guidelines, those

beneﬁts will only grow. These guidelines are set, reviewed, and updated

## by the World Wide Web Consortium, a nonproﬁt, global, multi-sector

community founded in 1994. Interestingly, chatGPT-powered platforms
