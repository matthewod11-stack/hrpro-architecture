## Humility at the Top Inspires Others to Lead

When executives acknowledge mistakes, give credit to their teams, or

engage in other humble behaviors, it helps build a culture of trust. Now

new research shows that it can also ignite employees’ desire to become

# leaders themselves.

In a ﬁeld study 216 pairs of supervisors and employees in China ﬁlled

out three sets of surveys, each a few weeks apart. The employees rated

how willing their supervisors were to admit mistakes, how open they

seemed to feedback, and how much they appeared to value their staﬀ’s

contributions in the previous weeks. The employees also noted how

strong their own desire for growth and achievement was and how highly

regarded they felt in their organizations. The supervisors, meanwhile,

rated how motivated each employee was to lead and how often that

person took charge of a project or situation.

The researchers found that the more supervisors exhibited humility,

the more highly regarded their employees felt, which in turn increased

their leadership ambitions. The eﬀect was especially strong among

highly individualistic employees, who prioritize personal uniqueness

and growth (in contrast to collectivist employees, who prioritize group

# harmony over personal recognition).

To see whether these ﬁndings held true in Western cultures, which

tend to have a higher concentration of individualistic workers, the

researchers conducted a follow-up survey with 210 participants in

## Australia, Canada, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United

States. They found the same pattern: Humble leaders made others want

to lead.

“Behaviors [that exhibit] self-awareness, appreciation of others’

## contributions, and teachability…signal respect and recognition,” which

can help employees gain the conﬁdence that they have what it takes to

lead, the researchers write.

## Rudeness at Work Silences Women More Than Men

Disrespectful behavior on the job—like shooting someone’s idea down

hastily or interrupting a colleague who’s speaking—might not be

malicious. But a new study found that it can have a major impact on

women’s willingness to speak up.

Researchers ran an online experiment with 654 participants from

the United States, United Kingdom, and Canada. They told the

participants they would each work for a few minutes with a group in

an online chatroom to come up with a creative name for a product.

Unbeknownst to the participants, the other group members’ comments

were preprogrammed responses created by the researchers. Half the

participants received responses to their ideas that were civil. The other

half received rude responses, such as, “Umm…that actually sounds

really boring. Why don’t we suggest something fun?” The rude remarks

appeared to come from both male and female colleagues.

The participants then were told to imagine they worked at a company

with the same group. The researchers asked how comfortable they’d

feel voicing new ideas or concerns, how likely they thought they’d be to

experience backlash to a bad idea, and whether they’d withhold insights

in the future. Men and women in the polite group were equally willing

to share new ideas and anticipated little backlash. But in the uncivil

group, women were signiﬁcantly less at ease sharing their thoughts,

more likely to anticipate hostile reactions to weak ideas, and more likely

to say they’d keep their insights or concerns to themselves.

The researchers obtained similar ﬁndings in a follow-up survey

with 2,528 participants from the United States, the United Kingdom,

and Canada, who were asked to report the levels of incivility they

experienced in their actual workplaces and to rate their willingness to

# share ideas.

Women are disproportionately impacted by rudeness because it signals

a high likelihood that they’ll be punished socially for behavior deemed

inappropriate to their gender—like speaking up, asserting an opinion,

or disagreeing with someone else’s analysis, say the study’s authors.

Managers who want to beneﬁt from the diverse insights of their staﬀ

must make sure they’re creating respectful environments free of even

# mundane kinds of incivility.

## To Motivate Workers, Reward Them for “Streaks”

If your employees struggle to persist at challenging or tedious projects,

oﬀering them incentives for maintaining streaks on the job can help

# them, new research shows.

## Across six experiments with with 4,504 U.S. participants, researchers

tested whether gradually increasing incentives for consecutive work

encouraged them to complete more tasks. In one study the researchers

asked 999 people to imagine that they worked for a food delivery service

and were tired after delivering many items that day. The participants

in one group were told that they’d receive a stable bonus (1.25 times

their usual rate) for every additional delivery they made. People in the

other group were told that their bonus would increase with additional

deliveries (1.15 times for one more, 1.20 for two, and 1.25 for the third

and any subsequent delivery after that). When asked to predict how

many extra deliveries they’d make before taking a break, participants

in the second group said they’d make signiﬁcantly more deliveries than

those in the stable bonus condition did.

In another experiment the researchers gave 423 participants the option

of decoding CAPTCHA images for small amounts of money or watching

funny videos for no money. Half the participants were oﬀered a stable

incentive for decoding each CAPTCHA. The other half were oﬀered

increasing incentives, but if they took a break and watched a video, their

reward would reset to a low rate and they’d have to build it up again.

The researchers then asked the participants how committed they felt

to the goal of maximizing their earnings and recorded how many tasks

they chose to complete before taking a break. Those in the increasing

incentives condition completed the most tasks, took the fewest breaks,

and reported the highest level of commitment to their goal.

Whether managers are trying to persuade workers to make more sales

calls, input more lines of code, or learn a new but challenging skill,

increasing incentives can be a useful way to help people forge on despite

boredom or fatigue, the researchers write.

## Apologies Can Be Good for the Bottom Line

Companies often send emails apologizing for things like customer

service snafus or mistaken information in prior messages. But does

saying you’re sorry have any impact on how customers feel about your

# brand?

Researchers conducted four studies to determine whether apologizing

## for a trivial mistake by email leads to more-favorable customer

evaluations than not apologizing for it. In one study the researchers

partnered with Sacha, a large footwear company that operates in

Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, and the Netherlands and has a strong

online presence. Sacha sent out two versions of an email campaign:

In one the subject line was “sorry” and in the other it was “good

## news.” Except for that diﬀerence, the content and length of both email

campaigns were identical.

More customers opened the email with an apology in the subject line

(38%) than the one touting good news (29%), which admitted the

error but didn’t apologize for it. More customers also clicked on links

in the email with an apology header (5.29%) than in the one with

the good-news subject line (4.67%). And ﬁnally, the apology email

generated dramatically more revenue (€628.74) than the good-news

email (€277.13).

# HBR / Digital Article / Research Roundup: Humility at the Top, Motivating Your Staff, R…

Across the four studies, the researchers determined that when

companies express regret for minor errors, it makes customers feel

more positively toward them. It increases the perceived warmth of

the company without making it seem less competent. However, if a

company is already seen as very warm, apologizing for small mistakes

doesn’t have as much impact.

The researchers suggest it may be beneﬁcial for companies to precede

## email oﬀers of incentives with an apology for a trivial mistake. But

they should be careful about the nature of the slip-ups they disclose.

Apologizing for signiﬁcant mistakes doesn’t improve perceived warmth

and can reduce perceived competence, leading to negative attitudes

toward a company, the authors write.

# People Dislike Pushy Referrals

Your company has probably sent thousands of messages urging

customers to recommend your product to their friends. But have you

stopped to test whether any of them actually get results?

In 2022 researchers conducted four studies involving 61,401 Chinese

consumers to investigate how the language used in referral messages

aﬀected consumer participation in referral reward programs. In one of

them the researchers created two types of SMS text referral messages:

an assertive message and a less assertive message. Each customer was

randomly asked to share one of the two messages. The researchers

tracked how many customers clicked on the link in the text to view the

referral-program details and how many then sent the message to their

# friends.

Almost 11% of the customers clicked on the link. Among that group,

0.94% of customers shared the assertive message, and 1.6% shared the

# less assertive message.

To counteract some of the resistance customers may have to assertive

language, the researchers recommend highlighting product beneﬁts

in referral messages. In a related study researchers recruited 499

participants and asked them to imagine that they had recently

purchased and were satisﬁed with a product called Herbal Tea.

The researchers created two types of referral messages: One was

assertive (“You must try Herbal Tea! Nice product, you must try

it!”), and one was less assertive (“It’s worth trying Herbal Tea. Nice

product, it’s worth trying”). In addition, they crafted two versions

of the product description: one emphasizing a positive attribute

## (“Herbal Tea for Improving Your Brain Power!”) and a control (“Herbal

Tea”). Participants were randomly assigned to one of four groups:

assertive message with the beneﬁt highlighted, assertive message

## with the control description, less assertive message with the beneﬁt

highlighted, and less assertive message with the control description.

The participants then rated their likelihood of referring the product on a

# scale from one to three.

The researchers found that participants were less likely to refer the

product when the message was assertive. However, when the beneﬁt

of the product was highlighted, participants were more likely to make

## a referral, regardless of the assertiveness of the message. Though the

likelihood was still lower with an assertive message than with a less

assertive one when the beneﬁts was highlighted, the negative eﬀect of

an assertive tone was mitigated.

## When Suppliers Sell Direct to Consumers, Relations with Retailers Suffer

When a supplier launches its own consumer-facing website, how do its

retail partners respond? A new study suggests that they disengage from

# the supplier.

# HBR / Digital Article / Research Roundup: Humility at the Top, Motivating Your Staff, R…

Researchers examined the ordering behavior of 2,625 French, Spanish,

## and UK retailers after their supplier—a large German toy company—

launched online shops in France and the United Kingdom. (The Spanish

retailers were analyzed as a control group.) The researchers found that

in the following months, the UK and French retailers reduced their

orders by 19%, on average, and paid 21% higher wholesale prices. This

suggests that they were no longer invested in their relationship with the

supplier—that they’d stopped negotiating for better prices and stocking

a wide range of items. The UK and French retailers also pivoted toward

the supplier’s more popular items—indicating that they continued to

stock what they knew would sell but no longer took risks on the rest of

# the company’s product lines.

Not all retailers disengaged to the same degree, however. The

researchers determined that large retailers reduced their orders

substantially less than small retailers did. A survey of 138 of the original

2,625 retailers revealed that when retailers are large and powerful,

they’re less likely to perceive the launch of a supplier’s online shop as

a competitive threat and retaliate only minimally compared with small

# retailers.

Suppliers contemplating changes to their distribution strategies should

consider how they might aﬀect retailers of diﬀerent sizes, the

researchers write. While relationships with large retailers may not suﬀer

much, they contend, suppliers who want to stay on good terms with

small customers should think about oﬀering them lower wholesale

prices or products that are diﬀerent from those sold on their direct-to-

# consumer sites.

## Search Engines Don’t Change Your Views—They Reinforce Them

Despite what you might think, looking up information online is unlikely

to alter people’s opinions of things. That’s because your preexisting

beliefs have a major impact on the results you get from search engines

like Google or Bing. If you believe caﬀeine is unhealthful, for example,

you’ll tend to use search terms like “risks of caﬀeine.” If you think

nuclear energy is good, you’ll be likely to query the “beneﬁts of nuclear

energy.” Because search algorithms surface the answers most relevant

to the terms you type, the results typically conﬁrm what you thought in

the ﬁrst place. And that makes it harder for people to discover broader

perspectives and learn, according to the authors of 21 global studies.

Beginning in 2020 researchers asked nearly 10,000 people to search

## on Google, Bing, and custom-built search engines and chatbots that

were designed to test speciﬁc interventions. In 2023 they added gen

AI tools like ChatGPT—which people are increasingly using instead of

traditional engines—to the experiments. Analyzing searches across a

variety of subjects, they observed that prior beliefs tended to persist

after a search, mostly because of people’s tendency to base search

terms on those beliefs. However, in one of the studies the researchers

developed a custom search engine designed to provide people with a

broader set of information. They recruited 1,002 participants to test

whether its results reduced the eﬀects of narrow, biased searches. The

subjects ﬁrst read a passage about the debate over whether younger or

older people make better leaders, which focused on people’s cognitive

abilities. Then they were instructed to use the search engine to explore

the relationship between mental acuity and age. The search engine,

without the participants’ knowledge, displayed one of two sets of

10 search results: The ﬁrst was based on the participant-generated

term, and the second was broader, combining multiple perspectives.

Participants reviewed the results, rated their beliefs about how age

aﬀects thinking ability, and evaluated the usefulness and relevance of

the search results. The study found that the people who were shown

balanced search results were much less likely to believe that age was an

important factor in how a well a leader thinks than participants shown

results based on their own search terms were.

Companies hoping to turn their own search engines or gen AI chatbots

into unbiased information sources should consider several ﬁxes.

Providing people a more-diverse set of results may help, the research

indicates. But the authors also suggest that companies program their

search and AI algorithms to mitigate conﬁrmation bias, promote new

thinking, and foster more broadly informed decision-making.
