Perhaps in response to the critique that corporate eﬀorts to achieve

diversity, equity, and inclusion are all talk and no action, an increasing

number of companies are taking the matter of diagnosing and resolving

inequities more seriously. According to a recent survey, more than 40%

have either already conducted a DEI survey or audit or are looking to do

# so “in the near future.”

But in my own work as a DEI practitioner who often administers,

analyzes, and helps companies act on these kinds of assessments,

arriving at data-driven insights is only the tip of the iceberg. The

far harder challenge is addressing organizational inequities without

incurring backlash: strong adverse reactions from individuals and

groups that undermine or compromise the positive outcomes DEI

initiatives try to create.

Mandatory DEI trainings have been linked to lower levels of

## representation in leadership positions for Black, Latine, and Asian

employees of all genders, and white women, due to resistance

from existing leaders. Backlash is well-documented in response to organizational equity eﬀorts like aﬃrmative action policies, as well as

broader equity-related social movements. In what has since been called

the “#MeToo Backlash,” a 2019 survey following up on the impact of

the #MeToo movement found that 19% of men were less willing to

hire attractive women, 21% were less willing to hire women for jobs

involving close interpersonal interactions, and 27% now avoided one-

# on-one meetings with female colleagues.

It isn’t only people from privileged groups that contribute to backlash,

either. When the “diversity” of candidates is mentioned as a reason

## for their hiring, people rate the qualiﬁcations and skill of a candidate

from a marginalized group lower — even if they themselves are from

that same group. And when marginalized employees are presented

with a “business case for diversity,” espousing the beneﬁts of diversity

on business outcomes, they respond by reporting a lower sense of

belonging and less interest in joining the organization.

Why is backlash such a large risk when DEI initiatives are put into

## practice, especially when the vast majority of workers express support

for DEI in the abstract? Because people are strongly motivated to protect

## their own sense of self-esteem, competence, and “inherent goodness.”

When any of these things are challenged, their gut reaction is to resist

and reject. If people are told that their language and interactions are

biased, that constitutes a challenge to their self-esteem. If people are

told that “diversity” and not “skill” played a role in their hiring, or that

favoritism played a role in their promotion, that constitutes a challenge

to their sense of competence. If people are criticized for being a member

of a social group that has negative associations, that constitutes a

challenge to “inherent goodness.” Regardless of how true any of these

assertions are, these framings run a high risk of resistance, rejection,

# and backlash.

One powerful method to avoid backlash is by framing DEI initiatives

to address inequities as changing systems, rather than changing

individuals. By situating an organizational inequity in something less

## “personal” than an individual or group, like a process, policy, or

normalized set of practices, leaders can galvanize the workforce while

lowering the risk that people feel personally targeted. Here are some

examples of this approach in action, compared to framings that risk

activating backlash.

Backlash risk: “Biased hiring managers are only bringing in candidates

that look like themselves, which is why we have little racial or gender

diversity. To address this, we should have all hiring managers go

through training to address their biases.”

Systems framing: “The hiring process doesn’t have consistent

guidelines or expectations, putting additional burden on hiring

managers, creating an inconsistent experience for candidates, and making it diﬃcult to connect our organizational strategy to our hiring

strategy. To address this, we should create initiatives to support hiring

managers, like implementing hiring panels, tracking the overall race

and gender makeup of the candidate pool through each stage, and

coming together to agree on how to make decisions fairly based on

# resumes and interviews.”

Backlash risk: “Employees with disabilities and those who are

neurodivergent aren’t able to navigate the workplace as well as their

non-disabled or neurotypical peers. To address this, we should give

disabled and neurodivergent employees coaches and run a campaign to

help all employees build empathy for these experiences.”

Systems framing: “The employee experience is built around narrow

assumptions about the ‘ideal’ employee that no longer hold true for

our current workforce, which, among other things, is more disabled

and neurodivergent than the workforce of the past. To address this, we

should revisit employee onboarding, job design, and the manager-direct

report experience to be more accessible, then integrate these changes

# into our general management training.”

To put this approach into practice in your own organization, use these

# ﬁve steps:

- 1. Collect data to diagnose speciﬁc inequities in your organization.

Use a mix of quantitative and qualitative data, whether survey data,

## focus groups or interview data, network data, or HR data, with

employee demographic data to identify inequities in speciﬁc aspects of

the employee experience. Seek to understand not only “what” inequities

exist, but also “why” and “how” they exist. Qualitative data can be a

useful tool to assist.

- 2. Communicate about initiatives using a systems-focused framing.

Make the case that the status quo is inequitable, pointing at the speciﬁc

inequities you have identiﬁed, but maintain that the things to be “ﬁxed”

are speciﬁc systems, policies, processes, and practices, rather than the

people engaging in them. Avoid blaming or shaming individuals or

groups, and actively push back against fears that DEI initiatives will

do so.

- 3. As change-making efforts begin, appeal to “fairness.”

“Business case” rhetoric tends to alienate members of marginalized

groups. “Multiculturalism” rhetoric that focuses largely on supporting

marginalized groups may alienate members of advantaged groups.

Instead, focus on “fairness” and stress that DEI eﬀorts both require and

will beneﬁt members of all groups.

- 4. Clearly lay out expectations for change alongside resources and support. Communicate within the context of every initiative (e.g., building a

more inclusive shared language), the initiative’s goals (fewer incidents

## of microaggressions and disrespectful language), and expectations for

## accountability (by the time of the next yearly survey, an improved

belonging score). Highlight primarily the support available to all

(learning resources and leadership coaching), while underscoring the

importance of achieving the initiative’s goals within the expected

# timeline.

- 5. Sustain momentum by afﬁrming effort and celebrating wins.

Using DEI-related metrics, regularly identify and celebrate wins and

achievements while praising the shared eﬀort of all stakeholder groups.

Ensure that these celebrations use a similar framing of fairness,

## universal beneﬁt, and systems improvement as other steps in the

process. Finally, regroup the organization around the next objective to

meet, and repeat these steps as needed.

To genuinely address and resolve inequities, leaders must ﬁrst

understand the nuances and obstacles that so frequently stymie the

initiatives they undertake. Backlash is no diﬀerent, and what can appear

at ﬁrst glance to be knee-jerk defensiveness, ignorance, or fragility,

under a more compassionate lens becomes our universal desire to be

seen as digniﬁed, competent, and inherently good. If leaders can protect

these core needs while coming together to make change, they can create

DEI initiatives that succeed.
