What exactly is a digital transformation, and how can you lead one

# successfully?

Digital transformations involve a kind of organizational soul searching:

How do we change while remaining the same? How do we do new things

diﬀerently, while staying true to our purpose? And how do we adopt—

and adapt to—new technologies as they emerge? They require leaders

## HBR / Digital Article / How 6 Companies Approached Digital Transformation

to delve into the granular details of their organizations, while keeping a larger vision top of mind. It’s no wonder they’re notoriously diﬃcult.

Consider what digital transformation really involves. First, it requires

understanding a new technology—AI, cloud computing, data analytics

—and how it might help your business. But a transformation, as the

term implies, is bigger than merely onboarding new tools. It requires

rethinking how your company creates value, its strategy, and the

processes by which your employees get things done. And ﬁnally, it

requires shepherding real cultural change.

Daunting as all of this might seem, it’s also unavoidable. The pace of

technological change seems to only increase. The miracles of yesterday

are the baseline of tomorrow. As such, digital transformation has

become a muscle that companies must learn to exercise—a process that

is never really ﬁnished.

How should leaders think about this task? One place to start is by

asking: How have other companies navigated this? So, looking back at HBR’s archive, let’s consider how six diﬀerent legacy companies have

tackled this process.

# Moody’s

When ChatGPT launched in late 2022, most companies adopted a wait-

and-see approach. Generative AI was new, untested, and laden with

risks, both known and unknown. Better to let others work the kinks

out, the thinking went. However, the leadership at the legacy ﬁnancial

institution Moody’s had a diﬀerent perspective: Inaction was the riskier

path. The company decided to go all-in on the new technology.

There was a problem with this plan, however. “Unlike most

## transformations, the end goal of this initiative wasn’t clear,” writes

Toby E. Stuart, of UC Berkley’s Haas School of Business. “The tech was

evolving incredibly quickly and there were no proven use cases for how

it could be applied to create value. [Moody’s CEO Rob] Fauber likened

the initiative to sprinting into the fog—it might be possible to see a few

steps ahead, but no further.”

In spite of not having a precise endpoint, leadership had an idea of what

they wanted to achieve: a sweeping cultural shift that would enable the

company to take advantage of this new technology, however it evolved.

So, they decided on three guidelines. First, they wanted every employee,

at every level, to be involved—a goal that required buy-in from 14,000

employees. Second, they wanted to resist the instinct to reject new

ideas, and encourage legal, compliance, and risk staﬀ in particular to

take a “yes, and…” approach. And third, the aim throughout this eﬀort

needed to be contributing measurable value to the business.

# Honeywell

To understand the distinction between digital adoption and digital

transformation, consider the problem that Honeywell faced at the

beginning of its recent eﬀort to transform itself. “We had more than 150

enterprise resource planning systems (ERPs), some 2,700 applications,

1,700 websites, and no overarching plan for collecting and using data,”

writes Darius Adamczyk, who was CEO of Honeywell at the outset of the

# eﬀort.

This was a problem for a couple of reasons. For one, because

Honeywell contains so many businesses, the sprawl of tools and systems

heightened those internal divides. Second, as a result, that hindered

Honeywell’s ability to create new value for its customers. “The question

we asked ourselves,” writes Adamczyk, “was ‘Is it possible to use

digitalization to transform a diversiﬁed industrial conglomerate into an

integrated company?’”

The company pursued a three-step plan to transform itself internally.

First, it focused on simplifying and reorganizing its infrastructure,

going from 150-plus ERPs to 10, from 1,700 websites to fewer than 100,

and from 2,700 applications to fewer than 1,000. Second, it invested in

creating master databases for products, employees, and customers. And

third, it developed a strategy for putting all that data to work.

The digital transformation also allowed Honeywell to oﬀer customers

new systems that would put their data to work in new ways. Because

the company was already providing hardware and systems layers, it was

able to add a cloud-based software-as-a-service layer that captures data

and oﬀers analytic insights—a new way of creating value built on top of

existing services.

“In a way, digital transformation is really a matter of being able to create

a system to capture and harness data and then to unleash its power

on whatever it is you’re doing,” writes Adamczyk. “But to achieve that,

you have to understand all the intricate moving parts that make up the

# whole.”

# IKEA

When the pandemic started, IKEA Retail’s then-chief digital oﬃcer

Barbara Martin Coppola, a tech industry veteran, had already spent

nearly two years working to rewire the iconic retailer. The sudden

closure of stores, however, prompted a rapid acceleration of those

eﬀorts. Making the legacy retailer into a truly digital company required

redesigning supply chains, inventory management, logistics, and

fulﬁllment, but it also meant reconceiving the customer experience in

subtle ways that broke down distinctions between digital and physical

“[T]his process is a bit like an iceberg,” Martin Coppola told HBR in an

interview. “At the top of the iceberg, we have the customer needs and

adaptation—revamping everything around customer interaction and

new purchasing journeys—and under the surface we are making huge

changes to our business and operating model. And what is under the

surface is a much bigger change than what we see above.” In practical

terms, that meant rolling out new data policies and communicating

them to customers, integrating the app into the retail experience,

introducing new AR and VR tools, and broadly embracing data in new

# and expansive ways.

To enact these changes, Martin Coppola had to engineer signiﬁcant

buy-in from employees. “I had to ﬁrst become accepted as part of

the community,” she said. “The company values are about hard work,

humbleness, being down to earth, and a strong entrepreneurial spirit—

people want to go the extra mile for the company. I had to show through

my behavior that I share the same values. Then, it was about meeting

people and communicating an inspiring vision. Finally, it was about

putting forward simple steps that people can see themselves following.”

# Levi’s

In some cases, company culture can be a stickier problem than

## technology. In the case of the iconic clothing brand Levi Strauss &

Co., updating the company’s approaches was as beneﬁcial as bringing

new tech onboard. “As an apparel company, we were rooted in a

‘perfectionist’ mindset,” writes Harmit Singh, a senior vice president and chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer at Levi’s. “Typically, we would take an

idea, plan for six months, create the ‘perfect/best’ solution, and then

continue to iterate for another six months or more to get it right before

bringing it to market.”

Digital transformations, Singh argues, are “about transforming your

workforce to think in an agile and digital-ﬁrst mindset, and encourage

the creation and adoption of technology that is new for the team and

# sometimes new for the industry overall.”

The company learned four lessons through its transformation process,

which other leaders can apply: 1) When going through a major

transition, failure is OK. 2) Don’t worry about how you’re behind; focus

on how you can leapfrog the competition. 3) View transformations as an

opportunity to help everyone collect and use data. And 4) allow time for

tech savviness to grow.

# Adobe

One of the hardest parts of adopting a rapidly changing technology

is staying abreast of new risks that you’re onboarding along with new

tools. With AI, which can be used in a dizzying variety of tasks and

contexts, that eﬀort can feel Sisyphean. It’s also essential.

To do this eﬀectively, leaders might need to reframe how they think

about the problem, looking at the whole picture rather than each part in

turn. “[I]t’s critical that leaders carefully consider the context in which

AI operates—understanding the speciﬁc circumstances, environments,

## and applications of AI technologies in real-world use cases,” writes

Grace Yee, the senior director of ethical innovation at Adobe. “AI is often

assessed through its inputs and outputs, but this paints only a partial

picture… Companies need to shift from viewing AI as a singular entity to

evaluating its impact in speciﬁc contexts.”

Adobe dealt with this problem by following four principles: 1) Human

involvement is critical. 2) Hype doesn’t equal quality. 3) AI will always

evolve, but you can anticipate concerns. And 4) AI requires a robust

# ethics framework.

# Intuit

Digital native companies aren’t immune to the challenge of digital

## transformation. For Intuit, the ﬁnancial software company, this problem

manifests through the shifting baseline of customer expectations.

“When a product truly solves a customer problem, users very quickly stop noticing it at all,” writes Ashok Srivastava, Intuit’s chief data oﬃcer.

“Today’s breakthrough is tomorrow’s baseline.” And AI has accelerated

this cycle. To keep up, transformation needs to be a continuous process.

Intuit has tried to develop a culture of continuous transformation by

adopting three guiding principles and embedding them into the regular

## ﬂow of work: 1) Track progress with regular, rigorous, and ego-free

technical checks. 2) Embed AI experts across teams. And 3) turn conﬂict

## into competitive advantage with clear escalation processes.

This process, writes Srivastava, has been integral to Intuit’s success. But

like everything else, companies need to be continually reconsidering

whether they’re working the way they need to. “These strategies aren’t

designed to be static; they are reactive, ready to adjust as the customer

needs evolve and scale.”
