Because women continue to bear most of the burdens of caregiving,

many have beneﬁtted from the ﬂexibility of hybrid and remote work,

which has allowed them to remain part of the full-time workforce while

spending more time at home. In theory, this is good news, because full-

time employees tend to be promoted more often and let go less often —

but in practice that’s not what’s happening. Why? Because when women

take advantage of hybrid and remote work options today, they become

subject to biases that creep into the performance-review process and

cause them to be judged unfairly.

I witnessed this problem ﬁrsthand during a consulting project I did

## recently for a global company with hundreds of thousands of employees

worldwide. During the project, which took place as the company (which

I’ll call HAPI Consulting, to preserve its anonymity) was in the midst of

a large reorganization, I was reporting to the CEO, his executive, and the

board. With their support, I gathered and analyzed data on performance

reviews given in a hybrid work environment (pre- and post-pandemic),

and in that context I identiﬁed three speciﬁc kinds of bias that were

hurting women and their career prospects. I’ll explore them in turn

# below.

# Experience bias

The ﬁrst bias I observed was what we call experience bias, one aspect of

which is overvaluing tasks that are easy to deﬁne.

This form of bias, I found, was prevalent in performance reviews

## at HAPI Consulting — where, because of the reorganization, many

employees had been forced to put their routine work on hold. During

that period, reviewers had judged employees instead on how they had

chosen to refocus their energies. Men, on the whole, had chosen work

that was much easier to recognize. They spent more time on highly

## visible external tasks, such as speaking at industry conferences and

giving interviews to journalists, bloggers, and podcasters. These tasks

were straightforward to review when it came to short-term measures

of success. Meanwhile, women spent more time on much less visible

internal tasks, such as boosting team cohesion to help get projects back

on track and providing psychologically safe spaces for team members

to ask questions and process elements of the reorganization that were

taking place at the company. These tasks had longer timelines and were

harder to evaluate in the short term.

These choices lent themselves to experience bias. It’s easy to

understand, for example, how somebody who has presented at a

major conference (probably a man) might have immediately provided

a measurable beneﬁt to the company. In fact, men were three times

more likely than women to speak at outside events. But how easy is it

to measure and evaluate the work that somebody (probably a woman)

has begun to do in a long-term eﬀort to repair team dynamics or

prevent deep-rooted problems that might ultimately aﬀect hundreds or

thousands of employees? Needless to say, given the nature of experience

bias, reviewers at HAPI Consulting praised the men more regularly in

their performance reviews for having succeeded in their work. More

speciﬁcally, men who reviewed other men assessed them 12% higher

than women, on average, as compared to when women reviewed both

# men and other women.

With the support of leadership, I tested several interventions designed

to help reviewers at the company correct this bias. While some

interventions failed, two had a statistically signiﬁcant chance (with a

95% conﬁdence interval or above) of reducing biases at this company.

The ﬁrst was for managers to help employees set individualized goals

with tailored metrics and then ask them to track what they had done

every week — and to do it on a virtual whiteboard that the rest of the

team and the directors up the chain could see. In this way, people who

had contributed to less-easily-deﬁned outcomes, such as team cohesion,

could still point to a record of their eﬀorts over time for all to see.

This whiteboard could record important work even if it wasn’t easily

described in terms of traditional goals and metrics. This was helpful

come performance review time. Even if employees had failed to reach

the goals laid out for them in their last performance review, there was

still a record of all their eﬀorts and achievements, which, according to

the post-survey results, helped reviewers better grasp the value of the

more ambiguous, internal work that (mostly) women were performing.

The second was designed to help employees become better at describing

their own eﬀorts. At the beginning of the week, for each project

they were working on, employees were asked to provide two diﬀerent

estimates on their virtual whiteboard: how long each task would take to accomplish and its level of diﬃculty (high, medium, or low). For

example, an employee might identify the three projects they’re working

on for the week and allocate the amount of time they plan to spend on each, based on the type of task and estimated diﬃculty. At the end

of each week, employees were asked to revisit their estimates, note how their time was actually allocated and how diﬃcult the task ended

up being, and reﬂect on the reasons for the diﬀerences between their

forecasts and “actuals.” This practice allowed employees to look back

on their recorded predictions, reﬂect on what the record showed in

comparison to their perceptions, and ﬁne-tune their ability to paint an

# accurate picture of their eﬀorts.

Initially, the data showed that women were more accurate in their

estimations of the time a task would take, although they often overestimated the diﬃculty of tasks. Meanwhile, men underestimated both the time a task would take and its diﬃculty. Following the

intervention, the likelihood of women accurately identifying the diﬃculty of the task increased by a factor of 28, while men were 12.5

times more likely to do so. Additionally, men became 7 times more

likely to accurately estimate the time required for a task, whereas there

was no signiﬁcant diﬀerence in this aspect for women.

# Proximity bias

An other form of bias I observed was proximity bias, or the tendency

to think that people who are in your physical orbit do the most

important work. A hybrid work environment exacerbates this bias and

was penalizing women at HAPI Consulting, where men were more likely than women to come into the oﬃce. Reviewers tended to express

skepticism, or at least confusion, about what women did when they

worked remotely, whereas they tended to give men the beneﬁt of the

doubt and assume that they were more focused and productive.

Even when women came into the oﬃce as often as men, reviewers

assigned them achievement levels that were a statistically signiﬁcant

3% lower than those they assigned to the men. And when women came into the oﬃce more than men, reviewers seemed to believe that they

were doing so only because they were looking out for themselves and

wanted to “have a seat at the table” to defend their position in the

reorganization of the company. Conversely, when men came into the oﬃce an above-average amount, they were seen as strong leaders.

To address this problem of proximity bias, I administered a survey

to employees to gauge their preferences among several choices: more

online gatherings, an “anchor day” when everybody was expected to be in the oﬃce, or more oﬀsite team-building opportunities. The

employees’ preference was that the company create an anchor day,

which it did. This intervention led to a statistically signiﬁcant drop

in proximity bias that was observable in the next performance-review

cycle. In addition to having employees post their current projects on

a virtual whiteboard each week, teams were also asked to hold weekly

meetings during which they would discuss three achievements from the

## previous week, their goals for the current week, and three challenges

they were facing in trying to achieve them. By drawing more equal

attention to the work that everybody was doing, no matter where they

did it, these meetings helped the company resist proximity bias.

# In-group/out-group bias

The third form of bias that was creeping into remote-work performance

evaluations was in-group/out-group bias, or giving preferential

treatment to people you feel belong to a group you identify with. Not

surprisingly, employees who were working remotely, and particularly those who had moved away from the oﬃce and across state lines,

were increasingly seen as members of the out-group — and they had

annual performance review scores that were lower by an average of

20%. Beneﬁts would accrue to those in the in-group, including vertical

promotions, horizontal promotions (providing employees with new

opportunities to learn new skills and take on more prized tasks that

## would position them well for vertical promotions), and bonuses, such as

equity shares in the company. Both men and women were subject to this

form of bias, but because men tend to be seen more readily as leaders,

they were more easily able to join the in-group than women.

To increase a sense of belonging, the company launched a campaign

## called “I am HAPI Consulting, We are HAPI Consulting.” One element

of the campaign asked employees to answer simple, sometimes silly

questions so that teams could come to know the commonalities among

them. For example, when providing updates at meetings, employees

might also have to tack on the answer to the question, “Dog or cat?” or

“What is on your bucket list this year?”

Questions like these provided some memorable moments that everyone could share, no matter whether they worked in the oﬃce or remotely,

and they allowed more people to experience in-group moments.

Strikingly, this practice led to a 14% increase in feelings of belonging

to the in-group, and a 17% increase in employees’ perceptions of which

other employees belong to the in-group. At performance-review time,

reviewers were also asked to recall one thing they had in common

with the person they were about to review. We found that this

simple intervention, which meant that reviews began from a point of

commonality, decreased the gender discrimination in the company’s

## performance reviews by several percentage points.

Men and women often experience the workplace diﬀerently, whether

in-person or virtually. To include and support the best talent for your

company in a dynamic environment, it’s important to take a careful

look at the data, be alert to the three kinds of biases discussed in

this article, and identify practices that are leading you to overvalue

the eﬀorts of certain groups. The insights you gain from doing so

will not only help you treat women more fairly but also will lead to

fewer predictable surprises, more productive work hours, and increased eﬃciency in smoothly leading teams — and your company — to
