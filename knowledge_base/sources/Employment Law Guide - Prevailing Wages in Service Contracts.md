## McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA)

(41 USC § 6701 et seq.; 29 CFR Parts 4, 6, and 8(https://www.dol.gov/dol/cfr/Title_29/Chapter_I.htm))

Who is Covered

# The wage requirements of the McNamara-O'Hara Service Contract Act (SCA or Act) are administered by the

# Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The SCA's prevailing wage requirements generally apply to contracts in

excess of $2,500, whether negotiated or advertised, entered into by the federal government and the District of Columbia where the principal purpose of the contract is to furnish services in the U.S. through the use of

service employees. The term "service employee" includes any employee engaged in performing services on a

covered contract other than an individual employed in a bona ﬁde executive, administrative, or professional

capacity as those terms are deﬁned in eCFR 29 CFR Part 541.

The SCA does not apply to certain types of contracts. These statutory exemptions include:

Contracts for construction, alteration, and/or repair, including painting and decorating, of public buildings or

public works (i.e., contracts covered by the Davis-Bacon Act;

Work required in accordance with the provisions of the Walsh-Healey Public Contracts Act;

Contracts for transporting freight or personnel by certain means (such as by airplane) where published tariﬀ

rates are in eﬀect; Contracts for furnishing services by radio, telephone, telegraph, or cable companies, subject to the

# Communications Act of 1934;

# Contracts for public utility services;

Employment contracts providing for direct services to a federal agency by an individual;

Contracts with the United States Postal Service, the principal purpose of which is the operation of postal contract stations;

Services performed outside the United States, as that term is deﬁned in the Act; and

Contracts administratively exempted by the Secretary of Labor in special circumstances because of the

public interest or to avoid serious impairment of government business.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The SCA requires contractors and subcontractors performing services on covered contracts in excess of

$2,500 to pay service employees in various classes no less than the wage rates and fringe beneﬁts found

prevailing in the locality, or the rates (including prospective increases) contained in a predecessor contractor's

collective bargaining agreement, as provided in wage determinations issued by the Department of Labor. These determinations are incorporated into the contract.

For contracts equal to or less than $2,500, contractors are required to pay the federal minimum wage of $7.25

per hour eﬀective July 24, 2009. Contractors must also, under the provisions of the Contract Work Hours and

Safety Standards Act and/or the Fair Labor Standards Act, generally pay employees at least one and one-half

times their regular (or basic) rate of pay for all hours worked over 40 in a workweek.

Finally, contractors must notify employees commencing work on a covered contract of the compensation due

## them under the wage and fringe beneﬁts provisions of the SCA.

Employee Rights

# The SCA provides covered service employees on covered service contracts the right to receive at least the

# locally prevailing wage rate and fringe beneﬁts (or the rates, including prospective increases, contained in a

predecessor contractor's collective bargaining agreement), as determined by the Department of Labor, for the type of work performed. The Wage and Hour Division accepts complaints of alleged SCA violations.

Every employer performing work covered by the SCA is required to provide each employee commencing work

on a covered contract notice of the compensation due them under the wage and fringe beneﬁts provisions of

the SCA and to deliver to the employees, or post, the "Employee Rights on Government Contracts" notice

(including any applicable wage determination) at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place

where it may be easily seen by employees. There are no size requirements for the poster. The Employee Rights on Government Contracts poster is available in Spanish as well.

If the contractor employs workers with disabilities under special minimum wage certiﬁcates, the "Notice to

Workers with Disabilities/Special Minimum Wage (PDF) poster" must also be posted. This poster explains the

conditions under which special minimum wages may be paid. It must be posted in a conspicuous place on

the employer's premises where it can be readily seen by employees and the parents or guardians of workers with disabilities.

Some of the records required to be kept under the SCA are also required under the Fair Labor Standards Act

## (see Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #21: Recordkeeping.

Under the SCA, contractors and subcontractors are required to maintain certain records for each employee

covered by the SCA. Basic records, such as the name, address, and Social Security number of each

employee must be maintained for three years from completion of the work. In addition, the following records

must be maintained for three years from completion of the work:

The work classiﬁcation(s), wage rate(s), and fringe beneﬁts provided (or cash equivalent payments provided in lieu of fringe beneﬁts)

## The total daily and weekly compensation of each employee

The number of daily and weekly hours worked by each employee

## Any deductions, rebates, or refunds from each employee's compensation

Any list of a predecessor contractor's employees furnished to the successor contractor showing the employees' length of service information

A list of wages and fringe beneﬁts for those classes of workers conformed to the wage determination

attached to the contract

# The contractor shall also make available a copy of the contract upon request from the Wage and Hour

# Division.

# Reporting

There are no reporting requirements.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Violations of the SCA may result in contract terminations and liability for resulting costs to the government, withholding of contract payments in suﬃcient amounts to cover wage and fringe beneﬁt underpayments, legal

action to recover the underpayments, and debarment from future contracts for three years.

Contractors and subcontractors may challenge determinations of violations and debarment before an

Administrative Law Judge. Contractors and subcontractors may appeal decisions of Administrative Law

Judges to the Administrative Review Board (ARB). ARB determinations on violations and debarment may be appealed to and are enforceable through the federal courts.

The SCA applies only to contracts awarded by the federal or District of Columbia governments. As noted

above, contractors generally are required to pay employees working on covered contracts for overtime hours worked in accordance with the overtime pay standards of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act.

If the employees are covered by the FLSA, the overtime provisions of the FLSA may apply as well.
