Here’s a common scenario in companies around the world: The annual

review of proposed new projects is coming up, and you’re on the

decision-making committee. You and your colleagues are faced with

an overwhelming list of options. Some of them you can comment on

knowledgeably; some of them not. Sometimes the tech behind them

is brand new or the market is yet to be tested. Working together, you

and the team are expected to discern what works best and what should

best be left aside. But how, exactly, should you combine and weigh your

# respective assessments?

This type of quandary is reﬂected in our new research on the selection

of innovation projects. Simulating a realistic selection environment,

we horserace common decision methods such as voting, scoring,

and ranking. Many big ﬁrms, be it device manufacturers, software

## purveyors, drug makers, or even venture capitalists, use these types of

tactics when they need to match innovative ideas with the resources

at their disposal. Often, the rules around these processes aren’t

consistently applied, which leads to muddled results — or an executive

sweeping in to have the ﬁnal say.

Studying portfolio decision-making eﬀectiveness is diﬃcult. When

company time, resources, and revenue are at stake, few teams can

aﬀord to go back and revisit decisions using new selection methods.

For example, they generally don’t have time to ask: How well would

our project portfolio have done if we had voted instead of scored our

options? Would we have selected diﬀerent projects?

We hope that our ﬁndings can oﬀer some valuable insights to help point

you in the right direction. We have designed a decision-making model

built from what we have learned studying portfolio-selection decision

## processes in high-tech ﬁrms, both as consultants and researchers, over

the last two decades. This calibration of the model is key to generating

plausible insights, since our results cannot be empirically veriﬁed. The

model runs through thousands of future scenarios, checking how well

a portfolio of selected projects would have done for every decision rule

outlined below.

Overall, we concluded that the best method is often a simple form

of ranking: Everyone on the decision-making committee places the

candidate projects in their preferred order. You then tally projects’

ranks and fund as many of the best placed projects as your budget

permits. The ranking rule selects portfolios that on average outperform

by 10-20% those selected by simple voting, depending on the available

budget, expertise, and project proﬁles. Adopting a ranking procedure

can help you make the most of the collective perspectives that the

committee brings to the table when selecting innovation.

# How Project Selection Often Happens

When selecting new innovation projects, some committees prize

consensus and thus end up funding only ideas whose success is plain

to see, which is often an incremental innovation. Venture capitalists

looking for the next big thing might do the opposite, picking projects on

which they disagree.

In our research, we focus on decision rules that are neutral, placing

equal weight on avoiding costly ﬂops and foregone opportunities.

A ﬁrst aspect to consider for your choice of decision rule is generally

the budget and the number of projects you can aﬀord to fund in

## parallel. The tighter the budget constraint — think, for example, of the

extreme selectivity of pharmaceutical companies when they populate

their portfolio of clinical trials — the greater the importance of choosing

a rule that can identify the best project(s) among many candidates

To that end, we considered some of the common ways organizations

make these innovation project decisions:

# An Executive Decides

Investing scarce resources into new product development, early-stage

ventures, or scientiﬁc research, can be daunting. The scope for

breakthrough ideas is huge and ﬁnancial means typically limited.

Sometimes these decisions come down to one senior leader.

But the top boss does not know everything, and even if they had several

experts to rely on, it is often hard to know in advance whose expertise

would be best applied. Delegating the assessment of a project to a

known expert best suits those projects that look familiar, not those that

are more ambitious.

# An Internal Committee Votes

Many projects show merit on at least some dimension, so discerning

their overall comparative worth is key to eﬀective prioritization. This

is where voting, which is believed to be the most commonly practiced method, falls short. Tallying yes/no votes often fails to provide suﬃcient

gradation, requiring arbitrary tie breaks. So if your budget permits a few

projects only, make it go further by adopting a method such as ranking

that our research shows as identifying the top candidates more reliably.

With a bigger budget, scoring is an alternative.

Voting is advisable only with large crowds. Open-science platform

EteRNA, for example, pools the assessments of hundreds of scientists,

in order to select the most promising protein molecules for further

study. Local governments running participative budgeting platforms

may similarly adopt the approach. With very large sets of decision

makers, voting’s ability to discriminate improves.

# An Internal Committee Scores

If you work for a smaller ﬁrm with a strong focus, you are probably

looking at a bunch of comparable projects. Handset maker Sony

Ericsson, for example, each year evaluated about 20 to 30 proposals

for new phones of various shapes and functionality, and funded many

of them. Their core portfolio management team consisted of ﬁve

experienced decision makers. In such situations, you may well opt for

a scoring approach. For example, ask everyone to allocate points for

projects’ commercial attractiveness. Then tally the points and proceed

with the projects that garnered most.

Scoring would, however, select poorly in a more diversiﬁed ﬁrm

operating in a fast-paced environment. The product board of

France Telecom’s TechnoCentre, for example, considered hundreds

of proposals a year in the 2010s, funding only a subset. Proposals

would hail from a dozen divisions, focused on multi-media, e-health,

or emerging-market solutions among others. With representatives from

the divisions on the product board, you would have wide discrepancies

in the applicability of domain expertise, depending on the proposals

in question. Here, ranking would be the most eﬀective method of

divining the future, oﬀering more robust classiﬁcation of commercial

## opportunities than scoring, and more discrimination than voting.

# An Internal Committee Ranks

If you are a small committee of any composition, you would similarly

fare best with ranking, especially when the choice set contains many

candidates, your budget can support a few only, and your experience is

limited. Drug maker Novartis, for example, in 2020 had eight pharma

executives make the ﬁnal call on selecting four of 155 high-risk project

## proposals for its Genesis development program.

The portfolio selected through ranking will never be optimal in

hindsight, but it will be more so than what voting or scoring could give

# you in the face of the same uncertainty.

# The “Kickstarter” Approach

Another interesting case are internal platforms such as IBM’s iFundIT

initiative. On these, decision makers can build their own virtual

portfolios and weight them, much like Kickstarter investors would. This

is expensive to orchestrate, but aggregating the individual portfolios

would give you even better discrimination than simple ranking.

There are other aspects to consider, regardless of the kind of rules you

use. For example, if you believe that the variety of project candidates

poorly match the domain expertise of your decision makers, either

because you work for a diversiﬁed business, or because the innovation

frontier moves quickly, then you need a decision rule that can handle

inaccurate judgment. Voting here performs better than scoring, which

provides a false sense of precision when what you need is a rough

categorization. Ranking is more robust to misclassiﬁcation of novel

# ideas than scoring, too.

And as always, you need to consider who you have on the committee.

How many colleague’s assessments can you feasibly integrate, and

how varied is their professional background? Many decision makers of

similar background could give you some wisdom of the crowd when

they score candidate projects, such that scoring errors balance out in

## aggregate. With fewer, or more diverse decision makers, such wisdom

is not guaranteed, and ranking would be a more eﬀective choice of

# decision rule.

## Finding the Right Decision-Making Process

We’ve created a decision tree to help guide your thinking about what

process to choose. If you are unsure about the expertise of your decision

makers, or how these would match the projects under consideration, the

best bet is often ranking. This is even more true when you have a limited

budget and a small committee. We’ll explain more about each question

# below the chart.

Can you organize a collective decision process?

Asking many people to weigh in on a decision creates well-known ineﬃciencies. Coordination takes time and eﬀort. Dates suitable for

everyone need to be found. All committee members will have less time

for their day jobs. You thus want to consider:

- Whether your business can aﬀord a tad less agility

- Whether your innovation processes can be aligned such that proposals

are submitted in a standardized manner at the same time at regular

# intervals

- Whether you expect the decision-making to be suﬃciently

complicated by uncertainty, or in need of broader legitimization, to

## undergo the trouble of distributed decision making

Do you have an expert for each new idea?

Most often the answer to this is no. If you conﬁdently knew who

the right expert is for the evaluation of a project, you would already

understand the project. In that case there is less need for additional

deliberation. Therefore, delegating to experts is best suited to frequent,

more routine decision tasks, involving incremental changes rather than

# innovations.

Do you receive many proposals?

When you are looking at only a handful of project proposals, the impact

of wrongly assessing one of them is relatively smaller than when the

list of proposals runs over several pages. This is where misjudging a

project has greater consequences for the overall preference order and

the ultimate portfolio composition. Scoring is prone to lead to such

## misclassiﬁcations. The greater the choice set of proposals, the more

you should seek a decision rule that provides coarser, more robust

# classiﬁcation.

Are you bound by a tight budget?

The smaller the budget, relative to the resources requested by the

proposals before you, the greater the need for a decision rule oﬀering

## robust discrimination of project attractiveness at the extremes. When

you are in the lucky spot of being able to fund almost all of few

proposals, scoring will serve you well. But if you aim to isolate the best

ﬁve of a few dozen proposals, go with ranking.

Big ﬁrms often already operate a sophisticated innovation process, have

experience with the winning products of the past but not the future,

and receive plenty more proposals than they can fund. Our decision tree

would thus lead them to the ranking decision rule, a simple collective

rule that strikes a balance between robustness and discrimination.

Scoring, which is discriminating but not robust, sometimes is a decent

second choice. Voting, although robust and well suited to screening tasks such as jury deliberations or medical diagnosis, insuﬃciently

discriminates between project options to enhance portfolio selection.

. . .

## Many ﬁrms, staﬀed with smart people and cutting-edge analytics, count

themselves lucky when a tenth of the innovations they pursue are

successful. Adjusting the committee’s decision rule can thus quickly

make a commercial diﬀerence, even if it is just one more project than

usual that is correctly accepted or rejected, respectively.

Our research recommends ranking in many situations. Many people are

familiar with the process of ranking something. Adopting a ranking rule

for portfolio selection thus is not a wrenching ask. Naturally, it is not

the only means of improving innovation success rates. But compared to

adjusting the salary incentives for your innovators, or redesigning the

internal resource-allocation process, it looks like a quick win.
