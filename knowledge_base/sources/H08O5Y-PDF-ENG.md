Public service roles tend to have specialized language, non-traditional

organizational structures, and distinct success metrics. In working with

numerous public sector employees looking to make the move to the

private sector for the ﬁrst time in their careers, I’ve seen them quickly

realize that they need to translate their accomplishments, skills, and

capabilities in a new and diﬀerent way. Here are four ways to update

your resume, as well as some networking tips, to set yourself up for

# private sector success.

# Understand the Differences in Work

The ﬁrst question to answer is whether your job exists in the private

## sector. Many roles in HR, ﬁnance, vendor management, and supply

chains are found in both public and private sectors, making the

transition more straightforward. However, positions like policy aides, legislative analysts, diplomats, federal intelligence oﬃcers, and border

patrol agents have no direct equivalent in private companies.

Even for similar roles, key diﬀerences exist in focus, objectives, and

## operational environments. Take cybersecurity, for example. Whether

## in government or private industry, professionals in this ﬁeld need

## expertise in threat detection, ethical hacking, malware analysis, and

risk management. They may also work with AI-driven security tools,

ﬁrewalls, and intrusion detection systems. But at a certain point,

their missions diverge: Federal cybersecurity focuses on national

## security, counterterrorism, and cyber warfare, whereas private sector

cybersecurity tends to prioritize protecting business assets, customer

# data, and ﬁnancial transactions.

It’s not just skills and actual work that diﬀers: Job titles, business

metrics, and work culture vary signiﬁcantly between sectors. A government “executive oﬃcer” might map to a VP, director, chief administrative oﬃcer, department head, or chief of staﬀ in private

industry, depending on their speciﬁc responsibilities. Similarly,

government success is measured by policy impact, long-term outcomes,

and compliance, whereas businesses focus on revenue growth,

# scalability, and innovation.

Because government employees don’t measure success in proﬁt, you

need to reframe your accomplishments in private sector terms. Instead

of emphasizing compliance with federal mandates, highlight how your work optimized resources, improved eﬃciency, or led to cost savings—

## all of which align with private business priorities.

# Learn the Industry Language and Nuances

Speaking the language of private industry is essential for translating

## government experience into a compelling private sector resume.

## Some roles share common terminology across sectors—think employee

## relations, talent acquisition, and workforce planning. But private

industry often uses diﬀerent phrasing. For example, “total rewards”

## encompasses compensation, beneﬁts, well-being initiatives, and

## performance-based incentives, whereas in government, the same term

may simply refer to pay and beneﬁts.

This translation is crucial when updating your resume. Consider this

# government-centric bullet point:

Managed multi-year appropriations and ﬁscal year budget

formulation, ensuring compliance with OMB Circular A-11 and

## agency ﬁnancial policies, and oversaw obligation and expenditure

tracking, aligning resource allocations with congressional mandates

# and strategic priorities.

A private sector employer wouldn’t ﬁnd this relevant. Here’s how you

might recast it in business-oriented terms:

Led annual ﬁnancial planning and forecasting, managing a $50M

operating budget to optimize P&L performance and drive cost

# efficiency across business units.

Analyze job descriptions in your target industry to identify commonly

used terms and tailor your resume accordingly. AI tools such as Copilot,

ChatGPT, or Gemini can also help you translate your current work into

language that will resonate with private sector employers.

# Position Your Transferable Skills

Consider how your hard and soft skills could bring added value to a private sector position. For example, the U.S. Oﬃce of Personnel

## Management identiﬁed ﬁve executive core qualiﬁcations (ECQs), which

are very similar to leadership skills valued in the private sector. Some

of these include leading change, being decisive in decision-making,

problem solving, understanding ﬁnancial processes and budgeting, and

building relationships. Demonstrating these skills on your resume and

during interviews will help close the gap between your public and

# private sector experience.

Further, you want to demonstrate how your inside knowledge of speciﬁc

areas, such as policy and regulation development, could give you a

## competitive edge. A deep understanding of government regulations and

policies can be very valuable in highly regulated industries like ﬁnance,

healthcare, and technology. While conﬁdentiality may preclude you

from sharing all the details of what you worked on, showing which

transferable skills you used to accomplish the work, as well as the

unique insights you can bring to the job, will allow you to eﬀectively

## position yourself for success in private sector roles.

## Show You Can Handle Fast-Paced Work Environments

Government agencies are often slow to adopt new technologies or

processes, waiting until change is absolutely necessary. In contrast,

## many private sector companies—especially those in hyper-growth

mode—operate at a fast pace, constantly evolving. To successfully

transition into the private sector, you must showcase your ability to

## think ahead and drive process improvements.

Additionally, government work is often bogged down by complex

regulations, which can lead to slow-moving projects. While these rules

serve a purpose, they create a stark contrast to the private sector’s need for speed and eﬃciency. To stand out, public sector professionals must

highlight their ability to work under tight deadlines and deliver results

# quickly.

For instance, federal cybersecurity investigations can take years to

complete, whereas private sector professionals must respond to security

threats in real time while managing risk. Even if your experience comes

from a long-term government project, emphasize moments where you

identiﬁed solutions, streamlined processes, or made quick, impactful

decisions. Demonstrating your ability to adapt to a faster pace will make

## you a stronger candidate for private sector roles.

# Expand Your Network Beyond Government

Networking is one of the most powerful tools in making a successful

transition from the public to the private sector. Most private sector jobs

aren’t ﬁlled through online applications alone—they’re secured through

networking and referrals. The more you expand your connections

outside of government, the more doors you’ll open to exciting new

# career possibilities.

Before reaching out to people, take the time to clarify your career goals.

What kind of role are you looking for? Which industries interest you?

Having a clear direction will make your conversations more productive

and help others guide you toward the right opportunities.

Once you have a focus, start expanding your network beyond

## government circles. Talk to friends, former classmates, and

acquaintances who work in the private sector. Your current public sector

colleagues may also have valuable connections—many have family

members, friends, or former coworkers in corporate roles. Don’t be

afraid to ask for introductions.

Attend industry events, join professional associations, and engage in

LinkedIn discussions to connect with private sector professionals in

your target ﬁeld. If you’re switching to an industry where you lack

direct experience, consider informational interviews. Reach out to

people in roles that interest you and ask about their career paths, daily

responsibilities, and what skills are most valued in their ﬁeld. These

conversations can provide invaluable insights and may even lead to job

# opportunities.

. . .

Government resumes often span one to ﬁve pages, detailing extensive

## work histories with quantiﬁable achievements, certiﬁcations, security

clearances, trainings, awards, and publications. In contrast, private

sector resumes need to be concise—ideally no more than two pages.

To make a successful career transition, you must do more than just

cut yours down; you need to translate government jargon into crisp

corporate language and focus solely on what truly matters to potential

employers. Spotlighting your most relevant skills and measurable

successes will help you position yourself as a uniquely qualiﬁed

candidate who’s ready to deliver tangible results in a business-driven

environment, and expanding your professional network will help steer
