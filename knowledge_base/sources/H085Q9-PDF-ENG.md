Most leaders recognize that the true test of their character comes in

diﬃcult times, when a change in business conditions demands a shift in

strategy in order to create and preserve enterprise value. And because

people are usually the single largest expenditure on an organization’s balance sheet, layoﬀs often become discussion item number one.

## HBR / Digital Article / 6 Mistakes Leaders Make When Announcing Layoffs

Layoﬀs are trauma-inducing for an organization and its employees.

When handled badly, some people (and organizations) never fully

recover. “When the next cycle of hiring comes around, the talent you

pursue will judge your company by the reputation it earned in this round of layoﬀs,” advises Evelyn Rodstein, Manhattan-based executive

## coach and former Wall Street leadership and talent executive.

For organizations facing down this situation, how should reductions in

force be communicated to employees? What’s a “great place to work”

to do? In my experience as a former CHRO, attorney, and now as an

executive coach, I’ve seen six common mistakes leaders make when communicating layoﬀs.

They’re not transparent about the state of the business.

In good or bad times, the best companies proactively ensure employees

are routinely educated on the state of the business. They invite

employees to listen in on investor calls, host quarterly town halls, or

send regular “state of the business” emails that inform everyone about

major customer wins or losses, the acquisition or sale of a business, and

# relevant industry trends.

This kind of forward-looking communication strategy should ensure

employees are not shocked during inevitable business downturns.

People understand challenging business conditions. They will not

forgive avoiding or obscuring the facts.

Angela Stopper, chief learning oﬃcer and director of people and

organization development at UC Berkeley, observes that organizations sometimes delay communicating layoﬀs because they’re afraid “good”

people will leave. “Why would you think that?” she asks. “All your

people should be good people.”

They’re not clear on the path forward.

As a former CHRO and corporate executive, I’ve both lived through and led layoﬀs enough to know that successfully reengineering your business through staﬀ cuts only works when it’s one part of an

overarching strategy to create greater value. Make sure you’re clear

on that strategy and ready to share it before acting. Rebuilding

your business requires communicating a compelling vision that will

inspire your remaining employees to forgive any mistakes in business

judgment, set aside doubts, and recommit to your organization.

They don’t get the tone right.

Healthy human beings don’t want to inﬂict pain on others. It’s

understandable that leaders may want to distance themselves from

their own guilt or feelings of failure. But there’s a big risk in emotionally

detaching, ignoring, or downplaying the complex emotions, such as

anger, sorrow, and confusion, that your employees may be feeling.

Anticipate and plan for this. Envision how you would want to be treated,

and be that leader. Think through how you will respond if someone

starts crying on a call or is angry in a meeting. When employees leave,

“you want them to have felt cared for,” says Stopper.

You want to be empathetic, but you can’t be defensive, sentimental,

or make excuses for the bad business situation you are in. Make

compassion a key driver of your approach. Be direct and take it on the chin. (CEO’s posting crying selﬁes expressing their sadness over layoﬀs

have not always gone over well.)

Your employees need to feel you’re there and that you care. Treat them

as intelligent partners who can understand the logic and rationality

## behind a change in structure, process, capability, and people.

They don’t offer remaining employees the opportunity to ask questions.

Most people understand that business demands may result in staﬀ reductions. However, these events are still viewed “with great

cynicism,” says Rodstein. Be prepared and available to respond to

myriad questions, from how the work will be handled to what support services will be oﬀered to departing employees. People are evaluating

whether your organization is a safe and rewarding place to stay.

Employees will likely want to understand why some roles were chosen

for elimination versus others. There is projection of survivor guilt —

Why were they chosen and not me? — as well as a stress response: Am I

next? Be prepared to share, even at a high level, the business rationale

for the positions or business units that were selected. But make sure to

consult with your HR and legal teams on what you can say. How you exit

people “can spin out into legal claims,” observes Jennifer Schwartz, a

# California-based employment attorney.

Employees will also want to know whether more layoﬀs are coming. You

can share that you are conﬁdent in the business strategy and, if true,

that no further cutbacks are planned. However, never say this is the

“only” or “last” time you will have reductions in force. You cannot know

# this.

As an in-house executive and now as a CEO coach, I’ve had to remind

some leaders that although they have been living with the tough news for a while and may be ready to move on, the layoﬀs are a raw wound for

the rest of the organization. Creating space for questions demonstrates

transparency and openness from leadership, which can build trust with

employees. Allowing for honest discussion can address concerns and

anxiety, provide clarity and understanding, and foster engagement and

ownership by employees when they feel that their voices are heard

and their questions are taken seriously. Healing takes time, patience, and persistent eﬀort. Think of every conversation as an opportunity to

re-recruit those who stay.

They don’t bring middle management on board.

Employees will likely direct most of their questions to their managers.

So it’s critically important to give middle managers the information

they need about the business case and future vision, so they can address

# employee concerns.

Managers must believe in the strategy or actions will seem unfair,

advises Rodstein. Map out a timeline that includes an investment in

these critical culture carriers. Allow space for them to process their own

feelings, so they can show up as leaders with genuine conﬁdence when

its needed most.

They don’t show appreciation to departing employees.

Your employees contributed to building your organization. Thank them

for the piece of their life that they invested. Incorporate genuine

## expressions of appreciation in your communications, both formal and

in-person. Be speciﬁc with your feedback. It means much more for a

manager to thank a colleague for their lasting contributions on a project,

or gaining a critical customer, than just to give vanilla thanks.

. . .

Thoughtful leadership is critical in navigating the challenging terrain of layoﬀs. Employees are not only exiting partners in your business — they

are future clients, customers, and competitors of your business. Treat

them as such. By avoiding these six common mistakes, you can ensure

you treat people with compassion, dignity and respect when it’s needed

# most.
