them, pronto. But to your dismay, nothing you share ends uplanding. This continues to happen week after week.When you ask your manager for feedback, they tell you somethingvague like: “We love all ideas — keeping them coming!” Still, youfeel you could be doing more to communicate your thoughts in ameaningful way.Ever been in this situation? You’re not alone. The majority of theworkers I coach face this issue at some point in their careers, andtypically, the issue is not their ideas — it’s their delivery. Here arefour strategies that have consistently worked for my clients. Usethem to present your ideas in a way that will resonate with anyaudience.Think small.One client I worked with had great ideas that she believed couldsolve some major issues at her company. She didn’t get too muchone-on-one time with her manager, so when she did, she endedup sharing all of her recommendations at once. A few minutesinto their meetings, my client could see her manager’s eyes glazeover. She knew her ideas weren’t being heard.It can be easy to get carried away and think you need to share allyour ideas at once — especially if, like my client, you get little facetime with the decision-makers at your organization. Butpresenting someone with too many thoughts or proposals at oncecan overwhelm them. Whether you’re talking a manager, a peer,or a senior leader — these people have a lot on their plates. It willbe easier for them to process what you’re saying if it’s clear, to the

point, and focused on a single solution or concept. In other words:Have patience and think small.My client and I discussed how her laundry-list ofrecommendations was not helpful to her boss, who likely lackedthe headspace and time to walk through every problem-solvinghypothesis she offered. Moving forward, she began to do thatwork herself — deciding on her strongest pitch and presentingthat singular idea when the opportunity presented itself. As aresult, she had more fruitful conversations with her boss and wasable to successfully sell her ideas.In your own situation, ask yourself: “What is

one idea that I cansell to my team/boss/peer in our next meeting?” You may feeleager to elaborate or present several options—but selling yourbest idea and gaining that win is the first step. It will carry youforth until you’re ready to share next idea … and then the next.Share in 10 minutes or less.These days, everyone seems to be stressed and burnt out. Hybridand remote workplaces that lend themselves to being “always on”can exacerbate these feelings. Consider this when you’re sellingyour ideas. Assume that everyone’s bandwidth is limited and aimto

share your thoughts in 10 minutes or less.Consider this example of what often doesn’t work versus whatdoes: One of my clients created a 50-page deck highlighting thebudget needs of his department and shared it with the executivecommittee of his company. He created an extensive rationale forevery dollar. After my client got through the first three pages, thecommittee told him he had the funding. However, my clientcontinued to proceed through the entire 50 pages and wound uplosing his audience. Even though my client secured the budget,he received feedback that his packaging and delivery were not

well-received by the powerful group of stakeholders he hadpresented to — potentially damaging his reputation and futureasks.You can avoid this by honoring your audience’s busy schedule.One method I recommend is breaking your idea down into a fewelements:

Start with a headline that describes your pitch, solution, or idea(Example: $200K Budget Recommendation for FY24)

Support point one (Example: This budget will give ourdepartment the opportunity to expand our resources and oﬀerclients more eﬃcient solutions.)

Supporting point two: (Example: Our earning from last year canbe allocated in X way to support this budget,)This will help you present your idea clearly and concisely. Justmake sure that your headline highlights what you’re proposingand include hard evidence or data in your supporting points tohelp you make a persuasive case.Do more than point out the problem.I once had a client who was very adept at spotting problemsbefore his team members and pointing them out. This type ofthinking is needed in every organization, but constantlyhighlighting what isn’t working or what won’t work is ultimatelyexhausting and makes other people feel shut down. No one wantsto hear all the pitfalls of their plans — over and over again.To help my client with his idea-packaging, we decided that whilehis concerns were valid and should be shared, he also needed toshift the conversation toward solutions. From then on, after

pointing out a problem, he followed it up with a simple question:“How can I help?”In your own situation, it’s similarly important to deliver difficultnews or alert your manager to a big concern. Yet it’s alsoimportant to ask yourself: How often am I doing this? Am I asperceived as someone who

always looks for problems? If so, yourideas won’t resonate. People may start to tune you out becausethey don’t want to deal with the messy situations you bring up orthey may start to believe you’re not interested in solving theproblems you bring up.Instead, aim to ease the tension when discussing difficult issues.Be prepared to discuss possible solutions as well, and if nonecome to mind, show your good intent by saying something like:“I’m not sure what the solution is yet, but I know there is one.What does the group think?”It’s not about you.Finally, remember that sharing the best idea is not a contest youneed to win. It’s not about you and your ego. It’s about youraudience, their communication preferences, and how you canmeet them where they are at.Ask yourself: How can I package my thoughts in a way that willresonate with my audience? How do

they like things presented?For example, if your manager only wants to hear the headline butyou’re someone who likes details, refrain yourself. In yourpresentation, only focus on what’s absolutely necessary to makeyour case. On the other hand, if your manager likes details butyou dislike the nitty gritty, step up and include the specifics.Remember, good communication is about considering the otherperson.

To figure out the preferred communication style of youraudience, just ask. If you’re presenting to your manager or asenior colleague, ask your peers first. Particularly if you’re new,they’ll be more familiar with the leaders at your organization andhow they like to communicate. If that leads to a dead end, ask youaudience directly. You can say: “How do you typically like newideas or data delivered to you?”A third option is to experiment and see what lands. For instance,try using visuals to make a point in one presentation and bulletpoints in the next. Pay attention to what lands best with differentgroups. Be open, curious, and nonjudgmental. Then, evolve andshift your style based on the feedback you receive.. . .If you’re frustrated because you can’t sell your ideas, focus onpackaging them more effectively. Unfortunately, no idea — nomatter how good — can be greenlit without being presented in away that works for the audience.
