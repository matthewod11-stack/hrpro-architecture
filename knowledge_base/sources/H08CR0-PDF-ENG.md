Everyone has experienced stress-inducing pressure at work: ambitious

ﬁnancial targets, tough performance reviews, and shrewd competitors,

and so on. The resulting stress can harm not just people’s personal

well-being, research shows it can also erode their commitment to

ethical behavior. This phenomenon, known as ethical fatigue, makes

it challenging to take the high road and maintain integrity when faced

# with complex decisions.

When stress destabilizes people’s ethical compass, they may

inadvertently overlook the heightened risk of ethical lapses. And when

employees focus solely on achieving their targets, deadlines, or personal

ﬁnancial goals at the expense of ethical considerations — when doing

the right thing feels burdensome compared to seemingly less-costly

shortcuts — they can teeter on what we refer to as “ethical burnout.” To

prevent this, it’s crucial to spot the signs and root out the contributing

# forces early.

Here are four warning signs that your employees may be heading

toward ethical burnout — and strategies to counteract these forces

before it’s too late.

## Increased Commercial Pressures and Targets

Setting challenging goals is standard corporate practice, with

proponents pointing to research that diﬃcult goals increase employee

performance. However, stretch goals are widely misunderstood and misused and can have serious side eﬀects, including increased risk-

taking and unethical behavior. For example, when Wells Fargo set

overly aggressive sales goals, some employees created millions of

fraudulent bank accounts and credit card applications to meet their

targets. Similarly, Volkswagen’s unrealistically high performance and

environmental targets resulted in engineers and executives installing

software in their diesel vehicles to cheat emissions tests.

Instead of viewing goals as benign, over-the-counter remedies for

motivation, see them for what they are: potent medications requiring precise dosage, consideration of adverse side eﬀects, and vigilant

monitoring. Involve employees in the goal-setting process to create

targets that motivate high performance and high ethics, leaving teams

enthusiastic and not exhausted. Solicit feedback from employees

regarding their obstacles to success. Encourage them to question your

assumptions and assure them it’s okay to disagree.

Armed with this understanding, you can respectfully push back on

unrealistic goals regardless of where they originate from. As a leader,

you need to be vigilant about validating how realistic your targets

or requests are. At higher organizational altitudes, leaders are often unaware of the practical diﬃculties and trade-oﬀs involved in achieving

a given target.

In addition, establish open feedback loops across the organization

to ensure that overwhelming commercial pressure and fatigue aren’t

“buried” within a particular group or function. When top organizational

leaders are attempting to combat lagging ﬁnancial performance, they

reach for strategies that appear rational from their altitude; however,

these same strategies, when cascaded down to middle management and

frontline leaders, arrive looking irrational. Without a two-way loop to

## communicate serious concerns, those responsible for execution often

## reach for their own irrational, sometimes corner-cutting, approaches in

response. Ron’s 15-year longitudinal study on organizational honesty

found that when there is transparency in decision-making across

functions, organizations are 3.5 times more likely to have people act

# honestly and fairly.

Finally, isolated groups are more vulnerable to ethical scandals, so exert extra eﬀort to integrate groups and teams that are more distant

## from headquarters geographically or in terms of transparency and

information access. Being further from the epicenter of decision

making and where ethical standards are set makes it easier for

local business norms to encroach, even if they conﬂict with the

company’s expectations. For example, Swedish telecom company

Ericsson, headquartered in what is commonly considered a low-risk and

highly transparent country, experienced ethical breaches in distant and

higher-risk markets including Kuwait, China, and Indonesia, among

# others.

# “Survival Mode” Thinking

Many industries and sectors are facing downturns and workforce

reductions. Under such circumstances, people often wonder if they’re

next, which can trigger stress that comes with personal economic

anxiety. It can also reduce organizational loyalty, as people might only

think about self-preservation and temporarily “suspend” personal and

corporate values to succeed at any cost in hopes of keeping their

# employment.

If you know this stress exists, instead of ignoring it, acknowledge the

elephant in the room. For example, one of Richard’s clients asked

for him to “double-down” on ethics and compliance training prior to

the company’s acquisition because the transaction would come with

signiﬁcant workforce reductions. His client tasked him to reinforce the

importance of integrity, even in times of uncertainty. By surfacing and

addressing this workforce stress instead of ignoring it, the client aimed

to keep ethics strong and top of mind during that period of disruption.

A number of our clients use “ethics ambassadors”: peers they can look

to for counsel when they feel ethically fatigued. With such touchpoints,

organizations can keep a sense of community and loyalty strong, even

under the most diﬃcult circumstances. As scholar Amy Edmondson

posits in her book The Fearless Organization, when confronted with an

ethical challenge, we’re most likely to turn to our peers and supervisors

for support and direction. As surveys demonstrate, having a cross-

functional network of ethics ambassadors can mitigate ethical stress in

the workforce by reducing the distance between those who are ethically

fatigued and those tasked with supporting them.

# Decision-Making Overload and Speed

While business leaders are often distracted by a need for speed to

## capture market share in the face of economic volatility and shrinking

## competitive advantage, too many decisions, especially in a short period

of time, can lead to ethical overload. Under such conditions, people

might think, “It’s not fair that they keep piling on all the work when I

don’t have the time, budget, or skills to do it. I have no choice but to

take a shortcut.” While such ethical fatigue can often be situational, that

doesn’t reduce the peril to both employees and their organizations.

As Max Bazerman demonstrates in his research, slower thinking is

more deliberative and ethical. However, it’s not intuitive and is often

rejected by leaders who signal the need for rapid responses to corporate

demands, especially in times of uncertainty. By encouraging slower

decision-making, you give your teams time to reach out for help and

ask tough questions when they most need to.

One of our clients, a sales leader in the pharmaceutical ﬁeld,

starts diﬃcult commercial meetings with a simple statement: “Don’t

misinterpret a mandate to move quickly and beat the competition as

a license to take a shortcut or circumvent rules. If you feel like you

are getting mixed messages about success and integrity, let’s pause and

talk about it.” By sharing clear ethical expectations at the start of tough

conversations instead of at the end, the client made it understood that

ethical and ﬁnancial success are partners. Moreover, they showed that

speed and thorough deliberation are not mutually exclusive and in fact

often work hand in hand. Deciding with haste rarely results in faster,

# better outcomes.

Yet even with the best of intentions, ethical lapses will occur, even

## minor ones, often under the pressure of shortened timelines. Another

client, who oversees compliance programs for a logistics company,

shared, “We see a growing set of employees that, when under pressure,

take ethical shortcuts, not to enrich themselves, but because they

think they are helping the company.” When that occurs, use those

opportunities to acknowledge and empathize with the intent and

transform those missteps into “intelligent failures.” When people stray

from processes, rules, and procedures, give them the runway to share

their disagreements, explore their assumptions about why it seemed

like a good decision, and be open to changes that can maximize learning

# and prevent future misjudgments.

# Envy of Unhealthy Status Symbols

When you sense people in your organization are becoming competitive

with peers as opposed to collaborative, or even envious of their

status, pay attention. These signals of self-involvement can devolve

into “Why should they get all the recognition when I’ve done all the

work?” thinking. Ironically, it’s the highest-achieving employees who

tend to be the least satisﬁed and therefore more prone to making

these comparisons. Cultural currencies — for example, attending high-

## visibility meetings, the square footage of one’s oﬃce, access to exclusive

perks, or high-proﬁle assignments — can create a zero-sum mentality

when used to compare one’s relative importance to others. And when

high achievers feel they aren’t getting their due acknowledgment, they

can be some of the ﬁrst to bend the rules.

“Sue,” a client of Ron’s, faced this challenge when one of her high

performers came to her and said, “I’m frustrated that you gave Rick

the lead on the Midwest expansion project instead of me. I thought

you’d said you would consider me for it.” Though Sue felt defensive at

the implied entitlement, she remained curious and empathic instead.

Rather than simply saying something dismissive like “I did consider

you for it, and decided Rick was the better option” and leaving it at that, she decided to engage her team member diﬀerently. She prompted,

“Tell me how you’re interpreting my giving the assignment to Rick.”

As Sue suspected, her team member saw it as a reﬂection of their own

shortcoming. Having that out on the table, Sue said:

My decision was simply about giving Rick a chance to shine. You’ve

had ample opportunities this year, and you already know you’re

one of our top performers. That level of success can’t be sustained

indeﬁnitely, and sometimes it’s ok to dial it back. I’m looking at your

long-term success, not just this year’s. I need you to learn that your

colleagues need chances to succeed as well and that your job is to

support them, not compare yourself to them.

Sue got the outcome she hoped for: Instead of withholding support from

Rick, her high performer rallied around him, sharing key client insights

and market data that were pivotal to Rick’s success — and that only they

had.

When you rely too heavily on your top performers, their dopamine

rushes and adrenaline hangovers can lead to unhealthy risk-taking

when trying to keep a track-record going. That degree of single-

mindedness can accelerate ethical burnout. As was the case with Sue,

showing that success can be celebrated without ratcheting up every

new goal is critical. Keep your highest performers grounded in integrity,

without the need to always be on the rise.

. . .

Ethical burnout often begins with what looks like benign stressors.

And that’s the best time to confront them head-on. The spectacular

Lehman Brothers, or Kobe Steel for example — were years, perhaps

decades, in the making. They began as misguided assumptions and

untested hypotheses about what success required and were hatched

in environments in which doing the right thing eventually became

too hard. If these early signals — excessive commercial pressures,

## survivor-mode thinking, decision overload and speed, and petty

competitiveness, especially from high performers — are showing

themselves, don’t wait to step in with supportive, clear leadership. The

seemingly simplest ethical dilemmas will always arrive at the worst

possible time. Prepare your employees for them early and often, before

they grow into headlines you never imagined appearing in.
