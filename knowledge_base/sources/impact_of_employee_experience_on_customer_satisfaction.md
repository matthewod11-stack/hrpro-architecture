# ABSTRACT

Employee experience is gaining much higher attention in recent years and it has the

potential to become as important or even more important than customer experience.

This Master Thesis focuses on understanding the different aspects of employee

experience, which factors influence employee satisfaction, and how these impact

# overall customer satisfaction.

The first part of this master thesis brings an academic view for specific areas of

employee experience and describes the main aspects of human satisfaction,

employee engagement, subjective wellbeing, main drivers, and methodology used to

## measure all the mentioned aspects of employee experience.

The second part explains the methodology used by the author in research on

employee experience and Net Promoter Score. The author describes surveys used

on the studied company, Atlas Copco, and research three main markets: The United

States, China, and Europe. The employee experience survey focused on capturing

employee satisfaction across the whole employee journey and researched different

aspects of EX divided into main areas of employee engagement, wellbeing, culture,

leadership, learning and development, with the addition of recruitment and

onboarding. The Net Promoter score survey was conducted with Atlas Copco

customers in different regions and focused on their loyalty and satisfaction with

# products and services.

In the third part, the author analyzes the data from both surveys and investigates

## relationships between different areas of employee experience in connection with

customer satisfaction. A third variable is introduced in this part in the form of

consolidated operational and financial metrics from the three main markets, providing

## an analysis of the relationships between EX, NPS, and financial outcome.

Results of this master thesis show that there exists a strong, statistically significant

## relationship between employee experience and customer satisfaction and confirms

the main hypothesis that positive employee experience brings higher customer

satisfaction, generating repeat business no matter the region, ethnicity, religious

# persuasion, or gender.

1.

# INTRODUCTION TO RESEARCH TOPIC

The author of this Master Thesis research document spent his career in the

automotive industry with fifteen years’ experience in sales, product management,

service management, and global marketing. The relationship between employee

experience and customer satisfaction has always been of professional interest to the

author and it has the potential to become equally as important as customer experience

to many companies. Atlas Copco gives to author the opportunity to be part of an

## automotive MBA program and conduct research inside Swedish corporate culture in

# the field of employee experience.

1.1.

# The Objective

The employee experience is recently gaining much higher attention. After the difficult

Covid times and challenging economic environment, companies are realizing the

importance of the employee experience and how affects an organization’s top and

bottom line. This document will help to understand key factors of the employee

experience which influence customer satisfaction, why the employee experience is

important, and what are the roles of employees in the customer satisfaction journey.

# The inputs of the research:

a) Using existing publications, books, and articles conducted in the field of the

## employee experience, management, and customer satisfaction

b) Individual empirical experience based on professional experience and gained

## knowledge in various positions within the automotive industry

c) Research conducted in-company where the author is employed and results

from structured surveys and questionnaires provided within same company

This master thesis should evaluate and consider following the hypothesis:

▪ Positive employee experience positively impacts customer satisfaction with

direct effect in generation of recurring business

# 1 | P a g e

▪ Elements of Employee engagement like commitment, pride, achievement,

sense of belonging and company culture are key areas of the employee

## experience and play significant role in employee and customer satisfaction

▪ Based on historical, national, or cultural differences between the United

States, Europe, and Asia, significant differences are expected in the impact of

employee experience in selected regions.

The theoretical part of this master thesis defines the employee experience and how it

impacts the customer experience and business outcomes. In addition, it explains the

## relationship between the employee experience and employee engagement and why

they are both very important. The author of this document is mainly inspired by Jacob

Morgan, a well-known speaker, and futurist, 4x best-selling author who researches

employee experience and explores how the workplace is changing. The Master

Thesis research topic is further developed in next section where the research

approach is defined and working methods are described and explained including an

explanation of the data used. The empirical research results are presented in next

## section with a critical evaluation of the findings against the hypothesis.

1.2.

# Today’s challenges

Pandemic, chip shortage, climate change, supply chain crisis, war in Ukraine,

economic instability. These are most frequently discussed topics in our everyday life

that influence human reasoning and change our everyday routines. The pandemic

caused by COVID-19 has had a significant and long-lasting effect on business and

future of work. Unemployment rates have fallen to historic lows, in Europe reported

6,6%, US

reported 3,7%

## (30.8.2022; https://tradingeconomics.com/united-

states/unemployment-rate) and a global talent shortage, also known as the Great

Resignation, is making it difficult for companies to find qualified candidates to fill open

positions. People want to feel that they are more valued and appreciated than

machines and they want a working environment that promotes meaningful work and

personal satisfaction, as well as a growth mindset. On the other side, stated in Gartner

## survey, annual voluntary turnover jump by nearly 20% this year. Every fourth

employee want to change his job. (Gartner Inc., 2022)

# 2 | P a g e

The customer experience is not a new concept at all and it is well known by most

companies. According to a Bonfyre study (Stolpe, 2022), today 89% of companies

focus mainly on delivering a differentiated customer experience. However, the

employee experience is a growing field which has the potential to become equally as

important as the customer experience. In fact, the employee experience controls the

customer experience. Based on a Deloitte survey of executives around the world,

nearly 80% of executives rated the Employee Experience as top priority, as very

important or very important for their business strategy. Only 22% of executives have

been able to successfully implement an employee experience program within their

companies. (Flynn, 2017) A Gartner study on the Top 5 priorities for HR Leaders in

2020 indicates the Employee Experience as one of the key priorities among all HR

initiatives. The biggest challenges, based on a Gartner survey in 2020, the future of

HR is linked to culture where 23% of HR leaders see a struggle and 15% see a

challenge in measuring the impact of investments in the employee experience.

Why are executives giving greater attention to the employee experience? In the

environment we live in today, people have an infinite number of alternatives for what

and where to purchase their desired product and employees also have an infinite

number of possibilities to decide where they want to work and what should be their

profession. A great customer journey is strongly related to employee engagement and

happiness, which has become a key competitive advantage. Customers who are

satisfied with the service they receive are more likely to purchase the product again,

generating additional business, and helping the organization deliver shareholder

value. Simple as it is, when company culture allows employees to grow, where they

are treated well and are happy, employees can engage in their work and find greater

purpose. They are then eager to satisfy their customers and also generate satisfaction

# for their shareholders.

People’s role in the Automotive industry

Although it has been more than a century since Carl Benz, Wilhelm Maybach, and

Gottlieb Daimler designed and manufactured their first vehicle, the fundamental idea

behind passenger automobiles has not changed significantly. Even though car

manufacturing parts have been improved a lot since then, cars in 21st century are still

powered by combustion engines that send power to road through gearboxes,

transmission shafts, and wheels, which, in connection with spring damper units,

provide driving stability and riding comfort. A steering wheel is still used to direct the

# 3 | P a g e

movement of the vehicle's front wheels, and cockpit controls are still positioned near

in front of the person sitting in the driver's seat. Significant changes, however, have

been made to the processes involved in both vehicle design and vehicle production.

What had once been the labor of a single great engineer over many years is now

accomplished by a deeply intertwined cooperative network of specialists from several

fields. All must be coordinated and synchronized on high level. With many of the new

materials and technologies which have been introduced in production, the process of

vehicle development has become much more complex than ever before. Surprisingly,

for many efficient car manufacturers in the world, it is to a very high degree, an ad-

hoc process. In 1908, the average cycle time of the Ford Model T was 514 minutes.

In 1913, Henry Ford introduced a moving assembly line and achieved an average

cycle time of 2,3 minutes. Today it is reduced to 60 seconds. After all, the development

of automobiles depends on humans. The fact that automotive development is so

difficult but also so fascinating is related to the reasons that it requires not only the

technical integration of individual parts in order to construct an entire vehicle, but also

the coordination of the efforts of thousands of individuals who come from a variety of

companies and who come from a variety of different cultural, social, and professional

# backgrounds. (Weber, 2009)

1.4.

# Atlas Copco group

Atlas Copco is a Swedish industrial group founded in 1873 in Stockholm and is a

## world-leading manufacturer of sustainable solutions for automotive and general

industry. In its early beginnings, Atlas Copco worked in railway construction where it

manufactured and sold all types of materials and tools, but began developing the first

air compressors after they were hit hard by the recession of the 1880’s. Over the years

the compressor business grew and became strong foundation for the company.

Several strategic acquisitions brought Atlas Copco the status of a world-leading

company in compressor technique. Expansion continued in other industrial segments

and Atlas Copco expanded the portfolio to include assembly tools, drilling machines,

vacuum technology, adhesive dispensing, and riveting technology for the automotive

industry. The company become strong partner for carmakers and a leading provider

of products with significant joining knowledge for car manufacturing.

# 4 | P a g e

# 1.4.1. Vision, Mission and Strategy

The Atlas Copco vision “First in Mind, first in Choice” is not meant only for customers,

but it cascades down to all employees and other stakeholders. The corresponding

mission is to “Achieve sustainable, profitable growth”, meaning that all of our efforts

are directed to producing long-lasting results while protecting people, profit, and the

environment. On a corporate level, there are six focus areas which group financial

and non-financial goals and they are separated into the objectives which help

accomplish and maintain the company vision and mission. All six focus areas have

their own targets on a group level which can vary from the targets of each specific

division. However, all divisions contribute to the overall group targets.

Fig. 1 Atlas Copco corporate goals and focus areas (Atlas Copco, 2022)

# 5 | P a g e

Non-financial areas are important ingredients to reach financial growth goals. Atlas

Copco has developed culture where employees have the possibility to grow their

knowledge and career and feel safe and motivated to bring new innovative products

to the market. It is not just a phrase: “The most valuable asset of the company are the

people”. The company provides many initiatives to drive the employee experience

journey. “The company believes that diversity and inclusion promote innovation,

strengthen employee engagement and lead to better decision making. Creating an

atmosphere where all employee feels appreciated where they can align their

individual purpose with the organizational purpose, bringing their true selves to work

every day” (Atlas Copco, 2021, p. 42)

Safety and Wellbeing is also a key part of the employee experience journey where

the company has set high priority. Covid-19 challenged all organizations and led them

to a new reality with a focus on safety and well-being by eliminating hazards and

reducing occupational health and safety risks.

Atlas Copco operates in four business areas decentralized across all continents and

serving customers in 180 countries, however corporate culture is characterized by a

commitment to people, customers, products, and innovations. The company ensures

that group culture cascades down to each employee everywhere in the world. Atlas

Copco believes “there is always a better way” and in many areas of our work we help

the company improve products or processes, but this meaning also has deeper social

aspects. For example, the company signs up for scientific targets to decrease CO2

emissions. According to CEO Mats Rahmstrom: “Our Science-based targets will lead

the way. They are the link between the Paris agreement and real actions to limit the

global warming in the world. As a leading industrial innovator and global supplier, we

can make a huge difference, also when it comes to battling climate change. We are

engaged in this race, there is no turning point”. (Atlas Copco, 2021, p. 3) Atlas Copco

with other well-known companies is fully committed and engaged to improve quality

of life and make difference for all humankind.

# Importance of Employee Experience (EX)

Every day, 365 days a year, employee experiences influence the customer

experiences, top line, and bottom line of a business in at least eight categories. An

employee exposed to exceptional experiences may take fewer sick days, be more

productive and innovative, provide superior customer experiences, and increase

sales. Additionally, this person is more of an advocate for the business and the

product and is more adaptable to organizational changes. (Smit, 2020)

Fig. 2 The effects resulting from good employee experiences (Smit, 2020)

Three studies endeavored to find some correlations.

Based on findings in research that was conducted in the HRB about the employee

experience, companies with good employee experiences outperform their competitors

by 2,3% - 3,8% per year in long-term equity returns. (Edmans, 2016). Glassdoor.com

is one of many available web sites for job seekers, employees, and others who

# 7 | P a g e

evaluate companies and other organizations. They have developed a measurement

## for their experiences as the well-known Glassdoor rating. Each organization

evaluated in this website is paired with its American Customer Satisfaction Index

score, in short ACSI. Figure. 3 shows a positive correlation: if company has a high

rating on Glassdoor, customers are happier with their service and customer

satisfaction is on higher level.

Fig. 3 The relationship between a business’s Glassdoor rating and its ACSI rating (Smit, 2020, p. 18)

This finding is also reflected in the third research part of project, which was conducted

by Answers Corp. It demonstrates the existing relationship between employee

engagement which is key element of EX and customer satisfaction for retail

companies. The trend line for this study is steeper than the trend line for Glassdoor's

# study.

## 2.1.1. Key EX facts from available materials

Different studies show that companies focusing on employee experience deliver two

times higher average revenue and four times higher profit on average while their

organization was smaller by 25 percent, driven by innovation, and much more

productive than companies lacking this focus. (Morgan, 2017) Companies which

invested heavily in EX were:

Included 11.5 times more often in Glassdoor’s Best Places to Work

- 28 times more often listed as Fats Company’s Most Innovative Companies

- Listed 2.1 times as often on the Forbes list of the World’s Most Innovative

# Companies

- Twice more often found in the ACSI

- Listed 4.4 times more often in LinkedIn’s list of North America’s Most In-

# demand Employers

Willis Towers Watson, a leading global advisory, brokering, and solutions company

conducted a 2021 Employee Experience Survey. The study represents 1550

employers and 9.45 million of employees around the world who participated between

March and April. (wtwco.com/employee experience survey, 2021). According to their

study, organizational awareness of importance of the EX increased dramatically over

last few years. 9 out 10 employers (92%) indicate that EX will be a priority in next

three years, while only 52% said that EX was priority in their organization even before

the pandemic. This shift in priority corresponds to employer views that EX drives

engagement (81%) and employee well-being (80%), as well as driving productivity

(79%) and overall business performance (78%), and that means it is creating value

for both the employee and the business. When Wilson Tower Watson surveyed

employers about the impact of the covid outbreak and associated measures, 52% of

them stated that it had a significant operating income impact, 43% that it had a serious

impact on the EX, 35% that job performance had decreased, and 37% that there had

been a negative transition in corporate culture. Research also confirms the fact that

organizations which focus on and have a strategy for EX report a 2.7-time higher

productivity and 90% of them report higher annual revenue than their peers in the

# industry.

2.2.

# Evolution of Employee Experience

Today we can’t imagine a life without a notebook, a car, internet, or phones. But

decades ago, the relationship between employer and employee was straightforward.

Employers had a job to be done, the employee had a bills to be paid and certain level

of abilities or skills they could offer to employer. There was no focus on getting people

involved, inspiring them, giving them power, making their workplaces look nice, using

modern technology, or anything of that sort. Typically, the workplace was fixed place

with a computer or notepad with a pen. In the past, people specialized in one area,

so for them was enough just to have a hammer and nails. Usually, it was a job for

one’s whole life. Jacob Morgan in his book The Employee Experience Advantage

identifies four different employment era’s (Morgan, 2017). The first one, already

described, is Utility. After the utility era came the Productivity era. In this era, we could

see the first attempts to optimize how employees worked. Everything was designed

to maximize productivity and output, the typical concept being assembly lines.

Basically, managers used stopwatches to measure every single process and how

much time it takes to complete each task. At that time, there were no robots which

would be better suited to this productivity era. As in the Utility era, there was little focus

on employee feelings or design of comfortable workplaces. In both, productivity and

output were the only focus areas.

# Fig. 5 Evolution of Employee Experience

Then came the Engagement, a completely new idea that showed the business world

that it's more important to pay attention to employees than to get the most out of them.

This ground-breaking strategy switched attention from how companies can help their

# 10 | P a g e

workers to why and how their people work. For the last two or three decades, this has

been our status quo. Although employee experience is sometimes seen as a

## replacement for employee engagement, the two concepts complement one another.

Employee engagement refers to programs and incentives that are implemented in the

near term, while employee experience focuses on cultural shifts and reorganization.

2.3.

# Definition of Employee Experience

There are many interpretations and explanations for what employee experience is

and how it is different compared to employee engagement, which are better known

terms today. Soren Smith in his book Mastering employee experience defined

Employee Experience: “The sum of all the experiences a person has as a candidate,

## employee, manager, freelancer, alumnus, and so on at or with an organization

throughout their working life and personal life (exposed, observed, felt, and sensed)

from the time the person hears about the organization, is employed, and has an

everyday experience of the organization until the time the person leaves, becomes an

alumnus, and perhaps is employed again at a later time”. (Smit, 2020)

Jacob Morgan wanted to avoid the simplistic definition of employee experience and

he described it as strong connection between an organization and employee. He sees

it as important to look from couple of different angles. The first is to look at employee

experience though the perspective of the employee, the second puts us in the shoes

of the organization, and the third is the connection between the first and second points

of view. “For the people who are a part of your organization, their experience is simply

the reality of what it's like to work there. From the perspective of the organization,

employee experience is what is designed and created for employees, or put another

way, it's what the organization believes the employee reality should be like”. (Morgan,

2017). He defines employee experience as “the

# intersection of employee

expectations, needs, and wants and the organizational design of those expectations,

needs, and wants” which he shows in figure 6.

# 11 | P a g e

# Fig. 6 Employee experience definition

According to the definition provided in the book "The Employee Experience," which

was written by Tracy Maylett and Matthew Wride and released in 2017, “The

# Employee Experience" refers

# to

# the combination of employees' subjective

impressions and feelings about company and team which they work. (Wride & Maylett,

2017). They describe the center of EX from the employee’s perspective and explain

their behavior and engagement towards the company. The value of the Employee

Experience is determined by both the written and unwritten contracts between

employee and employer, as well as what each party expects from the other.

Leadership expert Denise Lee Yohn, who is also an EX-content writer for Forbes, has

written, The Year of Employee Experience. She defines EX as everything an

# employee encounters throughout his or her relationship to the organization, from the

first contact as a potential recruit to the final interaction after employment.(Yohn,

2018)

According to company Bonfyre, which provides an employee experience platform,

Employee Experience reflects how a company treats its employees. (Stolpe, 2022) In

their framework they define three different types of experience which are connected

to each other and create the overall Employee Experience:

- 1) The Procedural Employee Experience, meaning what the work

experience is like. It comprises both the design of the work and the

organization of the procedures and processes that employees apply to

execute their tasks and fulfill their duties.

- 2) The Textural Employee Experience, describing the environment around

the work. It includes how organizations build their cultures, how they

# 12 | P a g e

arrange their workspaces, and the technology they give to their

# employees.

- 3) The Emotional Employee Experience, explaining how employees'

feelings and emotions affect how they act and think about the company

every day. It looks at how employees, both as individuals and as a group,

think about the company, interact with their peers and leaders, and

## understand and deal with their emotional environment at work.

## 2.3.1. The Procedural Employee Experience

# Matthew Stolpe (Stolpe, 2022) describes the Procedural Employee Experience as the

systems and processes that employees use while working for the company including

the actual work they are doing and how the company evaluates performance. The

phenomenon described below is universal, occurring in companies of all sizes and

across all sectors. With all the good things that new technology has brought to the

modern workplace, there has been an unintended and perhaps inevitable side effect:

employees everywhere are stressed out. Deloitte summarized their findings from

survey in Human Capital Trends (Schwarz, 2014) where 65% of executives rated

overwhelmed employees as most important trend and 44% explained that they were

not ready to deal with it. In addition to that, the companies who are attempting to deal

with it are not doing a great job as well. The Procedural EX suffers mainly from work

interruptions from social media according to 57% of employee who participate on this

research, and 72% reported that they lack access to the necessary data inside the

constraints of their own organization. Based on available research and existing

literature, the Procedural EX is the area of EX which is focused on the most. Many

companies are maximizing their outcomes by improving their processes and

structures, and implementing new technologies, realizing that great Procedural EX

motivates employees to be real-time problem solvers in field, no matter what their role

and where they are located in the organizational structure.

# 13 | P a g e

# 2.3.2. The Textural Employee Experience

The concept of "Textural Employee Experience" refers to the process of building work

environments to meet the intrinsic experiential demands of employees, such as the

need for flexibility, accessibility, inclusion, and agility. Jacob Morgan in his book The

## Employee Experience Advantage (Morgan, 2017) describes

# three different

# environment within Textural EX.

## Fig. 7 The three Employee Experience environment

# a) Physical Environment

The key element of the physical environment is workplace design and it

contributes to 30% of employee experience. According to Jacob Morgan

physical space matters and includes everything from company design of

offices, meals that the company offers, coffee break areas, organization

values and, of growing importance today, workplace flexibility: providing

the opportunity to work from home.

# b) Technological Environment

This area is linked to the technology aspect of EX and the ease of use of

company tech tools, how they are maintained, and accessibility. According

## to a Workforce Institute of Kronos International (Stolpe, 2022, p. 28)

survey, 48% of employees wish their personal technology would match

their workplace utilities and 35% of employees report obstacles in their

# work because of outdated technology

# 14 | P a g e

# c) Cultural Environment

According to Peter Drucker, considered to be one of the most well-known

and important philosophers on management, “Culture eats strategy for

breakfast”. The cultural aspect of EX is the perspective of how

organizations treat their employees, how products or services are

developed, the partnership established, and how employees actually get

their job done.

# 2.3.3. The Emotional Employee Experience

Employee experience is greatly influenced by employee feelings and emotions.

Author Lance Gibbs in his book Not my Circus, Not My Monkeys, describes the

emotional aspects of the customer experience. In a single phrase, the customer

experience is all about how the customer feels. It's all about emotions, feelings,

experiences what customer has with company during his interaction. If operations are

effective and employees are satisfied, then customers will have a favorable

impression.” (Gibbs, 2017). The Emotional Employee Experience is critical and one

of the most important elements of EX, relating directly to how employees see the

organization, both individually and collectively, how they relate to coworkers and

managers, and how they comprehend and use their workplace. The average return

on assets for businesses with CEOs and management teams that lead with

emotionally intelligent traits like compassion, forgiveness, and integrity is roughly five

times greater than for those with "poor character" leaders. When compared to

dissatisfied employees, happy employees are up to 20% more productive on the

opposite side of the organizational structure. In the end, the ideas and feelings that

employees have every single day cascade into those that they have over their

collective experiences. (Stolpe, 2022) This dissonance that arises when an

organization simply ignores its Emotional Employee Experience has a formal name.

It is known as a perception gap. It is formed when the experiences between leaders,

management and employees are misaligned. PwC and The Katzenbach Center’s in

their 2018 Global Culture Survey (PwC & Katzenbach, 2018) exposed these

perceptual gaps in practice in a comprehensive way. The C-Suite and Board of

Directors will typically be pleased with the organization's situation, but employees will

often feel disconnected from what is really happening at the company. For example,

63% of leaders feel that they have strong cultures, however this is perceived by

# 15 | P a g e

employees to be only 41%. An even more interesting statistic explains that 87% of

leaders felt proud to be a part of their organization but only 57% of employees feel

the same. According to Larry Senn’s theory, the characteristics of a leader are carried

on through the organization. Executive leaders "cast a shadow" on the organization's

lower levels by exhibiting the behaviors necessary for success in the company

# ecosystem.

Drivers and factors influencing EX

By reviewing available literature from different areas and sources such as positive,

humanistic, and behavioral psychology, the present research found the concept of

employee experience to be the whole perspective of employee life at work and it

demands regular and authentic feedback, action, and monitoring. Belonging, purpose,

accomplishment, happiness, and vigor have been recognized as the fundamental

aspects of employee experience. These aspects are a starting point for determining

drivers and results of EX. Based on Jacob Morgan, EX consists of seventeen

characteristics that may be categorized into three groups: "ACE technology, COOL

physical environments, and CELEBRATED culture." (Morgan, 2017, p. 13) More than

150 companies around the world had their top executives interviewed for this study,

and the researchers looked at 17 different aspects of employee experience. These

included: accessibility, products, organizational needs versus company needs, the

ability to invite guests, possibility for flexibility, a commitment to employees' health

and well-being and the role of leaders at all levels as coaches and mentors. In this

research, the multiplicity of culture, technology, and physical space is linked to a

positive employee experience. The researcher emphasized that "technology can

either empower people or make them powerless"

# 16 | P a g e

## Fig. 8 The 17 Employee Experience Attributes

Jacob Morgan also specified main drivers of employee experience into The War for

Talent, Technology, Poor success with Engagement, Alternative Work Arrangements,

People Analytics and Transparency. Jason Flynn and Arthur Mazor identified several

factors which contribute to positive employee experience. According to their model

represent in figure 9 – factors that contribute to a positive employee experience, the

journey starts from recruitment and continues until retirement. “Models such as this

one describing variety of factors such as meaningful work, the purpose of the

# organization, employee talent development a growth, rewards and wellness, fairness

## and inclusion or authenticity among management and leadership” (Flynn, 2017)

Fig. 9 Factors that contribute to a positive employee experience

# 17 | P a g e

On further review of scientific literature, many factors of employee experience have a

common denominator, and that is satisfaction or happiness and psychological wealth.

This refers collectively as subjective well-being. According to Ed Diener and Robert

## Biswas-Diener who research life satisfaction and psychical wealth in their book

Happiness “Psychological wealth includes life satisfaction, the feeling that life is full

of meaning, a sense of engagement in interesting activities, the pursuit of important

goals, the experience of positive emotional feelings, and a sense of spirituality that

## connects people to things larger than themselves.” (Diener & Diener, 2008)

# 2.4.1. Satisfaction

The definition of life satisfaction is more complicated than it first seems to be and

sometimes is used interchangeably with happiness, but in reality, they mean two

different things. Life satisfaction is how a person feels about their life, not just how

happy they are right now. Another popular definition of life satisfaction comes from

Stuart and Hamilton, satisfaction with life is how happy someone is with the way they

live. (Stuart & Hamilton, 1995) David Meyers is his book The Pursuit of Happiness

defining Life Satisfaction as a desirable goal in and of itself. This comes from the

Aristotelian ethical model called eudaimonism (from the Greek word for happiness,

eudaimonia), which says that good actions lead to happiness, which is the highest

good. (Myers, 1993) Satisfaction is defined by American psychologist Edwin Locke

as an emotional response or affection toward an object. (Locke, 1993) Based on Ruut

Veenhoven, Life Satisfaction is the degree to which a person positively evaluates the

overall quality of his/her life. In other words, how much the person likes the life he/she

leads. (Veenhoven & Saris, 1996) Life Satisfaction is a part of a person's subjective

well-being and life quality in perspective of the events that take place in it. (Dikmen,

- 1995) Diener has done substantial research on this topic, and he has concluded that

there are four essential components to life satisfaction:

▪ Psychological wealth includes attitude, aspirations, and level of participation at

# work in addition to financial riches

▪ Happiness is good for health, relationships, and work

▪ Setting realistic goals and expectations can be helpful for happiness. No one is

# always completely happy

▪ Thinking is a crucial component of happiness; if done properly, improving our

cognition may also improve our happiness

# 18 | P a g e

# 2.4.2. Subjective Well-being

A good working definition of subjective well-being is “the experience of joy,

contentment, or positive well-being, combined with a sense that one’s life is good,

meaningful, and worthwhile.” (Lyubomirsky, 2014) Another research document based

on Diener, Oishi and Lucas in their journal article Personality, culture, and subjective

well-being explains well-being as “the scientific analysis of how people evaluate their

lives—both at the moment and for longer periods such as for the past year [including]

people’s emotional reactions to events, their moods, and judgments they form about

# their life satisfaction, fulfillment, and satisfaction with domains such as marriage and

work”. (Diener, Oishi, & Lucas, 2003). According to different studies, subjective well-

being distinguishes between a person's subjective assessments of and emotions

about his or her life and the real circumstances of that person's existence. Many

relatively healthy, wealthy individuals are dissatisfied, and many comparatively poor

or sick people have meaningful and fulfilling lives. In some relatively poor nations, the

average subjective well-being is higher than in some relatively prosperous ones. In

addition, some nations become richer over past several decades, but the life of their

citizens has not improved. (Myers D. , 2000) Based on Ed Diener and Robert Biswas-

Diener, higher SWB individuals are likely to make more money. In general, they enjoy

better physical health and outlive those with lower SWB. (Diener & Diener, 2008)

James E. Maddux defines happiness in terms of the subjective well-being (Maddux,

- 2018) paradigm, which describes the different positive ways that individuals assess

and experience their life. Positive emotions should be felt often, unpleasant emotions

should be felt seldom, and overall life satisfaction should be high for someone with

high levels of SWB. SWB thus includes both emotive experiences and cognitive

## judgements (life satisfaction or life evaluation).

2.4.2.1.

## Influences of Well-being and Life Satisfactions

## James E. Maddux in his book Subjective Well-Being and Life Satisfaction defines

# influences of well-being and life satisfaction as Interpersonal and Intrapersonal, Self-

# Related influences.

# 19 | P a g e

I.

# Interpersonal Influences

Nearly all theoretical thinkers believe that interpersonal connection can impact overall

happiness for each individual. Strong relationships help people live longer, happier,

and more meaningful lives. Interpersonal influences have different types of

relationships,

for example romantic relationships,

# friendships, social media

relationships as well as a variety of types if interactions with others such as

forgiveness, humility, gratitude, helping behavior or the psychology of employee well-

being known as job satisfaction.

# Job satisfaction

Voluminous research has investigated the factors that contribute to global work

satisfaction, the most well-known definition of employee well-being. According to

# these studies, a number of environmental factors, such as job responsibilities, the

structure of job roles, how people are treated at work, and pay levels, are linked to

overall job satisfaction. Locke defines job satisfaction as “a pleasurable or positive

emotional state resulting from the appraisal of one’s job or job experiences.” (Locke,

- 1993) Robert Albanese explains, job satisfaction at work is a state of mind. It is both

how a person feels about their job and how they feel about different parts of their job,

like the pay or working conditions. (Albanese, 1978) Job satisfaction is a mixture of

good and negative emotions that employees have towards their jobs. Meanwhile,

when an employee is recruited, he brings with him his individual preferences,

ambitions, and motivations, which shape his expectations and aspirations. Job

satisfaction reflects the degree to which expectations and actual rewards correspond.

An individual's behavior in the workplace is intimately related to his or her job

happiness. (Davis & Newstrom, 1989) In another document written by Burton Kaliski

“job satisfaction is a worker’s sense of achievement and success on the job. It is

generally perceived to be directly linked to productivity as well as to personal well-

being. Job satisfaction implies doing a job one enjoys, doing it well and being

rewarded for one’s efforts. Job satisfaction further implies enthusiasm and happiness

with one’s work. Job satisfaction is the key ingredient that leads to recognition,

income, promotion, and the achievement of other goals that lead to a feeling of

# fulfillment” (Kaliski, 2003)

# 20 | P a g e

# Factors influencing Job Satisfaction

Several studies were conducted on factors influencing job satisfaction over the past

fifty years which highlighted a series of factors such as: The nature of the work, the

## pay, the chances for advancement, the management, the work groups, and the

working conditions. Figure 10 by Rue and Byars offers a slightly different perspective

on the characteristics that influence work satisfaction. (Rue & Byars, 2003)

Fig. 10 Determinants of Satisfaction and Dissatisfaction (Rue & Byars, 2003, p. 259)

This study explains that every human has different intrinsic motivators directly

influencing person behavior and this has an effect on overall satisfaction. Therefore,

factors which influence job satisfaction can also cause dissatisfaction in a different

person. Herzberg's Two Factor Theory (Herzberg, 1993) is perhaps the most often

quoted perspective. In reality, the core principle is that workers' work environments

are influenced by two elements, one that plays a significant part in job satisfaction and

one that does not. Accordingly, all elements determined from extensive empirical

study have been categorized as factors that lead to job satisfaction (motivators) and

ones that cause job dissatisfaction (hygiene factors), Table 1.

# 21 | P a g e

## Table 1 Job Satisfaction Factors (Herzberg, 1993)

The theory explains that motivators arising from intrinsic conditions of the job itself,

such as personal growth, achievement or recognition and hygiene factors such as job

security, salary, working conditions are extrinsic to the work itself. Dissatisfaction

# results from absence of hygiene factors.

II.

## Intrapersonal and Self-Related Influences

Intrapersonal influences include different types of individual characteristics that

influence behavior such as meaning in life, self-awareness and self-acceptance,

# religion or spirituality, materialistic value orientation or sexual orientation. James

## Maddux in his book Subjective Well-Being and Life Satisfaction (Maddux, 2018, p.

- 294) explaining, the meaning of life is a significant part of psychological well-being,

yet it is still a separate concept when compared to other aspects of well-being. By

Baumeister's perspective, meaning in life is an indicator of optimal psychological

wellbeing; people are intrinsically motivated to feel that their lives have meaning.

Another important thing that has come out of empirical research on this topic is a

clearer definition of what "meaning in life" means in human experience. According to

one such definition, “Lives may be experienced as meaningful when they are felt to

have a significance beyond the trivial or momentary, to have purpose, or to have a

coherence that transcends chaos.” (King, Krull, & Hicks, 2006) This definition

highlights three main aspects of the subjective feeling that one's life has meaning:

purpose, significance, and coherence. First, purpose related to engagement in goal-

oriented activities: Spending time and effort pursuing personally meaningful goals is

related with a feeling that one's life is more worth living. Second, significance covers

the level to which an individual thinks that life is valuable, that they will make a mark

on the world and leave a legacy that goes far beyond. Last but not least, coherence

is the level to which stimuli, events and one’s life make sense. (Maddux, 2018).

Other important parts of intrapersonal influences are motivation, goal pursuit, and

achievement where research says when someone isn't happy, it can be because they

# 22 | P a g e

don't have enough opportunities, don't have enough control over their goals, or are

not making as much progress as they want. Motivation also has a direct effect on well-

being because it helps people reach their goals. Well-being may be considered a main

or secondary outcome of motivation, as well as a source or driver of motivation.

2.5.

# The Employee Journey

In chapter 2.3 author already described definition of employee experience as sum of

all an employee's interactions with an employer, from the time they are hired until they

leave. It includes everything from major events and personal relationships to the use

of technology and the physical work environment. Soren Smit in his book Mastering

Employee Experience defines Employee life cycle as “An employee journey (EJ) is

the path an employee takes through an organization, from A to Z, that is, from the

time they hear about the organization, get an interview, and are hired through their

everyday lives as employees until they leave and become alumni.” (Smit, 2020, p. 34)

He explains that during the employee journey there are +250 employee touchpoints,

for example: first impression on an interview, lunch, or first day at a work. One

subjourney can contain hundreds of small touchpoints. Smit also identified and

described the high emotional value of touchpoints which are critical to the employee

experience. He called

# them employee moments of

# truth (eMOT), typically

development conversations and one-on-one talks. An employee has +50 eMOT’s

during their employment cycle. If an organization performs well during these special

moments, it will result in strong engagement and loyalty. Smit also identified

touchpoints which lead to inefficiency with no value creation, calling them Employee

Friction Points (EFPs). These could be bad IT systems, difficult interfaces, bad and

inefficient meetings, or email culture. An organization typically has more than 25

significant friction points. Employee Continuous Listening (ECL) is a base for

collecting insight about employees’ experiences during employee journey. This

includes all small journeys, touchpoints, and moment of truth.

# 23 | P a g e

# Fig. 11 Employee journey

The best explanation of employee journey is based on a study from Gallup, a global

analytics and advice firm. Gallup defines the Seven Essential Stages of the Employee

Life Cycle, the stages an employee goes through with an organization, from being

interested to being hired to working there to leaving at some point, and interaction that

employee has with managers and colleagues at each stage. (Gallup, 2021)

## Fig. 12 The Journey of Employee Experience

Jacob Morgan believes that is good to consider the moments that matter as moments

of biggest influence and impact on individual. Moments that matter can be the first

day at work, having a child, getting married, or promoted. It can be also buying new

house or car, leaving a company, or anything in between. These are specific moments

do not occur all the time. By concentrating on these moments, the company is able to

# 24 | P a g e

see employees as whole individuals with unique traits rather than just employees who

are there to carry out a simple task.

## Fig. 13 Types of Moments that matter (Morgan, 2017, p. 202)

Ongoing moments that matter are continued relationships with peers or managers

also including how employees interact with technology and physical workspaces.

Created moments are those special events like team building, innovation challenges,

which the organization creates because they feel it is important and are often focused

## on specific business needs or challenges. (Morgan, 2017)

# Measurements of Employee Experience

Many Employee Engagement metrics are available in existing literature, the most

widely used metrics are global in scale. Surveys typically measure satisfaction and

willingness to recommend. Employee experience is a much wider area, employee

engagement surveys are not enough to capture the entire employee journey since

they typically cover daily life but do not include experiences in small subjourneys that

influence EX. This element needs to be gathered using another method. Soren Smit

recommends using the same approach as used in Customer Experience by using

# recommendation, satisfaction, and effort-based questions across the whole employee

journey. He also specifies and calculates overall EX index as a simple average of the

EX-scores through the whole employee journey. EX index, overall = (EX index “I just

heard about this organization") + (EX index “I’m applying for a job”) + (EX index “It’s

my first day") + (EX index “I have a daily life here") + (EX index “It’s my last day") / 5.

In order to get more accurate results for specific organization preference, he also

applied weights to different areas to get an overall EX index relative to employee

# 25 | P a g e

turnover or importance of the journey. For example, EX index, overall = (EX index “I

just heard about this organization”) x weight%.

## Fig. 14 Examples of overall EX metrics across the employee journey

Another methodology and set of metrics was selected by Jacob Morgan. He was

evaluating 252 organizations with 17 questions in scale from 1 through 5 where 1

means strongly disagree and 5 means strongly agree. The whole survey was

constructed in way to capture the physical environment, starting with four questions,

then the next ten questions are dedicated to cultural environment, and finally three

questions analyze the technological environment. He also added weight to each

applied environment to get total comparable scores.

# 2.6.1. Employee Engagement

Employee engagement (EE) is biggest contributor to the employee experience

journey and is typical measurement point for most companies. It evaluates how

committed an employee is to supporting their organization to achieve its goals. The

# 26 | P a g e

definition refers to the psychological and emotional engagement employees have to

their company, their tasks or activities, and their colleagues. The rise of engagement

started in 1990’s, first appearing in an academic journal published by the Institute of

Employment Studies (IES) in article “From People to Profits, the HR link to the service-

profit chain” which demonstrates how employee behavior and attitude can improve

## customer loyalty and, thus, sales performance (Barber, Hayday, & Bevan, 1999).

According to IES, customer happiness alone is insufficient to increase corporate

success without also fostering customer loyalty. Over time, employee engagement

became the most important measurement metric with the rise of importance of

tracking the whole employee life cycle from recruiting, onboarding, retaining, until

exiting the company. A new aspect of measurement had to be added for employee

# engagement.

# 2.6.1.1. Employee Engagement Measurement

Employee engagement is measured by Gallup based on employees' answers to its

survey of 12 questions. The q12 survey is comprised of 12 actionable workplace

aspects that have been shown to have demonstrated connections to performance

results. Gallup spent years and thousands of hours conducting interviews at every

level of several companies, across a wide range of sectors, and in a number of

different countries in order to uncover these aspects. The surveys and publications

produced by Hay Group consulting, highly encourage looking not only at engagement

drivers as an essential aspect for the development of the workplace and performance,

but also at the "enablers." People who are driven but are unable to transform their

excitement into action may have an even more destructive influence on the

performance of a company than individuals who are not motivated. Over the period of

the last three decades, research has shown that businesses have dramatically better

performance when high levels of employee engagement are joined with high levels of

employee enablement. To achieve the maximum levels of financial success, staff

retention, and employee performance, it is crucial to simultaneously prioritize

## engagement drivers and empowerment drivers. (Hay, 2012)

# 27 | P a g e

## Fig. 15 Employee effectiveness framework (Tobing, 2017)

PwC developed the Employee Engagement Index to assist businesses in using

employee engagement as a way to achieve organizational objectives. Through factor,

regression, and correlation analysis, the EEI has shown a connection to operational

and workforce indicators. The PwC believes that every company and organization is

unique. Attributes that might impact employee engagement, like Advocacy,

## Commitment, Pride, Achievement, Alignment, Effort

# remain

# consistent.

Consequently, the model is constructed to also assess the aspects or dimensions of

the employee experience and, through statistical analysis, identify the organization-

## specific driver of engagement with the highest impact. (PwC, 2014)

# 2.6.2. Net Promoter Score

## 2.6.2.1. Employee Net Promoter Scores (eNPS)

Employee Net Promoter Score (eNPS) is measurement how likely employees are to

recommend the organization as good place to work. It is usually built into the

Employee Engagement survey because a single question is insufficient to reveal all

the aspects of employee needs and feelings. eNPS contains only one simple

question: How likely are you to recommend your company as a place to work?

Measurement is on a scale of 0-10. eNPS has roots in traditional customer satisfaction

survey NPS which companies asking their companies “how likely they will recommend

product or services to their family or friends”.

Calculating eNPS

eNPS responses on satisfaction scale 0-10 are divide into three categories:

▪ 9 – 10 – Promoters: these are the most satisfied, happy, and motivated employees

▪ 7 – 08 – Passives: employees who are satisfied but not passionate

▪ 0 – 6 – Detractors: dissatisfied employees, bad relationship, they would not

recommend the company

eNPS does not take Passives into consideration, so we get the eNPS score from

subtracting the percentage of Detractors from percentage of Promoters.

# % Promoters - % Detractors = eNPS

A good eNPS score is between 10 and 30 and above 30 is excellent. The average

global eNPS score across all industries is 12.

# 2.6.2.2. Employee Satisfaction (eSAT)

Employee satisfaction (eSAT) measures the level of happiness of employee in their

work or in their company. This metric will generally track factors such as company

# 29 | P a g e

culture, relationship with management, or job itself. These usually use scale questions

for rating eSAT using an interval between 1 to 5 or “least likely” to “most likely”.

# 2.6.2.3. Net Promoter Score (NPS)

Net Promoter Score is the leading metric used for measurement of customer loyalty

to a company. According to research, a high NPS score correlates directly to

increased business growth. Based on available studies, more than two-thirds of the

Fortune 1000 list currently use Net Promoter Score (NPS) to evaluate the

performance of their customer experience initiatives, and this percentage continues

to rise daily. The history of NPS is not that long. Fred Reichheld and his team in 2003

identified that the challenge with the traditional survey is that they have only a limited

possibility of capturing customer emotions and feelings or how companies can take

responsibility for their satisfaction, and they identified the most effective single

measure of customer lifetime value. One sentence: “How likely are you to recommend

# company to a friend or colleague?”

# Calculating NPS

NPS respondents give a rating between 0 (not a likely) and 10 (extremely likely) and,

responses are divided into three categories:

## ▪ 9 – 10 – Promoters: typical for loyal and enthusiastic customers

▪ 7 – 8 – Passives: customers satisfied but not loyal

▪ 0 – 6 – Detractors: not happy customer, not loyal, probably they will not buy again

NPS does not take Passives into consideration, so we get the NPS score from

subtracting the percentage of Detractors from percentage of Promoters.

# % Promoters - % Detractors = NPS

A good NPS score is between 0 and 30, above 50 is excellent.

# Goal for surveys

Every company would like to become a strong partner for their customers and deliver

excellent customer experience, great products and service. It is essential that all

discussions begin from a customer’s point of view but also consider aspects of

employees and their impact on customer experience. It demands major change in

## approach, mindset, and processes in many parts of the organization.

The benefits will be:

- Real time input from customers and the ability to respond quickly to early

# warnings

- Real time feedback from employees and understanding the main drivers of

# employee experience and satisfaction

Empirical research consists of three elements, Employee Experience metric,

Customer Experience metric, and Operational Data like revenue, consolidated profit,

EBIT and headcount. In the research section, we will compare different aspects of

employee experience based an EX-survey constructed by the author between three

markets, the United States, China, and Europe, in total 105 employees from field of

sales and service. Customer satisfaction is represented by the NPS survey for those

specific markets and the author has added operational data, which should indicate

relationship between these three elements, into the research. To begin, the author

conducted personal interviews through application teams with respected Human

Resources personnel in all three markets to determine the maturity of their EX

initiatives and how Atlas Copco scores against the benchmark. The questionnaire is

based on Ennova’s EX study from the Soren Smith book Mastering Employee

Experience (Smit, 2020, p. 59) and measures the average rank of maturity level on

scale from 0 to 100 in four different areas, EX strategical framework, data-driven

culture, implementation of a new way of working, and transformation to employee

experience. Answers are compared with 548 HR staff members who participated on

# Ennova study.

# Table 2 Atlas Copco EX maturity level

The Atlas Copco scores are in table 2 where the Atlas Copco EX maturity level is

based on the average of the three regions. According to the HR management team,

the strongest results are linked to questions one and two, which reflect the people

management strategy and vision towards employee experience. In this area Atlas

Copco outperformed the benchmark average significantly. On the other side of the

metrics, Atlas Copco’s performance in measuring employee experience and using

new technologies are below benchmark average. Comparison between markets

shows China as leading market for maturity EX with average score 66 points, US

scores 63, and Europe 51 while the industry benchmark average is 52 points.

Calculation is based on the total scores divided by the total number of questions.

# Construction of Survey

# 3.2.1. Employee Experience

The author constructed the Employee Experience survey based on 30 questions in

different aspects of the employee life cycle covering recruiting, onboarding, and

employee engagement. The survey also covered elements of eNPS and eSAT, well-

being, culture, learning and development, purpose, belonging, leadership, and

physical safety. The survey was fully anonymous and distributed via email with link to

make it possible to use a mobile phone or web browser for the questions. The

Qualtrics platform was used for survey creation and collection. The survey took place

in June 2022 and was distributed to an Atlas Copco team, representative sample of

## sales, project managers, and service management in the three regions, Americas

represented by US HUB, Europe represented by Germany and Asia represented by

# China.

# 3.2.1.1. Methodology of evaluation

Q1: What is your experience with Atlas Copco during recruitment process? –

representing recruitment and the evaluation is based on the feeling of employees

during recruitment, measures are a % between positive, neutral, and negative

# experiences.

Q10: I would recommend this company to people I know as a great place to work – is

the eNPS question. The methodology of the eNPS question is explained in 2.6.2.1,

however the main metrics are calculated:

# % Promoters - % Detractors = eNPS

The remainder of the survey is questions related to satisfaction, engagement, and

wellbeing of employees, which are evaluated on scale from 1 “strongly disagree” up

to 5 “strongly agree” or 1 “not satisfied” to 5 “strongly satisfied”. Note that score(s) are

converted to a scale of 1-100 (as illustrated below) for easier comparison (fig. 17)

where the answer of 1 (“not at all” or “strongly disagree”) represents 1 point and the

answer 5 (“completely happy” or “strongly agree”) represents 100 points. The total

score in different areas of employee experience is measured as their average score

from questions related to the employee experience area.

Detractors (score 0-6) – those are customers who are not loyal to company, a high

probability that they will not buy products or services again, and do not consider Atlas

Copco as potential supplier. They can potentially damage the brand reputation

Passives (score 7-8) – those are neutral customers, typically satisfied but

unenthusiastic and who are open to competitive offerings.

Promoters (score 9-10) – loyal customer who intent to promote Atlas Copco, they will

keep buying products and services and have strong partnership behavior

## Atlas Copco uses both metrics of NPS, Relational NPS and Transactional. The

emphasis of this study will be on relational NPS. Q3 - Q7 are related to customer

## Fig. 18 Employee Net Promoter Score Atlas Copco

Typically, one of the most essential indicators used to asses employee satisfaction

and employee engagement is the eNPS which is based on question 10 in the author’s

survey, “I would recommend this company to people I know as a great place to work”.

## Representative sample of 105 employees from sales, project management and field

service who responded to the author’s survey, 65 employees would recommend Atlas

Copco to their friends as a good company to work with, 29 are passive or neutral

employees, and 11 employees are detractors who would not recommend the

company. They might potentially resign and they represent certain risks for the

company. An eNPS score 51 is excellent and, among 1260 similar sized companies

compared on web portal comparably.com, represents the top 5% and 1st place versus

5 competitors rated on comparably. (Comparably, 2022)

# 37 | P a g e

## Fig. 19 eNPS Atlas Copco in region Europe, US and China

In Europe, an eNPS = 37 shows a big difference compare to the other two markets.

17 employees would recommend the company to their friends to become coworkers,

while 4 are detractors. However, 14 employees out of 35 have neutral opinion, this

represents 40%. In other markets, size of detractors is similar to the European one,

but the biggest differences are linked to the number of passive employees. The US

has 20% and China has 23% passive or neutral employees, while the number of

promoters represents 71% of employees in US and 66% of employees in China. The

eNPS score in all three markets is higher than the industrial benchmark, however

significant differences are visible mainly between Europe eNPS=37 and US eNPS=

63.

# Fig. 20 Employee Experience comparison

The Employee Experience survey is constructed to measure aspects of the whole

employee life cycle from recruiting, onboarding, and daily employee life measured

with the employee engagement index. A detailed score comparison is shown in figure

20 – Employee Experience comparison. The construction of the survey and

measurement method was described in part 3.1.1.1. The first metrics influencing EX

are recruiting experience and onboarding.

# 38 | P a g e

# Recruitment and On-boarding

Employees participating in the survey ranked recruitment experience as positive was

84, while neutral was 17 employees and 4 were negative. This statistic represents

successful candidates who are now part of Atlas Copco; an external comparison

needs to be evaluated.

# Fig. 22 Interview Experience from survey

## Fig. 21 Interview Experience from web source

Interview experience from web glasdoor.com shows a statistical difference in negative

## experiences. (source: https://www.glassdoor.com/Interview/Atlas-Copco-Interview-

Questions-E10368.htm). While the internal Atlas Copco survey shows a 66% positive

experience, participants on glasdoor.com surveys (total number of respondent is 208)

shows 64%. The biggest difference represents a negative experience with the

recruitment process: where 9% of existing Atlas Copco employees experienced

negative interviews, in glasdoor.com number represents 18%. The process following

the interview and recruitment is on-boarding, described in Q2 in the author’s survey:

“How accurate was your role described to you during your interview process? (i.e.,

Are you doing what you expected you'd be doing)?” And Q5: “Were you given an

overview of your career path and progress in the company?” According to the study,

onboarding at Atlas Copco is the most challenging aspect of the employee experience

since results show overall score of 66 points, which is significant lower compared to

other areas of EX. Question 5 is ranked as the worst from all questions measured in

the author’s survey and a relationship between Q5 and Q14 was evaluated. According

# to the study:

Q5: Were you given an overview of your career path and progress in the company is

positively correlated with Q14: I know what skills I will need in the future to be a

# valuable contributor to this company?

below formula: Q5: Were you given an overview of your career path and progress in

the company? = (0.745 x Q14: I know what skills I will need in the future to be a

valuable contributor to this company and (Definitely yes) Q5: Were you given an

overview of your career path and progress in to company? shows 20 of 105 datapoints

# which correspond to 19%.

# Employee Engagement

EE consist of six questions in the author’s survey related to employee satisfaction,

belonging, and purpose. According to research from the internal survey, the best

employee engagement is in US, with a score of 89. China follows with a score of 83

# 40 | P a g e

and Europe with 79. (fig.24–Employee Engagement Index in the three different

# markets)

## Fig. 24 Employee Engagement Index in the three different markets

Q10: How happy are you working at your company?

Fig. 25 eSAT: Q10 How happy are you working at your company?

Using the same metrics as eNPS, eSAT indicates that 62% of employees are

extremely satisfied, 27% are passive and 11% are negative employees or not satisfied

at all. A very similar statistic is shown in Q11: I am proud to work for this company

where 91% of scores strongly agree or somewhat agree with this statement and the

author of this document evaluated the relationship between this question and Q25: I

# 41 | P a g e

feel satisfied with the recognition or praise I receive for my work. The Qualtrics

platform was used for the analysis. According to the study:

Q11: I am proud to work for this company is strongly positively correlated with Q25:

I feel satisfied with the recognition or praise I receive for my work.

Effect size indicates whether a relationship is meaningful in a practical sense,

regardless of the amount of data. In this case represent 0.512 which is large effect.

# Table 4 Correlation between Q11 and Q25

R-squared is a measure of how well a value for one variable could be predicted by

entering a value for the other in the below formula:

Q25: I feel satisfied with the recognition or praise I receive for my work = (0.611 x

Q11: I am proud to work in Atlas Copco Group) + 0.997 which shows strong relation

# between Q11 and Q25.

# Fig. 26 Correlation between Q11 and Q25

# 42 | P a g e

In quadrant 1 (Strongly agree) Q11: “I am proud to work in Atlas Copco Group” and

(Strongly agree) Q25: “I feel satisfied with the recognition or praise I receive for my

work” shows 26 of 105 datapoints which correspond to 24,7%.

Adding a regression analysis into this model: cumulatively, the drivers in this model

explain a moderate proportion of I feel satisfied with the recognition or praise I

receive for my work. This statement is based off of r-squared: the researcher consider

an r-squared between 20% and 45% to be fairly typical for this survey research,

indicating that the model is good enough to base a decision off of R-squared = 26.2%

Relative Importance is a modern extension of regression that calculates the proportion

of the r-squared contributed by each driver in the model. It accounts for situations

where the input variables are correlated with one another, a very common issue in

survey research (known as "multicollinearity")

# Employee Well-being

This area of EX consists of six questions. Atlas Copco overall scored 80, whereas

Europe scored 75, US scored 85, which is best result, and 81 was scored China.

Nearly 50 out of 105 respondents ranked Employee Wellbeing in the highest position.

One of the highest rated questions from survey is Q27: “I feel safe at my workplace”,

where the average score was 91.

## Figure 28 Employee Well-being Index in three different markets

The lowest scored question was Q21: “My workload is manageable”, shows significant

differences in comparison between the three markets. The lowest score, 66, is in the

European market, while the US scored 79 and China with 71. In Europe, 14 out of 35

employees defined their answers as neither agree or disagree and somewhat

# disagree.

# 44 | P a g e

Q19: “I can manage my job responsibilities in a way that enable a healthy work-life

balance” is strongly positively correlated with Q20: “I have the flexibility I need in

my work schedule to meet both work and personal needs”

# Table 5 Correlation between Q19 and Q20

Effect size indicates whether a relationship is meaningful in a practical sense,

regardless of the amount of data. In this case represent 0.537 which is large effect.

R-squared is a measure of how well a value for one variable could be predicted by

entering a value for the other in the below formula:

Q19: “I can manage my job responsibilities in a way that enable a healthy work-life

balance” = (0.609 x Q20: “I have the flexibility I need in my work schedule to meet

both work and personal needs”) + 0.858 which shows strong statistical relationship

datapoints which correspond to 26,6%.

Adding into this mode Q24: “I feel a sense of belonging at my company”. Cumulatively,

the drivers in this model explain a high proportion of Q19 “I can manage my job

responsibilities in a way that enable a healthy work-life balance”. Q21: “My workload

is manageable” is the primary driver of Q19: ”I can manage my job responsibilities in

a way that enable a healthy work-life balance” and Q24: “I feel a sense of belonging

at my company” is a secondary driver.

# R-squared = 45.7%

# Leadership Index

The next important metric which is influencing Employee Experience is Leadership.

This part consists of four questions. The Atlas Copco overall score is 79, whereas the

# 47 | P a g e

European market scored an average 73, US was 83, and China ranked leadership in

# 82 points.

## Fig. 34 Leadership Index in three different markets

According to the author’s survey, leadership index in the European market is

significantly lower, ranked CLI=73 compared to US or China market. Specially Q28:

“Teams at my company collaborate effectively to get things done”, only scored 58 in

the European market, which is the lowest score in the whole survey. No average was

in the high end of the scale, and nearly half of people indicated dissatisfaction with

cooperation between teams. In the total score, only 22% of employees out of 105

responded to this question positively.

There is a strong statistically significant relationship between Q9:” I would recommend

my manager to the others” and Q28: “Teams at my company collaborate effectively

to get things done”

For statistical research, the author used ANOVA tests to determine whether the two

variables are statistically related, which typically means at least one group tends to

have higher values than at least one other group.

# 48 | P a g e

P-value = 0.0046 and Effect Size (Cohen’s f) = 0.446

## Table 6 Statistical relationship figures for Q9 and Q28

# Culture Index

Culture is another of the most significant aspects of Employee Experience and

represents a high priority at Atlas Copco. The author’s internal survey contained 4

question related to the Cultural Index. The overall Atlas Copco average score is very

high, in this case 85 points, whereas employees in the European market scored 81,

US market shows best results among three markets with a score of 90, and China

scored 83. It is interesting is to compare Atlas Copco with external sources. Based on

comparably.com, Atlas Copco scored 81/100 across all culture dimensions according

## to 95 employees (source: https://www.comparably.com/companies/atlas-copco).

Based on glasdoor.com, Atlas Copco scores 4,1 out of 5 possible points.

# 49 | P a g e

## Fig. 35 Culture Index in three different markets

# Learning and Development Index

Learning and Development is one of the critical areas of Employee Experience and

differentiates companies from good to great. Each employee requires a certain level

of on-the-job training and classroom training. Top companies arrange activities to

keep employees motivated to learn and it is no different for Atlas Copco. This last

area of the author’s survey is constructed to evaluate the Learning and Development

index and consists of 3 questions. Overall, the Atlas Copco average score in Learning

and Development is 78, whereas US and China scored the same 81, but Europe has

## a large gap with a score of only 72 points.

# 50 | P a g e

Statistical correlation between Q13: “I have a good opportunities to learn and grow at

contributor to this company”, is strongly positive. Simple linear regression R-

squared=0.262 and line of the best fit - Q13: “I have a good opportunities to learn and

grow at Atlas Copco Group” = (0.508 x Q14: “I know what skill I will need in future to

# 3.3.2. Net Promoter Score Analysis

# Fig. 38 Net Promoter Score Atlas Copco

The Net Promoter Score is a well-known customer metric which measures level of

## customer satisfaction with the company and their level of loyalty. The author

constructed a customer survey based on seven questions which generate an NPS

score and customer touchpoints. The NPS question measures customer loyalty to

Atlas Copco company through Q1- “How likely are you to recommend Atlas Copco

company to a friend or colleague?” From 90 customers who responded to the author’s

survey, 37 are loyal customers who intend to promote Atlas Copco, keep buying

products and services, and have strong partnership behavior, 34 customers are

neutral, typically satisfied but unenthusiastic and who are open to competitive

offerings, and 19 customers are not loyal to company, there is a high probability that

they will not buy products or services in the future, and do not consider Atlas Copco

as potential future supplier. They can potentially damage brand reputation. In the

author’s NPS survey, the Atlas Copco score of 20 is a good result based on the

industrial average, whereas European customers ranked experience with Atlas Copco

company the worst, scored at 3.23. US and China customers evaluate the company

significantly better where the NPS score for US market is 23.33 and in China 33.33.

# 52 | P a g e

## Figure 39 Net Promoter Score Europe, US, and China

In the European market, Atlas Copco has only 29% promoters, and a similar number

of detractors at 26%. In both the US and China, customer loyalty and satisfaction

show significant differences. Both markets have 47% promoters with 23% detractors

## in the US and an even smaller number of detractors in China.

Customer touchpoints performance on table 8 shows a comparison of different areas

of Net Promoter scores based on question 3 of author’s NPS survey Q3: “Based on

your working relationship with Atlas Copco over last 12 months, please rate how

satisfied you are with each of the following experiences:” Purchasing, Project

# Management, Delivery of products, Installation and startup, Product performance, and

# service performance.

Table 8 Touchpoint’s performance

Significantly lower results are linked to “Delivery of products”, which caused the

# largest part of customer dissatisfaction from Atlas Copco performance The average

score is 5 points whereas European market ranked it at 4,6 points. On other side,

# 53 | P a g e

## Product performance and Service performance show positive customer experience

and satisfaction where the Atlas Copco average score in product performance is 8,0

## points and service performance in 7,9 points.

## Table 9 Touchpoint’s performance Service and Products

More detailed analysis is shown in table 9, the touchpoint performance of Service and

Product. Communication with customers outscored other performance in the service

part with very strong results seen in the China score of 8,8, while US and Europe

scored 8,2. The lowest scoring part of the service performance is availability of service

personnel where Atlas Copco average is 6,0 points. Performance in products shown

in table 9, product capability to improve customer productivity scored an average of 8

points, while reliability has significant gap with an average score of 7,1 and where

Europe shows the worst reliability of products with score of 6,7.

# 3.3.3. Statistic correlations analysis

The first section of scientific work has been dedicated to simple research and

## comparison the two author surveys, Employee Experience and Net Promoter score

conducted in three different regions. In this section, the author researches factors

## which impact Employee experience and the relative importance to employee

satisfaction with question in survey, “How happy are you working at Atlas Copco”. The

# second part links Relative Importance Analysis to NPS where the author researches

which part of Employee experience has a significant impact on customer satisfaction,

relative to the importance of the question “I would recommend this company to people

I know as a great place to work”. The third part of the analysis is a comparison

between the three regions and as last part of the research, the author considers the

business implications of EX and NPS. Linear regression has been used for the

# analysis.

# 54 | P a g e

How Happy are you working at your company?

Table 10 Relative Importance Analysis: How happy are you working at your company

Based on research (table 10 – Relative Importance Analysis: How happy are you

working at your company), the most important area of Employee experience

influencing employee satisfaction is employee engagement. Linear regression shows

that employee pride in being part of Atlas Copco company (16.47%), belonging

(11.41%), acting ethically (8.13%) and safety has statistically significantly higher

## importance and higher impact on employee happiness (R-squared = 0.6555, n=106).

# 55 | P a g e

Fig. 40 Relative Importance: How happy are you working at your company

The second part of the author’s statistical verification is linked to Net Promoter Score

analysis and factors which have relative importance and impact on customer

satisfaction. Linear regression was used for this analysis (table 11, Fig. 41)

Fig. 41 Relative Importance Analysis: I would recommend this company to people I know

Research of 106 responds from employees in three different markets are correlated

with the Net Promoter score. Significantly higher importance and higher impact on

customer satisfaction of 15.93% is linked to question: “I feel a sense of belonging”,

followed by the question “I am proud to work in Atlas Copco” with relative importance

of 13,13%, both are Employee Engagement aspects of EX. On the other end, the

interview or recruitment process and onboarding has a significantly lower importance

## and impact on customer satisfaction (R-squared = 0.6913, n=106)

# 56 | P a g e

## Table 11 Relative Importance Analysis: NPS

# Differences between regions

The author of the research compared three main regions of Atlas Copco, Europe,

Asia, and Americas and analyzed main differences between them (Fig. 42). Sample

# size = 108, 95% confidence level.

Based on research, a statistically significantly higher difference than the average in

recruitment & onboarding aspect of Employee experience is seen in the US market

and this is represented by the question of “What is you experience with Atlas Copco

during recruitment process?” and “Where you given an overview of your career path

and progress in the company” with score of 2,9 and 3,9. The same statistically

significant higher difference is visible in question 22: “My company takes a genuine

interest in my wellbeing (physical, mental)” whereas US score averages 4,5 but

Europe scores much lower as their average is 3,8

# Fig. 42 Difference between regions

Economic parameters linked into research

Analysis of economic parameters of the studied company are not the subject of this

document and it represents a consolidated view of three different regions. Limited

availability of raw data of Net Promoter scores by region for respected years led to

the author’s subjective point of view of the business implication of Employee

Experience and NPS. Further statistical analysis was not possible to execute. The

attached table contains selected economic parameters taken from the researched

time period and represents all three regions. Economic results are heavily impacted

by the global economic situation influenced by covid-19, war in Ukraine, and the global

supply chain crisis. Based on table 12 – economic parameters of the studied

company, Atlas Copco company revenue reached pre-covid figures by 2021, however

significant improvements in efficiency in terms of functional cost development led to

better profitability compared to 2018 or 2019. A high statistical difference is visible in

Employee Experience where all aspects of EX have had significant improvement

when compared with the years 2017 or 2019. Net Promoter Score, which is the

customer satisfaction index, also significantly improved compared to previous years

whereas 2017 NPS = 16.15 and NPS in the author’s survey reached a score of 20.

- 4. FINDINGS, IMPLICATIONS

CONCLUSION,

# PRACTICAL

# 4.1.1. Findings

The main objective of this Master Thesis was to research the impact of Employee

Experience on customer satisfaction. The author conducted Employee experience

surveys in different regions in addition to Net Promoter Score surveys with respected

customers. Employees who participated in the survey interact directly with the

customers who were measured by NPS. The author of this document researched the

relationship between different aspects of EX and determined which factors of

employee experience influence employee satisfaction the most. Published literature

sources used in combination with author’s scientific research in Atlas Copco indicates

that positive employee experience brings higher customer satisfaction. This trend is

# clearly visible with the matching of Operational Metric data with Employee Experience

and NPS data. Difficult global economic situations impacted by the pandemic, war,

and the supply chain management crisis influenced economic results of the studied

company where revenue increase is not in correlation with EX and NPS improvement,

however significant improvements are visible mainly in functional costs development

which led to higher efficiency and profit of the company. Significantly higher

## improvement is linked to Employee Experience and Net Promoter Score. This

assumption confirms the first hypothesis that positive employee experience brings

higher customer satisfaction and also generates repeating business.

Some of the strongest factors influencing employee satisfaction are sense of

belonging, purpose, and psychological safety which leads employees to feel proud to

be working at Atlas Copco. Published literature and author research also confirms

that feelings and emotions are critical areas which impact the whole employee journey

from recruiting, daily working life, until the employee leaves the company. Employee

engagement and company culture in Atlas Copco is significantly higher than most of

the companies used as a benchmark. This also confirms the second hypothesis that

Employee engagement and company culture plays significant role in the Employee

## experience and directly influences employee and customer satisfaction.

# 60 | P a g e

The third hypothesis is differences between regions. Research shows significant

differences between the European market and US or China. Published literature

sources describe main behavioral differences between the European, American, or

Chinese mentality. By nature, Europeans are more conservative, which can partially

## influence employee and customer evaluation of questions during both surveys.

However, main regional differences confirm the hypothesis where Europe has EX

index much lower than the US and this has a visible impact on NPS where the

European market scored worst among those three regions.

# 4.1.2. Practical Implications

The main objective of this document was to understand the relationship between

employee experience and customer satisfaction, and whether regional cultural,

historical, or national differences can influence employee happiness in their whole

employment journey. The author studied many published works, used his professional

experience, and conduct empirical research with the author’s model of Employee

experience and Net promoter score surveys in three different regions. All findings are

summarized in this document and few practical recommendations for Atlas Copco are

described in following section.

# Recruitment and On-boarding

This area of EX was one the worst rated among all questions from author specific

survey. Based on this statistic, company has a significant gap starting with interview

setup. A suggestion is to educate managers and HR personal on how to conduct

interviews to give the potential employee the best feeling about the company culture

and leadership style. Emotions and feelings play a significant role in employee

experience and participants of the recruitment process have to feel comfortable in

order to match their personal values with their potential organization. The onboarding

process also has a gap where analysis shows that employees did not have

opportunities for career progression explained sufficiently. During f2f meetings and

regular personal & development reviews during the onboarding phase, the author

suggests inclusion of employee potential career path discussions and an explanation

of which skills are needed for specific positions.

# 61 | P a g e

# Physical environment

The Covid-19 outbreak challenged the physical space expectations of each

organization the most. Based on published literature and author research, employees’

expectations on office workspace and availability of hybrid working time are significant

different compared to the time before the pandemic. Offering workplace flexibility is

becoming critical part of employee satisfaction. The author strongly suggests offering

Atlas Copco employees a flexible workplace, meaning that employee can choose

whether they come to the office or work from home, or anywhere else where the job

can be done. If coming to an office, this physical space needs to represent company

core values and company culture. Jacob Morgan nicely described in his book “The

## Employee Experience Advantage”, the physical environment and the author of this

master thesis recommends a rethink or redesign of physical workplaces into

employee experience centers where employees are happy to work and collaborate

# with their coworkers.

# Technological Environment

A recommendation for a technological environment is based on the author’s 15 years

of professional experience in Atlas Copco company. Currently, Atlas Copco uses too

many platforms across different parts of organization. SAP and more versions of this

system in different customer centers, Cloud for customer, SharePoint, Teams,

Yammer, Workfront, Clevork. While most of them should make life easier for

employees, it leads to inefficiency and employee frustration. A suggestion is to review

available platforms and see from employee’s perspective which platforms are the

most efficient for them and unify their usage. A second suggestion is link to employee

expectation regarding technological platforms to the available working device. The

author strongly recommends that employees working equipment should match their

private equipment, which today is not the case in every market.

# Cultural Environment

Despite the fact that research shows culture and employee engagement are very

strong areas of employee experience and strong motivators for Atlas Copco, scored

high above industry standard, the author recommends that the company should better

## communicate company strategy, core values, and business principles. The author

## personally experienced cultural differences during his employment in Germany and

strongly suggests that culture has to cascade down from top management to every

single employee and it is recommended that few channels are used. Sense of purpose

# 62 | P a g e

and meaningful work should be linked to personal and development review with the

respective manager, and each employee should agree on their mission and role in

the company. Though Atlas Copco has a strong KPi’s and drive in diversity and

inclusion, the company is perceived not be attractive for women. Diversity must be

supported by middle management and a recommendation is to establish diversity

ambassadors’ programs in each of customer centers.

# Customer Experience

Customer experience reflects employee experience. Based on published literature

and author research, positive customer experience is essential for an organization’s

success and begins with its first customers, the people who work there. It is strongly

recommended to establish a CX strategy. As a first, ensuring that employees

understand their roles in customer experience and how customer experience affects

employees. The right set up of goals and mission are very important factors. It is

suggested to the organization that the process of annual targets should be built from

financial and customer experience aspects. Secondly, the Net promoters score and

Employee Experience survey should run regularly, a minimum on annual basis. Third,

combining NPS data and EX data, building a comprehensive 360-degree view of

# experiences and value delivery.

The integrated data may bring benefit in two key ways:

a) generating a matrix of employee and customer key performance indicators

according to main organizational groups will allow the organization to target

above average performance areas both for generating and sharing the best

examples, and for directing additional resources and training to areas below

# average performance.

b) Identifying the employee experience drivers of the relational customer

experience can help to improve both EX and customer relationship.

Great business results can come from just having a strong EX strategy which drives

employee experience and a CX strategy which drives customer centricity and the best

experiences. When you put the two together, it goes to the next level.

# 4.1.3. Conclusion

The global economic situation, post pandemic challenges, war of talents, and energy

crisis. These are the most critical challenges which each organization needs to deal

with. Every leader who is leading an organization during and after the pandemic

realized that the traditional view on the workplace and how work is structured is no

longer applicable. Every company must adapt to new way of working and the area of

human resources and Employee experience are becoming more important than ever

before. While some companies are open to flexible work arrangements, many others

are hoping to get employees back to the offices, widening the gap between employee

and employer expectations. Employees seek a sense of belonging, better working

community, collaboration, and a higher purpose of their work. They need to know that

their efforts are appreciated and valued by high level management and recognized by

their colleagues. They desire that their personal ambitions and achievements will

match those of their company. This all needs to match the digital and physical

environment which help employees achieve a better work-life balance. If the

organization wants to stop exodus of people and win the war of talent, employee

feelings, needs, and emotions must be taken seriously during the entire employee

journey. Delivering state-of-the-art Employee Experience requires a radical shift from

the standard top-down approach to one that is based on design thinking principles.

This change makes possible a company that puts its employees first to find out how

they see their own employee journey, and then offers targeted interventions that

concentrate on important moments that matter in order to enhance happiness, boost

# performance, and productivity.

The author of this Master Thesis researched how employee experience impacts

customer satisfaction and the author used Atlas Copco as the studied company.

Available materials used in this document and the author’s scientific work confirm the

hypothesis that positive employee experience brings higher customer satisfaction and

also generates repeat business. Research also confirms that sense of belonging,

# purpose, psychological safety, and well-being play a significant role in employee

## satisfaction, no matter the region, ethnicity, religious persuasion, or gender.

Companies cannot claim to know and understand their customers unless they know

the employees who directly interact with them. If a company cares for its employees,

and they feel motivated and encouraged, they will treat customers the best. If a

# 64 | P a g e

company does not care for its employees and customers interact with unmotivated,

unsatisfied employees, he will remember only a negative experience, which is difficult

to overcome.
