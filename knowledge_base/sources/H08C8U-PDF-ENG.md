Most top-down, target-driven transformation programs fail to

produce lasting results. Bain’s research on over 350 companies

worldwide found that only one in 12 target-driven transformations

succeeded in delivering sustained performance improvement. Too

often, transformations set ambitious targets but fall short of achieving

them. Worse, some organizations hit their targets on paper only to

discover that a fraction of the theoretically “executed” or “realized”

improvements translate to the corporate ledger.

It is possible to utilize targets eﬀectively in transformation, but it

requires a diﬀerent mindset and approach. Our review of successful

transformations uncovered the primary diﬀerences between companies

that succeeded in transforming using targets and those that did not.

Four actions helped the winners defy the odds:

- 1. Change leadership’s mindset around targets

Successful target-setting demands that leadership think about targets

diﬀerently. Rather than equating targets with something they must hit,

executives should view them as a minimum bar they must clear. This

preserves the beneﬁts of traditional target-setting while minimizing its

# shortcomings.

To elaborate, most senior executives strive to hit the bullseye. However,

once managers identify the actions required to meet their assigned

target, they often stop, seeing no need to identify additional steps or

strive to improve performance further. Worse, in companies that have

deployed multiple rounds of targets over a short time, executives may

have a perverse incentive to avoid exceeding targets, fearing it will raise the baseline and make hitting subsequent targets more diﬃcult.

Successful companies think of targets as minimum performance

requirements and often refer to them as such to avoid the stigma

now attached to the term targets. In these cases, leadership is explicit

about the minimum hurdle the company must clear and encourages

executives to deliver even more, typically reinforced through incentives.

This new mindset uniﬁes the organization, pushing everyone to identify

new opportunities to drive higher levels of performance.

- 2. Specify targets in absolute — not relative — terms

To be eﬀective, targets should be set as absolutes — e.g., “we will deliver

a minimum of $4.5 billion in EBIT in 2025” — rather than relative

to a baseline — e.g., “we will deliver $400 million in cost savings in

2025.” Setting targets as absolutes avoids unnecessary game-playing and

increases the likelihood that the minimum performance requirement

appears in the company’s ﬁnancial statements.

While common, the approach of setting targets in relative terms almost

always fails to produce real performance improvement. To start, relative

targets encourage counterproductive behavior among managers. Two

behaviors are most common:

- Arguing the baseline. Baseline plans are rarely stable, nor are all the

actions within them clearly deﬁned. Astute executives know this and,

in the face of targets, claim to ﬁnd “new opportunities” that in fact

were already included in the baseline, such as consolidating sales and

support locations to save on overhead costs when that was the plan all

## along. Consequently, the targeted improvements in performance never

materialize, even though the executives may gain credit for realizing

# the opportunity.

- Sand-bagging negotiations around the targets. Even when the

baseline is undisputed, leaders may deliberately understate the

potential for performance improvement to secure lower targets. This

often manifests in debates over the applicability of benchmarks or

statements regarding the limitations the company faces given its

strategy. Haggling over targets takes precedence over ﬁnding ways to

improve performance.

## In short, relative targets too often waste valuable time in discussions

around the targets themselves, rather than focusing leadership’s time

on identifying new and better options to improve performance.

In addition to encouraging unproductive behaviors, relative targets face

a practical constraint: tying them to the corporate ledger. Financial

systems are designed to measure performance in absolute terms —

e.g., revenues, gross proﬁt, EBIT. Consequently, introducing relative

targets creates a disconnect between performance tracking for the

transformation and the corporate ledger. Despite the availability of

strong tools for tracking transformation initiatives — Bain’s ARC, for

example — cost savings or proﬁt improvement targets often face

substantial “leakage.” In fact, we ﬁnd that commonly less than 60%

of “captured savings” — even opportunities supposedly reaching “L4

Executed” or “L5 Realized” stage gates — actually show up in the

# corporate accounts.

Establishing absolute, minimum performance requirements allows

leadership to determine whether the transformation is delivering results

(or not). Absolute targets minimize squabbles over the baseline and

keep managers focused on actions to transform the company.

- 3. Use the company’s budget or operating plan to monitor success

Successful transformation eﬀorts embed performance targets in the

company’s budget or operating plan. Instead of specifying targets

as savings relative to some baseline, targets are stated in terms of

## a maximum budget for a speciﬁc business activity or functional

area in future years. This allows the company’s existing performance-

monitoring process and leadership forums to drive the transformation,

rather than relying on a “shadow process” to track results.

To ensure this approach works, management must have (or develop)

a robust, multi-year budget or operating plan tied to demand and

cost drivers. For some companies, this represents a signiﬁcant upgrade

to their existing process, which may lack the granularity needed to

track spending and revenue generation at the level required to drive

the transformation. For these organizations, the investment made

to improve the company’s budgeting and planning processes will

pay dividends beyond the near-term improvement targeted by the

transformation. For companies that already have a rigorous planning

process in place, this approach leverages the company’s existing

operating system and leadership forums to drive the transformation.

Using the company’s budget or operating plan to monitor success also

avoids double counting. Because the baseline is inherently subject

to interpretation and disconnected from the company’s budget or

operating plan, the same dollar of savings can be counted multiple

times across diﬀerent initiatives. Actions taken in one area can often

drive savings in other areas, making it contentious where a speciﬁc

dollar of savings gets counted. Rather than settle these disputes, savings

are often counted multiple times, making performance monitoring

## nearly impossible and leakage inevitable.

- 4. Set more than cost-based targets

Transformation requires more than cutting costs. Generating superior

shareholder returns necessitates sustained proﬁtable growth, which

cannot be achieved through cost-cutting alone. Therefore, leadership

should set targets across multiple dimensions to prevent managers from

making short-term cost decisions that jeopardize the company’s long-

term success and, as important, prevent the organization from equating

transformation with slashing costs.

We have all seen or heard of companies that have cut costs but

failed to see an increase in market value. In years past, Eastman

Kodak, Yahoo!, and more recently Xerox, all set aggressive cost

targets and even met them, only to see their competitive performance

deteriorate and their market values decline. That’s typically because

cost-based targets often prompt companies to take actions that generate

short-term savings but undermine competitiveness. For example, in

2012, just before its take-private transaction, Dell Technologies was

advised to cut its direct sales force by more than 2,000 representatives

to match “productivity benchmarks” and boost short-term earnings.

A year later, Dell’s competitive position in PCs slid. With fewer sales

representatives, the company lost sales momentum and market share. It

took three years for Dell to hire 2,000 sales representatives and begin

rebuilding a tenured sales force, costing the company three years in its

# transformation eﬀorts.

## Beyond encouraging myopic and counterproductive actions, cost-based

targets alone can lead to organizational cynicism about transformation.

When managers and employees hear the word “transformation,” they

naturally begin to associate it with downsizing, headcount reduction,

expense cuts, loss of beneﬁts, and so on. Over time, cost-based targets

breed resentment and resistance. Instead of generating energy and

enthusiasm, “transformation” becomes a dirty word.

Successful companies establish multiple minimum performance

requirements or targets. Typically, they set an absolute revenue target

as well as one for EBIT. This approach encourages executives to ﬁnd

ways to increase proﬁt margins without sacriﬁcing growth. Increasingly,

companies are also setting non-ﬁnancial targets, such as a target

for growth in relative market share, improvements in customer NPS,

minimum Glassdoor ratings, or the company’s future carbon footprint.

The combination of multiple, absolute targets sets constraints on the

trade-oﬀs executives can make to deliver better performance, reducing

# the likelihood of detrimental actions.

Although most target-driven transformations fail, targets can be

used successfully to accelerate performance improvement. To achieve

this, leaders should view targets as hurdles, not bullseyes, and set

multiple targets in absolute terms to provide a concrete framework for

team members aiming to deliver breakthrough performance. Only by

adopting a diﬀerent approach to target-setting can leadership hope to

defy the odds and drive lasting results from their transformation eﬀorts.
