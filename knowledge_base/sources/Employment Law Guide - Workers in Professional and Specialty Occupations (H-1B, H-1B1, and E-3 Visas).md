Sections 101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) and (b1); 212(n) and (t), and 214(g) of the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, (INA) (http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?

# vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act)

as amended ((8 USC Â§1101(a)(15)(H)(i)(b) and (b1), 1182(n) and (t), 1184(g);

# ; 20 CFR Part 655 Subparts H and I (/elaws/leave-dol.asp?exiturl=http://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text- idx^Q^node=sp20.3.655.h|rgn=div6&exitTitle=20%20CFR%20Part%20655%20Subparts%20H%20and%20I&fedpage=yes))

# The INA applies to employers seeking to hire nonimmigrant aliens as workers in specialty occupations or as fashion models of

# distinguished merit and ability, using the H-1B nonimmigrant visa classiﬁcation. The H-1B1 program is for hiring nonimmigrant

aliens from Chile and Singapore as workers in specialty occupations and the E-3 is for hiring nonimmigrant aliens from Australia as workers in specialty occupations.

The INA allows employment of alien workers in certain specialty occupations (generally those requiring at least a bachelor's

degree or its equivalent). Foreign workers such as engineers, teachers, computer programmers, medical doctors, and physical therapists may be employed under the H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 visa classiﬁcation.

The INA sets forth certain prerequisites for employers wishing to employ H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrant workers. To obtain

H-1B or H-1B1 status approval, the employer must ﬁrst ﬁle a Labor Condition Application (LCA), Form ETA 9035 or Form ETA

9035E, with the Department of Labor. The employer must state that it will:

Pay the nonimmigrant workers at least the local prevailing wage or the employer's actual wage, whichever is higher; pay for non-productive time in certain circumstances; and oﬀer beneﬁts on the same basis as for U.S. workers;

Provide working conditions for H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 workers that will not adversely aﬀect the working conditions of workers

similarly employed;

Not employ an H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 worker at a location where a strike or lockout in the occupational classiﬁcation is occurring,

and notify ETA of any future strike or lockout; and On or within 30 days before the date the LCA is ﬁled with ETA, provide notice of the employer's intent to hire H-1B, H-1B1, or

E-3 workers. The employer must provide this notice to the bargaining representative of workers in the occupation in which the

H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 worker will be employed. If there is no bargaining representative, the employer must post such notices in

conspicuous locations at the intended place(s) of employment, or provide them electronically.

The number of new visas that can be issued each year is subject to a cap. H-1B visas are capped at 65,000 during a ﬁscal year; an additional 20,000 are available to those individuals who received a master's degree or higher from a U.S. institution of higher

education. H-1B1 visas are limited to 1,400 nationals of Chile and 5,400 nationals of Singapore; E-3 visas are limited to 10,500

# nationals of Australia.

Additional rules apply to employers who are dependent upon H-1B workers or are willful violators of the H-1B rules. An H-1B

dependent employer is, generally, one whose H-1B workers comprise at least 15 percent of the employer's full-time equivalent employees. Diﬀerent thresholds apply to smaller employers. H-1B dependent employers that hire H-1B workers who are paid at

least $60,000 per year or have a master's degree or higher in a specialty related to the employment, can be exempted from these

# additional rules.

The employer will not displace any similarly employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after the date of ﬁling of any visa

petition supported by an LCA; The employer will not place any H-1B worker employed pursuant to the LCA at the worksite of another employer unless the

employer ﬁrst makes a bona ﬁde inquiry as to whether the other employer has displaced or intends to displace a similarly

employed U.S. worker within 90 days before or after the placement of the H-1B worker, and the employer applicant has no

contrary knowledge; and The employer, before petitioning for H-1B status for any alien worker pursuant to an H-1B LCA, took good faith steps to recruit

U.S. workers for the job for which the alien worker is sought, at wages at least equal to those oﬀered to the H-1B worker. Also,

the employer will oﬀer the job to any U.S. worker who applies and is equally or better qualiﬁed than the H-1B worker. This

attestation does not apply if the H-1B worker is a "priority worker" (see Section 203(b) (1) (A), (B), or (C) of the INA).

The American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009 requires all recipients of Federal funds under Chapter 13 of the Federal Reserve Act or the Troubled Asset Relief Program of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008 that want to hire H-1B

workers to make the attestations required of an H-1B dependent employer that are listed above.

# After the Department of Labor certiﬁes the LCA, the employer will petition the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS)

# for approval to employ a speciﬁc alien worker under H-1B status. For H-1B1 and E-3 visas, after the Department of Labor certiﬁes

the LCA, the employer must follow the procedures of USCIS and the Department of State, which diﬀer in some respects from procedures for H-1B visas.

The Department of Labor's Wage and Hour Division is responsible for enforcement of this program.

H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 workers are granted a number of rights. The employer must give the worker a copy of the LCA. The employer must pay the worker at least the same wage rate as paid to other employees with similar experience and qualiﬁcations

or the prevailing wage for the occupation in the area of employment, whichever is higher. The employer must pay for non-

productive time caused by the employer or by the worker's lack of a license or permit. The employer must oﬀer the worker fringe

beneﬁts on the same basis as its other employees. Also, the employer may not require the worker to pay a penalty for leaving

employment prior to any agreed date. However, this restriction does not preclude the employer from seeking bona ﬁde "liquidated damages" pursuant to relevant state law. Liquidated damages are generally estimates stated in a contract of the anticipated

damages to the employer caused by the worker's breach of contract

. U.S. workers and job applicants may also have certain rights under the H-1B programs. U.S. workers employed by an H-1B

dependent or willful violator employer may not be laid oﬀ within 90 days before or after the employer ﬁles a USCIS petition to

employ a nonexempt H-1B worker in an essentially equivalent job. In addition, an H-1B dependent employer or willful violator must oﬀer the job to any U.S. worker who applies and is equally or better qualiﬁed for the job than the nonexempt H-1B alien

worker. The U.S. Department of Justice has the authority to investigate complaints of failure to hire qualiﬁed U.S. workers.

No employer of H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 workers may intimidate, threaten, blacklist, discharge, or in any other manner discriminate

against any employee, former employee, or job applicant for disclosing violations of H-1B, H-1B1, or E-3 provisions or for

cooperating in an oﬃcial investigation of the employer's compliance.

U.S. workers and H-1B/H-1B1/E-3 workers may also examine the public disclosure documents that the employer is required to

# maintain that provide information about the employer's compliance with the attestation elements.

Complaints about non-compliance with H-1B/H-1B1/E-3 labor standards may be ﬁled with a local Wage and Hour Division

## oﬃce(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact/local-oﬃces).

# Notices and Posters

There is no poster requirement.

There is a notice requirement. The employer must inform U.S. workers of the intent to hire a foreign worker by providing notice of the ﬁling of the LCA to the bargaining representative if there is one, or, if there is no bargaining representative, by posting notice of

ﬁling in two conspicuous locations at the employer's establishments, or by providing electronic notice (see below). The notice

must be provided on or within the 30-day period before the date that the labor condition application is submitted to DOL. The

# notice must:

Indicate that H-1B workers are sought

Identify the number of H-1B employees the employer plans to hire

## State the occupational classiﬁcation of the H-1B employees

# State the wages oﬀered

State the period of employment State the locations at which the H-1B employees will work, and

Where there is no collective bargaining representative, state that the LCAs are available for public inspection at the employer's

## U.S. principal place of usiness or at the worksite

The notice must include the following statement: "Complaints alleging misrepresentation of material facts in the labor condition

application and/or failure to comply with the terms of the labor condition application may be ﬁled with any oﬃce of the Wage and Hour Division of the United States Department of Labor."

If the employer is an H-1B-dependent employer or a willful violator, and the LCA is not being used only for H-1B exempt

nonimmigrants, the notice must contain additional information and must also contain the following statement:

Complaints alleging failure to oﬀer employment to an equally or better qualiﬁed U.S. applicant or an employer's misrepresentation

regarding such oﬀers of employment may be ﬁled with:

The Department of Justice, Civil Rights Division, Oﬃce of Special Counsel for Immigration-Related Unfair Employment Practices

Washington, DC 20530

Telephone: 1-800-255-8155 (employers) or1-800-255-7688 (employees)

## Web address: https://www.justice.gov/crt/immigrant-and-employee-rights-section

As noted above, notiﬁcation may occur in one of two methods: hard copy or electronic notice. The hard copy notice must be given

to the bargaining representative for workers in the occupation or, if there is no bargaining representative, remain posted for a total of 10 days in at least two conspicuous locations at each place where any nonimmigrant will be employed. Notice can also be

provided by the electronic means through which the employer normally communicates with its employees (e.g., e-mail, bulletin

# board, and home webpage).

A copy of the LCA must be provided to each H-1B nonimmigrant no later than the time the H-1B nonimmigrant reports to work at

# the place of employment.

Employers of any H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 nonimmigrant workers are required to make a ﬁled LCA and its supporting documentation

available for public inspection at the employer's principal place of business or at the place of employment of the H-1B/H-1B1/E-3

nonimmigrant workers within one working day after the date of submission of the LCA. This public inspection ﬁle must contain the following:

A copy of the certiﬁed LCA including cover pages

Documents providing the wage rate paid to the H-1B nonimmigrant worker

Method used to establish the "actual wage," including any periodic increases which the system may provide Prevailing wage rate and a general description of the methodology of the source

Documents showing satisfaction of the union/employee notiﬁcation requirements

Summary of beneﬁts oﬀered to U. S. workers and H-1B workers

Where the employer utilizes the deﬁnition of "single employer" in the Internal Revenue Code (IRC), a list of any entities included

as part of the single employer in making the determination as to its H-1B-dependency status

In the event of corporate change, the public inspection ﬁle must also contain:

# A sworn statement by a successor entity accepting all liabilities of predecessor entity

## Aﬀected LCA number(s) and eﬀective date(s)

# Description of successor entity's actual wage system Successor entity's employer identiﬁcation number

Additional documentation is required for employers who are H-1B-dependent, willful violators, or TARP/Federal Reserve Chapter

# 13 recipients:

List of "exempt" H-1B nonimmigrant workers with respect to LCAs that indicate only such exempt workers will be employed

# Summary of recruitment methods

In addition to the records listed above, every H-1B dependent, willful violator employer, and TARP/Federal Reserve Chapter

13 recipient must keep the required documentation concerning compliance with the non-displacement obligation.

Additionally H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 employers must maintain complete payroll records and make such available to the Wage and

Hour Division upon request. The records must include the following information:

Name, address, and occupation, for all H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 workers and any other worker employed by the employer in the same occupation at the place of employment

Rate of pay, total wages paid each pay period, date of pay and pay period covered by the payment, and total additions to or

deductions from pay each pay period for each H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 worker and any other worker employed by the employer

## in the same occupation at the place of employment

Hours worked each day and each week by the employee if the employee is either paid on other than a salary basis (with respect to H-1B, H-1B1, and E-3 workers and any other worker employed by the employer in the same occupation at the place of

employment), or with respect to only H-1B workers, if the worker is a part-time employee

Documentation of the oﬀer of beneﬁts and eligibility for beneﬁts provided as compensation for services

Payroll records for the nonimmigrant workers and other employees in the occupational classiﬁcation must be maintained for a

period of three years from the date of the creation of the records (or longer if an enforcement proceeding is in eﬀect) and be kept at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of employment of workers in the H-1B program.

The other records listed above must be kept for one year beyond the end of the employment period speciﬁed on the LCA, and be

available at the employer's principal place of business in the U.S. or at the place of employment.

After the LCA is certiﬁed, if there is a strike or lockout of workers at the place of employment in the same occupational

classiﬁcation as the H-1B nonimmigrants, the employer must notify ETA within three days.

Aggrieved parties, and others, may ﬁle complaints with the Administrator of the Wage and Hour Division alleging H-1B-related violations. When violations are found, the Administrator may assess civil money penalties, depending on the type and severity of

the violation. The Administrator may also impose other remedies, including payment of back wages.

Within 15 days of the date of the Administrator's determination, any interested party may request a hearing on the Wage and Hour

Administrator's determination before an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Within 30 days of the decision by an ALJ, an interested party may request a review of the ALJ's decision by the Department's Administrative Review Board.

# Employers found to have committed certain violations may also be precluded from future access to the H-1B program as well as

# to other nonimmigrant and immigrant programs for a period of at least one year and as much as three years depending on the

# nature of the violation.

An H-1B employer will generally be considered in compliance notwithstanding a technical or procedural failure if such employer

has made a good faith attempt to comply. However, an employer will not be considered in compliance if DOL or another

enforcement agency has explained the basis for the technical or procedural failure and the employer has not corrected the failure

voluntarily within 10 business days of receiving the explanation. Furthermore, no ﬁnes or penalties shall be assessed for violations

of the H-1B prevailing wage requirements if an H-1B employer can establish that the wage was calculated consistent with recognized industry standards and practices. Neither the good faith compliance defense to a technical or procedural failure nor

the recognized industry standards and practices defense to a prevailing wage violation is available to an H-1B employer that has

engaged in a pattern or practice of willful violations.

Various Federal, state and local labor standards such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, may apply to foreign workers employed in

# the U.S.
