ABSTRACT	 The	purpose	of	the	study	was	to	examine	empirically	the	effect	of	talent	management	 strategies	 on	 employees’	 performance	 behavior,	 through	 mediation	 of	 talent	 management	outputs,	in	telecommunication	industry	in	Pakistan.	Positivist	paradigm	 had	been	used	for	the	study.	A	structured	questionnaire	was	used	to	collect	data	from	a	 convenience	 sample	 of	 200	 employees	 of	 telecommunication	 industry	 located	 in	 Rawalpindi-Islamabad	 area.	 Descriptive	 statistics,	 correlation,	 and	 regression	 tests	 were	used	to	analyze	the	data.	The	results	indicated	that	talent	management	strategies	 significantly	and	positively	affect	employees’	performance	behavior;	whereas	the	talent	 management	outputs	partially	mediate	the	relationship	between	talent	management	 strategies	 and	 employees’	 performance	 behavior.	 The	 results	 provided	 new	 insights	 into	the	phenomenon	of	the	study.	It	also	offered	opportunities	to	management	to	plan	 and	initiate	appropriate	interventions	to	foster	employees’	performance	behavior	for	 organizations’	competitiveness.

INTRODUCTION	 Talent	management	has	become	vital	for	organizational	competitiveness	and	sustainability	in	 dynamic	 business	 environment.	 This	 aspect	 is	 receiving	 importance	 and	 attention	 of	 researchers	that	necessitates	further	exploring	this	phenomenon	(Collings	&	Mellahi,	2009).	 Within	the	context	of	Pakistan,	the	telecommunication	industry	is	experiencing	performance	 gap	 and	 organizations	 are	 pursuing	 talent	 management	 strategies	 to	 improve	 performance	 (Cooke,	2014).

In	 a	 study	 Mensah	 (2015)	 conceptualized	 the	 role	 of	 talent	 management	 strategies	 in	 promoting	employee	performance	behavior	through	the	mediating	role	of	talent	management	 outputs.	The	study	necessitated	further	examination	through	empirical	testing	of	the	theorized	 relationship.	This	paper	is	extension	of	the	Mensah	(2015)’s	study.	The	purpose	of	the	study	is	 to	 empirically	 examine	 the	 relationship	 of	 talent	 management	 strategies	 and	 employee	 performance	 behavior	 with	 the	 mediating	 role	 of	 talent	 management	 outputs	 in	 this	 relationship.

# LITERATURE	REVIEW

Talent	Management	 Talent	management	is	the	proactive	identification	of	the	important	strategies	and	positions	 and	 the	 deployment	 of	 the	 qualified,	 skilled	 and	 differentiated	 human	 resource	 system	 to	 attract,	 recruit,	 develop	 and	 retain	 the	 talented	 and	 sharp	 employees	 on	 the	 basis	 of	 their	 performance	behavior	(Collings	&	Mellahi,	2009).	Talent	management	entails	differentiation	 and	the	strategic	positioning	of	the	talented	employees	in	order	to	lead	towards	performance	 development	and	as	well	as	the	organizational	differentiation	and	development	(DiRomualdo,	 2009;	DiRomualdo,	2009).	Talent	management	strategy	is	the	pivotal	position	needs	potential	 for	 roles	 and	 responsibilities	 in	 order	 to	 contribute	 to	 the	 organizational	 strategic	 issues	 (Tansley,	2007).	The	focus	is	primarily	on	ensuring	compatibility	of	person	with	the	right	job	 as	well	as	role	and	responsibilities	contributing	to	firms’	strategic	goals	(Iles,	2010).	The	scope	 of	talent	recruitment	is	based	on	a	find	blend	of	internal	and	external	markets	and	the	staffing	 from	a	mixed	talent	pool	(Collings	&	Mellahi,	2009).

Management	of	the	employees	is	to	develop	the	employees	of	the	organizations	enabling	them	 to	work	better	for	the	organization	and	make	them	more	competent	in	their	skills	and	abilities,	 development	 of	 a	 differentiated	 human	 resource	 team	 and	 structure	 of	 an	 organization	 in	 order	to	facilitate	and	support	the	management	of	the	talented	employees	of	the	organization	 (Collings	 &	 Mellahi,	 2009).	 Researchers	 found	 that	 training	 and	 development,	 performance	 management,	 and	 integrated	 reward	 management	 contribute	 towards	 firms’	 strategic	 objectives	 	 (Mahapatro,	 2010).	 Retention	 of	 talent	 is	 key	 to	 organizational	 competitiveness		 (Tarique,	 2010;	 Schuler,	 2011;	 Vairman,	 2012).	 An	 innovative	 approach	 to	 talent	 retention	 based	 on	 multidimensional	 aspects	 of	 work	 life	 balance,	 an	 effective	 work	 diversity	 policy,	 open	communication	providing	employees	with	opportunity	for	a	strong	and	powerful	voice	in	 the	organization	for	their	own	rights	and	for	the	rights	of	other	talented	employees;	flexible	 working	hours,	conducive	work	climate,	and	management	orientation	towards	competence,	 fairness,	and	mutual	respect	(Gallardo-Gallardo,	2013;	Swailes,	2013;	Iles,	2010).

Talent	Management	Outputs	 The	 aim	 of	 the	 talent	 management	 strategies	 is	 to	 achieve	 maximum	 output	 from	 talented	 employees	of	the	organization	and	to	utilize	the	talented	employees	more	appropriately.

The	investment	of	talent	management	strategies	helps	in	achieving	some	great	outcomes	such	 as	employee	satisfaction,	employee	engagement,	employee	motivation,	employee	commitment	 and	perceived	organizational	support	(Byckingham,	2001).	Employees’	motivation	is	the	drive	 that	 energizes	 the	 employees	 to	 excel	 in	 physical,	 cognitive,	 and	 behavioral	 dimensions	 to	 achieve	and	sustain	organizational	objectives	with	a	sense	of	purpose	and	devotion	(Cappelli,	 2008;	Dries,	2013).	The	talent	management	strategies	provide	requisite	stimulus	to	employees	 to	demonstrate	their	best	in	tangible	and	intangible	dimensions	with	a	focus	on	organizational	 objective	(Hajimirarab,	2011;	Hartmanna,	2010;	Tarique,	2010;	Deborah,	2009).

Employees’	commitment	is	an	individual’s	emotional	attachment	to	the	identification	with	and	 the	 involvement	 in	 the	 organization.	 This	 phenomenon	 fosters	 productivity,	 enhanced	 relationship,	 devotion	 to	 achievement	 of	 organizational	 goals,	 customer	 satisfaction,	 organization	 citizenship	 behavior,	 quality	 of	 products	 and	 services,	 and	 loyalty	 to	 the	 organization	(Collings	&	Mellahi,	2009;	De-Meuse,	2009;	Barkhuizen,	2014;	Lockwood,	2006).

Employee	Satisfaction	 The	organization	determinants	of	employee	satisfaction	plays	very	important	role	(Farah	et	al.,	 2018).	In	an	organization,	proper	organizing	and	managing	the	organizational	variables	can	 increase	 employee	 satisfaction	 (Balouch,	 2006).	 Talent	 focused	 variables	 of	 organizational	 development,	policies	of	compensation	and	benefit,	promotion	and	career	development,	job	 satisfaction,	job	security,	working	environment	and	conditions,	relationship	with	supervisors,	 work	 groups,	 leadership	 styles,	 and	 performance	 management	 determine	 employee	 satisfaction	(Bakka,	2006;	Herzberg	F.	,	1968;	Warren	R.,	1989).

Employee	Engagement	 According	Cooke	(2014)	the	employee	engagement	is	the	active	and	full	performance	of	an	 employee	or	individual’s	cognitive,	emotional	and	physical	energies	and	efforts.	The	level	of	 engagements	is	observed	by	the	energy	and	efforts	that	an	employee	applies	and	that	level	of	 engagement	 highlight	 his	 or	 her	 motivational	 dimension	 of	 the	 engagement.	 These	 aspects	 reflect	 a	 positive	 and	 productive	 behavior	 that	 is	 congruent	 with	 organizational	 strategic	 objectives	(Farah	et	al.,	2018;	Meyer	&	Allen,	1991;		Allen	&	Mayer,	1990).

Perceived	Organizational	Support	 Perceived	 organizational	 support	 refers	 to	 the	 extent	 to	 which	 an	 organization	 gives	 importance	 to	 their	 employees	 or	 how	 much	 an	 organization	 values	 their	 employee’s	 contribution	and	how	much	the	organization	cares	about	the	well-being	of	their	employees,	 however	high	perceived	organizational	support	will	lead	towards	the	improvement	in	work	 behavior	and	attitudes	and	it	will	affect	the	work	in	positive	and	effective	way.	Employees	will	 feel	owned	and	cared	and	they	will	be	obliged	to	pay	and	contribute	in	the	production	of	the	 organization	and	to	achieve	the	targets	and	goals	of	both	individual	and	organization	(Meyer	&	 Allen,	1991).

Employee	Performance	 Job	performance	refers	to	how	good	and	effectively	or	resourcefully	an	individual	takes	action	 and	contribute	with	his	or	her	behaviors	(Dries,	2013).	Performance	is	a	positive	or	effective	 contribution	of	an	employee	or	individual	for	the	performance	of	the	organization	(Mensah,	 2015).	 Task	 performance	 refers	 to	 the	 behaviors	 that	 contribute	 to	 the	 core	 duties	 and	 responsibilities	 (Sageer,	 Rafat,	 &	 Agarwal,	 2012;	 Meyer	 &	 Allen,	 1991).	 Task	 performance	 indicates	the	actions	that	are	part	of	the	formal	duties	and	reward	system	that	has	been	made	 by	the	organization	and	it	refers	to	the	requirements	that	are	specified	and	mentioned	in	the	 job	 description	 of	 an	 employee	 (Sageer,	 Rafat,	 &	 Agarwal,	 2012).	 Contextual	 performance	 refers	to	the	factors	and	issues	that	are	not	directly	concerned	or	not	directly	part	of	the	job	of	 an	employee.	It	is	the	psychological	and	social	mind	setting	that	an	employee	has	and	acts	with	 his	 or	 her	 behaviors.	 Contextual	 performance	 involves	 the	 behavioral	 patterns	 and	 factors	 involving	 extra	 role	 behavior	 both	 towards	 coworkers	 and	 organization	 (Sageer,	 Rafat,	 &	 Agarwal,	 2012).	 Adaptive	 performance	 focus	 on	 organizational	 and	 employees’	 agility.	 and	 responsiveness	 to	 the	 changing	 external	 environment	 and	 aligning	 with	 the	 changes	 in	 proactive	manner	(Rich	LePine,	&	Crawford,	2010).

Talent	Management	Strategies,	out	puts	and	Performance	 Researchers	 have	 consensus	 that	 talent	 management	 strategies	 create	 an	 environment	 in	 which	 employees	 give	 their	 best	 in	 physical	 and	 psychological	 dimensions.	 The	 shaping	 of	 responsive	and	positive	attitudes	of	employees	results	in	desirable	organizational	behavior	in	 the	form	of	desirable	performance	behavior	that	affects	organizational	performance.	Strong	 empirical	 evidence	 is	 available	 in	 literature	 that	 indicate	 that	 efficient	 talent	 management	 strategies	 affect	 attitudinal	 aspects	 of	 employees	 in	 the	 form	 of	 outputs	 that	 in	 turn	 affect	 performance	(Rich,	LePine,	&	Crawford,	2010;	Kahn,	2010).

# Figure	1:	Conceptual	Framework

Statement	of	Hypotheses	 H1:	 There	 is	 a	 positive	 effect	 of	 talent	 management	 strategies	 on	 employee	 performance	 behavior.	 H2:	There	is	a	positive	effect	of	talent	management	strategies	on	talent	management	outputs.		 H3:	Talent	management	outputs	positively	affect	employee	performance	behavior.	 H4:	 Talent	 management	 outputs	 mediate	 the	 relationship	 between	 Talent	 Management	 Strategies	and	employee	performance	behavior.

METHODOLOGY	 The	study	is	quantitative	causal	and	cross-sectional	in	nature.	A	structured	questionnaire	had	 been	used	to	collect	data	from	a	sample	of	200	employees	working	in	Mobile	Operators	located	 in	 Rawalpindi-Islamabad	 area.	 Convenience	 sampling	 technique	 was	 used	 for	 selection	 of	 sample.	The	scale	for	different	variables	had	been	adapted	from	studies	in	which	these	scales	 had	already	been	validated.	The	scale	of	talent	management	strategies;	talent	management	 outputs;	and	employee	performance	behavior	were	adapted	(Rich,	LePine,	&	Crawford,	2010;	 Kahn,	2010;	Rhoades,	2001).	Face	and	content	validity	was	undertaken	through	expert	advice	 of	academicians	and	practitioners.	The	pilot	study	was	also	conducted	to	test	the	reliability	and	 validate	 the	 instrument	 of	 forty-eight	 items.	 To	 empirically	 determine	 the	 impact	 of	 talent	 management	strategies	on	employee	performance	behaviors,	in	this	study	various	statistical	 techniques,	 including	 descriptive	 stats,	 OLS	 regression,	 correlation	 analysis	 techniques	 and	 Andrew	F,	Hayes	model	used	for	examining	mediation	effect	with	model	4	were	used.

(Collings	 &	 Mellahi,	 2009;	 Cappelli,	 2008)	 methodology	 was	 used	 for	 mediation	 and	 interpretation	of	the	results	as	indicated	in	Table	5.	Firstly,	the	direct	effect	of	independent	 variable	 (talent	 management	 strategies)	 on	 dependent	 variable	 (employee	 performance	 behavior)	 is	 checked	 and	 analyzed.	 Thereafter,	 the	 indirect	 effect	 of	 talent	 management	 strategies	on	employee	performance	behavior	has	been	tested	statistically.	Here	the	value	of	t- value	is	greater	than	2,	which	shows	that	there	is	need	of	this	mediating	variable	in	order	to	 have	 the	 results	 and	 relationship	 between	 the	 independent	 variable	 and	 the	 dependent	 variable.

talent	 (MT)	 and	 retention	 management	 (RM)	 were	 examined	 and	 their	 impact	 on	 the	 dependent	variable,	employee	performance	behavior	(EPB)	was	analyzed	through	the	role	of	 the	mediating	variable,	talent	management	outputs	(TMO).	The	results	are	given	below:

In	Table	6,	the	entire	coefficient	values,	t	values,	p	values	and	values	for	the	indirect	effect	are	 given	for	each	variable.	In	the	coefficient	values,	the	highest	value	is	for	managing	talent,	which	 is	 0.1459.	 It	 means	 the	 contribution	 and	 the	 changes	 due	 to	 the	 managing	 talent	 in	 the	 employee	performance	behavior	are	almost	15	%.	The	t-value,	which	shows	the	individual	 testability	of	retention	management	(RT)	is	3.1386,	which	is	highest	than	any	other	variable.	 The	P	value,	which	shows	the	significance,	is	more	significant	for	the	managing	talent	(MT).	In	 the	indirect	effect,	the	highest	value	in	all	variables	is	for	managing	talent,	which	shows	that	 there	 is	 almost	 11	 %	 effect	 of	 managing	 talent	 on	 the	 employee	 performance	 behavior.	 According	 to	 the	 above	 results,	 in	 the	 four	 talent	 management	 strategies	 the	 best	 suitable	 strategy	is	managing	talent	(MT),	because	it	has	large	contribution	in	the	effect	on	employee	 performance	behavior	and	its	indirect	effect	on	the	employee	performance	behavior	is	also	up	 to	11%	with	the	2.6759	t-value.

DISCUSSION	 The	aim	of	this	study	is	to	examine	the	impact	of	talent	management	strategies	on	employee	 performance	behavior	and	how	these	talent	management	strategies	plays	its	role	through	the	 talent	 management	 outputs	 which	 leads	 towards	 the	 employee	 performance	 behavior.	 The	 results	indicate	the	confirmation	of	the	hypothesized	relationship.	The	results	of	the	study	are	 in	conformity	with	earlier	studies	(Kahn,	2010;	Rich,	LePine,	&	Crawford,	2010;	Sageer,	Rafat,	 &	 Agarwal,	 2012;	 Bakka,	 2006).	 The	 newness	 of	 this	 study	 lies	 in	 its	 empirical	 testing	 to	 examine	 the	 relationship	 between	 the	 talent	 management	 strategies	 and	 employee	 performance	 behavior.	 Hence	 the	 study	 positively	 contributes	 towards	 existing	 body	 of	 knowledge.	The	study	also	provides	opportunities	to	managers	and	practitioners	to	initiate	 appropriate	interventions	strategies	to	attract	and	retain	the	talents	for	positive	performance	 behavior	 resulting	 into	 organizational	 competitiveness.	 The	 study	 has	 limitations	 of	 small	 sample	 size,	 based	 on	 limited	 number	 of	 organizations,	 and	 cross	 section	 nature	 of	 the	 research.	 The	 choice	 of	 sample	 is	 likely	 to	 limit	 the	 generalizability	 of	 the	 findings.	 Future	 research	should	be	based	on	random	sampling	and	the	longitudinal	approach	is	recommended.

CONCLUSIONS	AND	RECOMMENDATION	AND	FUTURE	STUDIES			 In	changing	environment	of	uncertainty,	performance	and	sustainability	of	the	organization	is	 vital.	 Proactive	 identification	 of	 organizations’	 talent	 and	 its	 subsequent	 nourishment	 and	 development	 provide	 requisite	 stimulus	 for	 positive	 attitude	 towards	 work,	 co-workers,	 customers,	 and	 organizations.	 This	 positive	 attitude	 transforms	 in	 tangible	 performance	 behavior	 of	 employees	 that	 is	 vital	 for	 organizational	 survival	 in	 competitive	 environment.	 Organizations	need	to	plan	innovative	talent	management	strategies	enabling	employees	to	 demonstrate	 positive	 attitudes	 and	 behavior	 that	 would	 enable	 organization	 to	 achieve	 sustainable	success.
