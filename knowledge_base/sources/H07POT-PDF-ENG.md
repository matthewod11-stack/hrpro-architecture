Mass layoffs hit dozens of U.S. companies in 2022 and show no sign of

## slowing, despite the robust economy and continued growth in new jobs.

According to Layoﬀs.fyi, tech companies slashed more than 187,000

positions in 2023 alone, compared to 80,000 in March to December

2020 and 15,000 in 2021. And it’s not just tech that’s feeling the pain —

signiﬁcant cuts have come from a wide range of sectors and blue-chip

companies including the Gap, Disney, LinkedIn, FedEx, Dow, 3M, and

Wayfair, to name a few.

## HBR / Digital Article / Worried About Impending Layoffs?

You might think your job isn’t currently at risk. But with tens of

thousands of employees from scores of employers having lost their jobs

since the beginning of the year, it’s well worth asking two questions: Am

I next? And if I might be, what should I do to prepare?

While you may assume that you’re simply at the mercy of your

employer when it comes to the ﬁrst question, there’s a lot you can do

to strengthen your professional guardrails even if your job doesn’t end

up on the chopping block. Based on my 12 years of experience coaching

employees who were laid oﬀ, I’ve seen that the time to prepare is before

you’re gripped by the shock and anxiety of a layoﬀ, when cooler heads

tend not to prevail. Here are some ways to get started:

Update your branding materials.

Just as it’s important to maintain your health by getting periodic check-

ups, you should also update your resume and LinkedIn proﬁle regularly.

It’s a prudent best practice to take care of these updates before you need

# to.

How you present yourself conveys the value you can bring to an

employer and determines how they respond to you. Yet one of

the activities my laid-oﬀ coaching clients found most daunting was

revamping their resume and LinkedIn proﬁle — professional reputation

must-dos. Devastated by their job loss and stuck in questioning if

they could have changed the outcome, these individuals rarely had

the conﬁdence to catalog their accomplishments and organize them

coherently. That’s why keeping your resume and branding materials

up-to-date ahead of time will pay oﬀ in the event that you get laid oﬀ.

Assess your résumé and LinkedIn proﬁle to make sure they reﬂect the

new skills you’ve acquired and projects you’ve tackled. If you’re unsure

which quantiﬁable accomplishments have made the most signiﬁcant

diﬀerence to your employer, review past performance reviews or ask

co-workers to recall situations where you made an impact. Here are

some questions you can pose to your colleagues:

- Why did this event stand out in their mind?

- What role did you play that was memorable and why?

- What strengths did they notice you using?

You can also proactively draft a generic cover letter as a template,

and create a one-minute professional introduction to have ready in the

# event of a layoﬀ.

Develop a list of what you value most.

Part of creating your personal brand should involve self-reﬂection. But

this isn’t just about uncovering and communicating the value you can

bring to an employer — you also want to proactively identify what

you’re ideally looking for from an employer. Don’t wait until you’ve

been laid oﬀ and are applying for jobs to ask yourself questions like: Do

you need scheduling ﬂexibility to make it to coach your child’s softball

team? Are you looking for a culture that promotes from within? Do you

value ﬁnding meaning in the work you do?

It’s critical to understand if an organization can give you the

opportunity and lifestyle you’re looking for, and you can’t accurately

determine this if you don’t ﬁrst develop a list of your own top values.

This self-knowledge gives you the lens through which to evaluate ﬁt

as you look at a company. Reﬂect on how your current or previous

employers have fallen short of identifying what was critical to you

and what you’d look for the next time, and try to visualize your ideal

# scenario.

As you consider what beneﬁts you most want from an employer,

reconsider your core values and ask yourself these questions:

- What makes me happy and whole?

- What truly satisﬁes me?

- Where have I given away too much of myself for little return?

Get your finances in order.

Some organizations provide severance payouts to employees impacted

by downsizing, but not all.

If you have cash in an emergency savings account, you’ll be

better prepared, since it can supplement any severance pay and

unemployment insurance you receive. Financial experts recommend

that people have three to six months’ worth of living expenses saved up,

which means having enough money to cover essential expenses such as

## rent, transportation, food, and health care.

To be ﬁnancially ready, you don’t necessarily need to save a substantial

amount of money from each paycheck — start small and increase your

savings rate occasionally. For example, you might begin with socking

away 5% of your pay, then gradually increase that percentage. For your

emergency fund, consider investing the money in a high-yield savings

account, which oﬀers a signiﬁcantly higher interest rate or annual

percentage yield than a traditional savings account but is less volatile

than investing in the stock market.

# Divorce your personal and work data.

The pandemic forced many workers to blend their professional and

personal lives — working at kitchen tables or bedrooms and using

work devices for personal tasks. Though convenient and cost-eﬀective,

using an oﬃce computer for personal use poses signiﬁcant risks to your

# private data in the event of a layoﬀ.

In many companies, the day you’re notiﬁed that you’ve lost your job,

you must return your work computer, leaving you with little time to

remove your personal information. Keep in mind too that anything

that you do on company equipment can be monitored and obtained by

your employer. A 2022 study indicates that one in ﬁve companies are

tracking workers’ online activity or have plans to do so in the future. If

your work device contains personal data, download a copy and store it

elsewhere, like a personal cloud service such as a Dropbox account or a

USB thumb drive. The simplest way to separate personal from work data

is to use only devices you own for personal matters. Buying your own

computer is one solution — and there are plenty of new options for less

than $300 or refurbished systems.

Getting laid oﬀ can be a traumatic event, but a little bit of preparation

can go a long way. The more prepared you are, the less impactful the

layoﬀ will be on your mental health and ﬁnances — and the easier it will

be to ﬁnd a new job.
