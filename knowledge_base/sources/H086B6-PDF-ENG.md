Ten years ago, Tasha* was the seventh employee at her medical

software startup, hired as an administrative assistant to the chief sales

oﬃcer. Today, she’s grown to manage a team of eight sales people

collectively responsible for $22 million in revenue. When the chief

sales oﬃcer announced his retirement recently, Tasha expected to be

considered for the role.

Instead, the CEO announced an external search, stating that there were

no qualiﬁed internal candidates. Tasha was hurt and angry, recognizing

a harsh reality she’d long suspected: “I’m seen as I was, not as I am.”

If you’re a reliable, long-term employee like Tasha who still wants to

grow in your career but is feeling trapped by old perceptions, you’re

not alone. As executive coaches, we’ve worked with many professionals

who’ve accelerated their contributions over time, but who continue to

be seen through the lens of their past.

In this article, we’ll share why this can happen and more importantly,

what you can do about it if that employee is you.

# Why Growth Gets Overlooked

We all know people whose career has become their entire identity.

But we often aren’t aware of the professional identity that others have

assigned us — and truthfully, they may not always recognize it, either.

## George Mason University professor Sarah Wittman calls these “lingering

identities,” or old identities that persist rather than adapt to how we’re

changing. Wittman shares that as we grow or change, our identity

transitions are often invisible — unless we do the work to help others

see our changes.

While some research suggests that it can take as long as six years

to shift these lingering ﬁrst (or early) impressions, in our experience,

it’s possible to change how others see you and reset the company

narrative about your contributions. Our clients have successfully used

the following steps to increase their inﬂuence, change their leadership

brand, and reposition themselves internally to better match the leader

they are today.

Identify the perception gap. We all have words we’d use to describe ourselves. But how do others see us? Getting clear about the diﬀerences

will help you understand the gap and design actions to close it.

Take Sarah’s client Mike*, who was a long-tenured senior leader in

a consumer-packaged goods company. He’d acquired a reputation for

being emotional and aggressive due to a few badly timed outbursts in

meetings. Soon, that perception was rooted in organizational lore and

began to supersede present-day realities.

Mike, however, was shocked when he learned others saw him as

aggressive. Realizing the perception gap, he worked with Sarah to learn

strategies to calm himself when he was getting agitated, channel his

frustration into productive conversations, and get clear once again on

the leader he wanted to be. He took ownership of the space between

whom others saw and who he wanted to be.

Align your actions. As long-term employees ascend the ranks, it’s

not uncommon to have diﬃculty delegating and letting go of

responsibilities that once made them successful. Holding on to long-

held work assignments may help you feel productive, but it also means

your colleagues are more likely to associate you with your previous role

# or responsibilities.

To counter this, we often invite clients to take a hard look at what

they’re focused on each day, looking through the lens of how they can

demonstrate who they want to be, not who they’ve been. To get started

with this process, ask yourself:

- What am I doing that reinforces who I am as a leader today?

- Where am I spending time that’s not aligned to my current leadership

# abilities?

- What’s the lower-value work that I need to delegate or stop doing?

- What expectations or assumptions are others making about my work?

If you continue to spend time on lower-level, lower-value work, you may

## unintentionally pigeon-hole yourself in old impressions.

Don’t be shy with your stakeholders. Despite Mike’s signiﬁcant self- improvement eﬀorts, subsequent feedback indicated he was still

perceived as the “old Mike” — quick to anger and likely to lose his

temper in meetings. To continue his turnaround campaign, he launched

a deliberate conversation strategy with his major stakeholders: his boss,

peer leaders, and direct reports. Mike asked:

In my 360, I heard that my emotions were still getting in my way. I’ve

worked hard to eliminate that in the past year. Can you provide an

example of when you may have seen this behavior from me recently?

When asked directly, many admitted that they hadn’t seen “old Mike”

in a long time. In those conversations, they realized on their own they

were hanging on to past recollections. Mike left those meetings with

commitments from his stakeholders to watch more closely for the good

behavior — and to call him out immediately on the less desirable.

Left to our own devices, most of us default to what is known and

comfortable. That goes for our beliefs about others, too. If you’re a long-

term employee who’s ﬁnding that people in your organization aren’t

seeing you as you want to be seen, try these strategies to reposition

yourself internally and be known as the leader you’ve now become.
