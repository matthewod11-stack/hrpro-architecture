Imagine knowing a negotiation tactic that could boost your earnings

by 20%, takes less than three minutes to prepare, and only a few

seconds to implement. This powerful approach isn’t a well-guarded

Phoenician trade secret or a complex strategy devised by tacticians in

hidden war rooms — it’s simply the act of asking open-ended questions.

Astonishingly, our research has found that open-ended questions

make up less than 10% of what most negotiators say during their

conversations — a problem for anyone hoping to negotiate eﬀectively.

Negotiation experts have long advised that the key to success lies in

balancing inquiry (asking questions) with advocacy (persuasion). Yet,

until now, it has been nearly impossible to determine with hard data

what the ideal mix should look like. Our research takes us closer to

cracking the negotiation code thanks to recent advances in AI and

# natural language processing.

By analyzing more than 60,000 speech turns from hundreds of

negotiation interactions, we uncovered a deceptively simple truth:

## The more open-ended questions negotiators ask, the more money

they make. Moreover, we discovered intriguing diﬀerences in the

eﬀectiveness of speciﬁc types of questions. Is asking “Why is this

## deadline important to you?” psychologically diﬀerent — or better —

than asking “How is this deadline important to you?” or “What is the

importance of this deadline to you?” Our ﬁndings suggest that the

wording of your questions can profoundly impact the responses you

receive and the outcomes you achieve.

In this article, we explore how asking open-ended questions can

transform your negotiation outcomes. Whether you’re negotiating a

business deal, a salary increase, or convincing a toddler to eat broccoli,

understanding the power of question-asking can give you a signiﬁcant

# edge.

## Leveraging AI to Understand Micro Behaviors in Negotiation

Our team developed algorithms to analyze hundreds of hours

of negotiation recordings from MBAs and executives worldwide.

We meticulously examined communication behaviors down to the

millisecond to uncover what leads to success at the bargaining table.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Most Effective Negotiation Tactic, According to AI

Among the factors we considered — such as who made the ﬁrst oﬀer,

how much a negotiator smiled, their speaking speed, interruptions,

pronoun usage, and whether they acted tough, polite, or warm — the

biggest predictor of personal success was the number of open-ended

questions they asked. Remarkably, there seemed to be no upper limit to

the beneﬁts of asking more questions. The more open-ended questions

asked, the higher the gains. Even more striking, most negotiators did

not ask enough questions: Fewer than one in 10 conversational turns

contained an open-ended question — a costly strategic error.

Digging into the question advantage, we found that open-ended

questions prompt responses that are roughly twice as long — and

## twice as informative — as responses to closed-ended questions or

non-question statements. This depth of information gave negotiators

## a better understanding of their counterparts’ positions, interests, and

constraints, leading to more eﬀective proposals and, ultimately, better

outcomes. Notably, asking closed-ended questions did not lead to

# higher gains.

To substantiate our ﬁndings, we conducted a controlled experiment

with participants assigned the role of a business owner or a property manager, negotiating the terms of a business lease for an oﬃce space in

London. Negotiators had secret objectives and were compensated based

on how well they met them. The business owner aimed to secure four

parking spots, get a ﬁber-optic connection for Internet service installed,

and preferred moving next quarter. The property manager wanted the

tenant to move in next week, keep the current old internet cables, and

no parking spots.

Participants playing the business owner role were randomly assigned to

either an open-ended question condition, where they prepared three

open-ended questions, or a control condition, where they prepared

three statements. Participants assigned to the property manager role

were naive to their partner’s question-asking intervention.

We observed profound diﬀerences in outcomes based on how

negotiators structured their questions. Let’s consider two contrasting

# conversations from our participants:

In the ﬁrst conversation, Julia, playing the part of the business owner,

skillfully used open-ended questions to explore what Mike, the property

manager, cared about. She began by asking, “Which of the three

issues is the most important to you?” This immediately revealed that

Mike cared most about an expedient move-in date. Julia seized this

information and suggested a trade-oﬀ: She’d consider moving in sooner

if he granted her four parking spaces.

Mike, eager to close the deal, oﬀered three parking spaces. Instead of

haggling, Julia pivoted with another question: “What are you willing to

oﬀer for Internet?” This prompted Mike to sweeten the deal by replacing

the old internet cables with ﬁber-optic cable — a win for Julia. However,

Mike stood ﬁrm on oﬀering only three spots. Rather than pushing back

directly, Julia asked another question: “How important is the move-in

date for you?” This led Mike to stress the urgency of the start date,

reminding himself of its priority. Sensing an opportune moment, Julia

made her ﬁnal oﬀer: She’d agree to move in next week in exchange for

the top-tier internet and all four parking spots. This secured the deal,

meeting nearly all her objectives (and fulﬁlling Mike’s needs as well).

In contrast, let’s track a conversation between Alex, playing the role of

business owner, and Oscar, the property manager. Alex started with a

closed question: “I’m looking to move in three months. Do you have

anything available?” This allowed Oscar, the property manager, to give a

short, clipped answer (“yes”) and then take control of the conversation.

Oscar oﬀered one parking space and the existing old internet cables if

he stuck to the three-month timeline, or two spaces if Alex could move

# in sooner.

Instead of digging deeper, Alex followed up with another closed

question: “Any possibility of installing ﬁber-optic for the Internet

connection at any stage?” This prompted Oscar to oﬀer it, but with only

two parking spaces if Alex moved in next week. When Alex countered

with yet another closed-ended question — whether Oscar would agree

to a one-month move-in — Oscar reverted back to oﬀering old internet

cables and just one parking space.

Alex’s closed-ended questions provided little insight into Oscar’s

priorities, leading to uninformed proposals. In the end, both Alex and

Oscar walked away with almost none of what they wanted, highlighting

how a lack of good questioning can lead to poor outcomes for everyone

involved.

These examples illustrate our broader ﬁndings: Negotiators in the

open-ended question condition achieved over 20% higher personal

gains than those in the control condition. Crucially, these gains didn’t

come at the expense of their counterparts. Instead, they resulted

from smarter agreements in which both parties discovered mutually

# beneﬁcial solutions.

# Different Types of Open-Ended Questions

Aiming to ask more open-ended questions is a great place to start. But

not all open-ended questions are created equal. The type of open-ended

question you ask can signiﬁcantly inﬂuence the tone and content of the

response, as well as the overall success of the negotiation. To examine

question types in action, consider the cases of Judith and Kate, two

business owners in our negotiation experiment, each negotiating the

## move-in date with their respective property managers.

Judith asked, “Why do you need us to move in next week?” Her property

manager responded, “Look, I’ve got other tenants to manage, and if you

delay, it’s going to mess up my entire schedule. I’ve already bent over

backward to get you what you wanted, but this is non-negotiable.”

Judith’s question uncovered the utmost importance of the move-in date

for the landlord (italicized terms), but the response also carried some

# irritation (bolded terms).

Kate, on the other hand, asked, “How would moving in next week help

your business?” Her property manager replied, “Well, moving in next

week would be great for us. It keeps our leasing plan on schedule and

helps me coordinate better with the other tenants.” While it was less

obvious that the move-in date was the landlord’s most critical concern,

the tone was more relaxed and collaborative.

As illustrated in these examples, we analyzed responses to more than

## 4,500 open-ended questions from negotiators — and the responses

they elicited. Our language models extracted both strategic information

disclosure (italicized) and emotional tone (bolded) from the responses.

We found that asking “Why” questions often elicited longer, more

detailed responses, revealing useful information but also leading

to more negative sentiment. In contrast, “How” questions tended

to generate positive sentiment but less detailed responses. “What”

questions fell in between, providing a balance between gathering

information and maintaining a neutral or positive tone.

questions into their toolkit. Here are some practical tips to leverage this

# strategy:

- 1. Prepare open-ended questions in advance.

Before entering a negotiation, take the time to write down three to ﬁve

open-ended questions you could ask to uncover valuable information

about your counterpart’s needs and constraints. Examples of powerful

questions include “Why is this issue important to you?” “What is the

biggest challenge you face?” “What do you care about?” or “How do we

move forward?”

- 2. Turn closed-ended questions into open-ended ones.

Actively transform your usual closed-ended questions into open-ended

formats. For instance, instead of asking, “Is this your ﬁnal oﬀer?” try

asking, “What factors inﬂuence your ﬁnal oﬀer?” Instead of asking,

“Do you need this by Friday?” ask, “Why do you need it done so

soon?” Then, use these more informative responses to craft compelling

# counter-proposals.

- 3. Balance inquiry with relationship-building.

You may have uncovered your counterparts’ interests and constraints

like a pro, but you’re still unlikely to get those extra concessions if

they don’t like you. Make sure you strategically balance “why,” “what,”

and “how” questions throughout the conversation to gather in-depth

information and build and maintain good rapport.

Negotiation is a core leadership and life skill — one that inﬂuences

everything from the prices we pay and the salaries we earn to who

picks up the kids from school. Despite its pervasiveness, people often

overlook a simple strategy to achieve better outcomes: asking more

open-ended questions, a strategy that is much easier if you spend just

a couple of minutes brainstorming open-ended questions before the

negotiation begins.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Most Effective Negotiation Tactic, According to AI

Prior work suggests that we shy away from asking questions out

of fear of appearing incompetent or because we overestimate our

persuasive powers. There is no doubt that assertiveness is essential at

the bargaining table. However, our microscopic dive into negotiation

conversations reveals a major imbalance in how people naturally pursue

their goals to inﬂuence and learn. Most of us spend our time pitching

and defending our positions without asking enough about the other

side: working to discover what they want and why they want it.

By preparing and incorporating a mix of why, what, and how questions

into our negotiations, we can uncover valuable information, build

stronger relationships, and ultimately achieve better outcomes. So, the

next time you’re at the negotiation table, remember: less pitching, more

asking. You might be surprised at what you learn — and how much you
