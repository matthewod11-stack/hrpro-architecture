## Despite an avalanche of initiatives in cross-sector collaboration and

open innovation, businesses still struggle to develop game-changing

ideas and bring them to market. Many people argue that the problem is

that we still don’t have enough new ideas, and we need to work harder

at getting diverse people into the conversation. New, imaginative ideas

wouldn’t hurt, of course, but that prescription misses an important

truth: Successful innovation involves more than just letting a thousand

# ideas bloom.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Nurturing Innovation

As studies of hackathons and other accelerated forms of innovation

## show, all too often very little happens after the initial brainstorming

phase. The organizers of these initiatives tend to focus on facilitating

the collision of ideas and talents without planning for the long term.

Those taking part in the initiatives enter with every intention of making

a long-term commitment, but most are unprepared for or underestimate

what lies ahead.

The reality is, innovation is more than generating an idea—it is a long,

collaborative journey. Daniel Epstein, the CEO of Unreasonable Group,

an organization that brings together a global network of entrepreneurs

who are tackling some of the world’s most pressing challenges with

investors, creatives, and business leaders, explains it like this: “Business

in the 20th century was oftentimes deﬁned by having a competitive

advantage. Business in the 21st century will be deﬁned by having a

collaborative advantage.” A considerable body of academic research

## into social networks, psychology, creativity, and the entrepreneurial

process validates that point of view. It shows that innovation is more

likely to succeed when it is a curated process in which an intermediary

takes responsibility for sparking and sustaining collaboration among

the people involved.

In this article, we draw on that research and on our own and describe

the crucial roles that intermediaries can play. We show how they can

## support innovative collaboration throughout the innovation journey—

from providing opportunities for innovators to make connections, to

helping them develop those connections into relationships, and ﬁnally

to sustaining and refreshing those relationships as the collaboration

# evolves.

# [ Step 1 ]

# Making Connections

Beyond simply bringing people together and providing a structure for

their conversations, the intermediary must spark trusting relationships.

A good example of how to do that comes from Unreasonable Impact

## (UI), a partnership between Barclays and Unreasonable Group. (We

have worked with all three of these organizations in various capacities,

including as mentors, academic advisers, and clients.) UI provides a

network of entrepreneurs with the resources they need to develop their

ventures and solve challenges that arise in order to rapidly scale.

UI runs three programs each year that bring together a select group

of growth-stage businesses. Those programs typically last from ﬁve

to seven days, and include sessions that address entrepreneurs’

critical needs, from understanding regulatory shifts to scaling up

manufacturing. Entrepreneurs also have the opportunity to connect, get

feedback, and share concerns. To date, the participants have built more

than 300 ventures across 53 countries, generated more than $7 billion in

revenue, and hired more than 25,000 full-time employees.

To understand the process better, and as part of Accenture’s research

on the power of cross-sector collaborations to address complex social

issues, three of us conducted a series of interviews and workshops with

28 collaborators. We found that UI’s success in setting up collaborations

can be largely attributed to two factors.

Careful selection. Most open-innovation research has focused on

deﬁning the most generative framing for challenges and how best to

broaden participation. UI takes a diﬀerent approach: It handpicks the

projects and the people invited to join its community. In addition to

considering ﬁnancials, the social impact of businesses, and the diversity

of the broader community, the UI team makes sure that the venture

founders it invites are aligned with the mission, values, and beliefs of

# the UI community.

The selection process is rigorous, and success isn’t the only criteria.

UI team members look for personalities they believe will contribute to

the community, and that means being able to collaborate well. One UI

fellow we spoke with says, “I just trust the Unreasonable community to

be people with the passion and heart to serve the community.”

Felicity McCabe photographed circus troupe trainees in Ulaanbaatar, Mongolia, for her project 42 Feet, documenting their passion, endurance, and ambition.

The Unreasonable team works to create what Harvard Business School

professor Amy Edmondson calls “team psychological safety”—that

is, an environment in which entrepreneurs feel comfortable sharing

stories of both successes and challenges. At Unreasonable, they believe

that equalizing the power dynamics between mentors and mentees

is key to achieving such a state, to the extent that they avoid using

those terms. Instead, UI describes relationships as collaborations and

# program participants as fellows.

Curation of the experience. UI carefully manages its programs’ in-

## person experiences—from workshops to team-building activities to

community dinners. All the fellows and mentors we spoke with

mentioned “the magic” that happened over the course of these events.

UI retreats typically combine small-group interactions with periods of

# reﬂective time.

Consider how community dinners are held. Fellows are divided into

tables of ﬁve or six people plus a UI mentor. Each table is given a

prompt; for example, “Tell us about a decision you made that changed

your life” or “Describe an object that is meaningful to you.” Each fellow

gets ﬁve minutes to respond without interruptions. Fellows often share

personal and emotional experiences. As one participant recalls, “There

was not one dinner without some tears.”

The programs include periods of time oﬀ for activities such as yoga

or quiet walks. The importance of having space for reﬂection is

well documented in organizational psychology research: It is how

people come to understand others with whom they have shared

intense experiences and discover whom they might be able to form

# relationships with.

Innovation is more likely to succeed when it is a curated process in which an intermediary takes responsibility for sparking and sustaining collaboration among the people involved.

The careful curation of the retreat experiences can help create a

foundation for strong relationships. Here’s one example: Two fellows,

one working on recycled 3D printing and the other on residential

wind turbines, discovered they had shared connections and interests

at a lunch during a UI program. They stayed in touch in the months

following the retreat, exchanging updates and advice and bonding over

their journeys as they developed their ventures. A year after they ﬁrst

met, the fellows had a moment of realization at another UI event,

where they were demonstrating prototypes of their products. They

recognized there were opportunities to work more closely together to

improve their respective products—and possibly develop a new type of

appliance. By the time we interviewed one of them, they were applying

for grants together in order to turn their ideas into a more structured

# collaboration.

The importance to relationship-building of carefully selecting people

and giving them moments of both intense connection and quiet

reﬂection are well-known. In fact, many corporations use this formula

in leadership-development programs. But in our experience, it is rare to

ﬁnd those practices so carefully followed in the context of innovation

# and the entrepreneurial process.

# [ Step 2 ]

# Developing Relationships

After an idea forms and a relationship is made, the collaborators have to

deﬁne their shared goals, metrics, and targets and devise the processes

and structures they’ll need to make their idea a reality and support the

## daily operations of a functioning business.

Creating a road map for a collaboration is a complicated undertaking,

and getting an outside perspective can be incredibly helpful. Consider

the founder of a venture in last-mile distribution, who was working

with an entrepreneur developing biotech solutions. Their teams had

started working together to deliver health care products to isolated

communities during the pandemic. “You need time and space to get

to know the partners, do the right expectations management, and

understand what exactly it is you’re trying to achieve together, and that

honestly needs to be facilitated,” the founder explains.

Another UI fellow echoes that sentiment. “A collaboration requires

external support, like a third-party strategist who says, ‘here’s how

you guys can align’ to help design and facilitate the next steps.” All

the fellows we spoke with highlighted the challenge of moving from

a shared idea and the early excitement of the collaborative encounter

to establishing a collaboration infrastructure (roles, leadership, project

management needs, and team dynamics) while reﬁning the idea of the

product or service to work on together. The UI program provided them

## with resources, connections with other fellows and mentors, and regular

meetings, which provided some accountability.

Successfully moving from the idea stage to implementation depends on

# two factors:

Structured follow-up. The importance of sustained direct support is

still frequently overlooked by the organizers of hackathons or open-

innovation challenges, who tend to focus on speed and idea generation.

However, an increasing number of intermediaries are recognizing the

need to support innovators and entrepreneurs beyond the original

# event.

One example is the open-innovation project #WirVsVirus (in English,

#WeVsVirus), an initiative in Germany that brought together seven civil

society organizations in response to the Covid-19 pandemic. It kicked

oﬀ with an online hackathon that attracted 28,000 participants and

produced 1,500 ideas.

# Felicity McCabe

What set #WirVsVirus apart, as Johanna Mair, a professor at the

## Hertie School in Berlin, and Thomas Gegenhuber, a professor at JKU

Linz in Austria, highlighted in a study, was that organizers planned

from the start for a six-month follow-up support program to help

150 teams prototype and test the ideas they developed during the

48-hour hackathon. In the follow-up program, participants were given

opportunities to connect with domain experts, investors, and potential

scaling partners, much as intermediaries provide. Teams participated in

weekly calls to share what they’d learned and the challenges they were

# facing.

#WirVsVirus’s organizers went further than most by bringing in

mentors who focused on skill development and team dynamics from

the get-go. Even during the hackathon weekend, moderators performed

a dual role: They provided domain expertise and also helped people

set up their collaborations, structure the creative process, and manage

team dynamics. They assigned a Slack channel to assist teams in

ﬁnding one another, and they helped them stay on track by asking

questions about the status of their collaborations and probing into

their challenges—technical and organizational—because they knew

that teams might be reluctant to ask for assistance. The mentors made

## suggestions on project-management issues as well as business and

# technology ones.

Holistic mentoring. Many collaboration intermediaries tend to prioritize

helping innovators polish and sharpen their ideas rather than coaching

the people collaborating. They consider the creative idea to be essential

to the success of the teams and therefore a better focus for their

limited resources. However, research on cross-disciplinary teams has

shown that team dynamics need to be managed if collaboration is to

be productive. The intermediary can be most eﬀective by embracing

a coaching role and creating safe spaces. That’s why entrepreneurial

## hubs like Impact Hub London, part of an international network of more

## than 100 hubs and 320,000 entrepreneurs (or Impact Makers, as they

are known) look for mentors who can not only help with business and

technical skills but also, as its website puts it, “provide holistic support

# and motivation.”

## Mentors at Impact Hub London commit to assignments that last

three to nine months. As coaches, they provide reassurance and help

collaborators deﬁne a common language, establish expectations, and

agree on roles. Research has shown that all of these activities are critical

## to successful cross-sector collaboration.

Mentoring the collaboration is also at the core of the programs

organized by the Innovation Ecosystem (IECO) at Portugal’s Nova

School of Business and Economics. One program is Project X, a three-

month innovation sprint in which 85 students work with 11 corporate

innovation teams from companies in various industries (including

## automotive, telecommunications, ﬁnancial services, and energy) on

15 innovation projects. People from IECO mentor the teams on the

innovation methodology as well as team dynamics, helping participants

build trust and navigate the innovation process. On one occasion a team

member dropped out for personal reasons, which seriously lowered

the morale of the remaining teammates. Their mentor stepped in to

boost their spirits and help them redistribute the workload. In another

case a mentor’s intervention in conﬂict management was critical

when team members strongly and passionately disagreed. The mentor

suggested mechanisms for decision-making and conﬂict resolution to

help overcome the constant arguments that were paralyzing the team.

# [ Step 3 ]

# Sustaining and Managing the Team

The experiences of two ventures we tracked illustrate how crucial it

is for collaborations to receive long-term support. In the ﬁrst, which

was established during the Covid-19 pandemic, two UI fellows joined

forces to provide health care kits to rural communities in Asia. They

were working on tight timelines, and they felt that they didn’t have

the time, space, and capacity to set up dedicated roles and clearly

deﬁne responsibilities. That choice ultimately put the collaboration in

# jeopardy.

By contrast, in the second, two fellows started collaborating to develop

solar-powered electric vehicles and soon realized that the work was

getting too big for them to manage by themselves. They decided

to establish a joint venture in order to provide more structure,

accountability, and resources for their team. The two founders believed

that was the only way for them to scale up. The ﬁrst collaboration

ultimately moved forward with diﬀerent partners, but the second is

thriving today.

The UI community had created a foundation for trusting relationships

that enabled the fellows to work in a ﬂexible manner, keeping

bureaucracy and governance to a minimum. But as the collaborations

scaled up, their organizational needs became more complex, and

addressing them required a renewed focus on building relationships.

While the fellows in the ﬁrst example were aware of the problem, they

had neither the time nor the resources to manage it successfully.

Again, this points to an opportunity for intermediaries, which have the

legitimacy to guide collaborators through this stage. An intermediary

can help in two ways:

Providing reﬂective checkpoints. By creating opportunities for

collaborators to get together in facilitated workshops, semistructured

calls, or in-person retreats, intermediaries can help venture teams

negotiate shifting roles and changing (or even new) relationships,

reestablish alignment, and introduce new governance structures.

These checkpoints oﬀer an opportunity for reﬂection, allowing social

entrepreneurs to step back and consider what they’ve learned in a

constructive fashion so that they can implement those lessons.

Checkpoints also help entrepreneurs manage their stress and emotions,

as the following stories of two social entrepreneurs outside UI

demonstrate. One young social entrepreneur who worked on a health

care venture told us that she ended up having a breakdown and

terminating her project. “I wish at the time I had a space to share

my worries on a regular basis and get support from my peers as well

as mentors,” she explained. By contrast, the other entrepreneur, who

developed a food-waste start-up, described how her network supported

her as her venture evolved through multiple phases and team member

changes. “I was lucky to have stayed in touch with a couple of mentors I

met in the diﬀerent hackathons and accelerator programs I participated

in,” she recalls. “As I struggled with team members’ engagement,

conﬂicts, and what to do with the idea—for instance, should I try to

ﬁle for a patent?—I was able to reach out to my mentors. Moreover, later

I was part of a network where we could share our experiences and best

practices.” She lamented that not every founder has the same sort of

# social network.

By providing reflective checkpoints, intermediaries can help teams negotiate shifting roles and relationships and reestablish alignment.

The need for sharing and reﬂecting is why the social entrepreneurship

hub Casa do Impacto in Lisbon holds events like the Founders

breakfast, where it invites entrepreneurs to an intimate gathering

to promote informal connections and knowledge sharing. Similarly,

## intermediaries like OpenIDEO, an open-innovation platform that one

of us (Anne-Laure) has studied extensively, always includes weekly

calls when developing communities of social entrepreneurs. They allow

community members to reﬂect on their experience, share their stories,

and listen to others.

During one workshop we facilitated as part of our study of UI, the

team membership of one venture had changed so much that most

of them had never actually met. Even though the UI fellows leading

the collaboration communicated well and had a trusting relationship,

the people managing the daily operations of the venture had not yet

developed the same. Participating in the workshop was for many the

ﬁrst opportunity they had to build relationships and trust. One UI fellow

told us at the end of the workshop that it gave team members the

“space to think about what worked, what did not, why rushing it was

not helpful, what was our readiness level to make things happen, and in

hindsight what we’d have done diﬀerent.”

Nurturing the ecosystem. In addition to promoting collaborative

eﬀorts, UI aims to create a community of social entrepreneurs linked

## to a wide network of mentors, investors, and innovators. A thriving

ecosystem will enable innovators to scale up their ventures. Alumni of

the programs stay connected with one another and form connections

with new fellows, sometimes becoming mentors themselves. Potential

investors build relationships with fellows, sometimes providing capital

for their ventures or helping them secure funding.

That’s what happened to 80 Acres Farms, an Ohio-based vertical farm

using 100% renewable energy. The cofounder of 80 Acres ﬁrst met a

## team from Barclays in 2019 through his participation in UI. When 80

Acres Farms needed to raise funds to build its ﬁrst commercial-scale

production facility, it secured Series A and B investment from Barclays

Sustainable Impact Capital, and the bank’s team acted as the sole

## placement agent in the Series B $200 million capital round.

OpenIDEO is focused on social and environmental issues and nurtures

an entrepreneurial ecosystem. After a few years of running one-oﬀ

challenges, in 2016 OpenIDEO initiated the Food Waste Alliance, a

## network of 80 ventures, along with experts, investors, and other

stakeholders. The idea was to give entrepreneurs and innovators

the ongoing opportunity to exchange knowledge, prototype, receive

## feedback, secure funding, and form collaborations. The OpenIDEO

team developed an online platform where venture founders can share

weekly progress updates and ask questions. Matt Ridenour, who led

the Food Waste Alliance, shared resources, invited guest experts,

and encouraged participants to share tools, guidelines, best practices,

challenges, and even grant opportunities. In-person events, including a

series of pitch days that paired founders and investors, were organized at the IDEO oﬃce in San Francisco.

Rise Products, a food start-up that upcycles organic by-products,

was one of the beneﬁciaries of that eﬀort. Thanks to the funding it

received from another Alliance member, Rise was able to prototype

a process for transforming barley waste from beer brewing into

ﬂour for baked goods. The two cofounders also participated in a

conference organized by the Alliance in San Francisco, where they met

other entrepreneurs, including some who would eventually start an

upcycled food association that Rise joined. Reﬂecting on the Alliance

experience, one of Rise’s cofounders says, “In addition to capital

(funding opportunities, prototyping facilities) and access (sharing of

existing infrastructure and knowledge), I’d say the most important

resources were networking (sharing of personal connections) and

storytelling (sharing of experiences). It helped us realize that we were

not alone and that people faced similar challenges.”

. . .

Although Silicon Valley celebrates “moving fast and breaking things,”

that approach is unsustainable. Hackathons and open-innovation

challenges can and do generate promising ideas, but they all too often

fail to achieve greater impact because most new ventures get too little

support for the people dynamics of collaboration. And while some

intermediaries, entrepreneurship hubs, and accelerators oﬀer more

structured, network-based support in the early phases of new venture

can provide this support—and a path to reducing the persistently high
