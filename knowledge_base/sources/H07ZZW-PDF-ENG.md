Recently I asked my MBA students whether they believed employers

should be making public statements on the tragic events occurring in

Israel and Gaza. One said he was “appalled” at the thought, but most

took for granted that companies would speak out. Few even remember a

time when companies avoided the political limelight.

Employees, particularly young ones, want employers to provide much

more than a paycheck. They expect companies to oﬀer public advocacy

on issues and to take concrete action on environmental and social issues

— and sometimes they demand it. In 2022, for example, thousands

of Salesforce employees signed an open letter urging co-CEOs Marc

Benioﬀ and Bret Taylor to stop doing business with the National Riﬂe

Association. “It’s not in our power to get background checks or other

gun control measures passed by Congress,” it explicitly argued, “but

we can eﬀect change by ending our commercial relationship with our

## customer, the National Riﬂe Association.”

Today’s employees are far more likely than those of generations past to

raise alarms about what businesses are (or aren’t) doing about climate

change, racism, political conﬂicts, abortion, or gun control. And eﬀorts

to hold their leaders accountable in the public square have led young

staﬀ members in particular to leak embarrassing internal information

## on social media — or directly to reporters.

The messy reality is that employee and corporate speech have

intersected in uncontained ways that make internal organizational

conﬂict inevitable. Relying on even the most seasoned communications

team to craft a convincing story about your corporate responsibility eﬀorts no longer suﬃces in this fast-moving, interconnected, image-

dominated, “gotcha” era — not when voices from inside a company

can quickly pierce its neat and glossy narrative. And as a broader,

far less legalistic idea of “business ethics” emerges in the workplace,

the traditional approach, which treats whistleblowing solely as a

compliance mechanism, has become obsolete.

Corporate leaders have wound up embroiled in complex questions

about whom they represent — and on what basis. The Business

Roundtable and other inﬂuential voices have called on businesses to

## balance the interests of all their stakeholders, not just shareholders.

Experts have told executives that employees and the general public

want them to take public stands on social issues — and that doing so

might confer an edge in hiring talent or attracting customers. But the

desire to balance stakeholder interests and speak up for employees on

high-stakes societal questions is colliding with the realities of divided,

## polarized workforces, political dysfunction, and anger about corporate

hypocrisy. These issues are particularly fraught in the United States

in a charged presidential election year, though they resonate far more

widely. And increasingly, companies are facing backlash around what

they are or are not saying on issues such as ESG and DEI, with many

hesitating to defend their choices, and sparking further employee

# frustration in the process.

What’s needed is a considered and deliberate strategy for speaking up.

Corporations are not democracies. Stakeholders are not an electorate.

Lacking both the authority and the mechanisms to advocate or

represent everyone’s interests in a coherent way, corporate leaders risk

undermining both their businesses and other societal institutions when

they claim that they can — or feel that they must. There is a better

# approach.

# How Did We Get Here?

Before discussing what corporations should do, it’s worth examining

how we got here.

Transparency has become a weapon. For businesses, one of the most

profound consequences of mass internet access is that they can no

longer control their narrative. Anyone with a smartphone can instantly

give detailed glimpses into a company’s environmental disasters, labor

## rights violations, or just bad customer service.

In the 20th century, public relations was about eﬀective

communication. Mainstream media were concentrated — and reluctant

to trigger libel actions or risk losing ad revenue — so companies

could largely direct messaging through friendly, predictable channels.

Today the public crowdsources opinions on where to work and what to

buy, and then skeptically compares them to corporations’ own claims. To make matters more diﬃcult, there’s no predictable formula for

determining which mistakes will come back to bite you. Activists often

target the best performers, and two companies can encounter wildly

disparate responses for the same conduct. Reputational risk is less a

## linear accountability mechanism than a funhouse mirror.

## Threats from within pose perhaps the most challenging issue for

corporate aﬀairs teams, as employees seek to hold leaders accountable

for ethical missteps. For example, employees organized protests and

## walkouts at Google over lucrative and secretive sexual harassment

settlements. When Amazon announced a $10 billion investment to

tackle climate change, employees broke conﬁdentiality agreements to

highlight the company’s ongoing work with oil and gas companies.

Workers at McKinsey helped reporters trace the ﬁrm’s simultaneous

## relationships with the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and Purdue

## Pharma. And at X (formerly Twitter), Elon Musk accused employees of

oﬀering the public blow-by-blow accounts of the chaos following his

# acquisition.

Employees have become the cultural auditors of their organizations.

And wise executives must assume that anything they say or do can

become public knowledge.

Business has become global and harder to control. Globalization oﬀers

companies enormous growth opportunities and access to cheap labor

## and raw materials, and reduces oversight from various national legal

and political institutions. But it also exposes them to a wider range of

# social and political risks.

In 2022, for example, Western enterprises encountered enormous

pressure to shut down their Russian operations after the invasion

## of Ukraine. Prominent Yale professor Jeﬀrey Sonnenfeld fashioned a

spreadsheet to help the media track which companies were in and

which were out, and CEOs had to decide almost instantly whether to

keep paying employees in Russia, evacuate nationals, sell their assets,

or stay put. Even companies that seemed to handle that crisis well soon

faced questions about their operations in other countries with egregious

## human rights violations, such as Saudi Arabia. Consumers increasingly

hold brands responsible for environmental irresponsibility and forced

labor in their supply chains, but those same consumers still want the

stuﬀ they ordered, right now.

These are not merely questions of geopolitical risk in a multipolar

world. As University of Chicago professor Luigi Zingales pithily puts

it, “We now have the politicization of the corporate world because we

have corporatization of the political world.” In other words, the public

believes businesses are more responsive to its dictates than nation-

states are, and it expects business to play a larger role in a world reeling

# from political and regulatory failures.

Business has become enmeshed with politics and social issues. For

years, big business steered clear of taking overt political stances: After

all, why would they want to alienate any potential customers? But in

reality, the bright line demarcating business and politics has never been

more than a convenient story — one that has become less credible with

each passing year. The aftermath of the 2008 ﬁnancial crisis featured

## the injection of vast public subsidies into private companies, swiftly

followed by severe austerity in public spending, which enraged many

## ordinary people. In 2011 Occupy Wall Street, the Indignados Movement

in Spain, and the Arab Spring are early examples of intersecting

sociopolitical frustrations that drew business into their tailwinds.

Gradually, business leaders began to signal their commitments to

## inclusion. For example, in 2016 more than 100 CEOs and other business

leaders signed a letter opposing North Carolina’s transgender bathroom

ban. That same year, the election of Donald Trump marked a shift

in the entanglement of business and politics. His administration had

a proclivity for drawing business leaders into policy conﬂicts that

might inﬂame the domestic culture wars. For instance, when the DACA

program was canceled, hundreds of Silicon Valley leaders stood up

to protect the Dreamers. Companies that attempted to maintain their

focus on shareholder value soon found that the neutral middle ground

had become quicksand: When Uber kept operating during a taxi drivers’

strike at New York airports protesting the Trump administration’s

“Muslim ban,” a #DeleteUber hashtag erupted.

By 2018 CEO activism was being described as the “new normal” in

the New York Times. And it has not faded, as U.S. business leaders

continued to face politically charged decisions such as how to respond

to the Supreme Court’s Roe v. Wade decision, Covid-19 mask and vaccine

mandates, and inadequate gun control regulations. Now many are

trapped between the Scylla of escalating, incessant employee demands,

and the Charybdis of organized political backlash.

Regardless of what you think of these changes — as a necessary

## elevation of core values and employee voice, or an opportunistic way

to galvanize customers and workers — the Overton window has clearly

shifted.

The professional has become personal. In the classroom, I hear my

students say repeatedly that a career should align with one’s values.

They’re not alone. “Employees want to work for a company with

purpose — that has values and sticks to them and isn’t hypocritical

## about it,” Douglas Pinkham, president of the Public Aﬀairs Council, tells

me. “They want to know: Are you doing something good for the world?

Am I part of something positive, as opposed to just a money machine?

…The pressures to get involved in social issues are enormous.”

That wasn’t always the case. Corporations traditionally expected their

leaders to set strategy and incentives and expected their employees to

follow. But younger employees in particular want to be able to express

their social identities and personal values at work. As a result, they

increasingly hope — and demand — that enterprises adapt to their

needs and interests, not the reverse. This applies to company stances

## on environmental and social concerns as well as internal culture and

## performance issues such as inclusion, remote work, and mental health.

Amid surging polarization, senior leaders need to listen to and beneﬁt

from employee voices without creating a silent, resentful minority — or

slowing the pace of work and generating perpetual conﬂict.

## The Uncomfortable New Landscape for Corporate Advocacy

Leaders are struggling to respond to this new landscape, with some

playing whack-a-mole on every issue and others simply ignoring

employee criticisms in hopes they’ll go away. Many are considering

whether — and how — to restrict employee speech; a 2023 Herbert

## Smith Freehills survey on the future of work ﬁnds that 97%

of employers are attempting to impose some level of top-down

control. Nondisclosure agreements and social media policies are

commonplace but vary widely in eﬀectiveness. Some companies are

taking more-novel approaches. For example, Dell’s employee advocacy

program incentivized employees to speak about their company in an

approved way by sharing brand-related content online in exchange for

certiﬁcation as a “social media and community professional.” While

analysis shows these eﬀorts may bring positive attention to businesses

in the short term, they fail to address the root cause of why corporate

and employee speech has become such a thorny issue, and what

organizations need to do to meet this moment.

To build and maintain cohesive organizational culture in a deeply

polarized, broadly vocalized society, leaders must develop norms and

processes that enable them to respond to ethical concerns and political

issues before they blow up. These processes should give employees both

agency and responsibility over when they choose to speak. And they

should help organizations act proactively and strategically to ensure

they can back up their public positions.

The time has come to rethink how organizations talk about and act on

political, social, environmental, and cultural issues. The solution is to

involve employees more eﬀectively in determining corporate advocacy,

while leaders exercise far more restraint in making promises and

taking positions. Fundamentally, your approach to cultivating corporate

culture has to change.

## When Can Speaking Up Be Prudent and Effective?

Ask yourself these nine questions before you lend your company’s voice to

an issue. If you answer no to any of them, it’s unwise to proceed.

- 1. Is the issue central to your business’s values, code of conduct, or other

existing public commitments?

- 2. Is the issue an environmental or social priority, according to a rigorous

# materiality assessment?

- 3. Does the issue pertain to commitments you have made to

## your workforce, such as diversity and inclusion or human rights

# commitments?

- 4. Has your company done all it can to ensure it isn’t making the problem

## worse through its actions or business model?

- 5. Does your company have relevant capacity and expertise to contribute to

# solutions for the issue?

- 6. Is this a new issue that has a proximate relationship to the company’s

# goals or operations?

- 7. Is there a clear way your business can make a positive contribution in

# collaboration with others?

- 8. Will acting on the issue support a positive operating environment for

business in general? Would it support democratic participation, fair

## competition, equality of opportunity, and basic human rights?

- 9. Can the company make a statement that’s consistent with its

## values, prior actions, political spending, and environmental and social

# priorities?

## A New Speech Culture for a Vocal, Polarized World

To proceed with integrity on matters of corporate and employee speech,

you must create a culture that’s attuned to the social challenges we

face today, and you must be realistic about how your company can (or

cannot) address them. This goes beyond deciding who can say what,

when. It involves designing an organization where regular discussions

among all employees about social priorities is anticipated; where ethical

concerns are part of day-to-day work; where politics are considered

a healthy part of discourse; and where everyone is attuned to how

corporate choices impact human beings. Without this foundation, the

decisions you make as a leader about when to speak — or when not to —

will ring hollow.

Involve employees in setting realistic priorities. Companies tend to

make three big mistakes when setting and publicizing societal, political,

# and environmental priorities.

First, they speak out on these issues as a form of stealth public relations

— they project their ambition along a huge range of topics in an eﬀort

to appease stakeholders in the short term. Making a public statement is

often a way to compensate for, or distract from, a lack of meaningful

action, and it is increasingly the norm. For instance, the Carbon

Disclosure Project recently reviewed 4,100 corporate commitments on

climate change and found that fewer than 100 were credible.

Second, organizations are reluctant to set tight priorities. So they end

up with a laundry list of goals and aspirations that fails to distinguish

among risks, opportunities, and negative impacts that require ethical

guardrails. When corporations suggest that they can address every

relevant issue, they overpromise and underdeliver, fueling impatience

and diminishing trust.

Third, senior leadership teams tend to set strategy and goals in isolation

from the rest of their workforce or delegate the task to teams of

# consultants.

Changing the way you determine your priorities — and whom you

involve — can correct all three errors. Issues such as sustainability and

diversity are distinct in that at least some employees feel passionately

about them and yearn for a sense of agency in setting goals and

enacting change. Students in a recent sustainability class told me that

they focus less on which brands to patronize and lifestyle changes to

embrace and more on pushing their employers to take action because

doing so leverages their impact.

Instead of awaiting such organized activity, or ignoring misalignments

between senior leaders and staﬀ, it’s wise to include your employees

when you use a materiality assessment to set environmental and social

priorities. Any credible materiality assessment takes the concerns of

internal and external stakeholders into account. And once you have

listened to the full range of concerns and opinions, the imperative is to

candidly focus on the handful of issues your business is truly capable of

# prioritizing.

Employees should also be invited to contemplate the company’s actual

leverage over an issue. For example, there might be limits on what

an internal diversity program can achieve when the pipeline of job

applicants is heavily skewed to a particular identity group. The same

applies to an organization’s eﬀorts to tackle climate change in the

absence of supportive public policy. Even the new CEO of sustainability

poster-child Unilever recently recognized that the company has made

## too many vague, sweeping, long-term commitments at the expense of

short-term performance, admitting that it ought to have focused on

# fewer, more-critical issues.

Sam Hartsock, a cofounder of qb. consulting, has worked to involve

employees in sustainability strategy at numerous companies, including

Ben & Jerry’s and Bumble. “We always advise our clients to think about

their employee engagement [around ESG] holistically,” she says. “If

[they] only speak to senior leadership, the result is an echo chamber

that leaves out a whole section of key stakeholders. This results in a

skewed image of the business, presents signiﬁcant risks, and produces

# an ill-informed ESG strategy.”

Instead, try to pinpoint what your employees expect and value. Surveys

and focus groups can help identify internal sources of pressure,

enthusiasm, pain, and tension. Then select individuals who could

help lead initiatives and make decisions. If you involve employees in

setting environmental and social priorities, you’ll be better positioned

to achieve them, and your public commitments will be anchored in a

robust internal framework. Perhaps most important, your employees

will carry increased responsibility and accountability for ensuring their

# success.

Reframe ethics as a process that involves everyone. For decades, ethics

was simply equated with legal compliance. Now our view of what it

takes to be a “good company” extends far beyond the boundaries of the

law. Questions of ethics have come to reﬂect how a business impacts

## social, environmental, and political systems, and vice versa; a company

can no longer operate solely as a self-interested, proﬁt-maximizing

black box. But there’s been no playbook to help executives navigate this

# new world.

Traditionally, many consumer-facing brands have attempted to address

social issues by setting up high-level, cross-functional task forces. But

ethical and social concerns are converging so swiftly that businesses

need to establish an active consultative process to ensure that their

organizational values are robust. Ethics is a process that must involve

everyone, from the C-suite to frontline employees.

Consider Dutch bank Rabobank’s dynamic approach to ethical

challenges. Its Global Ethics Committee, which includes young

employees, considers the ethics surrounding emerging issues such as

AI and cryptocurrencies and sustainability dilemmas such as whether to

source solar panels from Xinjiang. “Every employee can raise a question

or ethical dilemma,” explains Francoise Rost, Rabobank’s senior ethics

## adviser. “The committee deals with cases and themes with an ethical

character in the ‘gray area.’ Often, there is not yet an internal policy

or legislation or regulations in such dilemmas. The outcome of the

dialogue can serve as a moral precedent for similar cases or contribute

# to internal policymaking.”

Your corporation’s impact on human beings is at the very root of your legal, operational, and reputational risks, even if how those risks might manifest is unpredictable.

Salesforce’s Paula Goldman, the company’s chief ethics and humane use oﬃcer, shares a similar process. “We created an ethical use advisory

council that includes, notably, frontline employees, executives, and

external tech ethics experts,” she explains. “When an issue comes

our way, we will debate it from multiple angles…and we’ll make a

# recommendation to leadership.”

Organizations can give their employees a framework for responding

to nuanced and complex problems. Novartis, for example, developed

## an online, interactive ethical decision-making framework for staﬀ. It

isn’t intended to replace conversation, and it doesn’t give employees

deﬁnitive answers about what they should do. Rather, it guides users

through 15 questions to prompt deep reﬂection, exposes as many as

six potential biases, and suggests additional materials and resources

to explore. This is more practical and eﬀective than laying out rules

and sanctions. It gives employees the tools to develop an ethical code

and oﬀers them agency in drawing their own conclusions. It also

emphasizes that ethical considerations and challenges are a key aspect

## of organizational decision-making in general.

## Be inclusive and transparent about politics. Organizations cannot

represent all employees’ views on political questions. Issues such as

racism, reproductive rights, and climate change are so fraught precisely

because they have both political and personal dimensions. Nor can

companies ignore these views, hope they won’t crop up during the

workday, or prevent employees from posting about them. As Hult

## International Business School professor Megan Reitz and author Jim

Higgins have rightly argued, “Banning political speech is fundamentally

implausible because it is impossible to draw a clean, objective line

between what counts as ‘politics’ and what doesn’t — or which issues

are ‘acceptable’ to discuss because they relate to the company’s mission

and which aren’t.”

The best nonpartisan approach for coping with escalating political

demands by employees is to emphasize individual political

engagement, tolerance, and mutual respect. True inclusion means

that someone should be able to hold a political opinion, even

if it’s misaligned with the company’s dominant culture, without

being penalized or “canceled.” Employers should respect healthy and

inclusive discourse while setting clear ground rules around issues such

as racism, sexual harassment, and calls for violence. A strong, clear code

of conduct is useful, not least by making it clear what a corporation

will not seek to control, as well as what it will. An institutional

emphasis on individual choice and responsibility can help employees

learn to be better political players themselves; indeed, it takes the

## heat out of demands for corporate advocacy and representation on an

overwhelming range of topics.

Allstate Insurance stands out for having created the Better Arguments

## Project, a civic collaboration with the Aspen Institute and Facing

History and Ourselves. The project focuses not on stymieing debate but

on making it healthier and more respectful. It aims to teach U.S. citizens

— including its employees — how to stop seeing winning an argument

as the goal, and to be more vulnerable and compassionate.

Companies might also consider inviting a range of political speakers

and promoting civic engagement by providing time oﬀ to vote.

Organizations can support democratic engagement and even match

employee contributions to speciﬁc causes without embracing them. To

## bake tolerance and inclusion into your culture, for example, a company

could make having a track record of working successfully with people

who hold very diﬀerent values and opinions be a requirement for

# promotion.

Healthy political engagement needs to go far beyond employee

## discourse. An unintended consequence of the surge in corporate

political speech has been a renewed focus by the public (and

## sometimes, your employees) on organizational misalignment with

## political spending. At the annual conference of BSR (Business for Social

Responsibility) in 2018, author Anand Giridharadas warned hundreds of

sustainability leaders in attendance: “You may have lobbyist colleagues

the Paris Climate Agreement and lobbying practices that do the

# opposite.

As momentum builds behind corporate political responsibility, ensure

## that your spending matches your avowed sustainability priorities

and consider augmenting transparency to build trust. Acceding to

## shareholder pressure over such contradictions, for instance, AT&T

published a “political congruency report.” Or consider emulating IBM’s

long-standing approach of not contributing directly to any political

candidates — especially since some research suggests it brings little

## comparative advantage and may even negatively impact company

# value.

Base your commitments on how you impact human beings. Your ethical

commitments should be based not solely on legal obligations but also

on human rights principles. Although the UN Guiding Principles on

Business and Human Rights are relatively new, and most corporate

implementation eﬀorts are still nascent, they can oﬀer business unique

## help at this particular moment, for several reasons.

Most important, the Guiding Principles focus on individual agency,

bodily autonomy, and dignity — they don’t attempt to impose values

on people who may not share them. A key advantage of the human

rights platform is that it encompasses the spectrum of economic, civil,

political, security, and environmental issues. In 2022, for instance, the

UN General Assembly recognized the right to a clean, healthy, and

sustainable environment. Next, your corporation’s impact on human

beings is at the very root of your legal, operational, and reputational

risks, even if how those risks might manifest is unpredictable. The

Guiding Principles consider the respective roles of business and

## government and account for the level of attribution and leverage

your corporation has in causing and resolving negative impacts.

(For example, they provide guidance in a scenario whereby you

are doing your best to respect human rights in your supply chain

factories, but the government is conducting aggressive surveillance

and arbitrary detention of the local population, which is aﬀecting your

workers.) Corporations must identify whether their actions are causing,

contributing, or are directly linked to negative human rights impacts.

Finally, the Guiding Principles consider tricky trade-oﬀs, such as those

## between freedom of expression and the right to privacy.

Human rights frameworks like this one explicitly direct corporations

to evaluate their impact on stakeholders and prioritize their ethics

eﬀorts on that basis, rather than on opinions or ideology. For example,

in the wake of the U.S. Supreme Court’s nulliﬁcation of Roe v. Wade,

human rights principles suggest that the right to health is paramount,

and reproductive rights are a key element. Businesses that make

## reproductive health care equally available to all employees and contract

workers across the United States (including travel) are explicitly

addressing the ruling’s negative human rights impacts.

The most astute corporate responses always respect the principles of

privacy and freedom of choice. In this case, a business would not

require employees to discuss their choices with HR departments but

would provide funds and medical coverage that can be accessed without

involving the employer. So long as there exists no eﬀort to force such

health care on women who oppose abortion, it aligns with human rights

principles to provide the same access to every staﬀer, anywhere in the

## United States. The rights of employees with values-based objections to

reproductive care are not violated by the provision of care to colleagues.

Companies that fund candidates and organizations that seek to restrict

this right, by contrast, are contributing to negative human rights

impacts, and they should stop making such contributions.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Corporate Advocacy in a Time of Social Outrage

Vestas Wind Systems provides an excellent example of a company

grounding both its integrity and social responsibility eﬀorts in a

commitment to human rights, including an explicit pledge to “ensure

the integration of human rights in the energy transition.” This is

notable, as many renewable energy companies try to avoid or sidestep the diﬃcult human rights issues their technologies present. Beverage

company Diageo has also outlined clear human rights commitments;

it makes detailed operational assessments of its human rights impacts

# publicly available.

To be in line with good practice on business and human rights, ensure

that your actions and spending are aligned. Be certain, too, that you’ve

taken concrete steps to protect employees and supply chain workers

from human rights violations before you mount any public campaign on

an issue. On reﬂection, most companies will ﬁnd that further internal

# work awaits.

Once you have been explicit and deliberate about employee

involvement in strategy, ethics, politics, and human rights, you’ll be

better equipped to make consistent decisions on how to address social

and political issues. Your employees may not always agree, and you

must be clear from the outset as to whether they’re allowed to disagree

publicly. But because they’ve been involved throughout the process,

and there has been clear consideration of how these issues will aﬀect

organizational culture, they should better understand what you are (or

are not) saying — and why.

# A New Era

The past decade has transformed the nature and impact of speaking

out. Although leaders may ﬁnd it frustrating and chaotic, it reﬂects

a real desire for positive change among employees, who have found

new ways to counter the hazard of retaliation for speaking out. Social

media–enabled collective action is one, with young workers organizing

# on Slack, out of sight of management.

Leaders, for their part, need to adapt in order to run today’s ﬂuid,

networked organizations. Barking orders from above while tuning out

employee sentiment has become wholly impractical. Megan Reitz, an

associate fellow at Saïd Business School, has worked for years on ways

to improve the speaking-up process, and she sees this as a central

leadership challenge. “How you respond in an agile way has had to

shift from the traditional notion of someone at the top making all key

decisions,” she tells me. “We need reminding that a leader’s perspective

is not the [whole] truth, because we all think that how we see the world

is the way it is. You need to do more than you realize, and you need to do

more than just inviting speaking up.”

A 2021 academic study showed that listening, empathy, and

persuasiveness have become far more valued qualiﬁcations in C-suite

job descriptions and recruiter checklists. In an era of soft corporate

boundaries and intangible value, an ability to tap into and leverage

inﬂuence has become indispensable. So have familiarity with — and

competence at handling — pressures regarding social responsibility.

Organizations need to solicit and support employee voice at all levels.

They also need to continually emphasize the importance of individual

accountability. That means taking a more considered and restrained

stance on questions of corporate voice and advocacy. They’d be well

served by striving to build more-tolerant cultures that feature less

## public grandstanding and more internal individual involvement and

accountability. Employees should be encouraged to share positive

examples of staﬀ activity, highlighting exemplary ethical behavior. They

should be involved in shaping the commitments an organization makes

and in pondering the trade-oﬀs and limitations it faces. Not least, they

should be encouraged to exercise their individual rights and freedoms

in the public sphere, rather than look to employers to represent their

# political positions.

Giving employees both agency and responsibility around speech is

easier said than done. Still, creating a culture where that’s the norm

## oﬀers the most promising route through the morass of confusion and

political turmoil that enterprises face today. It’s inevitable that business

leaders will get backlash around their decisions on speaking out on

issues. But if they ground their decisions in a robust process and

culture, and therefore make less frequent public declarations, they’ll

be better positioned to stand their ground.

Take my students’ perspective on their employers’ need to speak out

about the present Middle East conﬂict. If they followed the strategies I

outline in this article, most companies would soon be envisioning the

negative consequences of empty “speaking up” when they possess little

useful leverage. They’d limit corporate statements to expressions of

## humanitarian support for victims of the conﬂict and immediate concern

## for the mental and physical health of aﬀected employees. They would

allow employees freedom of expression on the issue while barring

advocacy that would violate human rights.

Our new era calls for sharper, more limited corporate commitments,

## a more thoughtful approach to political speech and spending, and an

end to the dangerous suggestion that proﬁt-making entities can single- handedly solve ﬁendishly diﬃcult societal challenges. Corporations

should ﬁrst seek to clean up their own messes and treat workers with

dignity and respect. It is also squarely in the interest of corporations

to support individual agency and engagement with the democratic

process. Ultimately, credible corporate responsibility starts with more
