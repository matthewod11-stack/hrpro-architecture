You’ve just learned that you will soon have a new manager. What can

you do to help your new leader launch successfully? You can help your

new leader (and yourself) by actively onboarding them.

According to research from Egon Zehnder, there are three main reasons

why onboarding leaders derail: 1) They fail to understand how the

organization works; 2) They don’t ﬁt with the organizational culture;

and 3) They struggle to forge alliances with peers. Our research shows

that being promoted from within does not eliminate these onboarding

challenges. Leaders we surveyed said internal promotions were 70% as

diﬃcult as coming in from the outside.

So, whether your new leader is an internal or external hire, they’re going to need your support. And the best way to oﬀer your support is

to guide them up the learning curve. Doing so means ﬁrst assessing

what they most need to learn and then helping them understand how

to accelerate their learning process. Here are our recommendations for

how to accomplish both of these steps along with real-world examples

from leaders we surveyed.

Assess what your new manager most needs to learn.

There are three fundamental types of learning when starting a new role:

# technical, cultural, and political.

- Technical learning is about understanding what it takes to succeed in

the job. It involves learning about customers, products, technologies,

and systems, as well as getting up to speed with the speciﬁcs of the

## organization’s roles, goals, capabilities, KPIs, and performance.

- Cultural learning is about understanding the key behavioral norms

that govern “how we do things here” as well as how to speak the local

# language (e.g., acronyms).

- Political learning is about understanding how decisions are made

and how power and inﬂuence work, as well as identifying the key

stakeholders and clarifying the decision-making processes.

Where you focus your attention will depend signiﬁcantly on the

situation. If your new manager has been promoted from within, they

may already understand a lot about the culture (although there may be

important cultural nuances associated with moving to a higher level).

So, the focus is likely to be more on technical learning (about aspects of

the organization with which they are not familiar) and political learning (about how power and inﬂuence work diﬀerently at the new level).

If your new manager is coming from a competitor, they likely will

be familiar with important technical aspects of the job, such as

knowledge of products, markets, and technologies. So cultural and

political learning may be their biggest priorities.

Help them understand how to accelerate their learning process.

Here you’ll ﬁnd the three types of learning we mentioned earlier along

with questions to ask yourself so that you can determine what your new

manager actually needs.

# Technical Learning

Questions to ask yourself:

- What can I give our new leader to quickly bring them up to speed on

# our customers, products, systems, etc.?

- What key reports or product information would be helpful?

- What data would give them a strong understanding of the current

# state?

- What historical data would oﬀer insights into today’s priorities?

# In practice:

“I knew the new VP would need access to organization charts,

ﬁnancials, and marketing plans. However, knowing how to access this

information on our intranet can be diﬃcult,” said one of the leaders we

surveyed. “To support our new manager, we created documents with

links that helped our VP quickly access the information needed.”

“Being part of a large, global organization, there are mountains of data,”

said one team member. “When our new CHRO was coming, the team

identiﬁed the most important historical information and shared our key

success metrics. We also had talent, culture, and leadership data that

helped our new leader better understand her team. She was grateful for

the information and found that it speeded up her acclimation.”

# Cultural Learning

Questions to ask yourself:

- What are the unwritten rules that would be helpful for someone

coming in new to our company?

- What insights into decision-making, collaboration, and working

together would help someone integrate faster?

- What are the culture-speciﬁc expectations or landmines that an

incoming leader needs to know?

- What acronyms are common in our company?

# In practice:

For one new executive, understanding the cultural expectations and

behaviors of business reviews allowed the leader to do extensive

preparation before important meetings. “As I took the new role, one

of my colleagues sat me down and said that I would be getting lots

of questions on the ﬁnances and that the expectation was that I knew

the ﬁgures cold. As an engineer, that meant spending signiﬁcant time

understanding the current ﬁnancials and the reasons behind them. It took great eﬀort, but it was helpful advice for my success in the role.”

One leader joined a consumer packaged goods company with a long

and rich history. Looking back, he realized the diﬃculty of navigating

the culture. “When giving a PowerPoint, the expectation was that the

company brand colors were used in a particular way,” he recalled.

“However, they didn’t share that with me. After presenting a proposal

without using these colors, another leader told me it damaged my

credibility. While it was an easy switch, it hurt me not knowing this

# from the start.”

# Political Learning

Questions to ask yourself:

- Who are the key stakeholders the new leader should meet with in the

near term, and is there anything I should share about them that would

be helpful for the new leader to know?

- Who are the key partners that the new manager will need to work with

to move strategic initiatives forward?

- Who are the external partners that work closely with this team?

- What is a suggested cadence for meeting peers, stakeholders, and

# partners?

# In practice:

For one leader, learning about the preferences of the company president

proved especially helpful. “When I started on this team, someone pulled

me aside and said that the leader was an absolute stickler for starting

meetings on time. She viewed being ﬁve minutes early as being on time

and those who came in on time as being late. She had no tolerance for

anyone coming in after the start of the meeting. It was very helpful to

me to have that insight.”

“I have been with my global organization for over a decade,” said

one oﬃcer. “While I was ecstatic to get a promotion to corporate

headquarters, since I was coming from Europe, I did not have the

## network, the knowledge, or the understanding of how this part of the

business operated. While everyone thought I did not need support in

my new role, that was not true. I needed onboarding help, too. My

coach helped me identify the internal relationships I needed to build for

## success within the corporate environment.”

. . .

In summary, many companies still give too little time and focus to

helping new leaders succeed. If you have a new manager coming soon,

identify how you can help them rapidly learn about the organization,

# the team, and the culture.

New leaders are drinking from a proverbial ﬁre hose. Being in a new role can be diﬃcult. Oﬀering help, checking in, keeping them in the loop, and oﬀering a listening ear can be very helpful to someone who is

working on learning and trying to make progress at the same time.
