Tracking things like customer satisfaction and employee turnover can powerfully supplement traditional bookkeeping. Unfortunately, most companies botch the job.

## Coming Up Short on Nonfinancial Performance Measurement

## by Christopher D. Ittner and David F. Larcker

In the past decade, increasing numbers of companies have been measuring customer loyalty, employee satisfaction, and other per- formance areas that are not financial but that they believe ultimately affect profitability. Doing so can offer several benefits. Managers can get a glimpse of the business’s progress well before a financial verdict is pronounced and the soundness of their investment alloca- tions has become moot. Employees can re- ceive better information on the specific ac- tions needed to achieve strategic objectives. And investors can have a better sense of the company’s overall performance, since nonfi- nancial indicators usually reflect realms of in- tangible value, such as R&D productivity, that accounting rules refuse to recognize as assets. But the reality is that only a few companies realize these benefits. Why? Because they fail to identify, analyze, and act on the right nonfi- nancial measures. We conducted field research in more than 60 manufacturing and service companies and supplemented it with survey responses from 297 senior executives. To our

surprise, we discovered that most companies have made little attempt to identify areas of nonfinancial performance that might advance their chosen strategy. Nor have they demon- strated a cause-and-effect link between im- provements in those nonfinancial areas and in cash flow, profit, or stock price.

Instead, many companies seem to have adopted boilerplate versions of nonfinancial measurement frameworks such as Kaplan and Norton’s Balanced Scorecard, Accenture’s Per- formance Prism, or Skandia’s Intellectual Cap- ital Navigator. And yet the frameworks’ own inventors rightly insist that every company needs to dig deep to discover and track the ac- tivities that truly affect the frameworks’ broad domains (domains such as “financial,” “cus- tomers,” “internal business processes,” and “in- novation and learning,” in the case of the Bal- 1 anced Scorecard). But businesses often fail to establish such links partly out of laziness or thoughtlessness. As a result, self-serving man- agers are able to choose—and manipulate— measures solely for the purpose of making

be? Here are some examples:

- One of the world’s top information-service providers began evaluating managers’ perfor- mance according to how many patents the company filed each year. Whether it might have made more sense to license someone else’s technology, whether the patents were ever put to work, or whether they ever earned back their cost was not considered. The reason for tracking patent awards? A more successful competitor owned a larger number.

Mistake One: Not Linking Measures to Strategy Whether the goal of a performance measure- ment system is to help direct the allocation of resources, to assess and communicate progress toward strategic objectives, or to evaluate man- agerial performance, a major challenge for companies is determining which of the hun- dreds, if not thousands, of nonfinancial mea- sures to track.

- A large retail bank decided to base bo- nuses on customer satisfaction scores. But the polling company hired by the bank surveyed only those customers who physically entered bricks-and-mortar branches. So one branch manager who had received poor satisfaction scores in the past coaxed customers to visit and then put smiles on their faces by offering them free food and drinks on the premises.

- Managers of an automobile components manufacturer reached the firm’s quality tar- gets by reclassifying as acceptable certain flaws that once would have caused a part to be re- jected. When such things happen, a company’s fi- nancial and nonfinancial performance di- verge—an ironic outcome, since the original reason for tracking nonfinancial performance was to fill out the picture provided by tradi- tional financial accounting. And yet, is it so surprising that nonfinancial measures would be equally, if not more, susceptible to manipu- lation as financial accounting? At least tradi- tional accounting has rules that govern it.

In fact, the misuse of nonfinancial measures may be even more damaging because of the significant opportunity costs incurred. As the exhibit “The Difference It Makes” shows, the companies in our study that adopted nonfi- nancial measures and then established a causal link between those measures and financial outcomes produced significantly higher re- turns on assets and returns on equity over a five-year period than those that did not.

In the following pages, we discuss our re- search findings, which reveal a number of common mistakes companies make when try- ing to measure nonfinancial performance. We then highlight a number of practices that, in our view, will allow companies to realize the

Many companies believe that they have solved this problem by adopting a framework like the Balanced Scorecard, mistaking it for an off-the-shelf checklist or procedure that is universally applicable and completely compre- hensive. But using such a framework by itself won’t help identify which performance areas—and which drivers—make the greatest contribution to the company’s financial out- comes. In a number of companies we studied, middle managers sarcastically referred to the Balanced Scorecard as the “four bucket” or “smorgasbord” approach because top manage- ment ordered them to come up with some- thing for each of the scorecard’s four perspec- tives, regardless of their business unit’s strategy or objectives.

More successful companies have attacked this problem by choosing their performance measures on the basis of causal models, also called value driver maps, which lay out the plausible cause-and-effect relationships that may exist between the chosen drivers of strate- gic success and outcomes. The exhibit “Which Measures Matter” shows how one very success- ful fast food chain diagrammed its drivers of strategic success. The diagram demonstrates how better employee selection and staffing should lead to higher employee satisfaction and thus improve employee performance. The latter in turn should increase customer satis- faction and thus purchase frequency, customer retention, and referrals, ultimately leading to sustained sales growth and increased share- holder value. This model became the basis for selecting performance measures directly tied to the goals of the strategic plan, which was to become the premier generator of free cash flow in the fast foods sector and lead stock- price performance in that industry.

of making such connections, fewer than 30% of the companies we surveyed have developed causal models, which show what areas are ex- pected to improve as the result of commit- ments to particular courses of action, and then show how those improvements should affect long-term economic performance.

Mistake Two: Not Validating the Links Even those companies that create causal mod- els rarely go on to prove that actual improve- ments in nonfinancial performance measures affect future financial results. Of the compa- nies we surveyed, only 21% did so. In far too

# The Difference It Makes

many cases, management simply relied on its preconceptions about what was important to customers, employees, suppliers, investors, or other stakeholders rather than verifying whether those assumptions had any basis in fact. Overlooked were questions like, Do expe- rienced employees make fewer errors, and, if so, should we do whatever we can to reduce turnover? (Not before testing the hypothesis and determining which employees matter most.) Does accelerating product-develop- ment time lead to increased market share? (Not if our new products are only minutely different from our earlier models, or we have merely reverse-engineered those of our com- petitors.) If companies don’t investigate whether there is a plausible causal relation- ship between actions and outcomes, they con- demn themselves to measuring aspects of per- formance that don’t matter very much.

When we asked managers why they didn’t try to establish these connections, they often responded that the links were self-evident: Of course improvements in customer loyalty, em- ployee retention, new product introductions, or other common nonfinancial measures lead to higher profits and shareholder value. But unfortunately, our research indicates that such assumptions are often half-baked or wrong. Consider the fast food chain discussed earlier. Before creating its causal model, the company chose employee turnover as a key perfor- mance indicator, believing that high employee retention indicated a high level of satisfaction and motivation, which would in turn improve customer service and eventually boost profits. This set of assumptions led the chain to con- sider implementing a series of costly initia- tives, such as cash bonuses and increased bene- fits at employees’ one-year anniversaries, to reduce voluntary turnover. Subsequent analy- sis, however, found that the profitability of res- taurants with identical turnover rates varied dramatically. That’s because a 150% annual turnover rate at one restaurant could include turnover of cooks and cashiers as well as man- agement and supervisory personnel, while that same 150% turnover rate in another restaurant could reflect 200% turnover among lower-level workers but only 30% turnover among supervi- sors. What distinguished profitability was the turnover among supervisors, not among lower- level workers. The company was not wrong in believing that turnover was important. But a

failure to investigate whose turnover really mattered nearly led to a substantial waste of resources.

In another case, an information service pro- vider believed that it could improve its service offerings by creating alliances with vendors of technology products. The higher service levels, in turn, were expected to strengthen ties to

customers, who would then, theoretically, pur- chase more services. The company accordingly went to great lengths to forge alliances and rate its progress at doing so. Yet we could find no evidence that the alliances improved the company’s chances of winning new work or having its contracts renewed.

Businesses that do not scrupulously uncover the fundamental drivers of their units’ perfor- mance face several potential problems. They often end up measuring too many things, try- ing to fill every perceived gap in the measure- ment system. The result is a wild profusion of peripheral, trivial, or irrelevant measures. Amid this excess, companies can’t tell which measures provide information about progress toward the organization’s ultimate objectives and which are noise. A leading home-finance company, for example, implemented an “exec- utive dashboard” that eventually grew to en- compass nearly 300 measures. The company’s chief operating officer complained, “There’s no way I can manage my business with this many measures. What I’d really like to know are the 20 measures that tell me how we are really doing.”

If companies can’t prove basic causality, they certainly can’t determine the relative im- portance of the measures they select. And not being able to weigh these measures makes it hard to allocate resources according to their most beneficial uses or to create meaningful incentive plans. For instance, does a dollar in- vested in product development yield higher re- turns than a dollar spent on customer reten- tion?

In the absence of such knowledge, compa- nies in our study came up with various solu- tions for assigning relative weights to different measures. One of the simplest solutions was to give each performance measure equal weight. As one executive at a consumer electronics manufacturer put it, “It’s difficult to precisely assign weightings, so I just assume they are of equal importance.” But perhaps even more of- ten, managers base weightings purely on their assumptions about the measures’ strategic im- portance. Or they stress the measures that have become most fashionable in the business press or among consultants. Or, particularly when bonuses are at stake, they place greater weight on measures whose targets they know they can hit.

## Coming Up Short on Nonfinancial Performance Measurement

It’s not uncommon for business units within the same company to use different methodologies to measure the same thing.

Mistake Three: Not Setting the Right Performance Targets Outstanding nonfinancial performance is not always beneficial. Indeed, it often produces di- minishing or even negative economic re- turns—and again, most companies have no idea when they have achieved too much of a good thing.

We studied one company in an unregulated segment of the telecommunications industry in which customers’ switching costs were mini- mal. To hold on to the customers it had, the company set its sights on achieving 100% satis- faction for every one of them. However, the company never attempted to discover whether a correlation actually existed between an indi- vidual customer’s level of satisfaction and the revenues and profits that customer generated. We discovered, in fact, that the expected rela- tionship did appear—but only up to a point. Customers who were 100% satisfied spent no more money than those who were only 80% satisfied. In short, getting to 100% required considerable investment, with little or no pay- back. Only by determining the level at which satisfaction ceases to contribute to revenue growth can a business know whether and how much to invest, at any given point, in trying to raise it.

Target setting is inherently difficult because it always takes awhile for improvements in a driver of corporate performance to produce improvements in the performance it’s meant to affect. Sometimes, efforts to improve nonfi- nancial measures can even damage short-term returns. However, if a company can reason- ably estimate when the nonfinancial perfor- mance improvements will pay off, and by how much, it can set lower interim financial goals, which can subsequently be adjusted upwards. Unfortunately, many companies don’t make the effort, preferring to focus on initiatives that promise short-term financial results even though other initiatives may have higher long- term payoffs.

Mistake Four: Measuring Incorrectly Finally, even companies that build a valid causal model and track the right elements can fall down when determining how to measure them. At least 70% of companies, we found, employ metrics that lack statistical validity

and reliability. “Validity” refers to the extent to which a metric succeeds in capturing what it is supposed to capture, while “reliability” re- fers to the degree to which measurement tech- niques reveal actual performance changes and do not introduce errors of their own. For ex- ample, many companies attempt to assess ex- tremely complex performance dimensions using surveys containing only one or a few questions. The questions may offer respon- dents only a small number of scale points (for instance, 1 = low, and 5 = high). Many compa- nies then collapse these already simplified an- swers into crude binary scales (for example, customers are deemed satisfied if the score is 4 or 5, and dissatisfied if the score is 1 through 3). Although inexpensive to use and easy to understand, such simplistic surveys lack valid- ity and reliability and impair companies’ abil- ity to discern superior performance or predict financial results.

Many companies also make the mistake of collecting data before deciding what they want to find out. By the time they have identified the level of analysis they want to undertake and the areas of performance they want to compare, the data have already been gathered and organized in a manner that renders the de- sired analyses impossible. For example, one studied management-consulting tracked customer satisfaction at the individual client level, but employee performance at only the regional level, and operational perfor- mance at only the project level, making it im- possible to determine how employee perfor- mance customers or project outcomes. Companies that don’t or can’t know in advance the correlations they want to ex- plore would do well to assign a unique identi- fying tag or code to each one of the smallest units measured.

# affected

Measures can also lose validity and reliabil- ity when the methods for evaluating nonfi- nancial attributes are inconsistent across the company. We found that business units within the same company often used differ- ent methodologies to measure the same thing. One consulting firm we studied en- listed three different internal groups to mea- sure corporate reputation. Each group used a different measurement technique, and each produced very different—indeed, contradic- tory—results. At another company, an appli- ance manufacturer, several factories mea-

sured total employee turnover, while others measured only voluntary turnover. Such in- consistencies make it hard for top manage- ment to assess overall progress or to compare one unit’s performance with another’s.

Sometimes the problem lies in the nature of the thing being measured. Most businesses have trouble discovering how they are doing at such elusive endeavors as developing leader- ship or maintaining supplier relations. Nearly half of all Balanced Scorecard users surveyed by Towers Perrin said they had difficulty quan- tifying qualitative results. One unfortunate re- sponse to these frustrations is to avoid measur- ing altogether the “hard to measure.” In fact, a Conference Board study found that for 55% of the senior executives it surveyed, the leading obstacle to implementing strategic-perfor- mance measurement systems was an unwill- ingness to measure activities that posed this problem. And many of the companies that did try to track more qualitative measures ignored them when making decisions. When we asked managers why they chose to overlook them, the typical response was lack of trust in mea- sures that were unproven and therefore sub- ject to favoritism and bias. Although such wariness saves companies from relying on mis- leading results, it also denies them a compre- hensive picture of their performance.

Doing It Right At the root of these four mistakes is the failure to discover which nonfinancial factors have

the most powerful effects on long-term eco- nomic performance. The root of the solution, therefore, is to base decision making on a well- established series of links. By following the steps listed below, companies should be able to realize the full promise of nonfinancial per- formance measures.

The first step is to develop a causal model based on the hypothe- ses in the strategic plan. Unfortunately, how- ever, many companies’ strategic plans are more like mission or vision statements than road maps. In the absence of strategic clarity and concrete detail, managers are prone to disagree about which performance areas are critical to success, and that can make consen- sus about the causal model difficult to reach. If that’s the case, it’s best to test a couple of different causal models. Once its merits have been proven, the model finally chosen will be hard to argue with and will be the source of broad-based agreement about strategy.

Develop a causal model.

Most companies al- ready track large numbers of nonfinancial measures in their day-to-day operations. So to avoid going to the trouble of collecting data that already exist, companies should take careful inventory of all their databases. This inventory should not limit itself to perfor- mance measurement systems but should ex- tend to any information systems (such as pur- chasing, manufacturing control, and customer service) that may contain useful data on key performance drivers. One important byprod-

Pull together the data.

# Our Research

This article is based on extensive field re- search into more than 60 manufacturing and service companies, where we interviewed se- nior and middle managers about their orga- nizational strategies and performance mea- surement systems. Since the data obtained from these companies are proprietary, we have kept company names confidential.

In 14 of the companies, we investigated the

extent to which nonfinancial performance measures that were chosen on the basis of their supposed ability to affect future finan- cial performance actually had the expected relationship. Executives at each of these com- panies gave us detailed descriptions of the fi- nancial and nonfinancial measures they be-

lieved to be the key drivers of their organization’s economic performance. We then statistically evaluated whether these drivers really affected their companies’ per- formance.

We supplemented our field research with

two surveys of performance measurement practices. The first survey, in which a market research firm obtained data from 157 chief fi- nancial officers and other senior executives in a broad range of industries, was con- ducted jointly by the Wharton School and PricewaterhouseCoopers. The aim of the sur- vey was to determine the types of perfor- mance measures these executives used, to what extent they tried to assess the relation-

ship between nonfinancial measures and fu- ture economic performance, and to what ex- tent they developed and adopted business models that established causal links between the company’s financial and nonfinancial measures.

## A second survey of 140 senior executives in

the financial services industry (banks, sav- ings and loans, insurance companies, and di- versified financial institutions) was con- ducted jointly by Wharton and Ernst & Young. This survey focused on executives’ perceptions of the key nonfinancial drivers of long-term economic performance, as well as the use and adequacy of related nonfinancial performance metrics for those drivers.

## Coming Up Short on Nonfinancial Performance Measurement

Many companies’ strategic plans are more like mission or vision statements than road maps.

uct of this step is that it begins the process of refining vague or ambiguous definitions and of developing consistent measures for the or- ganization as a whole.

It may be, however, that a company lacks the data it needs even to formulate a causal model. If that’s the case, executives might want to focus first on a performance area be- lieved ultimately to advance the company’s strategy and positively affect corporate finan- cial performance (employee satisfaction, say). Next, it might take a small number of actions believed to improve performance within that area (such as more training). The final step would be to precisely and consistently mea- sure the effects of those actions. Did more training actually increase employee satisfac- tion?

One problem we repeatedly encountered in this step was data “fiefdoms.’’ An automobile manufacturer we studied wanted to determine whether its manufacturing defects were gener- ating too many warranty claims, in which case it would need to change its factory inspections. But the marketing people refused to share their findings with the operations people, mak- ing such detective work impossible. Ulti- mately, a senior executive had to step in.

There are many statistical methods for testing the causal model. Most companies have experience using correlation analyses and multiple re- gressions in their market research and quality improvement efforts. A good example of such statistical techniques is an approach used at Sears, which sought to develop a causal model and scorecard focused on three domains: em- ployee relations (“compelling place to work”), customer satisfaction and loyalty (“compel- ling place to shop”), and results for sharehold- ers (“compelling place to invest”). Like many companies, the retailer had already tracked hundreds of suspected drivers of performance within these domains. Because the data on them came from a large cross section of stores, the company was able to use regression analy- sis to identify the handful of activities that ac- tually were driving performance and there- 2 fore belonged in the causal model.

Turn data into information.

In addition to these familiar statistical tools, a slew of other techniques, many developed by marketers, can be used to validate the as- sumed relationships in the causal model. Qual- itative analyses such as focus groups and one-

on-one interviews can test management’s hunches about what’s important to customers, employees, suppliers, investors, and other stakeholders. For instance, a major industrial gas supplier decided that a primary driver of customer retention was customer satisfaction with the supplier’s billing system. Accordingly, the supplier began soliciting bids for a new, im- proved system. However, interviews with indi- vidual customers revealed that the billing pro- cess was not a major issue. Far more important was technical assistance. On the strength of this finding, the supplier dropped its plans for the new billing system and directed its capital instead to hiring new technicians and retrain- ing existing ones.

Causal mod- eling, if used at all, is often used only once. But reassessment of results should be ongoing and regular. A new competitive environment can weaken or neutralize the effectiveness of for- merly key activities, and the company’s strate- gic response can marginalize once important performance areas.

Continually refine the model.

Even in stable environments, ongoing anal- ysis allows companies to continually refine their performance measures and deepen their understanding of the underlying drivers of eco- nomic performance. For example, a company may believe correctly that low employee ab- senteeism is a key driver of financial perfor- mance, but its managers will still need to know whether employees fail to turn up because they are unhappy with their pay, with their working conditions, or for some other reason. At one information technology company in our study, a cross-functional team conducts analyses of integrated operational, accounting, and customer data every quarter and develops hypotheses about the relationships between particular company efforts and outcomes. For example, what types of customers is the com- pany most likely to lose if operational metrics fall below a certain threshold? Does higher customer satisfaction on some attributes (such as assistance in problem solving or flexibility in meeting changing demands) really lead to higher customer profitability? The hypotheses and associated test results are then presented to senior management. In virtually every meeting, these presentations spark new ques- tions about the underlying drivers of value, which are examined again in the next quarter’s data analysis.

## Coming Up Short on Nonfinancial Performance Measurement

In short, the refinement process should be never ending. Beneath the proven drivers of performance lie the drivers of those drivers. Since a business can’t ever know whether it’s gone deep enough, the effort to uncover these drivers must never cease.

Ultimately, the conclusions drawn from data analyses must be used in decision making if nonfinancial per- formance measures are to improve financial results. And clearly, companies should act on the conclusions that appear to promise the greatest financial reward. For example, a major finance company found that, in ascend- ing order of importance, employee satisfac- tion, quality (the number of processing mis- takes), and customer satisfaction were the fundamental drivers of financial perfor- mance. Consequently, the company began re- quiring managers to base their recommenda- tions for allocating capital according to the drivers’ relative importance. It also required them to explain how success in these three realms would be measured and to estimate the financial payback in these three areas.

# Base actions on findings.

The final step in the per- formance measurement process is determin- ing whether the action plans and the invest- ments that support them actually produced the desired results. In our research, very few companies did “postaudits” that could con- firm whether investments actually paid off. Even if the postaudit showed negative finan- cial outcomes, it would have the positive ef- fect of suggesting revisions to the causal model, and it might expose managers’ data-

Instead, such measures seem to have become a shabby substitute for financial performance. Our study shows that they will offer little guid- ance unless the process for choosing and ana- lyzing them comes to rely less on generic per- formance measurement frameworks and managerial guesswork and more on sophisti- cated quantitative and qualitative inquiries into the factors actually contributing to eco- nomic results. Otherwise, having proliferated in prosperous times, such measures are likely to be abandoned in lean ones, along with the managers who are charged with tracking— and justifying—them.
