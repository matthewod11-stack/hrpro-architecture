You’ve likely experienced at least one reorg in your career. And, like

most executives and employees, you probably dread them.

While a successful redesign can help a company boost performance,

they’re often a miserable experience for everyone involved. Most

reorganizations take 10 months from plan to implementation,

and the extended uncertainty leads to signiﬁcant stress and

anxiety, regardless of whether job losses accompany the change.

## HBR / Digital Article / Navigating Uncertainty About Your Role During a Reorg

It’s no wonder approximately 60% of organizations experience

plummeting productivity during this limbo state.

Reorgs can be especially diﬃcult when you’re nervous about what might

happen with your role. While it may feel like the situation is out of your

hands, there is much you can do to steer toward a positive outcome.

Here are a few steps to take if you’re worried about a looming reorg:

First, talk to your manager and emphasize how you bring value.

When you learn of the reorg, some restructuring decisions may be ﬁnal.

But chances are, many pieces are still in play. Proactively talk to your

## manager about the impending changes and your career.

To prepare for the meeting, clarify how your value aligns with the

company’s needs. Take a broad view of the business, including its

## challenges, market opportunities, and strategic direction.

Next, identify a few scenarios that demonstrate how you could

meaningfully contribute to the company’s success. You might say,

“Here’s what I see for the business. I want to help us succeed, and here

are areas where I have expertise or have led before.” Your manager will

appreciate your holistic perspective and company-ﬁrst mentality. And by clarifying the diﬀerent ways you can contribute, you make it easier

for them to advocate on your behalf.

Finally, remember that you’re not the only one approaching your

manager in this way, and they’re likely unable to make any

## guarantees. Acknowledge your understanding of these circumstances;

your manager will appreciate your empathy.

# Nurture your network.

A robust internal network is always beneﬁcial for career success. It

has even more value within the uncertainty of a reorg, when access to

information and opportunities could be a game changer for you. The

more supporters you have at your company, the safer you are.

Make a list of people to connect with, including allies, former

managers, and mentors or sponsors. In addition to nurturing your close

ties, consider colleagues with whom you’ve fallen out of touch, like

former teammates, cross-functional partners, or coworkers you used to socialize with. Dormant ties oﬀer more novel insights and advice and

can be a valuable source of knowledge and social capital.

One client whose role was in jeopardy received two separate oﬀers from

other areas of his company by reinvigorating his network. Your internal networking eﬀorts can also unlock external opportunities should the

need or desire arise.

Do some scenario planning.

Contemplating how the reorg may unfold and how you might respond

can help you react more dynamically to the unknown future.

What are plausible outcomes of the reorg for you? Scan the current

reality of the business, considering inﬂuential internal and external

factors. Think about the worst case, best case, and several outcomes

between these poles, and determine how you would handle each one.

Document action steps and consider timing: Are there strategies and

tactics you should pursue sooner rather than later? One of my clients,

for example, identiﬁed a possible opportunity to shift into a new

department. Energized by this scenario, he started contributing ideas to

the group’s manager and took on a problem they were facing. Getting

creative and adding value can boost the chances of your preferred

# outcome.

Finally, look for indicators that a given scenario will occur. For example,

if your manager asks you to detail your role and responsibilities, it’s

likely they’re under pressure to restructure their team and consolidate

roles. Staying alert to these signs can prompt you when to take more

# immediate action.

By proactively identifying a range of potential outcomes and

determining how you will respond, you can ensure you don’t get caught

# on your back foot.

# Make time for career maintenance.

Regularly updating your resume and LinkedIn proﬁle is good

career hygiene, enabling you to capture your contributions and

accomplishments while they’re still fresh. Use every reorg as a prompt

to undertake this career upkeep.

It’s also an opportunity to reﬂect on your overall feelings about your current role. A reorg can oﬀer a valuable inﬂection point, even if you

didn’t realize you were ready for one; perhaps you can let it be your

impetus to explore more energizing possibilities, either internally or

# externally.

Manage your emotions, and be kind to yourself.

It’s normal to feel stressed, angry, or fearful about your future during

this period of limbo. To manage your emotions, notice and brieﬂy name

them; for example, “I feel stressed I might lose my job.” Labeling your

feelings can help you feel calmer and reduce the risk of being reactive.

And try not to personalize any reorg-related conversations and decisions. The reality is that companies undertake restructuring eﬀorts

purely for business reasons. Thinking otherwise only adds to your

# emotional load.

Take this example. One of my clients was required to transition her

organization to another leader with her next role still undeﬁned. She

felt unvalued and upset, but knew she needed to be collaborative. In

reappraising the situation, she realized this change would give her

a chance to recharge and try something new. This helped her feel

more positive about the transition and showed that she could thrive in

uncertainty, resulting in accolades and a more senior role. Ask yourself:

What could be some upsides of this reorg for me?

. . .

While you may have limited inﬂuence over your company’s

reorganization, you absolutely have control over your response in

moving forward. Using the strategies here can provide a measure of

self-determination and opportunity, helping you successfully navigate

# through a corporate state of ﬂux.
