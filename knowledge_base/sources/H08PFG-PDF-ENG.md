Think of all the times you started a new job. You probably learned about

## key policies and formal processes around things like vacation time. But

employee manuals don’t teach other things, like whether you should

advocate for a promotion or wait to be asked, how quickly colleagues

expect email replies, or if meetings start on time or three minutes after

# the hour.

## HBR / Digital Article / To Make Your Workplace Fairer, Take Charge of Its Norms

Norms shape both individual and collective behaviors and serve

as symbols of organizational culture or “how we do things here.”

Employees pick up on these norms over time by noticing what people

around them do and inferring what would be acceptable (e.g., “Is it

okay to disagree publicly with colleagues?”). Being intentional about

setting and collectively valuing norms is key to removing ambiguity

for employees—and it’s especially critical for leaders in times of

uncertainty and upheaval when employees need a North Star at work.

Fostering a fundamental norm of fairness—where all employees play

on a level ﬁeld where they can succeed, support is oﬀered equitably,

and rewards are allocated justly—can create a virtuous cycle. As fairness

breeds fairness, with employees reciprocating with higher productivity

and a stronger commitment to their employers, fairness is a norm that

builds on itself and grows stronger over time. Of course, the reverse is

also true, and unfairness can lead to a self-perpetuating cycle with bad

outcomes, which is why it’s crucial for leaders to foster the norm of

# fairness.

To do it, you can become a “norm entrepreneur” for fairness—and

create an environment where employees can do the same. Originally

coined by legal scholar Cass Sunstein, norm entrepreneurs shape

what we perceive to be normal, acceptable, and expected. Norm

entrepreneurship is a potent tool in leaders’ toolboxes because, in some

cases, norms trump formal policies and processes as inﬂuencers of

## behavior. For example, a corporate policy such as unlimited vacation

time isn’t worth much if employees don’t feel empowered to make

use of it in practice because long leaves are frowned upon. Likewise,

organizations proclaiming a “speak-up culture” will not succeed

in encouraging employees to raise concerns if they see colleagues

sidelined, discredited, or penalized when they do. To create truly fair

and high-performing workplaces, we must work on what we want to

# accept as normal.

Here are three ways leaders can inﬂuence workplace norms and

encourage employees to act as norm entrepreneurs to build a fairer

environment for all to thrive.

Change perceptions of “how we do things here.”

Our perceptions of what others around us think and do are not always

well calibrated, leading to inaccurate beliefs about what is acceptable or

desirable—in other words, what the social norm is in a given context.

For example, recent research reveals that a majority of Americans

are in favor of diversity and inclusion initiatives, but they tend to

## underestimate the level of support among others.

At work, such “pluralistic ignorance” often happens because we

don’t have complete information about people’s private beliefs, and

the information we do have—observations of other people’s outward

behavior—is not necessarily reﬂective of how they truly feel. However,

mistaken beliefs should not keep people from utilizing opportunities at

their disposal, so fairness entails providing the information people need

to act.

Take parental leave, something that has only relatively recently become

available to men in some countries. As such, the social norm regarding

uptake is still evolving, and men might not avail themselves of the

parental leave they’re entitled to because they fear negative reactions

from their colleagues. At Santander bank in the United Kingdom, for

example, a survey revealed that only 65% of male employees expected

their colleagues to be supportive of ﬂexible work—even though when

asked about their personal opinions, almost every man at Santander

was in support of ﬂexible work.

When some men were informed in an experiment of their peers’ support

for ﬂexible working, their intentions to take between ﬁve and eight

weeks of parental leave increased by 62%, or nearly 13 percentage

points, compared to men who did not receive the information.

Correcting inaccurate beliefs through information helped many men to

behave more in line with their personal values and preferences. Because

humans have an innate drive to ﬁt in and go with the herd, correcting

inaccurate beliefs in this way is a potent lever for changing behavior and

keeping ﬂawed norms from taking hold.

## In addition to informational interventions, norm entrepreneurs can

decrease ambiguity by role modeling desired actions to show they

can be done successfully. Former transportation secretary Pete

Buttigieg and Reddit cofounder Alexis Ohanian are examples of norm

entrepreneurs who took parental leave and were vocal about their

positive experiences, helping to dispel the myth that men do not or

cannot take leave, at least in organizations where parental leave is

# available.

While senior leaders may have more privileges, inﬂuence, and power

to make change, employees don’t need to be in the C-suite to change

norms in the workplace. Often, the people who shape our expectations

the most are the ones closest to us, as equities sales trader Ronak Patel

explained about his 16-week parental leave: “The more men that do it,

the less of a big deal it becomes.”

To change perceptions of prevailing norms, ask yourself:

- What data might you be able to collect or share that could challenge

employees’ existing beliefs about an issue?

- What behaviors can you role model that will shift your organization’s

# culture in a positive direction?

- What is something you’re already doing that you wish more employees

did as well—and how could you make those actions more visible in

# your workplace?

# Find the right audience.

While everyone can be a norm entrepreneur, our eﬀorts are particularly

eﬀective when we tailor them to the right audience that sees us as

credible and compelling messengers. The case for fairness can be

especially compelling when made by someone who beneﬁts from the

status quo—or, on the ﬂipside, by someone who challenges stereotypes

by succeeding in spaces they weren’t expected to.

“Unusual suspects” can be the best norm entrepreneurs precisely

because they’re counter-stereotypical. Research shows that when white

male executives and top managers hired more women and people of

color, they were rewarded with higher performance evaluations; women

executives and executives of color of all genders did not receive the

# same credit.

Similarly, Katherine Johnson, Mary Jackson, and Dorothy Vaughan,

the protagonists of the ﬁlm Hidden Figures, became famous not only

because they were brilliant mathematicians, but also because they were

“ﬁrsts” in many ways at NASA in the 1960s. They started to change

norms by breaking glass ceilings and paving the way for others.

In both cases, people became credible norm entrepreneurs because

they did something counter-stereotypical: white men hiring women

and people of color and Black women climbing up the career ladder

# in STEM.

To ﬁnd the right audience for your norm entrepreneurship, ask yourself:

- In which spaces, conversations, or contexts might I be an “unusual

# suspect” for a cause?

- Are there people diﬀerent from me whom I could purposefully support

or advocate for?

- What are my sources of credibility (e.g., experience, authority, ability

to inspire), and which colleagues do I have credibility with?

- Whom could I tap as an unusual suspect to help advocate for my

# cause?

# Leverage collective action.

Fairness is not an individual sport but a group eﬀort. Often, for fairness

to become a norm, coordination is required. Norms spread when more

and more people take them up.

A company we worked with wanted to decrease ambiguity in hybrid

meetings and decided that virtual participants should speak ﬁrst, before

in-person participants. Like many of us since the pandemic began,

they had noticed that once in-person participants got into the ﬂow of conversation in a room, it was very diﬃcult for virtual attendees to get

a word in. These leaders also knew that the new “virtual-ﬁrst” norm

could not simply be mandated from above. So they recruited a group of

meeting organizers to pilot the new approach, share feedback, and serve

as role models. After a while, word about the new practice started to

spread, and the company could shift its messaging to say that “virtual-

ﬁrst” was an increasingly popular practice.

BBC journalist Ros Atkins followed a similar approach when he

started scaling 50:50 The Equality Project, which aims to equalize

representation of women and men in media coverage. After honing

his data- and goals-based methodology—whereby journalists count

the number of women and men featured in their content, aiming for

parity—Atkins started sharing his approach with strategically selected,

inﬂuential BBC colleagues. Given the grassroots nature of the project

when it began in 2017, Atkins had no power to compel or even

incentivize anyone to join him. But he had a proven track record of

## equitable results on his own show and credibility as a fellow journalist

to make the simple pitch: “We’ve found this helpful in our work, so

maybe you’ll want to give it a go, too.” Seven years later, more than 750

other BBC content creating teams had joined the 50:50 Project.

You may think that one person cannot change the norms of a large

organization. But these examples show that when people start with

what they can control—their own daily work—and recruit a small

circle of colleagues to join them, even a single individual can spark

# meaningful action.

This is what happened when students from randomly selected

American middle schools were encouraged to publicly advocate against

bullying as part of an anticonﬂict intervention. Reported conﬂicts

decreased dramatically, especially when the students who happened

to be part of the intervention were socially inﬂuential. These so-called

“social referents” tended to be closely watched by their peers for cues

on how to behave, and when they took a stance against conﬂict, their

actions had outsized inﬂuence in shaping other students’ perceptions of

# the norm.

Try it. Confer with your team to create a set of norms that you

collectively agree to uphold, such as starting and ending meetings on

time, scheduling social events during work hours, or doing weekly

feedback check-ins. Then, make those norms visible and top-of-mind,

such as by documenting them on posters in meeting rooms (for

in-person meetings) or sharing them in email reminders for weekly

feedback check-ins to create momentum. Team members could even

take turns being the “norm champion” who helps everyone uphold the

norms and steps in when violations are about to occur. If you land on

an approach that works, share it with a few other teams or units and

encourage them to join you.

To leverage collective action as norm entrepreneur, ask yourself:

- What is a norm that I would like to spread throughout my

# organization?

- How can I prove the concept in my own work ﬁrst?

- Which (ideally inﬂuential) colleagues could I recruit to try the norm

# shift with me?

. . .

Clarity around organizational norms can ground us and provide

stability during a time of uncertainty. Even more importantly, norm

entrepreneurship can help you create a fairer workplace where everyone

can contribute to their fullest—and have a better time doing it.
