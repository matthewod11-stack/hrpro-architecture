According to LinkedIn’s Workforce Conﬁdence Index, almost half of

employed workers are planning to look for a new job in 2024. This

kind of data may immediately prompt some leaders to take a closer

look at their employee retention eﬀorts. But in today’s labor market,

attempts to prevent employees from leaving may not be fruitful or

# entirely realistic.

Rather than only focus on employee retention, more forward-thinking

organizations acknowledge that some turnover is inevitable, and in

some cases, even healthy. When leaders recognize that employees

who choose to move on is a normal aspect of contemporary talent

management, their perspective shifts toward exploring the value that

former employees, also known as alumni, can bring to the organization.

Growing evidence supports the importance of alumni to organizational

performance as they can provide new business opportunities, share

## industry insights, enhance employer branding and reputation, and

support hiring processes by providing referrals or coming back as

returning employees themselves.

However, beneﬁts from alumni don’t just appear organically. Instead,

organizations have to strategically manage relationships with alumni

in ways that encourage them to bring resources back to their former

employer. One way in which a growing number of organizations, such as

McKinsey & Company, SAP, and Starbucks, are doing this is by oﬀering

corporate alumni programs. Similar to university alumni programs,

corporate alumni programs encompass an organization’s systematic

eﬀorts to engage former employees by providing opportunities to

reconnect with the company and other alumni. This can range from

creating a page for alumni on social networking platforms to sponsoring

a formal program that provides alumni with networking events, job

# opportunities, or exclusive perks.

While corporate alumni programs are becoming increasingly important

for organizations, they are still relatively new to most companies,

prompting questions about how to manage relationships with alumni

and build a strong alumni network. To provide direction, I recommend

that leaders consider ﬁve dimensions of alumni programs: investments,

## platforms and beneﬁts, communications, feedback, and integration

with the employee life cycle. These dimensions can help them start

or evaluate the current status of their program and guide the strategic

## management of a successful alumni network.

# Alumni Program Investments

One of the ﬁrst questions most leaders ask is, “What level of investments

are needed for a successful alumni program?” A recent benchmarking

report I coauthored with PeoplePath, a global provider of corporate

alumni management software, indicates budgets for alumni programs

vary considerably. We found 36% of respondents had a budget under

$60,000 while 20% of respondents had a budget over $300,000. The

program budget generally depends on the current size of the alumni

base and the number of years that the program has been in existence, as

more mature programs often provide more beneﬁts. However, strategic

leaders should not only consider the current size of their alumni base

when planning the budget, but also consider the overall size of their

employee base and projected turnover rates, as these indicate future

potential growth of the alumni base and the need for an increased

# budget.

Beyond the ﬁnancial considerations, leaders should also consider how

many employee resources will be allocated to the alumni program.

Management of an alumni program often starts as an additional

responsibility for an existing employee. However, as the program

matures, it becomes more common to create a full-time alumni

## manager role. More advanced programs with large alumni networks

may even assign a full team to managing the program. Having a

dedicated alumni manager or team not only ensures appropriate

attention is going into the company’s alumni strategy, but also provides

alumni with a designated point of contact. Where the alumni manager

and/or team sit often depends on the organization’s speciﬁc goals for

alumni, but they are most commonly located in marketing, business

# development, or human resources.

# Alumni Platforms and Benefits

Once an organization commits ﬁnancial and employee resources to

their alumni program, the next question should focus on what resources

should be oﬀered to alumni and how. Many companies start by creating

## an alumni group on social networking platforms, such as LinkedIn. This

is a particularly appropriate route for organizations that are just starting

to build an alumni community because it facilitates basic contact with

alumni and enables the sharing of company news and announcements.

Although this is a low-investment option for initiating contact, a social

media-only strategy constrains a company’s access to data which limits

their ability to develop strategic insights about alumni engagement.

Organizations with more advanced alumni programs tend to invest in

a formal alumni platform that hosts a variety of beneﬁts in addition to

groups on social media. These kinds of formal sites provide alumni with

a centralized location where they can ﬁnd updates about their former

employer and reconnect with past colleagues. For example, Accenture

manages its alumni network of over 400,000 ex-employees across more than 80 countries with an oﬃcial alumni platform that oﬀers a variety

## of beneﬁts and services such as prioritized re-hire opportunities, career

development resources, alumni newsletters, and networking events.

Alumni platforms also enable organizations to approve who can access

and participate in the alumni network, keep track of where alumni go

after they leave, identify the beneﬁts and services that best enhance

## alumni engagement, and target company news and announcements to

## relevant audiences. Jenn Pedde, vice president of customer advocacy at

PeoplePath shares, “A great corporate alumni platform not only oﬀers a

robust set of beneﬁts that support alumni’s ability to engage with each

other and with their former employer, it also connects seamlessly with

an organization’s systems allowing visibility into data and analytics.”

# Alumni Communications

Workers already have various demands on their time and attention from

their current employers before also factoring in communications from

a former employer. Capturing alumni’s attention without overwhelming

them requires a delicate balance. Although some organizations don’t

have a planned schedule for alumni outreach, a majority of companies

with formal alumni programs communicate with alumni on a quarterly

(31%) or monthly (36%) basis. These kinds of communications generally

come in the form of a newsletter containing company announcements,

## industry insights, and alumni news and events.

As an alumni communication strategy develops, organizations often

advance to more targeted approaches by segmenting the alumni

network or tracking alumni milestones. For example, Christian Mencke,

## Senior Director of SAP Alumni Relations, shares, “We customize content

for a variety of groups including executive alumni, ‘early talent’ alumni

who are at the start of their careers, alumni in speciﬁc geographical

regions, retirees, and recent leavers. The possibilities for targeted

communication are unlimited, and this is a critical factor for successful

connection with our alumni community.” Another targeted alumni

communication strategy is monitoring alumni milestones such as a

“one-year since exit” anniversary. Aligning communications with these

kinds of alumni milestones may be particularly important, as research

suggests reaching out one year after exit may be the best time to check

in about returning to the organization.

# Alumni Feedback

While some organizations consider an alumni program to be a top-

down eﬀort, others make considerable eﬀorts to gather feedback from

alumni. This often takes the form of issuing surveys, though even

this practice isn’t nearly as common as it should be: Only half of

organizations with formal programs implement a survey. When an

organization does survey alumni, they generally do so on an annual or

semi-annual basis. Broadly, these surveys should aim to gauge what the

company could do to better engage alumni as well as whether there are

untapped opportunities for alumni to support their former employer.

For example, surveys generally include questions that ask alumni about

which beneﬁts they already use or would like to see oﬀered, how

often they interact with the company, and whether they support the

organization by recommending it to others or bringing back business.

Particularly progressive alumni programs go a step further on alumni

feedback by creating an alumni advisory board. For example, the

## alumni network at the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation (BMGF)

created a 12-person alumni advisory board. Andrea Voytko, manager

## of the BMGF alumni network, shares their advisory board members

“serve voluntarily three-year terms, and live and work around the

world representing the broader alumni community in geography and

areas of expertise. Our board members provide strategic input and

## perspectives, advise on network oﬀerings, and connect with other

alumni to encourage engagement.”

Although an advisory board can strengthen the broader alumni

program, it is important to build it with care. To start, leaders should

provide clear guidance about the board’s role and purpose within the

overarching alumni strategy. Without this direction, the company runs

the risk of discouraging board members or making them feel that

their time is not being used productively. It is also important for the

board to be representative of the broader alumni network so that their

recommendations and guidance consider how to engage a wide-range of

## alumni at various career-stages with a diverse set of needs and interests.

# Integration with the Employment Cycle

Given that employees transition into alumni as they leave the company,

most companies with a formal program make some eﬀort to integrate

the alumni program into the exit process. A majority of organizations

with a formal alumni program provide materials about the alumni

network to employees during the exit process (76%) and/or send an

email on the last day encouraging the departing employee to register in

# the program (73%).

However, a more comprehensive approach can embed the alumni

program throughout the employee lifecycle. In this situation, the

organization considers the alumni program to be an integrated part

of the total employee experience. For example, some companies

introduce the alumni program during new employee orientation,

while other companies, like McKinsey and McDonalds, introduce the

alumni program as early as the recruitment stage to attract potential

employees. In doing so, the organization positions the alumni program

as another beneﬁt of becoming an employee and signals that they

support employees in their career development even if that means

taking them to a diﬀerent employer. This support ranges from enabling

access to a broad network that includes current and former employees

to opening up job opportunities at the organization if they choose to

come back one day down the road.

. . .

Investing in employees and treating them well is a critical element

for organizational success. But in today’s dynamic labor market

environment, focusing only on retaining employees may be ﬁghting

a losing battle. Instead, by developing relationships with alumni,

organizations can continue to reap the beneﬁts of investments made

in employees even after they’ve exited.

Developing relationships with alumni through a corporate alumni

program won’t be a one-size-ﬁts-all endeavor. Leaders need to carefully

consider how alumni ﬁt into the overall organizational strategy and

then allocate ﬁnancial and employee resources accordingly. But in

doing so, they can build strong programs that foster continuing

relationships with alumni, which will likely be critical for staying

## competitive in in today’s dynamic labor market environment.
