There are times in our jobs where we may feel disappointment or

frustration, but mostly on the surface. Think missing a deadline with

your team or not getting a long-shot promotion. Usually, we manage

to ﬁgure out a solution or next steps without the moment completely

rocking our world.

Then there are moments when everything shifts and you lose something

in your career that’s deeply meaningful. As author and host of The

## HBR / Digital Article / When Your Job Breaks Your Heart

Anxious Achiever podcast Morra Aarons-Mele described it in a LinkedIn

post, “sometimes it’s the death of a dream, like owning your business.

Sometimes it’s when your identity seems to escape you through a layoﬀ

or a job loss. And sometimes it happens when you don’t get something

that you really, really want.”

I wanted to learn more about this idea of “professional heartbreak”

— how it manifests and how we can cope. So, Aarons-Mele and I had

a conversation over a shared document and email. Here’s an edited

version of what we discussed.

HBR: What is a professional heartbreak?

Aarons-Mele: Professional heartbreak is the loss of something work-

related that feels as personally wounding as grief or heartbreak in your

personal life. This can be because something happened that’s so deeply

counter to your values system that you feel morally wounded. It can be

the loss of something that you loved, like your business or a long tenure

at a company, or a loss of a professional identity you’ve worked for many

years to build. It can be a betrayal from a colleague, boss, or client you

thought you knew.

Regardless of the circumstances, professional heartbreak brings up all

# the big emotions.

This idea crystallized for me a couple summers ago when a favorite

writer of mine, Taﬀy Brodesser-Akner, wrote about the Taylor Swift

song “My Tears Ricochet” in the New York Times: It’s “a song that

poses as a love song but is really about a diﬀerent kind of devastation.”

The anthem is ostensibly about a lover’s bittersweet mourning of an

ex who dies, but Swifties know the song’s true meaning: professional

heartbreak. For many years, the artist’s original song masters were

owned by a man she considered a father ﬁgure and a mentor and whom

she trusted. Without telling her, he sold the masters to an industry

ﬁgure Swift considered unethical. She tried to buy the masters back and

could not, and so she began to re-record her albums one by one as an act

of taking ownership of the art she had created. Swift felt her songs were

stolen from her, and she couldn’t get over it.

The song helped Brodesser-Akner understand her own professional

heartbreak, still raw in her heart: She’d learned she was being paid a

third of what her male colleagues were being paid at a job she loved. “I

was beloved by them, but also I loved them,” she told the Times podcast

The Daily. “I loved them so much. And when I hear this song, I cry… It

was such a betrayal of me. And it was such a betrayal of what I thought

# of myself.“

That’s heartbreak.

Have you experienced a professional heartbreak? What did it feel

# like?

I endured one in 2022, after I sold the business I had started while

on maternity leave in 2009. Everything about the sale turned out the

opposite of what I’d hoped: for my team, my clients, and me. I blamed

myself, and the grief was profound. In hindsight, I know that selling a

business is almost always challenging for the founder, and acquisitions

often go wrong. I’ve done a lot of healing since then. But when it

happened, I had the worst mental health crisis I’d had in 13 years. My

anxiety and depression were debilitating.

The worst part is that most people in my life couldn’t understand the

grief I felt. After all, on paper, I had successfully sold a business and

made money. Isn’t that the dream? Why was I so devastated? And

honestly I was ashamed that I had let my life come to a halt over my

# job.

But sometimes we feel loss in our work life very profoundly. People right

now are getting laid oﬀ. That’s a loss, that’s grief. It’s a small death for a

# lot of people.

The reason why we need to talk about professional heartbreak is that

it’s very painful and real, and yet often this heartbreak isn’t given the

weight it needs. Many of us pour our heart and soul into our career. But

when you go through professional heartbreak, even the people you love

the most might just tell you to get over it. “A job will never love you

back,” they say. Yes, obviously. But that’s not realistic either, because for

many highly skilled professionals and people who have built businesses

or do work that is very meaningful to them, their identity is deeply

intertwined with their professional self. Not to mention, many of us

have deep relationships with our colleagues. Having friends at work

makes us feel good. There’s community, belonging, rewards. And so

when we say “it’s just a job,” we’re denying very real feelings, which can

only exacerbate the heartbreak.

You recently asked your LinkedIn followers to share their stories

of professional heartbreak. What did you learn from their

# experiences?

Several themes popped up in all the stories I heard, both on LinkedIn

and via email, and I think they’re instructive.

First, professional heartbreak often stems from a fundamental clash

## between your personal values and those of your employer.

A chief marketing oﬃcer at a nonproﬁt shared: “I led an ambitious

rebranding initiative that promised transformation. The project

consumed years of my life, resulting in a new logo, website, and bold

vision supported by refreshed values. My pride in this achievement,

however, turned to devastation when I confronted the CEO about failing

to uphold these very values.

“His reaction stunned me,” the CMO recalled. “It hit me then that the

entire rebranding — the project that had consumed so much of my time

and energy — was just a façade. He wanted the appearance of change

without any real commitment to follow through.”

Betrayal was also a big theme. Professional heartbreak can mirror

romantic heartbreak in its power to fundamentally alter our ability to

# trust.

## Farrah Bostic, CEO of the research and strategy agency, The Diﬀerence

Engine, discovered this after a painful experience with a disingenuous

startup founder. “It’s insulting to keep being asked for your insight,

expertise, and experience and to ﬁnd out it’s not worth anything

tangible to someone you thought valued you,” she reﬂected. The

repeated pattern of being asked for input while being “strung along”

eventually destroyed both a potential business partnership and a

# friendship.

The damage went deeper than just one failed relationship, however.

“Candidly, it’s made me extremely gun shy around taking on partners in

the business I’ve built,” Bostic admits. The experience left her struggling

to believe that others would follow through on their commitments or

stay committed when challenges arose.

It sounds like this kind of heartbreak can have long-term ripple eﬀects.

Exactly. The paradox of such betrayals is their double-edged nature.

These experiences can teach valuable lessons about self-protection in

## business, but they can also permanently diminish one’s willingness to

take risks. The loss of that “freedom of opportunity” and “going for

it-ness'” represents a hidden cost of professional betrayal — a scaling

back of ambition and trust that can limit future possibilities.

There are also times when identity and loss coincide. Professional

heartbreak strikes deepest when our sense of self becomes inseparable

# from our work.

Lindsey Epperly’s story illustrates this intersection of professional and

personal identity. As founder of a travel company, she had known only

success: “I believed that because my business was a success, I was a

success,” she recalled. Then the pandemic hit.

The crisis forced tough choices. Five months pregnant, Lindsey and her

husband (also her business partner) had to walk away from their home

to keep their company alive. But the real struggle was internal: “My

identity was so intertwined with my business that those stark months of

continued sacriﬁce, strategic attempts at gaining any momentum, and

painstaking attempts to hold onto a dream were actually attempts to

claw my way back to a semblance of success that made me feel worthy.”

Each business setback felt like a personal failure, each strategic decision

a referendum on self-worth. It took hitting “rock bottom” for Lindsey to

grasp a crucial truth: “Even in a season of professional failure, I did not

have to view myself as a failure.”

## This question of how the personal and professional intertwine

really resonates with me. I left a job I loved once, and it felt like

I was breaking up with it — and it took me a long time to get over.

Absolutely, there are times when leaving work feels like a breakup.

Professional heartbreak can mirror the intensity of romantic

dissolution, as one former media professional explained to me. Her

relationship with her dream job had all the hallmarks of an all-

consuming romance: “My commitment to the brand instantly felt like

a marriage. I lived and breathed it, even changing my lifestyle to match

the mission (i.e., going from a non-athlete to a triathlete).”

Like many passionate relationships, boundaries blurred. “From day

one, I had no boundaries (2 AM edits? no problem!), and my entire self-

worth was wrapped up in the gig.” When her editor-in-chief resigned,

it triggered what felt like a marital breakdown. Her response mirrored

classic post-breakup behavior: She quit and ﬂed to Italy to pick olives,

seeking physical labor over intellectual work, with no plan beyond

# escape.

The healing process, too, followed a familiar pattern. It took three

months of thousands of miles of distance before she could face

returning to New York and rebuilding her professional life. This

“divorce” from her dream job ultimately led to personal growth,

however: She launched a freelance career that evolved into an award-

winning creative agency.

How can you get to the other side of heartbreak, like this person

did?

Start by working through your own complicated feelings. When

## professional heartbreak strikes, our harshest inner critic tends to

emerge. One founder told me, “Leaving my startup was devastating. It

cut to fears and griefs about how I understood myself as a leader and as

a collaborator, which took some time to process…We don’t talk enough

about what that can feel like.”

Similarly, after I sold my company, I was ashamed. I would constantly

berate myself: “You acted too fast. You made a stupid decision. You

were rash. You did what you always do.” This endless self-criticism,

when left unchecked, becomes a form of internal abuse, psychologist

David Bedrick told me. The critical voice inside us often completes

this devastating equation: “This heartbreak happened because you are

[insert your favorite negative self-judgment].” These thoughts don’t

appear from nowhere, he noted. They emerge from beliefs already

residing within us.

To heal, we must bring these critical thoughts into the open. Speak

them aloud, said Bedrick. When criticism remains locked within, it

goes unwitnessed and gains power. The path through professional

heartbreak requires us to face our inner critic with compassion, allowing

ourselves to feel fully while ﬁnding healthy ways to express and process

# our pain.

You probably also need space to grieve, right?

Yes, you need to mourn it. Writer Amy Shoenthal described her own

professional heartbreak to me upon coming back from maternity leave

as one of the most transformational experiences of her career. “I had

spent so many years slowly climbing a mountain, and the second I

looked away I was pushed back down,” she said. “Turns out, one of the

worst things we can do is ﬁght through… If you let [the negativity] in

and acknowledge what is happening, you can face your setback head

on. Mourn it. Work through it. Most importantly, you may ﬁnd it sets

you on a path that leads to something greater than you ever expected.

I had always taken so much pride in my work. I just had to ﬁnd a new

mountain to climb.”

I also think it’s important to accept what you can’t change, and change

what you can. Tori Rhoades, an electrical engineer, was part of a

mass layoﬀ well beyond her control at the height of Covid-19. It was a profoundly diﬃcult moment for her that left her feeling defeated and

questioning her self worth. But to move forward, she decided to return

# to school at the age of 45.

“It was one of the most transformative decisions of my life,” she said,

and she has since earned three additional degrees. “The journey hasn’t

just been about education; it’s been about rediscovering my value

and purpose. The layoﬀ that once felt like a loss has turned into an

opportunity for reinvention and growth. I’m proud of the person I’ve

become through this journey, and I’m excited for the future ahead.”

Are there any parting words you’d leave someone who is currently

going through a professional heartbreak, especially if it’s in the

# early stages?

You’re not alone, and what you’re feeling isn’t weird! If you can try to let

yourself feel your feelings without assigning judgment to them, moving

on will be easier and you’ll feel better. Give yourself the time to mourn,

and if you’re mourning while also working full time and living your life, make some time in your day to feel your feelings. Stuﬃng them down

just doesn’t work; they need to move through.

When you feel ready to get going again, it’s really important to spend

some time thinking about what will help you gain momentum as you

move forward or seek a new opportunity. Are you the kind of person

who likes to create a plan, block out your time, and create a sense of

momentum through action? Or do you need some time to try something

totally new in your life and experiment? Understand your ﬁnances,

what demands there are on your time and energy, and try to create a

path forward that allows you to look ahead and get excited rather than

looking back in regret and rumination. This too shall pass, and one day

## you might even credit it as a learning experience.
