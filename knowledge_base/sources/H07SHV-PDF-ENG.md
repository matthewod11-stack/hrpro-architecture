Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work “If you’re unhappy at work, you’re probably unhappy in life.”

To the strivers and workaholics out there, bestselling author and

Harvard professor Arthur C. Brooks has a message for you: change your

behavior before it’s too late. Brooks was one of you: a pace-setting boss

who expected others to work 80-hour weeks just like him, leaving little

time for friends and family. He says he was addicted not to work, but to

success. And he missed watching his kids grow up.

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

Today he classiﬁes behavior like his as a pathology that can lead to

misery. And he has concrete, actionable advice for increasing your

life’s happiness. In fact, he writes about it in a regular column for The

# Atlantic.

For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR

editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Brooks, co-author (with Oprah

Winfrey) of the forthcoming book, Build the Life You Want: The Art and

Science of Getting Happier, to discuss:

- What’s caused the severe dip in general happiness in the last few

# years?

- The two traits of those who ﬁnd true happiness in their work

- The diﬀerence between “deal friends” and “real friends”. The

real kind are “beautifully useless” and you need them more than deal

# friends

Happiness is contagious, Brooks says, and just being in a happy person’s

vicinity can make you happier. “But,” he says, “even more contagious is

# misery.”

ADI IGNATIUS:

# Arthur, welcome.

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

# Hi, Adi.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I don’t want to steal any thunder from the book tour, but I want to talk

about aspects of your research and insights, particularly as they relate to

# the world of work.

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

Absolutely. And the truth is that the book is based on a lot of the things

I’ve been teaching at the Harvard Business School, a class I teach called

“Leadership and Happiness”, which is a very oversubscribed class. It has

180 in the seats, 400 on the waiting list, and there’s even a secret Zoom

link they think I don’t know about. I’m happy to talk about what I talk

## about with my students, with our wonderful viewers here.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I hope a few of the students were just horriﬁed to hear that you know

about the Zoom link. But let’s set some context. Start with some data.

The numbers show that despite a thriving happiness industry, people

like you who think about it think we’re becoming less and less happy.

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

That’s true.

ADI IGNATIUS:

In the US at least, the number of cases of depression are up, the number

of people who self-report themselves to be happy is down. I know it’s

impossible to say exactly why, but what’s your hunch? What’s going on

# here?

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

We do have a pretty good idea of what’s going on. You ﬁnd that

happiness started to go into a little bit of a malaise, a bit of a decline, in

the late ’80s, early ’90s, but then it took a real big dip when social media

came along.

Social media was catastrophic for happiness. Part of the reason is

we distract ourselves when we’re lonely with something that’s the

equivalent of burgers and fries for a social life. They give you lots of

# calories and not very much nutrition.

There’s a lot of neuroscience behind this, but everybody knows that

when you’re bored or you’re lonely and you start looking at your devices

and at your phone, you actually get more bored and you get more lonely.

This is a huge problem, especially for young adults.

Then the coronavirus came along, and this was the most catastrophic

event for public happiness that we’ve seen in a long time worldwide.

Ordinarily, about 30% of people would say they’re very happy about

their lives, and 15% would say they’re not happy. The rest are in the

middle. Those are ﬂipped. Now it’s about 30% who are not happy and

15% who are very happy.

Those trends have not actually turned around. We know that it has

everything to do with social life. It has everything to do with our love

# relationships.

We know the habits that bring the happiest life—your philosophical or

## your faith life, your family life, your real friendships, and work that

serves others in person—these have been in decline. When those things

go in decline, there’s no tech that’s going to solve the problem.

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

ADI IGNATIUS:

You do have your ﬁnger on it. I want to focus on the world of work. I

think this is drawing from stats in the book, I think you say just 16% of

employees self-report that they’re very satisﬁed with their work. I want

to ask about that because we’re spending half our waking hours in the oﬃce, and yet we’re not getting the kind of fulﬁllment and satisfaction

that we deserve. So what’s happening here and how can we think about

moving the needle?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

I’ve been studying what brings work satisfaction for the longest time,

and when I ﬁrst started oﬀ, I was a fresh PhD. I thought, well, let’s see

if for-proﬁt versus nonproﬁt versus government work: which brings the

most happiness? Turns out, that’s insigniﬁcant. So I said, well, high

salaries versus low salaries. Above a certain level of subsistence, it’s a

wash. College educated, not college educated, white collar, blue collar,

# none of it matters.

Two things show up on the happiest workers, the people who have

the greatest happiness from work. They feel like they’re earning their

success, which is to say that they’re creating value with their lives and

with their work lives, that their accomplishments are moving the needle

and they’re being recognized for those accomplishments. And number

two, they feel like they’re serving people so that they’re needed. These

are the two big things.

A lot of people are watching us right now who are employers, and I’ve

been a CEO too. The number one thing that you can do for recruitment,

for retention, the ultimate rewards that go far beyond money are

making sure that you have a system where people are earning their

success through their merit and personal accomplishment. They know

it, they see it, and so do their friends. And they actually feel like they’re

serving other people and they can see the faces of the people for whom

they’re creating value. These are the big things.

One more thing to keep in mind, those things are easiest to do when

we’re in person. That’s just it. You said we spend half of our lives with

our coworkers at work. Well, I don’t know, man, not anymore. A lot of

people are spending half of their lives in front of a Zoom screen where

it’s hard to earn your success, it’s hard to feel like you’re serving other

people, and you don’t even get to see your work buddies. That’s tough

# stuﬀ.

ADI IGNATIUS:

If you’re right, then there must be some self-deception here. If you ask

people, they like hybrid. They like working from home. They talk about

it giving them a better work-life balance, all of that we think would

translate into fulﬁllment and happiness. But do you think we’re fooling

# ourselves?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

To a certain extent, there’s a set of biases that are at play here. For

example, one of the things we ﬁnd is that when you’re really lonely, it

impairs the executive centers of your brain. We know this. This is the

reason that when you’re really sad and lonely, you cocoon on the couch

with a comfortable blanket streaming Netﬂix and eating Haagen-Dazs.

What you should do is get up and go outside and get some vitamin D

and ride your bike and call your friends, but you’re impaired at that

# particular moment.

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

During the pandemic people started to become more isolated. They

made the best of that isolation by creating lives that were very, very

convenient, I have to say.

That said, some people do have a way better work-life balance because

they want to spend all that time with their families. The problem is all

of the people that are separated from their family and their friends and

actually not seeing people at work, that’s really catastrophic when it

comes to happiness.

ADI IGNATIUS:

The book in many ways is about agency: happiness and fulﬁllment are

not based on external variables or things that happen to us, but all very

much within our control. The problem is it’s very hard to take dramatic

actions to reorder one’s life. How do you get people who understand

they should be doing this, but who don’t? How do you make that leap?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

Part of the problem is that a lot of people notice that they can manage

their money and they can manage their company, but they can’t

manage their feelings. Or they can manage their home and they can

manage their family life, but they can’t manage their emotions. The

reason is that emotional life is a diﬀerent species of problem.

The stuﬀ around us in our work, these are complicated problems,

meaning they’re hard to ﬁgure out. But once you do, you can master

them and repeat the solutions over and over again.

Life and your emotions, the aﬀairs of the heart and the feelings that

you’re getting, positive and negative, they’re not complicated at all.

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

They’re what mathematicians would call a complex problem. That’s

a problem that’s very easy to understand and that no amount of

computational horsepower can solve it for you. You can only get in it

and experience it and work with it in real time.

A cat is a complex problem. A toaster is a complicated problem. Your job

is more like a toaster and your relationships are more like a cat. Your

feelings are highly complex. The result is that I can master all these

highly complicated things, but I can’t get my mind around my feelings.

The solution starts with understanding the science of human emotion.

This is what I’m doing in a lot of my work. This is when my HBS

students come to me, these phenomenally talented and successful MBA

students, really at the best business school in the world. And they’ll say,

“My biggest problem is I can’t manage how I feel, and I feel like I’m

really out of control.” So the number one skill that we get is to treat your

## emotional system, the limbic system of your brain, like anything else

that you would be managing.

Thinking about it as a complex system that you’re participating in,

and using the techniques that we talk about in the class, which start

with basically this idea of learning how to experience your emotions,

not as they’re delivered to you, but in the prefrontal cortex of your

brain so that you can decide how to react, substitute emotions, and

even disregard the emotions, but on purpose. That’s a speciﬁc set of

techniques called metacognition that I walk through based on cutting-

edge neuroscience. Anybody can do it.

The problem is, we don’t teach kids to do this. We don’t teach school

kids to do this. We don’t teach business people to do this. If I had my

way, every business school and every high school would have this class,

and when you came to work for a big company, they would have a class

in metacognition and emotional self-management that you have to go

## through for the ﬁrst week in orientation.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I assume these business students are, as you said, incredibly successful

by any measure. There’s probably a split, but do you ﬁnd they crave

what you’re teaching or that they come in skeptical of what you’re

# teaching?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

They really crave it. I mean, the most skeptical ones are probably not

taking the class. It’s an elective, after all. The ones who are really

skeptical are across the hall in supply chain management or something.

But the truth is that they really crave it and it’s because they want it.

My approach is basically this: you can be happier, but you have to

understand the science. You need to use the science to change your

habits and your lifestyle, and then you need to teach it to other people

to make it permanent in your life. The class is called “Leadership and

Happiness” because I want every leader to become a happiness teacher.

I’m doing 175 talks a year outside of Harvard, talking to business

audiences primarily. And I say, “Look, I’m going to show you a bunch

of PowerPoints on the science of happiness, and what I want you to do

is to take these slides, take my name oﬀ, put your name on, and I want

you to teach it to somebody so that you permanently understand this

technology and you don’t forget it in your own life.”

That’s the way to get it done. That’s the way that we teach it at Harvard,

and it really, really works. I’m telling you, Adi, I am my own ﬁrst patient

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

in this work, quite frankly. Because I wanted to be happier. As a social

scientist, I applied my own toolkit to myself. I wanted to be a happier

person. And since I’ve been writing about the science of happiness,

guinea-pigging it on myself, everything that I suggest in my column in

The Atlantic and to my students, I do myself ﬁrst to make sure that I

actually believe it works. I’m not just reading academic journal articles

and then teaching it to other people.

My happiness has risen by 60% in the last four years. In just four years.

To be sure it started at kind of a low baseline, but 60% is a lot based on

the best measurement techniques for happiness. So I know it works, and

I see the results of this every day among my students as well.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Let’s keep you on the couch a bit more. You come across as a positive,

presumably happy person. I know ﬁrst impressions can be oﬀ, but even

the sentence, “My happiness is up 60%,” I can’t imagine really what

you’re measuring to come up with such a speciﬁc ﬁgure. What are some

measurements? Why have your numbers changed and how?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

There are some general wellbeing surveys people can take. They’re all

over the Internet. And if they’re psychometrically robust, they can do a

good job. What I like to look at, however, is I pull apart the negative and

# positive intensity levels in aﬀect.

Aﬀect means mood. What we ﬁnd is that if you have a little bit of a

malaise, if you’re kind of a melancholic person, either your happiness

levels are too low or your unhappiness levels are too high.

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

Now, it seems like I’m splitting hairs here, but I’m not. A lot of people

think happiness and unhappiness are opposites: that if you’re unhappy,

it means you have a lack of happiness. That’s completely wrong.

## Happiness and unhappiness, or positive and negative emotion, they

largely exist in diﬀerent hemispheres of the brain. They’re produced for

# diﬀerent reasons.

## The negative emotions of fear and anger and disgust and sadness, these

are evolved to keep you alive. You should be very, very grateful for your

negative emotions. But if they’re too intense, they can hurt your quality

of life. Your positive emotions of joy and love and interest in things,

again, these are evolved and they’re really good things to have.

The problem is that some people, their happiness levels are too low.

Other people, their unhappiness levels are too high. I have a test that

I administer to my students. I didn’t develop it. It was developed by

psychometricians about 20 years ago. But it’s called a PANAS test, the

positive aﬀect negative aﬀect series, and it separates out the intensity of

# your positive and negative emotions.

What happens is eﬀectively that you have four diﬀerent characteristics.

You can be high positive and high negative. You can be low positive and

low negative. You can be high positive and low negative, and of course

you could be high negative and low positive. These are a quarter of the

# population each.

High, high, this is a high aﬀect person, it’s called the mad scientist.

That’s me. My problem with wellbeing is not that I’m unhappy or that

I’m not happy enough. On the contrary, it just means that I need to

# manage my high levels of negative aﬀect.

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

Other people have diﬀerent issues. Everybody wants to be high positive

and low negative. That’s called the cheerleader. It turns out cheerleaders

have problems, too. If two cheerleaders meet each other and marry, for

example, they won’t be able to bear any threat or listen to any bad news

or think that anything bad might happen in the future. They’ll spend all

the money and go bankrupt. Cheerleaders, they tend to be pretty rocky

CEOs because they will not listen to bad news, and they tend to get

wiped out by threats.

High negative, low positive, these are poets. They tend to be extremely

creative, but they suﬀer a lot from sadness and these negative emotions.

They have to manage that.

And last, low, low, these people are not horribly unhappy or low quality

of life. They have low intensity aﬀect. These are judges. These are

people who are sober. They make great surgeons, they make great

litigators and judges. They make great parents of teenagers, high stress

professions, etc. But they tend to look a little unenthusiastic.

I give these tests to my students so they can know who to marry, how

to manage themselves, how to build a management team around them

that complements them. It’s really, really instructive, and this is one

of the ways that I measure my own happiness and the management

techniques that I need, using the neuroscience for my life, and that I can

# apply to the lives of others.

ADI IGNATIUS:

To what extent do we need to be happy at work? I mean, one approach

to work could be I do it, I am hopefully making decent money to be able

to sustain myself, and I’m focusing on my personal development, on my

happiness outside of work. Obviously in an ideal world, we’re happy and

contented everywhere, but do we need to be happy at work? How critical

is that?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

That’s an empirical question about whether or not people that have a

high quality of life tend to be happy at work or it doesn’t matter. And the

truth is, if you’re unhappy at work, you’re probably unhappy in life. It’s

simple. I mean, it’s like nobody works an hour a day. Maybe you’re one

of these lucky people that can be on the four-hour work week. My friend

Tim Ferriss wrote that famous book, and the truth is, a lot of people

could get their work done in a lot less time than they do. But most of us

don’t have that luxury.

I’ve been working 80-hour weeks my whole career, and part of it is a

pathology. I’m not going to kid you, I talk a lot in my research about self-

objectiﬁcation, workaholism, which is all based on success addiction,

# and fears of failure.

And everybody out there watching, you know I’m talking about you

too. So take care of these pathologies because these are addictions like

anything else, and there’s a lot of brain chemistry in that.

But the point is, you’re going to spend a ton of time doing that. And

if it’s drudgery, that’s bad. You don’t want drudgery. At very least it

should be something that’s pleasant and making it pleasant sometimes

it’s completely out of our grasp. If you have a job that you truly hate and

a boss who’s just the worst, well, that’s no good. But a lot of it is in our

hands, and this is a lot of what I’m working on and what I’m trying to

help people understand they can actually manage.

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

ADI IGNATIUS:

You just mentioned workaholism. I think many of us suspect we suﬀer

from it, but maybe aren’t willing to look too closely at whether that’s

true. But the workaholism is a high, we get a sense of who we are, a

sense of accomplishment, etc. But surely it’s not fully a good thing.

What is your advice to workaholics who may not realize that that is what

they are?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

To begin with, workaholism is actually horrible for your quality of life.

The problem is that when you’re a workaholic, people congratulate you.

Nobody says, “Man, you are so good at drinking gin.” Nobody ever says,

“Dude, you’re unbelievable at how much methamphetamine you can

consume.” These are not compliments. People feel sorry for you when

you’re addicted to other substances or gambling or pornography or

anything else that’s deleterious, dangerous, and addictive, that captures

# your brain.

But workaholism, man, you work all night, you work 100-hour weeks,

people are like, “Dude, you’re killing it.” And you’re like, “Yeah, I

feel so good about myself, but how come I can’t maintain a proper

# relationship?”

The truth of the matter is that there are really a portfolio of four things

that go into having a truly happy life, and they need to be in both in

# abundance and in balance.

Number one is faith and philosophy, whether it’s religious or not

religious, it has to be something that zooms you out on the majesty of

life and makes you small so that you have yourself in perspective. You’re

going to have peace.

Second, you’ve got to be paying serious attention to your family

relationship. No joke, family relationships are the most mystical kind

of love, and you can’t substitute anything for them.

Your friendships, now, this is a really bad one for workaholics.

Workaholics have a lot of deal friends, but not very many real friends.

Everybody watching us knows the diﬀerence between real and deal.

And if you don’t, take the fellow workaholics, take the 10 people that

you see most and spend most of your time with and write real or deal

after each one, and see for yourself that you need to tune this up. Deal

friends are useful, real friends are beautifully useless to you. Do you

have enough useless people? That’s the question.

And last but not least is work. The two parts of work that really matter

are not title, not money, not admiration, not power, [but] earned success

and serving other people. Workaholism militates against these sources

of fulﬁllment in our lives. It impoverishes. It makes us poorer so that we

actually can’t pursue these other pillars. The result is we just don’t have

# a balanced portfolio.

Look, if everything you do for your happiness is work, that’s like putting

your entire pension into Greek bonds. It might work out, but I’m an

economist. I don’t recommend it. That’s not a diversiﬁed strategy.

You’re most likely not going to retire the way you want to.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Here’s a question from Saudi Arabia, it’s a simple, intriguing question. Is

# happiness contagious?

# HBR / Digital Article / Harvard’s Arthur C. Brooks on the Secrets to Happiness at Work

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

Yeah, happiness is absolutely contagious because social contagion

is a real thing. There’s a really great study, Adi, more or less in

our neighborhood, they’re called the Framingham Heart Study from

Framingham, Massachusetts. It looks over 50 years. It was set up to look

at people’s lives, at how diﬀerent social aspects of life are contagious

for physical stuﬀ, whether obesity is socially contagious, etc. But they

started to look at other things like happiness, and they found that just

being in the vicinity of a happy person makes you happier. Having

your spouse get happier makes you happier. Having your best friend get

happier makes you a lot happier.

But even more contagious is misery. That’s the reason you don’t want

your teenage kids to hang out with a kid who wears all black and

looks bummed all the time. And that’s because it’s like, “Oh, that

sucks. Everything sucks.” You don’t want that because that’s so socially

contagious that your kid is going to become unbelievably negative and

become sad. And nobody wants this for their children because they

have a sense of the social contagion.

The number one issue that I see in family dynamics is a social contagion

of negativity. That’s what each one of us has to turn around, is to try

to inject the happiness virus into our family and to basically do it on

# purpose.

ADI IGNATIUS:

This is a question from Nepal that picks up on your themes. You’ve

talked about people taking agency in their own life and their own

fulﬁllment and sense of happiness. But how should we deal with people

in leadership who don’t believe in any of this stuﬀ, who don’t believe in

work-life balance? You can work on yourself, but as you said, misery and

all this stuﬀ is contagious. How can you move the needle on leadership

that doesn’t appreciate any of this?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

When it comes to leadership, leader lead thyself. Your number one

employee is you. Don’t be the pace-setting leader.

Remember when Daniel Goleman wrote that famous book Leadership

That Gets Results? It was about the six types of leaders, and the number

one leadership characteristic that everybody thinks is great—but is

actually horrible—is workaholic pace-setting leaders that are in the oﬃce all the time and saying, “Look, if I’m going to ask people to work

hard, I have to work even harder.” It’s incredibly dispiriting for other

people. It lowers their quality of life.

When I was a CEO, I’m telling you, somebody on my executive team

says, “Arthur, you got to stop sending email at 5:00 AM and 11:00 PM

because people are going to stay up wondering if they’re going to have to

answer your email.” I said, “I don’t expect anybody to…” That’s not the

point. So I put timers on my email to do that.

But even better was when my wife started clamping down and saying,

“You need to sleep more. You need to go to the gym more. You need

to have more of a life.” So number one, if you’re a leader, you need to

get a hold on this problem because you’re going to be hurting yourself,

wrecking your relationships, and disheartening all the people around

you. This is a big problem.

Second, don’t work for a workaholic. Don’t work for them if you can.

And again, not everybody’s got all these degrees of freedom, but most

of us have a few choices in what we can do for work. And by the way,

if it turns out that your boss is abusing you and hopelessly addicted to

drugs, you got to change circumstances. That’s an abusive relationship.

I recommend steering clear of workaholics.

Now, what’s behind workaholism, fellow workaholics? It’s the success

addiction. Workaholism is a secondary addiction to the addiction of

success, and a lot of that’s based on the objectiﬁcation of yourself, which

is a bad thing to do, and a deep, deep set of fear of failure. Those are the

things to actually start working on. You can’t just say, “Work less, what’s

the problem?” It’s self-objectiﬁcation and fear of failure, almost always.

ADI IGNATIUS:

But you think of new entries to the workforce, and some of them are

your HBS students who are working for investment banks, who are

working for law ﬁrms, and there is this expectation of exploitation

where, yes, I’m working around the clock. It is killing me, but it is

getting me to where I will be rich, fulﬁlled, happy. How can people who

are ambitious in those ﬁelds do otherwise?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

One of the things that I tell my students is you’ve got to have a balanced

happiness portfolio, and killing all of your relationships to spend 110

hours in an investment bank is the worst, most unbalanced happiness

portfolio you can possibly get. Plus, you’re losing your best years to

establish the relationships that you’re going to want to cultivate for the

# rest of your life.

People say, “Okay, I’m 28. I’m going to go get an investment bank job,

they’re going to expect me to work a hundred hours a week. That’s ﬁne.

I’ll look for a spouse when I’m 35.” Probably not. I got the data, and the

data don’t lie. You’re more and more likely to actually not have the thing

that’s going to give you the most happiness in your life, which is your

marriage. We actually have to think in a balanced-portfolio approach to

the happiness that we’re trying to get, and making those sacriﬁces are

# really bad sacriﬁces.

Adi, guys like you and me, our age, in our ﬁfties, you notice that we

don’t make those sacriﬁces anymore. And the reason is because our

time parameters are shorter. But also we’ve had bitter experience with

these types of things. It’s funny, it’s like I’m a grandfather now and my

grandson was born and suddenly I was a lot less interested in working.

But part of it was the bitter experience.

I’ll tell you a story actually that will motivate this. When I was

interviewing this woman for my last book, which is called From Strength

to Strength, about how to get happier as you get older, a titan of Wall

Street. This woman was just famous and rich, a billionaire, and she was

horribly unhappy. She was my age, late ﬁfties.

And I said, “What’s wrong?”

She said, “Well, my husband and I were roommates. I’m kind of cordial

with my adult kids, but it’s not close. I’m getting bad reports from the

doctor. I think I drink too much. I need to go to the gym. My employees

are starting to doubt the wisdom of my decision-making. And I don’t

know, what do I do?”

And I said, “What do you mean? You don’t need a Harvard professor to

tell you what to do. You’re prescribing to yourself, stepping back, going

away with your husband. You’re already rich. Why don’t you do that?”

She said, “It’s true, but I guess I’ve always chosen to be special rather

# than happy.”

Boom, man. It was like a knife to my heart, Adi. All these years when I was running a company and the 14th hour at the oﬃce before the ﬁrst

hour with my kids, well, news ﬂash man, they grew up. They grew up

and I missed a lot of it. And I really, really regret that. Now I’m not going

to miss it with my grandkids, I get a do-over. I’m not going to screw that

up twice. That’s a really important thing.

If I could have had a little bit more perspective, I would not have been

less successful. The data don’t lie on this either. The 14th hour is not

productive. It’s just compulsive. Just like any other addiction, the 14th

drink doesn’t give you more joy. Stop at two, is the bottom line, because

you need the balance in this part of your life as well.

ADI IGNATIUS:

At HBR we try to be super practical, so before you go, can you leave the

audience shortcuts to happiness, or just things that viewers can think

about or do today that can be a meaningful step in that direction?

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

## Every week in my column in the Atlantic, every Thursday morning, I

have a big topic and I do talk about the science, but then I always give

three ways to live this thing.

Just in general, since we’re on the meta topic of happiness, the way

to think about happiness is that it’s not a feeling. If happiness were a

feeling, that would be very disappointing. It would depend on how you

slept last night and what you ate for breakfast and no good. If your

spouse yelled at you this morning, no good. Don’t chase the feeling.

Feelings are evidence of happiness, like the smell of the turkey is

# evidence of your Thanksgiving dinner.

Happiness is three things that we need to be thinking about and

managing in our lives. Enjoyment, satisfaction, and purpose. Those are

the three big things that we need.

Enjoyment is not pleasure, pleasure is an animal thing. Enjoyment is

the pleasure you get plus the people that you enjoy it with and the

memories that you’re making. That’s why beer commercials don’t have

a guy alone in his apartment pounding a 12 pack. They have people

enjoying a few beers together because it’s pleasure plus people plus

memory. Don’t do the stuﬀ that makes you feel good alone. That’s the

# rule of thumb.

Second is satisfaction. Satisfaction is the joy you get when you struggle

for something and you get that. Now fellow strivers, the striver’s curse

is you get on something called the hedonic treadmill where you struggle

and struggle and achieve it, but then it doesn’t give you very much

satisfaction for very long and so you keep trying and trying and trying

# again.

The solution to that is not to have more, it’s to want less. Your

satisfaction is your haves divided by your wants. Manage your

## denominator with a wants-management strategy.

And last but not least, it’s meaning, it’s purpose in your life. The way

to ﬁgure out if you have a purpose crisis is asking yourself two simple

questions. There’s no right answers, but you have to have answers. “Why

am I alive, and for what am I willing to die today?” And if you don’t have

answers, go looking for the answers with introspection. When you see

somebody that ﬁnds those answers, it’s like an actual miracle.

These are the three things practically to think about. “Do I have

enjoyment or just pleasure? Am I managing my wants or my haves, so

I can have satisfaction? And do I have enough meaning in my life by

answering those two questions?”

ADI IGNATIUS:

That’s great. I hope people took notes, I hope people try to act on that.

Arthur, I want to thank you for being on the show.

ARTHUR C. BROOKS:

Thank you, Adi. And thanks to everybody watching.
