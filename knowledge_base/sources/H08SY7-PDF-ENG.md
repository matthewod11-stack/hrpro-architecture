In 2008, Uber seemed like a terrible idea. Regulatory headwinds,

## an unproven business model, and the unsettling proposition of

summoning a stranger’s car from a smartphone app made most

seasoned investors balk. On paper, it didn’t make sense. But a handful of

early backers felt something else. Not certainty, but clarity. Something

# internal clicked.

They couldn’t explain it fully at the time—but they “just knew.”

## HBR / Digital Article / How CEOs Hone and Harness Their Intuition

That moment—that ﬂash of recognition—is what many people call gut

feel. In the world of executive decision-making, it’s often misunderstood

as impulsive or emotional. But in reality, it’s something more nuanced

and more powerful: the output of a process called intuition.

## Through years of my own behavioral science research and independent

coaching of senior leaders, I’ve come to see that while most leadership

advice centers on being data-driven, the world’s top-performing CEOs

often rely on something else entirely: intuition. And the most eﬀective

ones treat it not as a superpower they’re born with, but a skill they’ve

worked to sharpen.

# What Intuition (Really) Is

In my research, I deﬁne intuition as the internal, sometimes

subconscious process of integrating experience and data. It’s what

## happens when your brain draws on a vast reservoir of pattern

recognition, emotional memory, and contextual ﬂuency to produce a

sense of direction. That internal process culminates in a gut feel: the

moment of felt clarity when you just know what to do.

These two concepts are often conﬂated. But the distinction is critical:

- Intuition is the process.

- Gut feel is the outcome.

When seasoned CEOs say, “I trust my gut,” what they’re often doing—

consciously or not—is trusting the culmination of thousands of micro-

decisions, failures, patterns, feedback loops, and mental models they’ve

built up over time. Like an algorithm trained on deeply personalized

data, their intuition is continually reﬁning itself—especially when they

reﬂect, recalibrate, and stay aware of its limits.

Gut Feel Isn’t Just Emotion. It’s Experience Plus Data.

During my dissertation research, I studied early-stage investors and

how they made high-stakes decisions in contexts where traditional

analysis fell short. I found that when investors said they “had a gut

feeling,” it wasn’t an impulsive hunch. It was the ﬁnal step in a quiet,

layered intuiting process that integrated analytical information with

# emotionally coded experience.

Here’s where it gets interesting: By the time they experienced a gut

feeling, the data had been so thoroughly integrated with their memory

and emotion that it no longer felt like external information—it felt

personal. Internal. Like drinking sweetened iced tea: You know sugar

was once added, but now it’s fully dissolved. You don’t taste separate

ingredients; you experience the whole.

This is why trying to fully explain a gut feeling often backﬁres. Investors

who attempted to justify their decisions using only logic and facts often

ended up talking themselves out of the right call. Because intuition isn’t

just what you think. It’s what you know, sometimes beneath conscious

# awareness.

# When Data Becomes Too Much

## In a world of inﬁnite dashboards, algorithmic recommendations, and

cognitive overload, the real leadership challenge isn’t access to data

—it’s making sense of it. Knowing what to do with it. This is where

intuition becomes a strategic edge.

## The best CEOs operate successfully in ambiguous environments: global

crises, emerging markets, evolving tech landscapes, talent volatility. In

these situations, data may be incomplete or contradictory. Yet decisions

still have to be made, often quickly and under pressure.

That’s why intuition isn’t a soft skill. It’s a diﬀerentiator.

Good intuition doesn’t mean ignoring facts. It means knowing when the

numbers stop speaking and it’s time to listen inward. As one Fortune

100 CEO told me: “There are decisions where data gets you to 85%. The

ﬁnal 15% is always gut.”

# Learning to Hear What Whispers

Modern leadership is now also louder than ever. Media narratives,

## market pressure, social expectations, and even AI models all scream

for our attention. But intuitive decision-making is quiet and intentional.

It’s informed by both the data we’ve processed and the experience we’ve

accumulated.

The problem is, we’re not wired to hear what’s quiet. Social noise is

persistent and performative. But intuition doesn’t perform. It signals. It

nudges. It emerges. The challenge is learning to tune into what whispers

—because those whispers often carry the real insight.

# Why Some Leaders Have Better Intuition

Not all intuition is created equal. Some executives have a reliable

internal compass. Others mistake anxiety, bias, or ego for insight. The

diﬀerence often lies in how well their intuition has been trained.

In my work, I’ve found four key conditions that separate eﬀective

# intuitors from the rest:

- 1. Volume and range of experience. Leaders who’ve seen a broad

variety of situations develop deeper pattern recognition. A CEO

who’s weathered multiple economic downturns, organizational

restructures, or market expansions builds an internal archive that

# fuels future instincts.

- 2. Structured reﬂection. It’s not experience alone that hones intuition

—it’s analyzed experience. Great leaders take time to review

decisions, successes, and misses. They ask: What was I feeling?

What did I sense? What did I misread? This metacognitive awareness

# sharpens future calls.

- 3. Contextual calibration. Highly intuitive leaders don’t apply the

same instincts to every context. They know where their intuition is

valid—and where it’s vulnerable. For example, one executive told me

she never relies on gut when reviewing legal contracts, but does when

assessing talent ﬁt. Intuition is powerful in domains where you have

deep expertise, but dangerous in ones where you don’t.

- 4. Quiet listening. Intuition doesn’t shout. It whispers. It emerges in

the mental stillness between meetings, when walking, writing, or

## reﬂecting. In a world that rewards noise and speed, intuitive leaders

learn to seek stillness—and listen for the signal underneath the static.

# Practical Ways to Build Better Intuition

If you want to sharpen your intuition, start by treating it like a muscle.

One that gets stronger through deliberate training.

Here are ﬁve practices I use with executives across industries:

- 1. The “calm test.” Before acting on a strong impulse, ask: Would I

make this same decision if I felt completely calm? This simple question

distinguishes clarity from emotional urgency. Emotions aren’t bad—

but they’re not the same as intuition.

- 2. Decision reﬂection. After each high-stakes decision, jot down what

you felt, what patterns you saw, and what cues you followed. Revisit

weeks or months later to evaluate accuracy. Over time, you’ll build

# your own internal signal library.

- 3. Name the process. Label the stage you’re in: “I’m gathering

information,” “I’m interpreting signals,” “I’m sitting with

uncertainty,” or “I’ve reached clarity.” Naming where you are in the

intuiting process increases your awareness and reduces impulsivity.

- 4. Surround yourself with sense-makers. Create a trusted circle of

colleagues or advisors who challenge your assumptions—not to give

you answers, but to help you hear your own intuition more clearly.

Often, the best “gut checks” come from people who ask better

# questions.

- 5. Mine micro-decisions. The best leaders practice intuitive decision-

making in the small stuﬀ, too—whom to promote, how to respond in

meetings, when to stay silent. Every micro-decision is a data point in

building a more accurate, more conﬁdent inner compass.

# Action Makes Gut Feel Useful

There’s one ﬁnal, underappreciated element of intuitive decision-

making: decisiveness. The power of gut feel doesn’t just lie in the

insight. It lies in the willingness to act on it—with intention and speed.

The early investors in Uber didn’t just feel clarity—they moved on it.

They translated that quiet signal into bold action, and then worked

to make it the right decision through mentoring, resourcing, and

strategic direction. Their decisiveness reinforced their internal signal

and increased the quality of future intuitive calls.

In short: Gut feel doesn’t just inform the decision; it can shape the

# outcome.

. . .

Intuition isn’t a shortcut to brilliance. It’s the sum of what you’ve seen,

learned, and lived—folded into an internal voice that is quieter than

fear, ego, or pressure. But it’s always there.

For the CEOs who’ve learned to hone and harness it, intuition is their

edge. In a world obsessed with prediction and performance, it reminds

us that not all wisdom is loud. Not all signals are labeled. And not all

good decisions start with a spreadsheet.

Sometimes, they start with a whisper.
