Generative AI (gen AI) has revolutionized workplaces, allowing

professionals to produce high-quality work in less time. Whether it’s

drafting a performance review, brainstorming ideas, or crafting a

marketing email, humans collaborating with gen AI achieve results

that are both more eﬃcient and often superior in quality. However,

our research reveals a hidden trade-oﬀ: While gen AI collaboration

boosts immediate task performance, it can undermine workers’ intrinsic

motivation and increase feelings of boredom when they turn to tasks in

which they don’t have this technological assistance. Our ﬁndings have

big implications for companies looking to leverage gen AI’s potential

gains without hurting their employees’ drive when it comes to their

# other responsibilities.

# The Research

In four studies involving more than 3,500 participants, we explored

what happens when humans and gen AI collaborate on common

work tasks. Participants completed real-world professional tasks, such

as writing Facebook posts, brainstorming ideas, and drafting emails,

with or without gen AI. We then assessed both task performance

and participants’ psychological experiences, including their sense of

## control, intrinsic motivation, and levels of boredom.

Our ﬁndings point to two contrasting outcomes of human-Gen AI

# collaboration:

- Immediate Performance Boost: Gen AI enhanced the quality and

eﬃciency of tasks. For instance, performance reviews written with

gen AI were signiﬁcantly longer, more analytical, and demonstrated

a more helpful tone compared to reviews written without assistance.

Similarly, emails drafted with gen AI tended to use warmer, more

personable language, containing more expressions of encouragement,

empathy, and social connection, compared to those written without

AI assistance. This highlights how gen AI can help workers deliver

outputs that are polished, engaging, and well-structured.

- Psychological Costs: Despite the performance beneﬁts, participants

who collaborated with gen AI on one task and then transitioned to a diﬀerent, unaided task consistently reported a decline in intrinsic

motivation and an increase in boredom. Across our studies, intrinsic

motivation dropped by an average of 11% and boredom increased by an

average of 20%. In contrast, those who worked without AI maintained

a relatively steady psychological state. This ﬁnding reveals a critical

nuance to collaborations’ beneﬁts: While using gen AI tools can feel

productive and empowering at ﬁrst, it may leave workers feeling less

engaged when they shift to tasks that don’t involve AI support—a

common reality in workﬂows where not every task can or should be

# AI-assisted.

# Why Motivation Dips and Boredom Grows

Collaboration with gen AI can remove the most cognitively demanding

parts of a task, often the aspects that make work stimulating and

personally fulﬁlling. For example, crafting a performance review

requires critical thinking and tailored feedback. When gen AI generates

much of this content, the process becomes less engaging, and humans

may feel disconnected from the task. This sharp contrast becomes

evident when individuals return to solo work, leading to boredom and

diminished motivation.

In our study, we found that gen AI collaboration initially reduces

workers’ sense of control—the feeling of being the primary agent of

their work. Sense of control is a key component of intrinsic motivation:

When people feel that they are not fully in charge of the output, it

can undermine their connection to the task. However, we found that

transitioning back to solo work restores this sense of control, albeit at

the cost of enjoyment. Essentially, workers regain their autonomy but

feel less inspired and challenged.

These ﬁndings carry important implications for the future of work.

While gen AI can help organizations achieve short-term performance

gains, its overuse may have long-term consequences for workers’

psychological well-being. If employees consistently rely on AI for

creative or cognitively challenging tasks, they risk losing the very

## aspects of work that drive engagement, growth, and satisfaction.

Consider a marketing professional who regularly uses gen AI to generate

campaign ideas. The AI may produce outputs that are faster and

even more polished than those developed independently. However,

if this professional begins to rely on gen AI entirely, they may miss

opportunities to reﬁne their creative thinking, problem-solving skills,

## and sense of accomplishment—key drivers of personal and professional

# development.

Over time, the lack of intrinsic motivation can lead to disengagement,

lower job satisfaction, and even burnout. Increased boredom, which our

research showed following AI use, can also be a warning sign that these

negative consequences might be on their way.

# What Companies Can Do

The solution isn’t to abandon gen AI. Rather, it’s to redesign tasks and

workﬂows to preserve humans’ intrinsic motivation while leveraging

AI’s strengths. Here are ﬁve actionable strategies:

- 1. Blend AI and Human Contributions: Instead of letting gen AI

complete entire tasks, integrate AI outputs as a starting point while

encouraging human creativity. For example, gen AI can draft a

performance review outline, but the manager should reﬁne the

content with personalized insights. Similarly, AI could generate

initial ideas for a project, while team members are expected to

expand, reﬁne, and build on them.

- 2. Design Engaging Solo Tasks: To counterbalance the psychological

costs of AI collaboration, follow up AI-assisted tasks with work that

provides autonomy and a sense of creative challenge. For instance,

after drafting AI-supported emails, assign a task that allows workers

to be in control of designing a new project. These tasks allow

employees to exercise their skills, creativity, and decision-making

without relying on AI.

- 3. Make AI Collaboration Transparent: Our study found that workers

can feel disengaged when they perceive that AI has taken control.

Clear communication about how AI is assisting—not replacing—their

contributions can help workers maintain a sense of ownership and

# fulﬁllment in their tasks.

- 4. Rotate Between Tasks: Organizations can sustain both productivity

and engagement by structuring workﬂows that alternate between

AI-assisted and independent tasks. Rather than clustering similar

task types, managers can sequence the day to begin with cognitively

demanding, solo work and shift to AI-supported tasks later for

eﬃciency. For example, starting with strategy development and

ending with AI-assisted editing balances mental stimulation with

# output quality.

- 5. Train Employees to Use AI Mindfully: To avoid an over-dependence on AI, organizations can oﬀer training to build employees’ ability to use gen AI thoughtfully and eﬀectively. This might include running workshops on prompt writing, engaging in critical evaluations of

AI-generated content, or introducing scenario-based exercises that

highlight when human judgment should take the lead. Workers can

learn how AI might complement their work and what part their own

skills have to play in their tasks—a perspective that fosters autonomy,

## creativity, and long-term skill development.

. . .

Human-gen AI collaboration has immense potential to boost

productivity and performance, but organizations must be mindful of

its psychological consequences. By thoughtfully designing workﬂows

that integrate gen AI, businesses can unlock its beneﬁts without

compromising workers’ motivation and engagement. After all, the

future of work isn’t just about what AI can do—it’s about what humans

and AI can achieve together.
