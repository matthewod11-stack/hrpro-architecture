For years, business and HR leaders pinned their hopes for better

workplace learning on MOOCs, or massive open online courses.

Unfortunately, the evidence continues to show that these are not

enough on their own, particularly for those who most need them.

Companies now have more options, thanks to better technology,

innovative funding mechanisms, and old approaches reimagined to

meet today’s needs. Below, I explain ﬁve of the biggest developments

# in this space.

# The New Digital Apprenticeship

How a medieval practice is propelling thousands of workers onto the career ladder

The apprenticeship is perhaps the oldest form of workplace learning,

stretching back to ancient times, and boasting some illustrious alumni,

including Benjamin Franklin. There are more than 580,000 active

apprentices working in the U.S. right now — up 103% in the past 10

years, according to Department of Labor ﬁgures.

For companies that consistently struggle to ﬁll important roles,

apprenticeships may be an eﬀective solution. While apprenticeships

have historically been associated with blue-collar jobs, they’re

increasingly becoming a way to ﬁll white-collar jobs in the digital and

## tech sectors. Apprenticeships in the IT and telecommunications sector

grew by more than 300% between 2011 and 2020, while cybersecurity

apprenticeships grew by 600% during the same period, according to the

# Department of Labor.

This trend is powered by a growing number of companies, many of

which are focused on fast-growing ﬁelds like software engineering

## and data science, that recruit, support, and train apprentices on

behalf of large employers. One UK-based provider, Multiverse, was

recently valued at $1.7bn and claims to have served 10,000 apprentices.

“We’ve long been believers in the apprenticeship model, and we’ve

found it particularly eﬀective for tech and digital jobs,” said Rashitha

## Jayasekara, chief of digital manufacturing at Rolls-Royce, which

works with Multiverse to upskill existing employees. “The experiential

learning that apprentices get through hackathons and project work

allows them to combine theory and practice in a way standard

training doesn’t, and to continuously develop skills we need within the

# company.”

Verizon, another Multiverse customer, uses the apprenticeship model

to ﬁll software engineering jobs and reports that 95% of an initial

cohort accepted full-time oﬀers at the company after completing an

apprenticeship program. The Verizon program was designed to “lower

barriers to entry to software jobs while training truly great software

developers that we fundamentally believe can propel our business

through digital innovation,” said Shankar Arumugavelu, Verizon’s chief information oﬃcer.

Apprenticeships aren’t right for all training needs. For one thing,

they require a signiﬁcant investment of time — in the U.S., formal

apprenticeships are usually four years long. In some markets they

can also come with restrictive regulation. In the UK, for instance, the

government’s apprenticeship funding program has been criticized for

being too rigid and not in line with employers’ needs.

## A Fresh Approach to Tuition Reimbursement

How a historically elite beneﬁt is becoming accessible for all

Large companies have long oﬀered to pay for their employees’

continuing education. However, these beneﬁts have historically been

reserved for a small number of white-collar employees, for example,

those pursuing an executive MBA. Or employees were asked to pay for

their courses out of pocket and get reimbursed afterwards.

As the labor market has changed, more companies are oﬀering tuition

beneﬁts as a way to retain their frontline employees — store clerks,

baristas, drivers, and hourly workers. In response, a new class of

companies has emerged to smooth and synchronize the relationship

between training providers, employers, employees, and (in some cases)

the government. Employees receive coaching, advice, and support to

help them ﬁnd the training program that’s right for them, and the

training programs are paid for by the employer.

For example, in 2021, Target announced a tuition-assistance program

called “Dream to Be” in partnership with Guild, one of the leading

players in this growing space. According to Chief Diversity and Inclusion oﬃcer Kiera Fernandez, “Target has oﬀered a traditional

tuition reimbursement program for more than two decades. Now,

through our partnership with Guild to oﬀer Dream to Be, team members

can attend classes at more than 40 schools, colleges, and universities

… with no out-of-pocket tuition costs.” Fernandez said that as of April

2023, more than 25,000 employees have been approved for the program.

If designed eﬀectively, the beneﬁts of tuition assistance programs for employers are clear. For example, Jack Hartung, chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer

of fast-casual restaurant chain Chipotle, told CNBC that “employees

who take advantage of the company’s free degrees are three and a

half times more likely to stay with the company and seven times more

likely to move up into management.” However, research suggests that

while 84% of employees value tuition reimbursement beneﬁts highly,

on average, only 2% of eligible employees use this beneﬁt. This implies

employers must do more to take advantage of this powerful tool.

# A Shift to Learning Experience Platforms

How employees know what to learn next

Organizing and tracking what employees are learning can be a

cumbersome task. For years, this work has been done by software

known as “learning management systems” (LMS), which are relatively

simple tools that store learning material, typically in the form of

presentations, videos, and text. Most large companies have one, but few

employees spend much time on them.

In the last few years, a new wave of tools has transformed the LMS

## into “Learning Experience Platforms” (LXP), with features like skills

assessments, Netﬂix-style recommendations about what to learn next,

and internal social networking. LXPs “make learning relevant for

individuals, not just managing training programs,” according Todd

Tauber senior vice president of strategy at Degreed, one of the leading

providers in this space. Industry analyst Josh Bersin estimates the

market for LXPs is $500m, up from $200m in 2018.

Customers report that the model is working. Chris Harry is the chief learning oﬃcer of TEK Systems, a staﬃng ﬁrm that’s been using

Degreed. “Since moving our various employee development programs

onto Degreed, we’ve seen our highest-ever engagement and satisfaction

rates,” he said. According to Harry, 96% of TEK employees have created

an account in Degreed, and the company consistently sees 40 to 50%

of them actively using the platform each month, which he says is “far

higher than anything we’ve seen before.”

Results like these require real investment beyond simply buying the

technology. For example, another Degreed customer, Ericsson, said

it hired internal champions and developed an extensive internal

marketing campaign to roll out its program.

# The Democratization of Coaching

How all of us can have a Sherpa for our careers

Professional coaching is a well-understood way to boost workers’

learning, conﬁdence, and eﬀectiveness. However, it has typically been

an expensive tool, reserved only for senior executives. Moreover, even

for those who can aﬀord it, ﬁnding a coach can be a challenge.

New platforms have emerged that use technology to make it easier to

ﬁnd, match, and work with coaches. New companies provide tools to

assess what each employee needs from their coach, match them with

a coach who has the right experience and expertise, and even conduct

coaching sessions via a digital platform.

The space is growing. According to the International Coaching

Federation, there were 71,000 practicing coaches in 2021, up 33% from

- 2016. Investors expect growth to continue: The leading digital coaching

startup, BetterUp, raised $300m in 2021 at a $5bn valuation as part of a

wave of investment into coaching startups.

Much of this growth is powered by large companies oﬀering coaching

services more broadly to their employees. Danone, the France-based

food products company, has been working with one provider,

CoachHub, to oﬀer this beneﬁt to 250 employees. According to

Maxime Hollande, who leads diversity and inclusion for Danone in the

Netherlands, “these coaching sessions have been of big added value for

employees… One of the metrics we watch closely is the extent to which

each employee has progressed toward the personal goals each of them

deﬁne with their coach. The average score on this metric is 4.9 out of 5.”

Chevron, the American global energy company, has made coaching

## sessions available to 7,000 of its managers around the world via

BetterUp. “Prior to BetterUp, we utilized an assortment of internal

coaching resources and multiple external coaching vendors,” explained Rhonda Morris, Chevron’s chief human resources oﬃcer. “BetterUp’s

virtual coaching model … has matured our coaching culture making it

more accessible for all who want it. Coaches no longer have to travel to

meet our employees. Our employees have been very vocal about their

# positive experiences with BetterUp.”

Because coaching sessions are inherently private experiences, it can

be hard for employers to ensure a focus on the topics that are

most important to them. At Chevron, they measure the success each

quarter by asking employees to rate the eﬀectiveness of leaders who’ve

received coaching. “Leadership Eﬀectiveness is consistently one of our

highest scoring categories across our organization,” Morris said. “This

shows that our BetterUp oﬀerings are having a positive impact on our

# workforce and culture.”

# The Rise of Cohort-Based Courses

How to build real skills online

When it comes to online learning, most participants don’t ﬁnish

the courses they start, mainly because the learning experience is

asynchronous. Individuals must be disciplined and diligent enough to

complete large amounts of the learning material on their own. This is particularly diﬃcult in today’s workplace, where the number of

meetings and distractions has ballooned in recent years.

Now, a new delivery format called “cohort-based courses” has emerged

as a way to improve completion rates. Groups of participants together

take a course with deﬁned start and end dates, regular homework

assignments, and an instructor to run periodic live online discussion

## sessions. Within this more structured format, participants still access

much of the learning material on their own time, making it easier for

them to complete the course and have the chance to apply what they

learn over its duration. One of the pioneers of this space, altMBA, says

its learners have achieved a 96% completion rate.

Boston Consulting Group (BCG) is one leading employer that has

embraced cohort-based courses, working in partnership with Emeritus

(where I work). Lidia Juszko, BCG’s executive director of global

learning and teaming, describes how the format works particularly

well for a professional services ﬁrm like hers. “We’ve found that

cohort-based courses oﬀer a level of structure and support that makes

them more engaging than standard online learning,” she said. “Our colleagues report that the combination and cadence of ‘oﬃce hours’

with instructors, live discussion sessions with the rest of the cohort,

and short videos and exercises to be completed each week are a

more accessible way for them to learn. Learning and development

opportunities like this allow us to continue to attract and retain the best

# talent.”

HSBC, the global banking organization, recently began piloting cohort-

based online courses as well, and the early results are promising.

According to David Morris, global head of people capability, “One

of our challenges has been to deliver in-depth learning in an online

format, given the range and complexity of our markets. Our early

results show that the online cohort-based format is achieving signiﬁcant

## improvement across key indicators like completion, conﬁdence, and

# capability.”

The downside of this format is that the live learning elements that make

it eﬀective come at a substantial cost. A single license to an open library

of standard online courses costs about $30 to $60 per month for access

to thousands of courses (most providers also oﬀer signiﬁcant volume

discounts). Meanwhile, cohort-based courses can cost between $500 and $5,000 per course. This means cohort-based learning is unlikely to

be an option for all employees, and employers must carefully decide

who can beneﬁt the most.

We are in an unusual economic situation, one where recession fears are

up but the job market is still tight. As training budgets inevitably come

under pressure, organizations will need to ﬁnd more targeted ways to

address their skills gaps. The ﬁve approaches outlined above can help

companies move beyond the MOOC to ﬁnd a learning program that’s

# right for their employees.
