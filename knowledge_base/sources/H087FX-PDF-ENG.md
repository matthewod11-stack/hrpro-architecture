Before the pandemic, Dara was a research engineer, thriving in a job

that involved complex technical design and problem-solving. (Names in

this article have been changed for privacy.) She was also an avid baker

and a voracious reader. Then in March 2020, she got Covid-19. Even after

the acute illness had passed, many symptoms remained: Dara struggled

to sit up for more than half an hour, was too breathless and lightheaded

to walk even short distances, and had severe brain fog that left her

unable to hold a conversation or write an email. She used all of her paid

and unpaid leave to rest and try to recover. Eventually she improved

enough to return to work — but she knew her job needed to change.

Collaborating with her managers and the HR team, Dara found a set of

accommodations that ﬁt her needs. They gave her the option to work

from home whenever she wanted — up to 100% of the time and at a

reduced schedule. For days when she wanted to go in to the oﬃce, they

secured a mobility scooter to help her get around the building. She also

received additional unpaid leave to manage symptom ﬂares. “I wouldn’t

still have a job without [that] support,” Dara says.

As her health has improved, she’s been working with her managers and

HR to resume her career growth. She was recently promoted to a role

# with more managerial responsibilities.

Dara’s story, for all its challenges, is a hopeful one. However, many other

people’s experiences of trying to work with long Covid are not.

Annette was a researcher at a large university prior to the crisis. She

worked long hours and felt well respected in her department, which

she’d been in for seven years. She commuted nine miles a day on a bike

and was a mountain climber outside of work.

Then at age 30, during the height of the pandemic, Annette was left

with debilitating symptoms, possibly due to asymptomatic Covid. She

struggled with basic mobility and overwhelming exhaustion, and was

eventually diagnosed with myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue

## syndrome (ME/CFS) and postural orthostatic tachycardia syndrome

## (POTS): chronic illnesses that people with long Covid commonly

# develop.

Once Annette’s department returned to the oﬃce, management

required her to come in four days a week, even though the three days

that were standard for her colleagues would have been suﬃcient for her

particular job tasks. When she approached her supervisor, she explains,

“I asked for nothing but two days a week at home like everyone else had,

because I desperately needed…the bandwidth to ﬁgure out what was

happening to me.” Her boss referred her to HR, who sent her back to her

boss. “I went around in circles like that for a while,” Annette says.

Eventually her request was denied. She was told to use sick days if she

couldn’t come in. But after speaking with HR, Annette was left with

the impression that she might be penalized if she took too many days oﬀ, even though the department had a policy of unlimited sick time.

Annette told HR that she was going to raise her concerns with the

university’s disabilities oﬃce, and HR made it clear that they would

# contest her account.

Just as Annette was getting desperate, another university oﬀered her

a more administrative-based job. It was a step down in terms of

responsibility and pay and meant leaving the research ﬁeld she loved,

but it came with a truly hybrid schedule. With more ﬂexibility, Annette

could focus on improving her health, though she still grieves the loss of

# her previous career.

## Unfortunately, for most people with chronic illnesses, and especially for

long Covid patients, Annette’s experience is more common than Dara’s.

One of us, Katie, recently surveyed more than 850 people with long

Covid to understand their experiences at work. While many respondents

cited accommodations as the reason they could keep working, others

said they were scared to ask for any or weren’t given an opportunity to.

- “I was on short-term disability when I was let go.”

- “I was still in the hospital when I was ﬁred, still trying to recover from

# Covid.”

- “As it was 2020, no one believed me about long Covid, and I was treated

like it was all in my head.”

- “Due to the stigma, I was scared to pursue accommodations.”

Dr. Ilene Ruhoy, a neurologist specializing in long Covid and complex

chronic illness at the Mount Sinai Health System in New York, is

familiar with such stories. She says that many of her patients have lost

their careers due to their employers’ failure to accommodate chronic

illness and that it has left many of them feeling hopeless.

On the ﬂip side, as stories like Dara’s show, the right workplace support

can be transformative. Employers must not only help these individual

employees but also build disability inclusion into their cultures and

# talent practices.

# Companies Have a Long Covid Problem

As of March 2024, 6.9% of U.S. adults — 17.8 million people — have

long Covid, a multisystem illness that sometimes appears after bouts

of Covid-19. Its wide range of symptoms vary from person to person,

range from mild to severe, and can wax and wane over time. The

most common include severe fatigue, post-exertional malaise (PEM, a

## worsening of symptoms after physical or cognitive exertion), cognitive

impairment (such as problems with memory, focus, or comprehension),

pain, and neurological and sleep issues. Long Covid disproportionately

impacts women — about 63% of patients are female. There are no

oﬃcial treatments for the illness; while some people see their symptoms

resolve, others remain chronically ill.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Long Covid at Work: A Manager’s Guide

In January 2022 Katie was one of the ﬁrst researchers to link long Covid

disability with a worsening labor shortage. Later that year she and

David Cutler, a professor of applied economics at Harvard University,

estimated that long Covid costs the U.S. economy between $160 billion

and $200 billion per year in lost wages and increased medical costs. In

May 2023 the Brookings Institution reported that 700,000 people were

absent from the U.S. labor force due to the illness. Some of these people

may be too sick to work, even with accommodations.

Yet 65% of adults with the illness are still working — in some cases for

fewer hours, or while struggling with tasks that used to be easy for them,

or both. Even if they don’t realize it, many employers have a long Covid

problem, making it more challenging to hire and retain employees and

to support their productivity.

While the focus of this article is long Covid, the recommendations here

can help organizations manage the growing number of people with

complex chronic illnesses. These include not only ones associated with

## long Covid, such as ME/CFS and POTS, but also other illnesses that

## share some symptoms with long Covid — for example, post-concussion

## syndrome, cancer, and multiple sclerosis.

As employers consider how to provide and customize accommodations,

they need to be aware that it is often challenging for employees with

these illnesses to get medical documentation or even a diagnosis. There

are too few clinicians who specialize in them, nonspecialists may be

less familiar with them, and underdiagnosis is common. For example,

pre-pandemic it was estimated that 84% to 91% of people with ME/CFS

weren’t diagnosed. Dara, from our ﬁrst example, saw ﬁve doctors over

## four months during her early stages of long Covid but couldn’t get

one to provide documentation to her employer. Thankfully, her HR

department recognized how ill she was and was willing and able to

accommodate her needs; Annette can attest that’s not always the case.

# Accommodations Must Deliver Flexibility

For your organization to start supporting people with long Covid and

associated conditions, it’s important to ﬁrst understand how people experience the diﬀerent symptoms.

## The fatigue that people with long Covid and similar conditions

experience has little in common with normal, day-to-day tiredness or

weariness. This fatigue is physically crushing. As one respondent from

Katie’s survey said, echoing a sentiment shared by many: “[I] am now a

shadow of myself. I’m completely isolated due to the fatigue.”

Their fatigue is severe, multifaceted, and persistent, and it happens at

a cellular level. In people with ME/CFS and also many with long Covid,

the function of the mitochondria — the cell powerhouses that create

energy — is impaired, and there are physiological changes in these

# patients after exertion.

When people with long Covid exceed their energy capacity, symptoms

can often worsen, sometimes severely, as with PEM. Those in chronic

illness communities often describe this phenomenon using the “spoon

theory.” Imagine that every exertion costs you a spoon of energy. Taking

the subway to work? Fifteen spoons. Sitting upright at your desk or

attending a meeting? Ten spoons. While a healthy person may have

unlimited spoons to use, people with complex chronic illnesses often

have a ﬁnite number. Importantly, patients with severe illness may have

very few to almost no spoons, whereas patients with mild illness have

more. However, if they exceed their allotment, their symptoms ﬂare.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Long Covid at Work: A Manager’s Guide

Flares can be signiﬁcant, leaving some people bedbound for days or

weeks. What makes these illnesses even more confusing is that energy

capacities vary, as does the extent to which speciﬁc activities are

draining, even for the same person. For example, someone with long

Covid might have ﬁve spoons one day and 15 the next, or 10 spoons in

## the morning and only three in the afternoon.

Because long Covid and similar conditions are complex and dynamic,

we recommend that accommodations be customizable and designed

for ﬂexibility. There is no one-size-ﬁts-all approach — sometimes not

even for the same employee over time, which can be challenging

for employers to understand and manage. The good news is that by

adjusting how, where, and when people do their work, it’s possible

to respond to the symptoms that are most problematic (and “spoon-

draining”) for any given worker.

We advise starting with a menu of options and then customizing

from there. For example, if an employee experiences extreme fatigue,

## energy ﬂuctuations, or post-exertional malaise, accommodations might

## include ﬂexible work hours, part-time options, opportunities for

daytime rest, remote or hybrid work, and the ability to organize work

priorities around energy windows (i.e., “spoon planning”). For cognitive

diﬃculties or brain fog — other common symptoms — employees

may beneﬁt from accommodations such as task reminders, written

instructions, quieter workspaces to reduce distractions, asynchronous

## work opportunities, ﬂexible hours, and recordings and transcripts of

meetings they can reference. (A list of 10 common symptoms and

potential accommodations can be found at the end of this article.)

Supporting people with these conditions also means reviewing and

potentially adjusting the work they are asked to do. Is there room to

reassign tasks that are particularly challenging for an individual and to

add in tasks better aligned with their current capacity?

Consider recruiters, who may do a combination of on-site work (such

as job fairs and hiring days at speciﬁc locations) and remote work that

can ﬁt schedule needs (such as reviewing résumés, screening candidates

over the phone, and talking to colleagues across departments to

understand hiring needs). If a recruiter with long Covid has signiﬁcantly

## more cognitive energy than physical stamina, for example, could they

take on additional remote work in lieu of on-site tasks?

# Inclusion Must Be Built In

## A menu of accommodations along with individual job redesign eﬀorts

will help employers retain employees with long Covid and other chronic

illnesses and enable these workers to contribute more than they could

otherwise. But organizations that take a more comprehensive approach

— building inclusion into the entire talent cycle, as explained in

Ludmila’s book, The Canary Code — will have the true advantage in

## hiring, retention, and productivity across their workforces.

Here are some recommendations. Many are best suited to oﬃce jobs,

but some can also be used to support frontline workers (e.g., food and

beverage services, retail, nursing, etc.). Employers that need to ﬁnd

accommodations for frontline workers may want to focus on providing

## robust short- and long-term disability coverage and ﬂexible leave-of-

absence policies. In addition, consider retraining those employees for

less physically demanding roles, if possible.

Recruitment. Make sure job descriptions focus on essential job

functions. Do not include physical requirements for tasks that may

need to be performed only on rare occasions. For example, requiring

someone to lift 20 pounds “just in case it’s ever needed” is both

## unnecessary and potentially discriminatory.

## Candidate assessment. Exclude demands from the hiring process that

aren’t essential to the position. For example, don’t make an interview

day an endurance test unless that mimics the conditions of the job.

Onboarding and team-building activities. Avoid bonding exercises that

are physically or mentally taxing in favor of inclusive options. Try

swapping the obstacle course or the group yoga class with an icebreaker

that works for everyone, like asking people in advance to come up with

a six-word title for their autobiography and to be ready to share with the

# group.

Work organization. This is crucial to providing ﬂexibility. Most

ﬂexibility-focused interventions are free and provide a great beneﬁt to

all employees — but they’re critical for allowing disabled, chronically ill,

and neurodivergent talent to participate in the workforce. Consider:

- Remote-work options. When roles can be performed remotely, even

partially — for example, among call-center employees — this option

can be a signiﬁcant accommodation.

- Flexible hours and/or scheduling. Be open to diﬀerent employees working diﬀerent hours, with mutually agreed overlap. This can pay oﬀ for everyone: Employees with long Covid or similar chronic illnesses can work at the times of day when they’re most alert,

and their peers get more ﬂexibility for things like childcare and

other day-to-day responsibilities. Even in roles with ﬁxed hours, employers can oﬀer more ﬂexible scheduling options. This could

include allowing for later start times, longer breaks, or part-time hours

to accommodate energy ﬂuctuations and medical appointments, or

enabling employees to swap shifts with their colleagues (a practice that

workers resoundingly appreciate).

- Eﬃcient work processes and tools. Let employees align their work

with their energy levels by providing asynchronous collaboration tools

and minimizing unnecessary meetings. Ask people what would make

work easier for them — for example, having access to work-related

phone apps that can be used while lying down.

Workplace design. Inexpensive adjustments to the physical workspace can make a signiﬁcant diﬀerence. These could include:

- Improving indoor air quality. Better ﬁltration or windows that can

be opened are useful here.

- Providing seating for roles typically performed standing. Cashiers,

for instance, do not need to stand. In an oﬃce or a factory, you might

have a room with a couch, pillows, and/or a yoga mat that employees

can easily reserve for breaks.

- Oﬀering basic resources. Ensure easy access to hydration, restrooms,

# and quiet rest areas.

- Accommodating limited “uptime.” Some people with long Covid

struggle with uptime: They’re able to stand or sit for a limited number

of hours (or even minutes in some cases) but may be able to work for hours lying down. When it’s possible to oﬀer in-oﬃce supine

workstations or rooms where employees can meditate or nap, that may be an eﬀective accommodation; when it’s not, companies should

consider allowing partial or total remote work.

Skill development and training. Provide training options that

accommodate energy and symptom ﬂuctuations. Lengthy in-person

sessions can be exhausting, but so can ones that require sitting for hours

or progressing at a set pace. Flexible learning will include options for

in-person, video, or text-based work, allowing participants to control

the length and speed of sessions. Do not use “time spent” or “pace”

as a proxy for success. Instead, test skill acquisition or information

# comprehension directly.

Inclusive norms. Leaders should establish and role-model ﬂexible and

accommodating behaviors. For example, in hybrid meetings, while in-

person employees might be sitting upright on camera, make sure those

who are sick and working from home feel comfortable lying down on

camera or not being on camera at all. Use the raise-hand feature to

ensure that everyone can speak.

Employee inclusion training. Train managers and HR on nonapparent

disability inclusion. Complex chronic illnesses are frequently

misunderstood, so one option is to invite speakers with lived experience

to educate others.

Job redesign or task modiﬁcation. Where possible, adjust the duties of

a role to ﬁt the current capabilities of an employee with long Covid —

such as by shifting them from a physically demanding task to a less

# strenuous one.

. . .

There is encouraging clinical and research momentum for long Covid

and related conditions. In a congressional meeting in January, U.S.

senators on both sides of the aisle called for more funding to support

medical research. Advocates from multiple organizations associated

with chronic illnesses, including long Covid and ME/CFS, are lobbying

to create a new government oﬃce to support a coordinated approach

to researching these illnesses. And scientists are actively studying long

Covid mechanisms and trying to identify potential treatments. (Among

those scientists is one of us, Beth, who studies shared features of

complex chronic illnesses and is working on a clinical study of long

# Covid and chronic illness at MIT.)

## The Job Accommodation Network reports that workplace

accommodations cost nothing for more than half of employers, and

when there is a cost it tends to be onetime and around $300. Yet stories

from the many people whose careers and lives have been derailed by

long Covid and associated chronic conditions — and in some cases by a

lack of understanding from managers, HR, and coworkers — show that

our society has a long way to go in helping people with complex chronic

# illnesses.

When we fail to oﬀer suﬃcient support, we’re not just failing people

with these illnesses — we’re failing society, all of us. We’re depriving our

## economy of the expertise, experience, and perspectives of millions, and

we’re failing to create systems where all talent can thrive. Providing the

right accommodations for people with chronic illnesses is a human and
