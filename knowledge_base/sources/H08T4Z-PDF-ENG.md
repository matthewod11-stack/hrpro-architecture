The number of full time independent workers in the United States grew

from 13.6 million in 2020 to 27.7 million in 2024, according to research

by MBO partners. Eighty four percent are happier working on their own,

reporting better health and security. Once seen as a risky professional

path, forging your own path is something even senior corporate leaders

are now pursuing to gain control over their time, their income, and who

they want to work with.

So why aren’t more people quitting? Figuring out the right time to make

the leap can be one of the most complicated aspects of this choice—and

many people get that timing wrong.

One of us (Katrina) quit her job at age 23 and walked away from

a six-ﬁgure opportunity at a Magniﬁcent Seven tech company to

become a solopreneur writer and travel the world. At least that was

the plan; instead, she found herself working at Starbucks three months

later. From there, she built her network by creating new connections

and opportunities—eventually landing contract work with companies

like HubSpot, which led to a role at Digital Press working with

## entrepreneurs, then to startups like M1 Finance, and eventually to

# Category Pirates.

Another one of us (Eddie) waited until age 43, when he was a senior

partner at a consulting ﬁrm, to launch a solo gig—long after he had

ample ﬁnancial and professional capital to quit. Looking back, he

realizes he could have left years earlier—and the delay probably cost

## him millions of dollars in potential incremental income and precious

# family time.

The ﬁnal author (Christopher) made the leap at age 38 after being

chief marketing oﬃcer of Mercury Interactive, which had just been

acquired by Hewlett Packard for $4.5 billion dollars in 2006. It might

have seemed early, but after starting a company at 18, being CMO of

three public tech companies, and racking up over four million miles on American Airlines, he was ready for something diﬀerent.

If you’re pursuing a side hustle that seems to be gaining traction,

you’re probably grappling with this question yourself: Is there a way

to calculate the right time to quit your day job?

It’s a question we’ve researched, consulted on—and considered deeply

before making the leap ourselves. Our business, Category Pirates, has begun oﬀering coursework and publishing a newsletter that focuses on

this pivotal decision, and we’re currently in the ﬁnal stages of writing a

# book on the topic.

While there is no one-size-ﬁts all answer, our work with executives and

leaders who’ve successfully made the leap highlights ﬁve questions to

determine if you are ready to jump.

Can cash flow from your side hustle sustainably exceed your main hustle?

Ideally you have a sustained track record of doing this, but your side

hustle trajectory, pricing power, scalability, and word of mouth can

help you make the leap a bit earlier. A strong trajectory can be enough

to estimate the potential of your side hustle if you gave it your full

attention and time. Your side hustle must have pricing power, which is

the most truthful signal of demand. New automation tools like Zapier

can help you scale your side hustle without just adding time or labor

since how you sell (your business model) matters more than what you sell (your oﬀer). Finally, your side hustle must generate word of mouth

# in an organic and easily ampliﬁable way.

Dickie Bush was making $200,000 per year at BlackRock in his mid-

twenties. He quit BlackRock 14 months after launching a digital writing

business with Nicolas Cole. By that point, it was paying him four times

his salary and showed a solid trajectory, with increasing pricing power,

ability to scale, and digital word of mouth. Now their business generates

# more than $6 million dollars in revenue.

Does your superpower generate a 10x outcome?

A 10x outcome is a commonly used benchmark in management

consulting; it refers to a client getting a revenue, proﬁt or valuation

result directly from your work that is at least ten times more than it

# costs.

What’s your superpower? Deﬁning this is essential—and not as easy as

you think. Hint: it has nothing to do with your title, pedigree, or resume.

Your superpower must be a unique ability that’s easily quantiﬁed in the

# marketplace by others.

Holley Miller was the director of global brand for Allergan, the

pharmaceutical and medical device company, when she built and

executed a category design strategy that quadrupled revenue for a

product from $25 million to $100 million in four years. She did it

by radically changing their marketing—by reframing and naming a diﬀerent end user problem instead of just marketing features and technology. As a result, end users and physicians saw Allergan’s oﬀer

as a category of one with no substitutes. Revenue quadrupled without

adding incremental sales reps or dramatic increases in operating

# expenses.

Miller realized her ability to frame, name, and claim a radically diﬀerent

strategy in med tech was quite rare and the outcomes she generated

were exponentially larger than her mid-six-ﬁgure salary. She received

conﬁrmation of this when competitors began calling to poach her to

their teams. So instead of being an executive, she’s now the founder

and president of Grey Matter Marketing with a team of 11 utilizing her

superpowers on her own terms designing new categories for companies

# in life sciences.

Do you have enough capital—and the right kinds?

Money set aside is a great safety net, but you need less than what

you think—it costs about $10,000 to $40,000 to actually launch a

business, on average—and money alone is insuﬃcient. You need three

other types of capital. Reputation capital is a track record of repeatable

outcomes for a speciﬁc problem and the type of clients you are known

for serving. Relationship capital is having three types of people in your

corner, including those who can see the upside you overlook, loved ones

who won’t lie to you, and fellow creators who love to jam with you.

Intellectual capital is knowledge you have converted into an asset others

can access, pay you for, and achieve outcomes while you are asleep. This

can be books, courses, diagnostics, frameworks, or tools that you can

monetize with no time or for an extreme price premium on your time.

Jeﬀ Klimkowski wanted to be an investment banker since the ninth

grade and realized his dream at Deutsche Bank for 13 years. But

he walked away from seven ﬁgures in deferred compensation and a

looming promotion to managing director to pursue another dream he

had with his friends from elementary school, Dude Wipes.

Dude Wipes is the category king of ﬂushable wipes, which Jeﬀ co-

founded with his childhood buddies Sean Riley and Ryan Meegan, the

CEO and CMO of Dude Wipes, respectively. They were living together

after college and realized that for guys who love beer and burritos,

regular toilet paper wasn’t going to cut it. They started this as a side

hustle over 10 years ago. Sean and Ryan had 9 to 5 jobs and would pack and ship wipes from 6 PM to midnight. Jeﬀ would provide working

capital with his investment banking bonus checks. They scored an

investment from Mark Cuban on Shark Tank, who bought 20% of the

# company.

Humor was their superpower. They were willing to make honest

jokes about hygiene via social media that would never make it past

## conservative marketing departments and nervous legal departments

at a Fortune 500 company. Soon after, Dude Wipes was growing fast enough that Jeﬀ had to make a decision. Jeﬀ had a reputation as

## both entrepreneur and investment banker, massive encouragement and

## support from his boss, and deep expertise in M&A and capital markets—

all qualities that would serve him well as CFO of Dude Wipes. As Sean

said, “You can always go back and get another investment banking job.”

Dude Wipes did $219 million in retail revenue in 2024 and just recently

closed a signiﬁcant minority investment from a leading consumer

# private equity ﬁrm.

Have you mastered your emotions?

Without emotional regulation, it’s hard to get the economics right. The

hardest part of quitting isn’t inconsistent cash ﬂow but the constant

self-doubt, imposter syndrome, and loneliness. Your emotions can

wreak havoc on your pricing by causing you to undervalue your product or service and oﬀer discounts before a customer even asks.

Nick Bennett teaches other solopreneurs how to make the leap, by

providing concrete strategies to scale but also coaching to manage all

the negative voices and emotions. When Nick was building his business,

he realized that running with others on the same journey was crucial.

He built a text thread with three other entrepreneurs that eventually

grew to a Slack channel of over 50. While he was successful in his

coaching and consulting, he realized the power of community and saw

an opportunity to meaningfully raise his price vis-a-vis his time. He and his partner created an oﬀer that generated $30,000 in one weekend.

Does your commitment to your craft and mission exceed your need for kudos and money?

If you’re a writer, you must ﬁnd joy in becoming a better writer even if

your writing goes nowhere. You must be clear about and so committed

to your mission that you are willing to walk away from money that

doesn’t align with your mission. You must love the problem you solve more so than the solution you oﬀer. This ensures you will have the

perseverance to innovate and increase the odds of outcomes for your

clients. Love of your craft and mission always leads to greater economic

# abundance.

Danny Bauer helps school principals achieve massive student and

culture outcomes. Adam Frankl helps developer-facing startups rapidly

scale and secure their next round of funding. Both had successful solo

consulting businesses, but both were so devoted to their craft they kept

innovating. Now both run six-ﬁgure digital communities full of their

people that they can help at scale and serve as a pipeline for their

consulting. Danny launched a top-ranked podcast and Adam wrote a

# best-selling book in his niche.

Based on our work in the space, we expect the number of independent

workers to double in a decade. Personal and ﬁnancial freedom are too

appealing, especially as job security at large employers in business and

## government wanes. The rise of single-person households from 8% in

1940 to 28% in 2020 makes it easier to go independent with less people

to provide for. But the pull to create will accelerate this transition.

Our data shows 77% of U.S. workers would love to be “paid to create.”

Millions will remember how creative they were as children, ﬁgure out

they can be paid to create as adults–and then make the leap.
