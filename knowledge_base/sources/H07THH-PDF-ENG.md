Flexible work is having an impact on employee well-being, according

to recent Gallup data. In our 2023 Global State of the Workplace Report,

which represents more than 140 countries, employed individuals who

were working remotely either full time or part-time (hybrid) said they

were experiencing more stress and more anger than employees who

were working onsite full-time.

We also asked HR leaders at Fortune 500 companies, who are typically

responsible for their company’s health beneﬁts, whether they thought

employees’ jobs were having a positive or negative impact on employee

mental health. Only 27% of CHROs who oﬀer the most ﬂexibility (requiring zero days in the oﬃce) said they saw a positive impact on

mental health, as compared to 29% of HR leaders who require one or two days per week in the oﬃce; 37% of HR leaders who require three

days/week; and 47% of HR leaders who require four to ﬁve days/week.

## At the same time, Gallup data shows that remote and hybrid

employees across the world were consistently more engaged than onsite

employees, which correlates with higher productivity and performance.

Again, Fortune 500 HR leaders agree: 41% of HR leaders with the most

ﬂexible policies said their productivity had generally increased in the

past year, as compared to 33% of HR leaders who required one or two

days/week, 32% who require three days per week, and 32% of HR leaders

who require four to ﬁve days per week.

This presents a complicated challenge for company leaders: Full

ﬂexibility means employee well-being might be in jeopardy. But if you’re going to require employees to be in the oﬃce full-time, you may

need to mitigate lower engagement and lower productivity.

So what can organizations do to promote both well-being and

productivity wherever employees are working?

Help people live their best lives with their definition of balance.

A common misperception leaders have about ﬂexible work is that

employees want to be mixing their work and personal lives during the

day. But Gallup asked a representative sample of the U.S. workforce: In

your best life imaginable, which of the following work schedules would you prefer Monday through Friday, whether at home or in the oﬃce?

- 1. A job in which you work 9 AM to 5 PM and attend to other

life activities before or after work (Gallup calls these employees

“splitters”)

- 2. A job in which you alternate between work and other life activities

throughout the day (Gallup calls these employees “blenders”)

The results were surprising: 50% of the U.S. workforce want to be

splitters and 50% want to be blenders. This varies somewhat by type of

## work: 45% of white-collar employees and 62% of blue-collar employees

want to be splitters, whereas 55% of white-collar employees and 28% of

blue-collar employees want to be blenders. Our survey of large-company

CHROs found that HR leaders consistently underestimated the percent

of workers who want to be splitters.

This matters quite a bit because when employees are not working in

their preferred ways — meaning if they prefer to be a splitter, but their

work requires them to be a blender (or the other way around) — they are

less engaged, more likely to report burning out at work, and more likely

to be watching for or actively seeking a new job.

Leaders need to make sure they understand what their employees want

before building solutions. Otherwise, mental health and productivity

are both at risk.

Make sure your employees feel cared for.

When Gallup asked large-company CHROs if their organization cares

about the well-being of its employees, 65% strongly agreed that this was

## the case. However, less than a quarter of U.S. employees could strongly

agree their organization cares about their well-being.

Leaders may feel like their organization cares about their employees —

but that doesn’t matter if your employees don’t feel like you care.

If your well-being strategy is based on programs that few people use,

then you have failed to bridge the gap between your caring and your

employees feeling cared for. Managers must not only understand what

programs are available, they must also be trained on how to talk

to employees about their well-being. While 72% of CHROs said their

managers were trained on well-being programs, less than half (49%)

said they were training managers how to have a conversation with their

# people about their well-being.

Require manager training on leading remote and hybrid teams.

Ninety-one percent of HR leaders said they have provided some sort of

formal or informal training to their managers around leading remote

and hybrid teams. Job done, right? Not quite. More than half — 57% —

of U.S. managers told Gallup they had received zero formal or informal

training on managing remote or hybrid teams.

One major issue is that trainings are often optional and often coupled

with a message to “own your own development.” In these situations,

what managers and employees hear is: You are on your own. Help is not

on the way, so ﬁgure it out by yourself.

Overwhelmed managers aren’t likely to complete these kinds of

trainings. Gallup research has found that managers leading hybrid

teams are more likely to report they are burning out as compared to

managers leading either remote or onsite teams. You might be thinking

managers will ﬁgure it out, but what Gallup discovered is that they are

not ﬁnding their way, but instead are losing themselves.

With mental health, engagement, productivity, and more on the line,

leaders should require training on leading hybrid teams that also

teaches managers how to put on their own oxygen masks before helping

others — because their mental health is at just as much risk.

To be truly engaged and productive, your employees must thrive in

both their work and their life. Organizations that help employees ﬁnd

their version of balance, prioritize their feelings of being cared for, and

ensure managers are actually equipped to lead remote and hybrid teams

have a good chance of improving both well-being and productivity in

# our new era of work.
