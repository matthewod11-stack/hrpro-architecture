For the past seven years, I’ve studied the overwhelmingly positive

impact sabbaticals have on people’s mental and physical well-being,

creativity, and conﬁdence. Through hundreds of interviews with people

who have taken sabbaticals, I’ve learned that the beneﬁts extend to

the teams and organizations in which they work. And yet when I talk

to organizational leaders about sabbaticals, many express skepticism

about whether facilitating them is practical, or even possible: “We’re

already at full capacity, so how would we cover the absence?” “How can

## our team function eﬀectively without a key member?” “My company

would go out of business if I allowed everyone to take extended breaks

— especially if they’re paid!”

I understand why bosses might be hesitant to support sabbaticals. But

I’ve come to believe that the beneﬁts to organizations of oﬀering them

far outweigh the risks.

Some leading companies agree. Although corporate sabbatical policies

in the United States remain relatively rare — only 5% of nonacademic

employers oﬀer them — they are a feature at dozens of successful

and innovative organizations, including Adobe, construction software

## giant Autodesk, Automattic (the company behind web-publishing giant

## WordPress), Genentech, Deloitte, Bank of America, and a rotating cast

of the Big Five tech companies (FAANG), depending on the economic

winds. Salesforce, Impossible Foods, and Apple would not exist in

their present forms without the sabbaticals — sometimes forced —

undertaken by their founders.

The percentage of U.S. employers with formal policies supporting

extended leave has doubled from 2019 to today. As these organizations

transform what was once an opportunity for the privileged few into an

equitable and important part of their cultures, they learn that oﬀering

sabbaticals can be a diﬀerentiator to attract talent, increase retention,

and rejuvenate long-tenured employees.

In this article I’ll describe the beneﬁts to performance, resilience, and

innovation realized by companies with extended-leave policies, and I’ll

identify the three pillars of a successful sabbatical program. (To share

your sabbatical experience and be included in my research, take this

## HBR / The Big Idea / When Employees Take Sabbaticals, Organizations Benefit

# Improving Organizational Performance

## My research highlights two ways that group performance improves

when employees are able to take sabbaticals.

Clarifying responsibilities. In many organizations, it’s not always clear

who’s doing what, and when. A job description rarely represents an

employee’s full contribution, particularly when they have long tenures

and retain duties tied to previous roles. This lack of clarity can lead to ineﬃciency and redundancy, not to mention frustrated and burned-out

# workers.

A sabbatical can reveal the full breadth of someone’s role and

responsibilities in a way that regular, shorter vacations can’t, because

all the duties of the leave-taker must be transferred to other people

while they’re gone. The duration of the absence creates a revelation

for both the employee and the employer. As they work together to

outline, hand oﬀ, and adjust work before and after the sabbatical (and

as colleagues adjust during the sabbatical), tasks that are unnecessary

are often eliminated and tasks that were delegated often stay that way.

In this way, work is streamlined and both individual and company

performance is enhanced.

Retaining talent. People almost always return from a sabbatical with

more energy and less stress — a clear win for organizations. Many

also return with fonder feelings toward the organization that allowed

them the break. It’s true that some might have used their time oﬀ

to reﬂect on areas of work where they are dissatisﬁed, which might

prompt a conversation about responsibilities and compensation upon

their return. But even that can be a good thing for companies and the

long-tenured high performers they want to keep, especially those who

are underpaid relative to their market value and are thus an unseen

# ﬂight risk.

Consider Carson’s experience. She had been working at a research

center focused on emerging-market poverty, leading partnerships

and innovation and seeing the center through a critical period of

formalization and growth. After ﬁve years in the job, she was feeling

undervalued in terms of her level of autonomy and pay. She and her ﬁancé had been fantasizing about taking a “monster” honeymoon. So,

she asked her bosses for ﬁve months oﬀ. To her surprise, they granted

the unpaid leave. She traveled through many of the countries her

organization studied during her leave, and it reminded her why she’d gotten into the work in the ﬁrst place. Her time away not only reaﬃrmed

her belief in the center’s mission but also gave her the conﬁdence to

consider taking her skills and experience elsewhere if necessary.

She came back reinvigorated, and she was pleased to learn that her

absence had caused the team to recognize the magnitude of her

contributions. Her bosses asked what they could do to keep her, and

she went from “feeling like a cog in a wheel,” in her words, to “feeling

like a grown-up with power.” She was promoted and, two years later,

became the executive director. The organization has thrived since her

return, doubling its budget and scope and quadrupling its number of staﬀ members and research aﬃliates.

# Building Organizational Resilience

Many company leaders I talk to fear that if they oﬀer a sabbatical, they’ll

essentially give a “golden parachute” to an employee who intends

to leave. Here’s some good news: According to my research, 80% of

extended-break-takers return to their companies. Of course, that means

that 20% do not. While this number is far preferable to the 0% of

employees who return when they are forced to quit to get an extended

leave, it does suggest that turnover is a legitimate worry. Recruiting and

training a new hire takes time, and the process is disruptive, creating

extra work for those who remain.

But when a sabbatical reveals that your employee wants to move on

from their role or your company, there are silver linings. First, you’ve

parted ways with someone who wasn’t committed to your organization

anyway. As one Zappos director explains, “If upon the ﬁrst sight of

daylight they sprint for the exits, at that point I wouldn’t want them on

our team anymore. We have no shortage of folks who actually want to

be here.” And second, new employees bring with them high motivation,

new ideas, fresh energy, and insights from their previous employment,

whether at competitors or in other industries, that can lead to more

# creative solutions.

When an organization oﬀers extended breaks as a routine part of

its culture, it builds the capacity to handle turnover. It’s a form of

resilience training, as the company is forced to ﬁll the gaps the absent

person leaves behind — even if it’s just for a little while — and the

colleagues who ﬁll them get stretch experiences and opportunities to

prove themselves. Ironically, enacting a sabbatical policy can help a

company both prevent and prepare for the departure of key people.

## The African Leadership Academy (ALA), a pioneering boarding school

in Johannesburg, experienced this ﬁrsthand. Ten years after ALA

opened, its cofounder, Chris Bradford, decided to step back for an entire academic year to accompany his ﬁancée to Europe while she

completed her master’s degree. When he returned, Chris discovered that

the school’s operations had ﬂourished in his absence, but its fundraising

eﬀorts had fallen oﬀ a cliﬀ. In response, he promoted the person who’d

been handling operations to be ALA’s permanent COO. Then he turned

his attention to soliciting donations for the school’s upcoming gala and

training others to better ﬁll this role. He set a personal goal to transfer

the role to a colleague within three years so that he could move to the United States, where his ﬁancée would soon start an academic job.

Chris’s sabbatical marked the beginning of the end of his time at ALA.

But from an organizational perspective, it also led to the identiﬁcation

of talented potential successors.

# Fostering Innovation

Creativity is an essential workplace skill — it’s a crucial component

of innovation and boosts both productivity and adaptability.

Unfortunately, the workdays of many people, governed as they are by

task lists and deadlines, aren’t conducive to creative thinking. What’s

needed is exploration and play, which requires unstructured time —

exactly what employees get when they take sabbaticals.

That was certainly the case for Cheryl P. Johnson, CEO of COTS

(Coalition on Temporary Shelter). After running the Detroit-based

organization for 17 years, she took a paid sabbatical that was funded

by an area donor. She started her extended leave with a monthlong

meditation retreat in upstate New York and followed that by taking

## a yearlong coaching certiﬁcation program on the West Coast. She

returned to work brimming with ideas about how to tackle the root

## cause of homelessness — multigenerational poverty — rather than

simply providing temporary housing. Armed with a new outlook and

coaching skills, she redesigned COTS’s approach to family support, case management, individual mentoring, and self-suﬃciency training. The

new program design has since been adopted by dozens of nonproﬁts

# across the country.

## Making Sabbaticals Equitable and Successful

Is your organization ready to start reaping the beneﬁts of employee

sabbaticals? Although there is no single playbook for designing a

program, my research has found that all successful and equitable

sabbatical programs rest on three pillars: eligibility, support, and

# disconnection.

Eligibility. Many employers make the mistake of oﬀering sabbaticals

only to people at certain levels — usually management. Adopting

a managers-only approach exacerbates organizational hierarchy,

provokes resentment, and limits beneﬁts such as increased innovation

and reduced burnout to a select few. Don’t fall into that trap — make

your program more widely accessible. Some companies, such as Adobe

and Autodesk, allow employees to bypass their managers — requesting

permission for a sabbatical is as simple as checking a box in an HR tool.

Practices like these send the message that everyone who has devoted

## signiﬁcant time to the company, not just the executive class, deserves

time to recover and explore interests outside of work — and that they

don’t have to jump through hoops to do so.

Another way to expand eligibility is by oﬀering new hires a chunk

of paid time oﬀ before starting: a “pre-battical.” Typically, only the

wealthiest among us are able to take unpaid leave, and they often do

so between jobs. However, tech hospitality company SevenRooms began

oﬀering two weeks oﬀ with pay to new hires after it noticed higher rates

## of burnout among job switchers during the Great Resignation of 2021.

The idea is to ensure that people leave behind old stress and exhaustion

and enter their new role with excitement and sustainable energy, not

just the short-term adrenaline boost that comes from starting any new

# job.

Support. An organization oﬀering sabbaticals should provide support

# on two fronts: ﬁnances and beneﬁts.

The best possible scenario is giving employees full pay and beneﬁts

during their time oﬀ. That’s what McDonald’s, widely considered to

be the ﬁrst U.S. company to provide a paid sabbatical to its salaried

employees, has done since 1977. If that’s not feasible, partial pay — or

even a stipend — can give leave-takers enough cushion, especially if

they have suﬃcient time to plan and save. Or companies could oﬀer

full pay for a shorter period of time — say three months — and allow

employees to use unpaid leave or accrued vacation days for the rest.

Obviously, the less ﬁnancial help you oﬀer, the more likely it is that only

privileged employees will be able to take advantage of the policy.

In countries where healthcare is linked to employment, such as

the United States, retaining insurance for your employees is also

nonnegotiable. Although it’s possible for people to buy supplemental

policies for work breaks, having to navigate that system even once can

trigger enough stress to reduce the positive beneﬁts of time oﬀ.

To diﬀerentiate themselves from competitors, companies might also

consider oﬀering coaching to sabbatical-takers. A trained, independent

third party can help them ﬁgure out the details of transferring

work responsibilities and putting the learnings from their time oﬀ

into practice upon return. For example, McKinsey oﬀers coaching to

employees during breaks, and HubSpot gives bonuses that employees

may spend on any kind of career development.

Disconnection. The ﬁnal pillar for a successful sabbatical program is

perhaps the most important: ensuring that those who take time oﬀ

do so for long enough and truly disconnect. You’ll need to establish

a minimum time-oﬀ policy and actually prevent them from working.

This is because habituated patterns can lead to what I call “functional

workaholism,” which requires time and space to recover from.

Most of the people I interviewed said it took them six to eight weeks to

fully disengage from their professional identities and become open to

new experiences and thinking. That’s why three months is the baseline

length for a proper sabbatical, and my team’s survey results indicate it

# also the most common.

Managers should ensure that leave-takers have no access to email or

other work communications during their time away. Best practice is to have them set clear out-of-oﬃce messages, auto-delete their emails, and

designate one colleague they can contact or who can contact them only

if absolutely necessary. For example, ﬁnancial services ﬁrm Brighton

Jones requires employees who take advantage of its paid sabbatical

program to fully transfer responsibilities, uninstall its email program,

and provide only an emergency phone number.

Another way to help people disconnect is to give them ample time

to prepare for leaving. I suggest 18 months to sort out ﬁnances and

personal matters, delegate professional responsibilities, and plan the

time oﬀ. You’ll also need to give them enough runway to readjust to

work before they launch back into mission-critical business.

. . .

We’ve all seen companies try to engender loyalty by piling on perks

like Ping-Pong tables and free snacks. Oﬀering sabbaticals would be far

more meaningful: They generate goodwill, boost employee engagement,

and improve team and organizational performance. That’s because the

gift of time is a rare and valuable one.

Although extended-leave policies are more of an exception than the

norm, organizations would be wise to accelerate their adoption. Doing

so would help people fulﬁll their personal dreams and aspirations,

build in recovery time, and live their lives without regret — all while

retaining the many psychological, social, and ﬁnancial beneﬁts that

work provides. And that’s a win-win for employees and employers.
