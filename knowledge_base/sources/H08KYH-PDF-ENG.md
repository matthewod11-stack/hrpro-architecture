In today’s fast-paced world, the pressure to do more, achieve more,

and be more in less time has become a pervasive part of modern

life — and it’s wearing employees out. The authors of one study

on professional service ﬁrms found that the majority of respondents

described their jobs as “highly demanding, exhausting, and chaotic,”

and also took it for granted “that working long hours was necessary

for their professional success.” Their conclusions echo the results of

another recent global workforce survey based on more than 56,000

employees, where 45% said their workload had signiﬁcantly increased

over the past 12 months and more than half felt there was too much

change at their workplace happening too quickly.

This relentless urgency can result in a phenomenon known as “hurry

sickness,” a term ﬁrst introduced in 1974 by cardiologists Meyer

Friedman and R.H. Rosenman to describe the damaging eﬀects of

Type A (i.e., high-achieving) behavior on cardiovascular health. Hurry

sickness isn’t a diagnosable condition, but it encapsulates a set of

behaviors and emotions — impatience, chronic rushing, and a constant

sense of time scarcity — that can wreak havoc on a person’s physical

# and mental well-being.

While the onus should be on employers to address many of the root

causes of hurry sickness — hustle culture, incentives to overwork,

and constant organizational change, for example — there are steps

you can take to mitigate it even in non-ideal circumstances. Here,

we’ll explore the profound consequences of hurry sickness and outline

several strategies to reclaim your time and peace of mind.

# Why Hurry Sickness Is Dangerous

The anxiety and chronic stress that come from a frantic, always-on

lifestyle and the belief that you’re chronically short on time can result

in high blood pressure, headaches, and insomnia. High blood pressure

and symptoms of anxiety and depression (commonly referred to as

psychological distress) are known risk factors for cardiovascular disease

and even death. A large meta study found that psychological distress

alone increased risk of mortality from any cause — and the higher the

psychological distress, the higher the risk of death, even after adjusting

## for factors such as age, body mass index, smoking, physical activity, and

# alcohol consumption.

Hurry sickness can also leave you physically and mentally exhausted

as you rush from task to task and don’t allow time for basic self-care

such as regular, healthy meals, adequate sleep, and taking breaks.

Increasingly fatigued, your immune system can become suppressed,

leading to greater susceptibility to infectious illness.

At work, hurry sickness can lead to poor decision-making as well

as suboptimal outcomes when you don’t take time to think things

through, or when rushing results in careless errors. Deep in the throes

of hurry sickness, you experience a decreased ability to absorb, process,

and use new information, and your ability to innovate can suﬀer as

well, as creativity usually can’t be hurried. Relationships can suﬀer

because you’re easily irritated when others don’t keep up with your

intense pace, or because you’re openly skeptical of their ability to get things done eﬃciently. When relationships falter, team dynamics suﬀer

— as does team output, as eﬀective collaboration is compromised.

When chronic workplace stress leads to exhaustion, negativity, and

underperformance, the ﬁnal outcome of hurry sickness can be full-

blown burnout.

# Identifying Hurry Sickness

One of the things that makes hurry sickness diﬃcult to detect is its ability to come disguised as eﬃciency, productivity, achievement, or

creating value for the organization. As each of these are prized qualities

and signs of high performance, you may not even realize something is

wrong until your constant hurrying exacts a price.

See if any of these signs and symptoms of hurry sickness are present in

# your own experience at work:

- Everything feels urgent. You frequently feel restless, anxious, or

worried because everything feels like it must be attended to at once

and ﬁnished as quickly as possible.

- You’re always in a rush. You walk, talk, carry out tasks, and even

drive at a rapid pace. You tend to interrupt others or hurry them along

and constantly multitask in an attempt to ﬁnish more things more

# quickly.

- You’re preoccupied with the passage of time. It feels as though time

is always slipping away from you, you feel compelled to “beat the

clock,” and you’re always on the lookout for shortcuts and timesavers.

- You always feel behind schedule. Despite your eﬀorts, you

frequently worry about falling behind — even when deadlines aren’t

imminent or others consider you highly productive and ahead of

# schedule.

- You’re low on patience and easily irritated. Even minor delays can

trigger stress and frustration, and you can lose your temper when

something (or someone) comes between you and completing a task.

- You deprioritize your own well-being in favor of eﬃciency and

productivity. Getting things done is always on your mind and takes

precedence over everything else. You sacriﬁce sleep, meals, exercise,

time with loved ones, time away from work, or hobbies in favor of

accomplishing things — and the quicker, the better.

- You’re uncomfortable with downtime and rarely take time to rest.

You consider slowing down or taking a break a waste of time. Being

unoccupied can make you anxious, irritable, impatient, or ﬁdgety.

- You get pleasure from getting things done. Pleasurable experiences

trigger the release of dopamine, the neurotransmitter known

colloquially as the feel-good hormone. It’s dopamine that delivers a

## reward in the form of potent feelings of pleasure and satisfaction —

and that motivates us to repeat a pleasurable action to experience the reward again. For those who love productivity and eﬃciency, there

may be no greater reward than getting things done.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Insidious Effects of Hurrying

In most professional environments today, the onus is on the individual to carve out and preserve their own boundaries. This is already diﬃcult

in work cultures that prize rapid results and overwork, but as Drs.

Meyer and Rosenman point out, certain personality traits can increase

one’s susceptibility to hurry sickness. In addition to the Type A

behavior pattern, perfectionists, people pleasers, and those who equate

productivity with self-worth can be at higher risk. Perfectionists often

spend inordinate time on tasks in an attempt to achieve an unrealistic

ideal, which steals time from other necessary tasks and leaves them

quite literally hurrying to catch up. People pleasers run the risk of

saying yes to every request, leaving them overwhelmed, rushed, and in

danger of falling behind. And many achievement-oriented individuals

locate their self-worth in how much they can produce, and how quickly.

# How to Overcome Hurry Sickness

Though the costs of hurry sickness can be dire, the remedies are

readily available. Try these tips and tactics to begin slowing down and

regaining your health — without compromising performance:

Implement forcing functions.

A forcing function is any mechanism or activity that by design compels

a particular result or behavior. With hurry sickness, the goal is to

decrease your sense of time scarcity and high urgency. Eﬀective forcing

functions might include blocking oﬀ buﬀer time on your calendar to

deal with unexpected tasks; reserving time for deep, undistracted work

with no particular end goal; and scheduling time to reﬂect on and

reprioritize your to-do list so you’re not approaching everything with

# the same sense of urgency.

Pause before saying yes.

Not only do you need to examine your calendar to see if you actually

can accept a request, you need to reﬂect to see if you should. Are you

the only person who can fulﬁll it? Will it demand too much of your time,

energy, or resources? Does it support your own goals and reﬂect your values? Once hurry sickness has become a lifestyle it will be diﬃcult to

slow down before saying yes, so you may need to enlist the help of an

objective advisor whose feedback you trust. You can also use the next

# tactic.

Write down the consequences of saying yes.

Pausing to write down what will happen if you say yes to an incoming

request is a natural forcing function that compels you to slow down and

prevents you from saying yes automatically. I prefer doing this exercise

in longhand for the deeper thoughtfulness the extra time allows. Is the

amount of stress associated with this task tolerable? Will the request

take too much time away from activities outside of work or simply

recharging? Seeing the consequences literally spelled out before you not

only slows you down, it can be a great wake-up call.

Write down the beneﬁts of slowing down.

For extra accountability and inspiration, try the ﬂip side: Make a list

of all the positives you can enjoy if you slow down even a little. For

many, it’s extra sleep, more time for relationships, and a greater sense of

# relaxation and peace.

Use a tool to help you prioritize.

Hurry sickness can mask what is truly high priority by leading you to

believe that everything is, so bring some objectivity to your to-do list.

Many of my coaching clients like the tried-and-true 4D method. Assign

each of your tasks to one of four categories: Do tasks are essential and

high-priority; Defer (or Delay) tasks can be done a little later; Delegate

tasks can be handed oﬀ to someone else; and Delete tasks are the ones

## that, upon further examination, actually aren’t essential. Bonus tip:

Don’t add another to-do to your list before crossing one oﬀ.

Prioritize grace over accomplishment.

One of my executive coaching clients is a self-described dopamine

addict who relishes the feeling of her brain’s reward system getting

a high-ﬁve as she checks things oﬀ her to-do list. When she doesn’t

accomplish goals as rapidly as she would like, she feels frustrated and

irritable and is hard on herself for not meeting her own expectations.

Fortunately, she’s ﬁnding relief from the self-induced stress by learning

to extend grace to herself, a powerful form of self-compassion that

allows us to direct our energy in a healthier, more productive way. In

her case, she lets herself oﬀ the hook by making an inventory of all the

things she did get done, and counteracts negative self-talk by running it

through the “friend test”: Is this anything she would say to a friend? If

not, she lets it go and moves on.

# Practice mindfulness.

Mindfulness is nothing more than slowing down to give your full, non-

## judgmental attention to the present moment — in many ways, the very

antithesis of hurry sickness. Even practicing mindfulness for a few

minutes at a time — such as through deep breathing, a simple body

scan, bringing your full attention to a routine physical task such as

brewing a cup of tea, or spending a few moments listening to calming

music — can quickly lower stress and give your over-taxed mind a

needed break. Practiced over time, mindfulness can decrease your

ﬁxation on rushing to get things done and is a key ingredient in a

healthy, focused, and balanced life.

# Seek support.

If the root causes of your hurry sickness run deep or if you simply ﬁnd it too diﬃcult to manage your time urgency on your own, seeking help

## from a therapist, executive coach, employee resource group, or support

group can be an essential part of a long-term cure. Accountability

partners can also help you keep up with daily habits that bring a much-

needed dose of slowness to your life.

. . .

As the demands of work and personal life blur in an era of

hyperconnectivity and hustle culture, hurry sickness is more insidious

than ever, quietly sabotaging productivity, relationships, and health. If

you ﬁnd yourself with an urgent need to slow down, your health, your

teams, the people you serve through your work, and your loved ones

will thank you for taking steps to free yourself from hurry sickness.

Remember, it’s not about how fast you go; it’s about how well you use

the time you have.
