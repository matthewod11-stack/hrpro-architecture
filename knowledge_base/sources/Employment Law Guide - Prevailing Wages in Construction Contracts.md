Who is Covered

# Updated: May 2024

# The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) generally apply to contractors performing on federal and federally

# assisted contracts in excess of $2,000 for construction, alteration, or repair (including painting and

decorating). Laborers and mechanics who work on the site of the work of DBRA-covered contracts are entitled to receive prevailing wage rates for such work.

The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) require that contractors performing on covered contracts pay

laborers and mechanics employed on the project jobsite not less than the prevailing wage rates (including fringe beneﬁts) listed in the contract's Davis-Bacon wage determination for corresponding classes of laborers

and mechanics. The rates listed are based on wages and fringe beneﬁts the Wage and Hour Division (WHD)

found to be prevailing for laborers and mechanics employed on similar projects in the area. Davis-Bacon labor

standards clauses and the applicable wage determination(s) must be included in covered contracts.

Apprentices may be employed at less than the prevailing wage rates if they are individually registered in and employed pursuant to an apprenticeship program registered with the Department of Labor or with a state

apprenticeship agency recognized by the Department.

Contractors on DBRA projects are required to pay laborers and mechanics weekly and to submit weekly

certiﬁed payroll records to the contracting agency. DBRA contractors are also subject to rules concerning

# allowable payroll deductions.

Contractors and subcontractors on prime contracts covered under the DBA or Related Acts in excess of

$100,000, or $150,000 for prime contracts covered under the DBA that are subject to the Federal Acquisition

Regulations, are also required, pursuant to the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA), to

pay laborers and mechanics, including guards and watchpersons, no less than one and one-half times their

basic rates of pay for all hours over 40 worked on a covered contract in a workweek.

# Worker Rights

The Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) provide laborers and mechanics on covered contracts the right to

receive at least the locally prevailing wages (including fringe beneﬁts), as determined by the Department of

Labor, for the type of work performed. The Wage and Hour Division and contracting agencies accept complaints of alleged DBRA violations.

It is prohibited to retaliate against workers or job applicants for engaging in protected activities such as

making a complaint or cooperating in a WHD investigation under the DBRA.

Every contractor performing work covered by the Davis-Bacon labor standards must post the WH-1321 "Worker Rights Under the Davis-Bacon Act" poster at the site of the work in a prominent and accessible place

where it may be easily seen by workers. The applicable DBRA wage determination, including any conformed

classiﬁcations, must be similarly posted.

Under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA), contractors must maintain records for all laborers and

mechanics during the course of the work and preserve the required records for a period of three years after all

the work on the prime contract is completed. Required records must include the following information for each

covered worker:

Name, address, telephone number, email address, and social security number; Correct classiﬁcation(s) of work actually performed;

Hourly rates of wages paid, including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona ﬁde fringe beneﬁts

# or their cash equivalents;

Daily and weekly numbers of hours actually worked in total and on each covered contract;

Deductions made; Actual wages paid;

Detailed information regarding bona ﬁde fringe beneﬁt plans and programs, including records that show

that the plan or program has been communicated in writing to the laborers and mechanics aﬀected; and

If applicable, detailed information regarding approved apprenticeship programs.

Some of the records required to be kept under the DBRA are also required under the Fair Labor Standards Act. See Wage and Hour Division Fact sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements under the Fair Labor

# Standards Act (FLSA).

# Reporting

# Weekly Certiﬁed Payrolls

Each contractor must submit weekly to the contracting agency or entity certiﬁed payrolls providing the

following information for each covered worker for the preceding weekly payroll period:

Name and an individually identifying number for each worker (e.g., last four digits of worker's social security

# number);

Correct classiﬁcation(s) of work actually performed; Hourly rates of wages paid, including rates of contributions or costs anticipated for bona ﬁde fringe beneﬁts

# or their cash equivalents;

Daily and weekly number of hours actually worked in total and on each covered contract;

Deductions made; and

# Actual wages paid.

Each certiﬁed payroll submitted must be accompanied by a "Statement of Compliance" using either page 2 of

Form WH-347 Payroll (For Contractors Optional Use), or any form with identical wording, certifying compliance with applicable requirements. The statements must be signed by the contractor, or by an

authorized oﬃcer or employee of the contractor who supervises the payment of wages. The certiﬁed payrolls

must be submitted to the contracting agency or other designated entity. These certiﬁed payrolls must be

submitted within seven days after the regular payment date for the payroll period. The certiﬁed payrolls may

be submitted by any method permitted by the contracting agency, but must be signed with an original handwritten signature or, if required or permitted, a legally valid electronic signature.

From time to time, WHD may ask contractors to submit, via survey, wage data from construction projects on

which they have employed laborers and mechanics for use by WHD in determining the locally prevailing wage

rates that will apply to Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA)-covered projects in the future. The submission

of wage data is encouraged, but voluntary. When new surveys are conducted to enable WHD to determine the locally prevailing wages, contractors and others may use the WD-10 Form, Report of Construction

# Contractor's Wage Rates to respond.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Contractors found to have disregarded their obligations to workers or subcontractors may be debarred from receiving future contracts for three years. In addition, contract payments may be withheld in suﬃcient

amounts to satisfy liabilities of the contractor for unpaid wages and for liquidated damages that result from

overtime violations of the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA). Breach of the required

contract clauses under the Davis-Bacon and Related Acts (DBRA) and CWHSSA may also be grounds for

# termination of the contract.

Workers have rights of action and/or of intervention against the contractor and its sureties if the amounts

withheld are insuﬃcient to reimburse the unpaid wages. Under such an action, it is no defense that workers

accepted less than the required rate of wages or voluntarily returned wage payments to the contractor.

Contractors may challenge the Wage and Hour Division's determinations of violations and debarment before

an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). Contractors may appeal ALJ decisions and orders to the Department's Administrative Review Board (ARB). ARB determinations on violations may be appealed to and are

# enforceable through the federal courts.

Falsiﬁcation of the required certiﬁed payrolls or any kickback of wages may subject a contractor to civil or

criminal prosecution, the penalty for which may be ﬁnes and/or imprisonment.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

# Since 1931, Congress has extended the Davis-Bacon labor standards requirements to numerous other laws -

# "Related Acts" - that provide federal assistance for construction through loans, grants, loan guarantees,

insurance, and other methods. These laws require payment of the prevailing wages determined in accordance with the Davis-Bacon Act on federally assisted construction undertaken pursuant to the relevant law.

Examples of the Related Acts are the Federal-Aid Highway Acts, the Housing and Community Development

Act of 1974 (and various other laws administered by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development

## (HUD)), and the Federal Water Pollution Control Act.

The Copeland "Anti-Kickback" Act prohibits contractors from inducing any person employed in DBRA- covered construction to give up any part of the compensation to which they are entitled, and requires

contractors to submit a weekly statement of the wages paid to each worker performing DBRA-covered work.

Implementing regulations govern allowable payroll deductions.

Contractors on projects subject to Davis-Bacon labor standards may also be subject to overtime pay

requirements under the Contract Work Hours and Safety Standards Act (CWHSSA) and the Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA).

In addition to these federal labor standards, state and local prevailing wage and overtime pay requirements

may apply.

# Compliance Assistance Available
