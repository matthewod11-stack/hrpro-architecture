In lean manufacturing, the goal is to establish precise procedures

for making products in the safest, easiest, and most eﬃcient manner

possible. When critical processes become standard work, variation

decreases, throughput increases, costs fall, and quality rises. Companies

as diverse as Toyota, Amazon, Intel, and Nike leverage this approach in their operations to great eﬀect.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Lean Strategy Making

In contrast, strategic decision-making is the epitome of nonstandard

work at most companies. Strategic decisions are often thought to be

unique—like snowﬂakes—with each one requiring a bespoke process.

Consequently, similar decisions—for instance, about whether to enter new markets—are frequently handled in vastly diﬀerent ways within

the same company. That inconsistency leads to slower, lower-quality

decisions—a problem that’s starkly clear in the feedback Bain &

Company received from the executives at 350 large companies we

surveyed about their strategy processes. We discovered that:

- Though nearly 50% of the survey respondents reported that their

companies used standard templates for developing strategic plans,

very few ﬁrms followed a consistent approach to making critical

decisions. In most cases the process was left to the discretion of the

executive in charge or varied with the type of decision.

- One quarter of the strategic decisions made by companies proved to

be suboptimal in hindsight, according to the executives. Leadership

frequently chose a course of action that was either incorrect or inferior

to other options. Many of those decisions were costly or impossible to

reverse, forcing companies to live with the consequences for years.

- Decision-making at the respondents’ companies was also too slow

more than 45% of the time. As a result, even when the right choice was eventually made, performance often suﬀered because market and

competitive conditions had shifted during the delay.

- On average, the respondents’ companies achieved less than 70% of

the results their strategies aimed for. That shortfall was often blamed

on poor execution, with the assumption that the strategy itself was

## sound. However, in many cases the strategic decisions themselves

were unclear, leading to uncoordinated—or even conﬂicting—actions

that produced mediocre outcomes. In other cases leaders believed

they had made a decision when they really had only articulated a

desired outcome without deﬁning the actions needed to achieve it.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Lean Strategy Making

Performance fell short because there was nothing concrete for the

organization to execute.

If a manufacturing process had a 25% defect rate, exceeded targeted

cycle times more than 45% of the time, and experienced a yield loss of

more than 30%, it would be deemed unacceptable. Yet many companies tolerate those levels of ineﬃciency and ineﬀectiveness in their strategy

# making.

It’s time to redesign the strategy process to achieve better results.

There’s no reason that strategic decision-making can’t become standard

work, just as critical manufacturing processes are. By adopting a

rigorous approach to it, companies can reduce waste, move faster, make

smarter choices, and gain a competitive edge.

Several leading companies that we have worked with and studied oﬀer a blueprint for standardization that others can follow. Their

lean approach to strategy typically has three components: (1) setting

strategic priorities, (2) tackling them in an ongoing fashion, and (3)

monitoring the results. In this article we’ll go into detail about what

each component involves and describe how successful companies

## incorporate all three into their strategy process.

# Setting the Priorities

Lean strategy begins with articulating (or revising) a company’s

multiyear performance ambition, which typically includes both

## ﬁnancial objectives, such as revenue and operating proﬁt goals, and

## strategic goals, such as relative market-share growth and improvements

# in customer satisfaction.

A performance ambition is not a typical target—meaning one that

senior leadership believes it can meet or exceed. Targets often hinder

eﬀective strategy development. They can become politicized; business

units may understate their potential so that they can secure lower

targets, while the corporate center pushes for higher ones, suspecting

that the units are sandbagging. Targets become a negotiated settlement, not an eﬀective guide for strategy making.

In contrast, a performance ambition is aspirational. It’s designed to

motivate business and functional leaders to surface breakthrough ideas

that can signiﬁcantly enhance a company’s performance. The ambition

should be realistic yet beyond the reach of the current strategy.

Google’s 10x thinking is a notable example. Introduced over a decade

ago by Google’s cofounders, Larry Page and Sergey Brin, it encourages

leaders to aim for solutions that are 10 times better than existing ones.

That mindset has become a core principle of Google’s strategy and is

deeply embedded in the company’s culture.

The 10x approach has fueled remarkable innovations at Google. When Gmail launched, for example, it oﬀered users 100 times more

storage than competing services did. Google Street View photographed

more than 10 million miles of road, adding unique value to search

results. Google X, the company’s experimental R&D unit, took on the

development of self-driving cars, leading to the creation of Waymo,

which now operates a ﬂeet of autonomous vehicles serving passengers

## in Phoenix, San Francisco, Los Angeles, and Austin.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Lean Strategy Making

Todd McLellan’s photo series from the book Things Come Apart features objects that have been deconstructed and rearranged to examine how their component parts work together.

The next step is to compare the performance ambition against a

multiyear outlook (MYO), which projects what a company’s future

performance will be, given the decisions and resource commitments its

leadership has already made. Critically, the MYO does not account for

decisions that haven’t been made yet, even if they’re likely to be made in

# the future.

It’s also important to note that the MYO is not a plan. It doesn’t include

assumptions about productivity gains, favorable pricing changes,

improved asset management, or other factors often incorporated into

ﬁnancial plans or forecasts. Instead, the MYO is designed to capture

## the likely strategic and ﬁnancial trajectory of each business if current

strategies remain unchanged. It should also recognize that competitors

are continually working to better their competitive positions. As a result

the MYO often depicts a deteriorating competitive position that must be

strengthened.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Lean Strategy Making

There should be a sizable gap between the ambition and the MYO. If

they’re too close, the ambition isn’t enough of a stretch and should

be revised upward. The gap will be closed by addressing issues on

what we call the strategic backlog—a document that captures the

company’s highest-priority strategic, operational, organizational, and

ﬁnancial challenges. Those issues should be prioritized using two criteria: value at stake, or the economic impact of eﬀectively resolving

the issue; and urgency or critical path—whether the issue must be

tackled immediately to avoid missing a crucial opportunity or to help

address other important problems. The backlog should guide decision-

making throughout the current year and beyond. Typically, companies

have multiple backlogs: one for senior leadership, encompassing

cross-enterprise issues, and separate backlogs for the business units,

addressing their speciﬁc challenges.

The issues on the backlog need to be described in careful detail to

ensure their proper framing. As we all know, it’s hard to ﬁnd the

right answer if the wrong question is being asked. Yet many leaders

deﬁne strategic priorities in ways that limit the ﬁeld of vision (for

example, by asking, “Should we acquire Company X in order to enter

Market Y?” rather than “How should we increase our penetration of

Market Y?”), unduly constraining their options. Or leaders widen the aperture too much, making the issue impossible to address eﬀectively

(as with “How should we adapt our strategy to best respond to global

climate change?”). In either case cogent plans are never developed, and

problems go unresolved for years.

Each item on the backlog should be tied to one or more decisions

that must be made to address it. For an example, let’s look at Dell

Technologies, the infrastructure technology giant. In 2015 its leadership

determined that to achieve breakthrough performance, it needed to

fundamentally redesign the company’s go-to-market model. To carry

out the redesign the company would have to decide the following:

- the optimal number of products for Dell’s sales team to represent

- how sales territories should be deﬁned to maximize productivity

- what coverage model best ensured the appropriate level of customer

# contact

- the best way to provide product-speciﬁc technical support to

# salespeople

After carefully reviewing the best available data and weighing the options, Dell’s leadership made each of those decisions, eﬀectively

resolving the go-to-market redesign issue. The company hired more

than 2,000 additional sales representatives to expand coverage, redrew

territories to better align reps with technical support, and reduced the

number of products most reps were asked to sell. Those and other

changes helped Dell gain market share in commercial PCs, servers, and

# storage.

Business is a game of choices, and good choices start with strong alternatives. But most companies fail to consistently explore multiple options when making strategic decisions.

The ﬁnal step is to create (or update) a decision calendar, which

outlines when each item on the strategic backlog will be addressed and

notes the leadership team member accountable for recommending the

best course of action (after getting the input of experts and others).

Typically, the calendar is aligned with the schedule for executive

## committee meetings, business unit leadership team meetings, and other

leadership forums, where time is set aside to focus on decisions in

the backlog. Done correctly, the calendar establishes a steady cadence

or “drumbeat” of decision-making, ensuring that the gap between

leadership’s performance ambition and the company’s MYO gets closed

# at an eﬃcient pace.

Once the strategic backlog is deﬁned and the decision calendar is set,

lean strategy making becomes a continuous process. As each issue on

the backlog is resolved, it’s removed and replaced with a new one.

# Ongoing Strategic Management

With every issue on the backlog, leadership follows a standard decision-

making process that guides resource allocation. It entails two distinct

# strategy sessions:

Facts and alternatives. During this session, leadership works to fully

understand the issue, identify its causes, and come up with a range of

ways to address them. The goal of this meeting is not to select the best

alternative but to engage in an expansive dialogue that will help the

team develop a comprehensive set of viable options.

In these discussions it’s important to examine the critical facts. Most strategy development eﬀorts include a phase in which facts

are collected to assess market trends, customer purchasing criteria,

competitor performance, and the proﬁtability of the company’s

products and services in each segment. While that information

is valuable, it often fails to reveal the underlying causes of

underperformance and deﬁciencies in the company’s strategic position.

For example, if leaders seek to accelerate growth in a market segment,

they must ﬁrst understand the primary impediments to growth.

Otherwise the company risks treating symptoms—such as low returns

on ad and promotional spending—without ﬁxing the cause, such as a

cumbersome product that’s diﬃcult to use and buy. Identifying the true

reasons for underperformance often requires gathering facts beyond

those typically collected in market or competitive scans or involves a

deeper analysis of existing facts.

Careful consideration of alternatives is equally important. Business is

a game of choices, and good choices start with strong alternatives.

Unfortunately, most companies fail to consistently explore multiple

options when making strategic decisions. Their approach often boils

down to “We’re doing this now; that seems better, so let’s do that.” While

such thinking may lead to incremental improvements, it frequently

causes companies to miss opportunities for breakthroughs.

Worse, the alternatives companies do consider may be false choices.

People often stack the deck by presenting leaders with three options:

one that implies doing next to nothing, one that’s akin to killing your

ﬁrstborn, and a third that’s the path they really want to pursue. Or

## they simply present “Goldilocks” choices—one too extreme, one too

weak, and one in the middle. Both practices undermine the quality of

# decision-making.

The most successful companies embed the

## formulation and evaluation of alternatives

into their strategy process. Strategies are

proposed only after a range of options have

been carefully considered. These

# companies also clearly deﬁne and in some

cases standardize the criteria for assessing

functional leaders to decide how to evaluate competing strategies and

make recommendations.

Choices and commitments. In this session leadership reviews

evaluations of the alternatives, uses agreed-upon criteria to select

the best one, deﬁnes performance milestones for it, and identiﬁes

the resources it will require. The outcome of this meeting is a

ﬁnal decision, which includes committing resources in exchange for

expected performance improvements.

It’s surprising how often strategy goes oﬀ the rails at this juncture.

Nearly 30 years ago, Michael Porter observed that “the essence of

strategy is choosing what not to do.” Yet in many companies, it’s diﬃcult

to determine precisely what leaders have decided to do—let alone what

they have chosen not to do. After a typical board strategy review, the

answers to key strategic questions often remain unclear or open to interpretation. Strategic decision-making falters when critical trade-oﬀs

aren’t assessed and concrete choices are left unmade.

In many companies strategy resembles an elaborate description of a

desired end state, without a clear path for getting there. Such ﬁrms

rarely deﬁne what actions will be immediately stopped, continued, or

started. Without that clarity, however, execution becomes challenging.

Worse, strategies can face a silent veto in lower levels of the

organization, where employees may be skeptical of leadership’s vision.

In both cases, performance will fall short. A strategic plan needs to be

prescriptive and specify how to achieve the future it outlines.

The best companies follow up their strategy reviews by creating an

explicit decision log. It captures the choices made by leadership,

documenting the range of alternatives considered, the reasons certain

options were rejected, and the rationale behind the chosen path. This

eliminates ambiguity. Strategy is no longer subject to hallway debates or

passive resistance from those who claim not to understand the decision

or who wish to pursue their own alternatives.

Commitments also matter: Strategic decision-making must drive the

allocation of resources, including operating expenses, capital, and

talent, over several years. Otherwise, the budgeting process will dictate

what gets funded and, by extension, shape the company’s strategy.

The best companies embed leadership’s strategic choices in a written,

two-way performance contract, where the corporate center provides

## essential resources in exchange for improved performance from

business units and functions. Such contracts formalize the strategy.

For over a decade, Dell has adhered to this standard two-session

formula when making decisions, regardless of their complexity. In his

book Play Nice but Win, Michael Dell encourages readers to “trust the

scientiﬁc method,” highlighting how his team applied it to calls about

everything from reestablishing Dell’s market leadership in servers;

## to the divestment of Quest Software, SonicWall, and other software

businesses; to renaming the company Dell Technologies following

its merger with EMC. Thanks to this approach, Dell’s leadership has

accelerated the pace of decision-making without sacriﬁcing quality,

resulting in a 10-fold return on the investment Michael Dell made in

the company when he took it private, in late 2013.

# Monitoring Business Performance

## In companies that practice lean strategy, the organization’s success at

meeting its performance commitments, as well as the allocation of

necessary resources by the center, is regularly assessed at business

performance reviews. When things are on track, leadership proceeds

as planned. However, when discrepancies arise, the discussion shifts

to whether corrective actions are needed. In extreme cases—such as

when market or competitive conditions have changed signiﬁcantly—

leadership may decide to return an issue to the strategic backlog.

That allows the team to gather new facts, explore new alternatives, potentially make a diﬀerent choice, and establish new commitments

# and performance contracts.

This is signiﬁcantly diﬀerent from what companies typically do in

business performance reviews. Most reviews resemble weather reports,

with the business unit and functional leaders comparing actual

performance against the budget or operating plan. While they often

highlight variances, the common response is to tweak the plan or

task leaders with quickly addressing discrepancies. However, the true

purpose of these reviews should be to determine whether the company

needs to alter its strategic direction. It’s not enough to merely note that

sales fell short of the plan. Leaders must probe deeper into the reasons

behind such misses and determine whether corrective measures are

needed.

Few strategies, no matter how well crafted, can be executed without

adjustments over time. Market conditions and competitor strategies

are always changing, often requiring companies to revise or ﬁne-tune

their strategies. Business performance reviews are the ideal forum for

assessing whether such shifts are needed. Leadership should ask, Have

the facts changed enough to suggest a better strategic alternative? If

the answer is yes, the issue needs to be revisited. If the answer is no, leadership may still choose to intensify eﬀorts in certain areas while

scaling back others to realign performance with the company’s goals.

Amgen, a $33 billion biotech pioneer, has successfully implemented

this type of rigorous performance monitoring. At its monthly operating

team meetings, which are attended by its top 30 executives, time is set

aside for “performance dialogues,” which examine whether the team is

executing on the commitments made against the company’s strategic

# backlog.

Amgen has also developed Sensing, a metric-monitoring platform that

tracks performance using both leading and lagging indicators. For

instance, “new prescriptions written” serves as a leading indicator

of pharmaceutical revenue, while “patient enrollment rates” predict

trial speed, helping assess whether a drug is on track to meet its

# development timelines.

Before every performance dialogue, operating-team members review

## key metrics for each of Amgen’s therapeutics, geographies, and

functions. If a business area is underperforming, the executive who

owns it presents the variance, identiﬁes its cause, and proposes a

solution to close the gap. If the gap stems from a fundamental market

change or regulatory shift, the responsible executive may suggest

adding a new issue to Amgen’s prioritized agenda so that the team can

reassess the company’s position, develop new alternatives, and revise

its strategy as needed.

Amgen’s performance dialogues also highlight successes. Each session

dedicates time to exploring the causes of overperformance. For

example, after observing higher-than-expected trial enrollment for a

## medicine in development, the team identiﬁed successful practices, such

as increased engagement with investigators, that boosted awareness

and enthusiasm about the therapeutic’s beneﬁts and people’s eagerness

to enroll eligible patients.

By standardizing the performance dialogue process, Amgen has

strengthened its performance culture, improving execution and

ﬁnancial results. In 2013 it had three blockbuster drugs (meaning drugs

with annual sales of more than $1 billion); by 2025 it had 14, and during

those 12 years it saw its market value grow more than threefold, from

## less than $50 billion to more than $160 billion.

. . .

For too long leaders have treated strategy as nonstandard work,

resulting in decisions that are often incorrect or poorly timed. To

address this, they need to adopt a systematic approach to strategy,

clearly deﬁning priorities, gathering facts that reveal the causes of

problems, developing strong options to choose from, making choices

explicit, creating a speciﬁc plan for implementation, and tracking

execution. If every unit and function follows the same approach,

leadership can conﬁdently delegate decision-making to lower levels

in the organization, and the ﬁrm can improve the quality of all its
