Returning to work after giving birth is one of the most challenging

transitions for postpartum mothers. With a lack of access to paid federal

leave within the United States, more than 25% of mothers return to work

within two months of giving birth and approximately 10% return to

work in four weeks or less. This means that in addition to their physical

recovery and the psychological adjustment to motherhood, postpartum

mothers are also navigating new shifts in identity as a working mother

— a uniquely challenging period that author Lauren Smith Brody refers

## to as “the ﬁfth trimester.” In her Washington Post column, Amy Joyce

described this experience as women “returning to jobs when their

bodies (and hearts) might be wanting them to do otherwise: They suﬀer

from painful breasts, leaking milk, the stress of trying to balance a job

with new family demands, plus a stigma that a mother can’t excel at

work.”

Considering the diﬃculties that surround the reentry period, there is

## no shortage of articles, blog posts, books, and online discussions that

provide advice for how mothers can cope with postpartum reentry.

Yet, more often than not, these recommendations place the burden

on postpartum mothers to ﬁgure out ways to ease the transition (e.g.,

ﬁnding reliable childcare, creating solid routines for the baby’s feedings

and sleep, communicating with colleagues to stay informed during

leave). While well-intended, there has been growing recognition that

postpartum mothers should not be expected to shoulder the challenges

of reentry on their own, and that colleagues and managers can play a

critical role in supporting mothers’ return to work.

In our research, we wanted to understand the speciﬁc types of support

and advocacy that postpartum mothers actually value — that is, the

behaviors that managers and colleagues can engage in to be eﬀective

postpartum allies. We conducted three studies using a variety of

methods to identify postpartum allyship behaviors that mothers value

during the reentry period, examine the impact of these behaviors on

mothers’ well-being and work outcomes, and understand how and why

these postpartum allyship behaviors are critical during the reentry

# process.

## What Postpartum Allyship Behaviors are Valuable to Mothers?

Through interviews with 45 working mothers who had returned to work

## postpartum within the past ﬁve years, as well as survey validation work

with over 500 working mothers, all of whom were residing and working

within the United States, we found four distinct types of allyship

behaviors most valued during the reentry period:

Co-navigating the HR infrastructure.

This involves helping a postpartum mother beneﬁt from, or avoid being

penalized by, HR policies. Examples include identifying policies that

are relevant to parental leave and the reentry process, ﬁnding ways to

extend parental leave time, and helping the mother advocate for her

# needs.

Creating physical and temporal spaces for motherhood.

This enables a postpartum mother to have the place and time to engage

in motherhood-related responsibilities. For example, encouraging

ﬂexible work hours, providing access to lactation spaces that are high-

quality (e.g., with refrigerators for storing milk, a sink for cleaning

pumping equipment, and comfortable seating), structuring breaks that

allow for pumping, and encouraging work-family boundaries.

Validating the worker identity. This aﬃrms the mother’s professional identity and signals that her

contributions are valued. For example, celebrating a postpartum

mother’s return to work, assigning developmental (and promotable)

tasks and opportunities, and expressing conﬁdence in the person’s skills

# and capabilities as a worker.

Validating the mother identity. This aﬃrms the postpartum mother’s maternal identity. For example,

asking to see photos and videos of the baby, checking in on the

mother’s well-being and compassionately listening to her experiences,

and describing one’s own parenting-related challenges.

Each of these four types of allyship were reported as important and

impactful. However, eﬀectively utilizing them is not as straightforward

as simply engaging in these four types of behaviors with every

postpartum mother returning to work. Why? No two postpartum

experiences are the same. As such, each mother needs to be treated

as the expert on what she needs, with allies empowering them to be

transparent and honest about the challenges being faced. As one of

our interviewees, Heather (pseudonyms have been assigned to maintain

the anonymity of participants), noted, “Everything related to childbirth

and rearing is unpredictable and ﬂuid and unique. So, you can’t say,

‘Everybody’s going to do it this way.’ You have to have some ﬂexibility …

This is a highly emotional time and needs evolve. You’d need to feel like

it’s open to communicate and share.” Thus, being an eﬀective ally also

means asking the postpartum mother about her unique challenges and

experiences, and then adapting allyship strategies to her speciﬁc needs.

## Why Are These Postpartum Allyship Behaviors Valuable?

As postpartum mothers face the daunting challenge of portraying

themselves as “superwomen” who must simultaneously attend, and

## devote themselves, to the demands of their careers and their children

— a concern that is particularly salient during the reentry period —

postpartum allyship behaviors help mothers feel validated across both

identities. They do this in two key ways.

First, these behaviors helped increase mothers’ conﬁdence in their

ability to eﬀectively balance both work and motherhood — what we

termed as work-motherhood self-efficacy. Second, postpartum allyship

behaviors helped reduce mothers’ feelings of guilt that they were

falling short of expectations at work and/or at home. Kelly, another

interviewee, described what this “mom guilt” feels like: “it’s sending

her to daycare when people believe that you need to be home for your

baby, or if you’re home for your baby, like, why aren’t you working [and]

contributing to the family? Mom guilt is: no matter what you’re doing,

it’s wrong; you could be doing more.”

Postpartum allyship, however, can alleviate these harmful, negative

feelings. As Michelle, one of our other participants, explained, “It’s

really hard for me to say, ‘I want to continue to grow my career, but I

also don’t want my kids to miss out on things because of that’ … I feel

like when an employer can say, ‘You can … and we’re going to make

adjustments so that both of those things can live together,’ that is not

a policy. It’s not written down anywhere, but it’s a behavior that makes

you feel like both of your identities can live in one space.”

Our research bears this out. We conducted an additional study of 155

working mothers — employed across various industries — who were

in the process of reentering the workplace following the birth of their

child. Our ﬁndings underscored the importance of postpartum allyship

experiences; by boosting postpartum mothers’ work-motherhood self- eﬃcacy, allyship behaviors reduced women’s intentions to quit the

workforce. At the same time, by feeling more conﬁdent in being able

to balance work and motherhood, women were more likely to view

their working mother identity as a form of strength, allowing them to

also thrive in their maternal identity at home. Finally, through its joint eﬀects on self-eﬃcacy and reduced feelings of guilt, allyship behaviors

also helped reduce working mothers’ postpartum depressive symptoms.

Thus, the impact of taking the time to support and advocate for mothers

as they return to work postpartum is invaluable. Allyship behaviors

have profound eﬀects on how mothers feel about both their work and

maternal identities, ultimately impacting intentions to stay in the labor

force and the ability to see work as a positive inﬂuence for their family

lives. Further, with postpartum depression being the “most common

complication of childbirth,” the impact of postpartum allyship has the

potential to help women experience fewer symptoms — though, we of

course note that additional help is likely needed for women in the form

# of therapy and medical support.

# Who Can be Postpartum Allies?

Data from our interviewees also highlighted that anyone can be an

ally to postpartum mothers returning to work — managers, colleagues,

## those with or without children, as well as individuals of all gender

identities. For instance, while managers typically have the authority to

allow for ﬂexible reentry policies, encourage work-life boundaries, and

advocate for (or even create) lactation spaces, coworkers with children

can provide insights on navigating HR policies and share their own

parental experiences. And behaviors such as asking to see pictures of

the baby, taking the time to check-in on the well-being of the mother, or

celebrating the mother’s return to work can be enacted by any colleague

# within the organization.

# What About Non-Birthing Parents?

Although our study focused on birthing mothers returning to work, we

believe that several of these behaviors can be helpful for non-birthing

parents returning to work, too (e.g., adoptive parents, non-birthing

# mothers, and fathers). For example:

- Non-birthing parents may still beneﬁt from help navigating HR

policies, particularly because family leave policies may be more

ambiguous for workers who are not birthing parents.

- Allowing non-birthing parents to work ﬂexible hours or work

from home may enable them to similarly attend to childcare

# responsibilities.

- Providing challenging work opportunities can likewise convey that

non-birthing parents are still seen as valuable workers, even while

navigating their new role as parents.

- Asking for photos of the baby, inquiring about the transition to

parenthood, and sharing one’s own parental experiences are behaviors

that signal to a non-birthing parent that their new parent identity is

both recognized and valued.

These behaviors can have signiﬁcant positive implications for non-

birthing parents, even enabling them to neurologically adapt to

parenting. Thus, we encourage colleagues and managers to recognize

that postpartum allyship is not just for birthing mothers but all parents

reentering the workplace after welcoming a child into their families.

. . .

Working parents — particularly mothers — face the impossible

challenge of simultaneously being a dedicated employee and a

dedicated parent. As our interviewee Lauren explained, “you can’t be

valued as an employee and a mother. You can’t do both, which means

you just lose. You either are working too hard and you’re not taking care

of your kids enough. [Or] you are doing too much with your kids and

you’re not a good enough worker.”

It is against this backdrop that we urge employees across all levels of an

organization, and with diﬀering non-work identities, to be better allies

to parents as they return to work from parental leave. In our view, there

are few costs associated with most of the allyship behaviors uncovered

in our research, yet the beneﬁts are substantial — chief among them

being the retention of working mothers in the labor force and, that too,

in a way that allows them to truly thrive and protect their well-being.
