ABSTRACT Board performance research conducted over the last 50 years has focused on indi- vidual directors’ economically-motivated behaviors and outcomes, and has generated inconsistent and disappointing results. Most research does not consider the board as a team, despite recent calls for a focus on collective board processes and behaviors. A recent survey revealed that 90 per cent of directors rate their individual performance as very effective but only 30 per cent rate overall board performance at an equivalent level, exposing a gap that needs to be addressed. The dis- crepancy between individual and team performance effectiveness was the focus of this research, based on original data from 182 directors and their assessment of their board’s dynamic, team task performance efﬁcacy, team potency and the impact of their activities, as a board, on ﬁrm proﬁtability. Our ﬁndings show that director experience, social network and cultural intelligence quotient, as well as their ability to achieve high levels of team interaction – thereby lowering information asymmetry – have a signiﬁcant impact on corporate proﬁtability. Our study demon- strates that the impact of board functioning as a team is an eight times greater predictor of corporate performance than individual director demographics. We found that this team dynamic as well as team potency has a positive impact on proﬁtability, while the focus on compliance- oriented tasks has a signiﬁcantly negative effect on proﬁtability. The insights of this study should help boards and their advisors better focus their efforts to improve team dynamic, optimize board interactions and refocus their attention on value-creating activities. We also believe that improv- ing board team dynamics will have an unintended consequence of bringing a level of individual and team satisfaction back to the boardroom.

theories generating inconsistent and disappoint- ing results (Bainbridge, 2010; Huse et al, 2011). Equally unsatisfactory is that most research has centered on the individual director as the unit of analysis instead of the board as a team, despite calls – since the early 2000s – for a focus on to collective board processes and behaviors understand and predict board performance quality (Leblanc and Gillies, 2003; Letendre, 2004; Huse, 2005; Pye and Pettigrew, 2005). The contrast between the individual and team level unit of analysis is strikingly clear when considering information from board members revealing that 90 per cent consider themselves to be ‘very effective’ but only 30 per cent rate the overall board’s performance as very effective in addressing their most important and strategic initiatives1 (Heidrick and Struggles, 2010). This is a disturbing revelation as shareholders and other stakeholders mistakenly believe that boards are comprised of successful, experienced and responsible executives working as a team to effec- tively carry out their legal and ethical obligation to represent and protect shareholder interests (Brennan, 2006), but, instead, we learn that less than half the time boards are assessing their collective performance as effective (Heidrick and Struggles, 2010). Poor board governance is one of shareholder activism (Smith, 1996; Gillan and Starks, 2007; Bebchuk and Weisbach, 2010). Much of the recent academic literature on boards has proffered the recommendation that directors should work as a team to be able to produce better board outcomes (Cohen and Bailey, 1997; Forbes and Milliken (F&M), 1999; Sonnenfeld, 2002; Finkelstein and Mooney, 2003; Leblanc and Gillies, 2003; Letendre, 2004; Pye and Pettigrew, 2005; Zona and Zattoni, 2007; Conger and Lawler, 2009; Payne et al, 2009; Van Ees et al, 2009; Huse et al, 2011; Vandewaerde et al, 2011; Lorsch, 2012), but these studies are based on theoretical assumptions.

# the causes of

Despite our exhaustive search, we could not ﬁnd any empirical academic studies that exam- ined actual data on boards working as teams – measuring director’s assessment of teamwork,

team productivity and team potency (TP). This research, we believe, is the ﬁrst of its kind to analyze collective board performance rather than at the individual level. Responses to an original and comprehensive team-focused sur- vey from 182 directors and publicly available information were used to better understand team dynamics, team task performance (TTP) and the collective board’s impact on corporate proﬁtability. Our research explores how a board’s team characteristics meaningfully impact corporate proﬁtability. We contribute to existing literature in several ways. First, we explore whether board dynamics are in fact an ‘interven- ing process’, as posited by many scholars, in the value-creation chain from director characteristics to ﬁrm-level performance. Second, we reframe interact, board dynamics as captured by the Team Learning and Develop- ment Inventory (TLI) (Lingham, 2005, 2009). Third, we introduce a new behaviorally-based measure to predict the directors’ potential con- tribution to board dynamics by determining their cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) (Earley and Mosakowski, 2004). Fourth, we explore the impact that TP and TTP have on corporate proﬁtability.

# the way teams

LITERATURE REVIEW The inquiry into the impact that boards of directors have on their organizations began over 150 years ago (Smith, 1863) and continues to be studied today (Minichilli et al, 2012). Hundreds of articles have been written to try to capture the ‘mystery’ of the boardroom, directors and their impact on the successful management of the ﬁrm (Zahra and Pearce, 1989; Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004; Finegold et al, 2007; Hambrick et al, 2008; Huse et al, 2011). When considering the perspectives employed in these inquiries, it is useful streams of to review the different literature on this topic – economic, behavioral, individual-based and team-based frameworks – from which to observe and consider board characteristics and outcomes.

# Improving corporate performance

The prevalent framework used to interpret and predict the motivations and behaviors of individual directors has been based in economic theories. Scholars have employed agency theory (Eisenhardt, 1989; Boyd, 1990; Donaldson and Davis, 1991; Bathala and Rao, 1995), stewardship theory (Donaldson and Davis, 1991, Muth and Donaldson, 1998) and resource dependence theory (Casciaro and Piskorski, 2005; Haynes and Hillman, 2010) as the lens through which to observe, interpret and predict director behaviors, in their activities to optimize the ﬁnancial return to shareholders. Despite these theories having been criticized as too narrow when considered as a sole theoretical framework (Eisenhardt, 1989), there is value in understand- ing that directors do provide important monitor- ing functions in an attempt to resolve, or at least mitigate, agency conﬂicts between agents and principals (Bathala and Rao, 1995).

Another stream of research – the newest in the portfolio of approaches – is the use of behavioral to explain board actions and outcomes (Hambrick et al, 2008; Van Ees et al, 2009; Huse et al, 2011). These theories include some new and some old behavioral theories including identity theory (Ashforth and Mael, 1989), theory of planned behavior and reasoned action (Madden et al, 1992; Ajzen, 2002), and social networking theory (Granovetter, 1973), as well as various theories of the ﬁrm that have recently been applied to board behavior (Cyert and March, 1963; Grant, 1996; Rumelt, 1997; Slater, 1997) in framing and interpreting director actions and their impact on ﬁrm outcomes. Despite diverse approaches and underlying theories employed by scholars, there is consensus that observing boards, understanding their behavior and pre- dicting the impact on corporate outcomes is virtually impossible because of the difﬁculty in gaining access to actual board processes (Pettigrew, 1992; Daily et al, 2003). In addition to reviewing the panoply of theoretical frame- works, we observe that the prevalent unit of analysis is the individual director, and that most economic and legal theory relies on the actions

of individuals in expressing the behavioral tenets of theory. However, there have been calls from scholars to consider the board as a collective unit or the ‘board as team’ as the unit of analysis to try to better understand the impact of the board on corporate outcomes. This is reﬂected in the surge of recent work on teamwork in contexts as an empirical inquiry of the sparsely-researched link between board dynamics and governance (Huse et al, 2011). Confounding the lack of clarity on board-level antecedent relationships to ﬁrm-level outcomes is the recognition that most research conducted employs secondary- source data or ‘easily available data and the use of standardized methods’ (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004), preempting efforts to gather primary data on the subject. Of the hundreds of articles written about board governance since 1990, only 8 per cent address director performance from a behavioral perspective (Huse et al, 2011), and of these only a few have produced original their quantitative analyses survey data (Minichilli et al, 2012). For all these reasons – the preponderance of theoretical frameworks, difﬁculty in accessing primary data and deﬁning the most appropriate unit of analysis – scholars refer to the board as a ‘black box’ (Pettigrew and McNulty, 1995; Leblanc and Schwartz, 2007; Neill and Dulewicz, 2010) and scholarly works have not yet succeeded in lifting the shroud of boardroom mystery.

THEORYAND HYPOTHESES We begin our research with the question: How do board team characteristics and team interac- tion meaningfully impact corporate proﬁta- bility? Our research question is informed in part by prior research conducted by other scholars, and in part by our own qualitative research on board directors’ behaviors, based on their lived experiences. Our prior research demonstrated that there are distinct behavioral patterns both inside and outside the boardroom among direc- tors. These behavioral norms, speciﬁcally in the ways directors coordinated information sharing, participated in deliberations and recruited new

directors, practices, were central to our quanti- tative investigation of ‘teamwork’ at the board level (Charas and Perelli, 2013).

In deconstructing boards and the hypothe- sized impact on corporate performance, we reference the F&M (1999) paradigm-shifting model (see Figure 1). We speciﬁcally focus on the impact of the processes or the relationship- dynamic on board-level and ﬁrm-level out- comes. F&M’s theory articulates should be that board processes explored for three reasons: ‘inﬂuence of board demography on ﬁrm performance … [is] com- plex and indirect’, ‘beliefs and behaviors [can- not] be inferred reliably from demographic variables alone’ and the ‘study of process con- structs has the potential to expand and reﬁne our understanding of group dynamics’ (F&M, 1999). Their work ushered in a new era of research – to consider boards in an economic- behavioral context (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004; Hambrick et al, 2008; Huse et al, 2011).

their work marks a signiﬁcant In addition, moment in academic research: it signals the departure from an exclusive reliance on eco- nomic theory and director demographics to predict board outcomes, and a move to examin- ing the actual behaviors of board directors framed by both behavioral and economic theory. They propose that boardroom aspects should be exam- ined at four intervals – director characteristics, board processes, board-level outcomes and ﬁrm- level outcomes (F&M, 1999). Their theory, combines different units of analyses – individuals, groups and ﬁrm-level constructs in the same model – another departure from the traditional approach of studying boards.

The F&M model uses board demography and the presence of knowledge and skills as its indicator of board characteristics. In our model, we update these constructs to represent the vital input from directors using professional capital (PC) and social capital (SC), or what is referred to combined as ‘board capital’ (Hillman and

Dalziel, 2003). PC and SC, in their ‘resource provision function’ and Hillman, 2010), represent the human and SC of the board and serve as a proxy for the director’s ability to provide resources to the board (Hillman and Dalziel, 2003). PC is a measure the knowledge, depth of expertise and of degree of experience in management and on boards that the directors bring with them to their service role on the board (Haynes and Hillman, 2010). SC is a measure of the breadth of the network of connections the director has among other board directors of both public and (Haynes and Hillman, private organizations 2010). On the basis of resource dependence theory, depth of board capital will have an impact on ﬁrm-level outcomes, or, in our study, proﬁtability, because of the perceived value and resources the director brings to the board. Resource dependence theory (in the economic school) describes the value relation- ship between directors and company stake- holders, explaining that directors contribute value to the organization through the resources they bring in the form of ‘legitimacy, advice and counsel, links to other organizations, etc’ (Hillman and Dalziel, 2003; Nicholson and Kiel, 2004). Our model combines both eco- nomic and behavioral theories, as each on its own is not sufﬁcient to explain the impact of the board on ﬁrm-level outcomes. We there- fore hypothesize that:

# (Haynes

## Hypothesis 1a: Higher levels of Professional

# capital (PC) increase proﬁtability.

## Hypothesis 1b: Higher levels of Social capital

# (SC) increase proﬁtability.

In our work, we assume that boards are teams and should be studied through this theoretical conceptualization framework, being ‘ignored or even denied in past board research’ (Vandewaerde et al, 2012). Boards can be considered teams as they are ‘groups of can self- individuals interdependent regulate their behavior on relatively whole tasks. [They have] 1) face to face interaction;

# despite

# this

# that

- 2) are employees with interrelated tasks res- ponsible for making a product or providing [exercise] discretion over a service; and 3) decisions task assignments, methods such as for carrying out the work and scheduling of activities’ (Cohen and Ledford, 1994). There- fore, we consider the board of directors a ‘team’ in the same way others have considered and studied boards at the theoretical level (F&M, 1999; Conger and Lawler, 2009; Vandewaerde et al, 2011; Vandewaerde et al, 2012). This distinction that boards are teams is germane when considering the next level of inquiry in F&M’s (1999) model: board processes. They identify effort norms, cognitive conﬂict and the use of skills and knowledge as the ‘intervening process’. We assume that the referenced inter- vening process is the board’s dynamic. F&M the ‘the study of process (1999) constructs has to expand and the potential reﬁne our understanding of group dynamics … the identiﬁcation of independently predictive processes represents an important complement to knowledge about the direct or indirect effects of board demography’ (F&M, 1999). According to Curry et al (2012), team dynamics is deﬁned as being able to deal with differences, trusting the other, creating a meaningful con- text, handling conﬂict and tension, and enact- ing effective leadership roles within the team (Curry et al, 2012). McGrath et al (2000) deﬁne it as ‘team members engaged in tasks using tools and resources’ to satisfy two team objectives – to complete group projects and to fulﬁll mem- ber needs (McGrath et al, 2000). Therefore, we measure dynamics to determine the degree to which team members interact successfully to achieve the team’s and their personal objectives by capturing how the team operates through these interactions. We measure the degree and quality of a board’s dynamic or interaction using the TLI (Lingham, 2009). Speciﬁcally, the scale was developed to capture the ‘socio- psychological’ aspects of teams, as it was observed team experiences are deﬁned by that great team member interaction with regard to ‘… trust, relating to others, safety and other

social-emotional aspects of team interaction …. Most of these aspects of team interaction are embedded in the lived experience of a team based on the quality of interaction along the task-relational continuum’ (Lingham, 2009). In our model, we refer to the dynamics of a team as team interaction quality (TIQ). We hypothesize, like F&M, that certain board characteristics, namely, PC of the director, will have an impact on intervening processes. We believe that the quality of relevant information, industry and management experience represented by a director’s PC will contribute to the richness interaction. of According to Hollenbeck et al (1998), ‘the degree to which each team member has all the informa- tion necessary to perform their role in the team process … is the most critical variable’ in team success (Hollenbeck et al, 1998). Therefore, we posit that:

# (PC) Capital quality (TIQ).

Perhaps one of the most important aspects of any successful team is the exchange of informa- tion. It is incumbent on the director to be able to share information to optimize the decision- making process, and it is the team member’s (in our case, the director’s) responsibility to behave in a manner that fosters the exchange of information and facilitates effective decision making. Effective exchange of information is critical in decision making, and we posit that directors have an obligation to be engaged in and contribute to the exchange of information. When information is not effectively exchanged, information asymmetry occurs – ‘different peo- ple know different things … and information asymmetries arise between those who hold that information and those who could potentially make better decisions if they had it’ (Connelly et al, 2011). The ability of the directors to understand each other is contingent upon each individual’s sensitivity to both spoken and tacit or nuanced communication. The tenets of this theory, and its economic implications, ‘lies in

ascribing costs to information acquisition pro- cesses that resolve information asymmetries in a wide range of economic and social phenomena’ (Connelly et al, 2011). The minimization of these information acquisition costs in the boardroom may result in higher levels of deci- sion making, task performance and ultimately proﬁtability. Therefore, dynamics is a measure of the directors’ ability to communicate infor- mation to one another, reducing the econo- mically detrimental information asymmetry – as observed, ‘information asym- metry is likely to play an important role in determining whether boards will be effective in carrying out their duties’ (Rutherford, 2007). We again update F&M’s model by adding an aspect that has not yet been measured at the director level – CQ. CQ is a measure of the individual director’s ‘ability to make sense of unfamiliar contexts and then blend in’ (Earley and Mosakowski, 2004). CQ measures an indi- vidual’s ability to ‘distinguish behaviors pro- duced by the culture in question from behaviors that are peculiar to particular individuals and those found in all human beings’ (Earley and Mosakowski, 2004). We measured CQ as an indicator of the director’s ability to conform with and be successful in the social norms indicative of each board (Charas, 2012), as well as an indicator of the director’s ability to receive and transmit ‘signals’ (Bliege Bird and Smith, 2005). According to Ang and Van Dyne (2008), ‘CQ has relevance to groups, teams, [and] organi- zation’ (Ang and Van Dyne, 2008), and Triandis (2006) adds that individuals with high CQ may be more effective in adapting to organization dynamics as ‘people who are culturally intelli- gent are also more ﬂexible than the average person and thus more able to adjust to different organizational environments’ (Triandis, 2006). Most recently, researchers have identiﬁed that it is the director’s ability to understand the nuan- ces of relationships and social norms in the boardroom that distinguishes high- from low- performing boards (Huse, 1998; Leblanc and Gillies, 2005), and CQ is a direct measure of this – the ability to perceive and adjust one’s

behavior to different cultural settings. The value that directors add to the organization is not the knowledge that resides in them (resource pro- viding), but their ability to share this knowledge for the beneﬁt of the ﬁrm (knowledge applica- tion) in a dynamic setting. Therefore, our third set of hypotheses relate to the ability of the director to understand and adapt appro- priately to different cultural settings, optimizing their ability to communicate effectively and impact the dynamic in the boardroom (TIQ), as well as the board’s ability to accomplish tasks. As indicated above, we consider TIQ as the the intervening measure of processes. Several researchers have investigated the phenomena of board dynamics. Erakovic and Overall (2010) describe dynamics as ‘more than a summation of individual contributions where … different people working together in a board-level environment genuinely adds value to the organization’. According to Huse (1998), ‘trust and emotion play … an important part in the boards’ activities’. He adds that dynamic is contingent on the feelings of the directors about their fellow directors’ ‘compe- tence, capacity, timing, even their integrity, their good intentions or their reliability’ (Huse, 1998). F&M (1999) state that board dynamics are heavily dependent on social-psychological pro- cesses, especially related to group participation and interaction, information exchange and dialog (F&M, 1999). Another point of view on the importance of dynamics in the boardroom comes ‘… the quality of the from Letendre (2004): interactions among the participants – or “board- room dynamics” – is a crucial variable in effective decision-making and achieving other desired meeting outcomes’. The question of board team dynamics and board task performance was exam- ined in our study to try to reveal the contents of the ‘black box’ (Gabrielsson and Huse, 2004; Leblanc and Schwartz, 2007) and the direct and indirect impact this has on corporate proﬁtability. In our study, task performance was operationa- lized through collecting information on the skills directors believe the board applies in generating cognitive outcomes, the freedom directors have

to express innovation, and directors’ attention to compliance and risk management issues. There- fore, we hypothesize on the relationship between director characteristics and board-level outputs:

(CQ)

# Hypothesis 3b: Higher

# levels of cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) increase Team Task Performance (TTP).

The most recent conceptual framework in the stream of board research has been the use of behavioral theory – the ‘interactions and beha- vioral processes among and between actors in and around the boardroom’ (Van Ees et al, 2009). Van Ees et al (2009) further suggest that studying boards from a behavioral perspective adds more value than using the traditional economic frameworks, as using behavioral the- ory brings us closer to what is actually happen- ing in the boardroom, and this is more actionable for practitioners. In fact, beyond the simple exchange of information, ‘the focus on how boards add value has increased the relative importance of practices that facilitate boards working together well as a group’ (Payne et al, 2009). Perhaps the the most scholars contributing to this stream of literature are Huse and colleagues in their pronounce- ment that to unravel the mystery of the board we should ‘… emphasize how the board, [works] as a team together and rather than only as individual board members … [and how they] can effectively coordinate ﬁrm activities and utilize different resources to create value. As no board member is the full complement of information and knowledge necessary to achieve desired goals, then work- ing as a team permits greater productivity than can be achieved by individual efforts’ (Gabrielsson et al, 2007). To best observe the behaviors that represent this concept, we need to understand different aspects of board perfor- mance ranging from how directors perform as a team, to how well directors are able to respond

to contextual and cultural differences (Earley and Mosakowski, 2004) that deﬁne each board environment (board culture), to the intervening processes or the dynamic of the relationships of the board directors (Minichilli et al, 2012) and how they impact resulting board-level outcomes of TP and TTP. TP is a measure of a team’s ‘collective perceived capability of work- ing together to achieve tasks’ (Collins and (2010) Parker, 2010). Collins focused on distinguishing the different drivers of team performance, examining elements of potency, processes and outcomes. TP as iden- tiﬁed, is an important board-level outcome, as teams with a ‘strong belief in their capabilities set higher goals, develop strategies to achieve their goals, and persist in the face of setbacks’ (Collins and Parker, 2010). They also found that ‘the broader bandwidth of team potency may be most predictive when a team does not obtain realistic feedback’ (Collins and Parker, 2010), and given that boards are special teams that meet infrequently and receive little feed- back, the use of potency was appropriate. In a study that focused on the importance of TP compared with other antecedents of TTP, potency was the strongest predictor of team performance (Campion et al, 1993; Champion et al, 1996). According to Ilgen et al (2005), effective teams are characterized by members believing that they are competent enough to accomplish their task (potency), provide an environment of psychological safety, demonstrate a desire to work and stay together (bonding and solidarity), are able to adapt to changing situations, and are able to learn. These team characteristics set the environment for the important intervening processes or board dynamic that is ‘complex and indirect’ (F&M, 1999) and thus crucial in generating vital and effective board-level outcomes. Because CQ is a measure of how well an individual can adapt to different social norms in group settings and TP is a measure of the team’s psychological proﬁle, we posit that it is the that quality of to different enhances

# and Parker

cultures in generating a shared mental model of TP. Because PC is a measure of the director’s experience and expertise, the ability to share this information effectively will lead to a higher level of belief that the team can accomplish their objectives. It is through their ability to achieve high levels of interaction and appro- priately share their experience and expertise that their collective belief in their ability to achieve goals can be manifested in TP. We therefore hypothesize the following relation- ships between board characteristics, TIQ and TP:

Hypothesis 4a: Team interaction quality (TIQ) mediates the relationship between cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) and team potency (TP).

Hypothesis 4b: Team interaction quality (TIQ) mediates the relationship between professional capital (PC) and team potency (TP).

As described above, we would expect a relationship between the knowledge resources the director brings to the board and their ability to perform effectively in a team because of a heightened ability to communicate. When TIQ is high, we would expect to see this resulting in higher levels of TTP. O’Reilly III et al (1998) observed that because boards are charged with complex, interactive tasks, the degree of TIQ – or as they characterize it, ‘interpersonal attrac- tion’ – will have an impact on how well those tasks are performed. Because in a team it is the collective actions of each individual that con- tribute to the ability to achieve task completion, a high level of information exchange, group decision making and shared mental models are required to achieve the TTP goals. It is through the ‘intervening processes’ or dynamics that teams are able to generate outcomes. We there- fore hypothesize that:

# Improving corporate performance

Hypothesis 5b: Team interaction quality (TIQ) mediates the relationship between professional capital (PC) and team task performance (TTP).

Again, CQ measures the ability of a director to appropriately and effectively understand the dynamic of the team, and contribute their knowledge and skills to enabling the team to achieve their goals. Knowledge-based theory of the ﬁrm and team interaction theory would support our prediction of a mediated relation- ship between CQ and ﬁrm proﬁtability, and we hypothesize that:

response times and improving decision making (Lawler et al, 1995). Several scholars have there is a direct and causal suggested that relationship between board task performance and corporate ﬁnancial performance (Brennan, 2006; Spellman and Watson, 2009; Adut et al, 2011): companies with active boards produce higher levels of investor returns and economic value creation than those with passive boards (Millstein and MacAvoy, 1998; Karamanou and Vafeas, 2005; Brennan, 2006). Our aim is to understand and hypothesize the following:

6: Team interaction quality (TIQ) mediates the relationship between cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) and proﬁtability.

Measuring TP is important because ‘teams with a strong belief in their capabilities set higher goals, develop strategies to achieve their goals, and persist in the face of setbacks’ (Collins and Parker, 2010). Groups with high levels of potency are more likely to achieve success in team goals. Given the ultimate goal of the board is to represent the interests of the shareholders by guiding the organization to ﬁnancial success, for our study we selected relative proﬁtability performance as the indicator of corporate suc- cess, and therefore board success. We hypothe- size the following relationship:

Hypothesis 7: Team potency (TP) mediates the relationship between team interaction quality (TIQ) and proﬁtability.

The literature of late is rife with references to the relationship between TTP and ﬁnancial performance, and organizations are ‘increas- ingly focusing on teams to increase competitive advantage’ (Hartenian, 2002). Teams have become the focus of businesses interested in improving their productivity and proﬁtability, as collaboration, continuous learning and shared to information have been shown to access generate value in organizations by improving increasing productivity, enhancing creativity,

Hypothesis 8a: Team task performance (TTP) mediates the relationship between team interaction quality (TIQ) and proﬁtability.

Hypothesis 8b: Team task performance (TTP) mediates the relationship between cultural intelligence quotient (CQ) and proﬁtability.

These hypotheses and the results are repre- sented in Figure 2. Note that consistent with the F&M model we have distinguished the four levels of focus – board characteristics, board processes, board-level outcomes and ﬁrm-level outcomes.

RESEARCH DESIGN To understand the inﬂuence of the identiﬁed factors on relative proﬁtability performance of public and private for-proﬁt organizations, we conducted a quantitative study using a combi- nation of survey data, proprietary data from third-party sources and public domain informa- tion. We followed a strict psychometric survey methodology that gathered individual responses addressing selected constructs. By using a blended quantitative approach using multiple sources of data, we reduced the potentially high level of method and social desirability bias in this study. The following section describes the method we used for the develop- ment of our survey instrument (including oper- ationalization) and data collection for our study. A summary of the constructs operationalized in

our study and the sources of scales used can be found in Table 1. These constructs are discussed in detail below.

Board characteristics – Independent variables Board director PC and SC measures were operationalized by accessing three sources of information: public domain information about director professional proﬁles; private third- party information about director social capital (BoardEx); and by collecting primary informa- tion from directors themselves about their level of cultural intelligence.

Professional Capital: To best understand the types of skills/competencies and relative impor- tance directors place on PC, we referenced prior research conducted on directors of public companies (Charas, 2012). Our prior research indicated that board directors are primarily recruited for their knowledge, experience and social network. In our study, we deﬁne knowl- edge and experience as PC, which was repre- sented by a score calculated by standardizing and then weighting attributes represented in Table 2.

Social Capital: SC was a raw score collected from a relationship capital management data- base (BoardEX). This raw score represents the number of connections each director has in a database of over 500 000 directors of both public and private organizations. SC raw score was converted to a standardized value.

Cultural Intelligence Quotient: (CQ) measures metacognitive, cognitive, motivational and behav- ioral aspects of adapting to different cultures. For our research, we measured only three aspects of director’s behavioral characteristics including metacognitive, motivational and behavioral and excluded cognitive as this aspect is not relevant to board tasks. Metacognitive aspects capture ‘the mental processes that individuals use to acquire and understand cultural knowledge, including knowledge of and control over indivi- thought processes.’ Motivational aspects dual measure the ‘capacity to direct attention and energy toward learning about and functioning in situations characterized by cultural differences.’ Behavioral aspects describe the ‘capability to exhibit appropriate verbal and nonverbal actions when interacting with people from different cultures’ (Ang and Van Dyne, 2008). The most critical aspect of CQ is the behavioral aspect as

Board processes – The mediators is The mediator for board-level outcomes TIQ or what F&M (1999) refer to as the ‘dynamic’ or the measure of boardroom ‘inter- vening processes’. To capture the director’s perception of TIQ, we employed the TLI questionnaire developed by Lingham (2009). This questionnaire focuses on the crux of team interaction by assessing the extent to which the board is currently creating a ‘safe and supportive environment, embracing and respect[ing] dif- ferences, developing strong trusting relation- ships, generating learning and getting tasks done effectively’ (Lingham et al, 2009). The 30 items scale measure interaction among team members on 10 behavioral attri- butes: engagement, active listening, individual- ity, solidarity, understanding, action, planning, power and inﬂuence, and openness. Board members responded to team- level questions on a 5-point Likert scale. As the instrument is a proprietary product of Interac- tive Science2, the raw data were provided to this organization and they in turn provided a single score representing the level of TIQ the per participant, and used to represent

Board-level outcomes Board-level outcomes are measured by two aspects – the degree to which boards are effective in achieving tasks (TTP) and the level of perceived TP. Given that a board’s primary output is cognitive in nature, TTP was mea- sured in relation to ‘service delivery’ (Bateman et al, 2002), and we attempted to capture aspects of TTP and compliance quality levels. For our analyses, three aspects were selected as appro- priate to capture the information deemed most indicative of TTP and conﬁrmed by our prior qualitative research, namely, skills, innovation and compliance quality (Charas and Perelli, 2013). Skills measured the degree to which directors have adequate training and are com- petent to do ‘board work’, as well as a measure of their skills (Bateman et al, 2002). Innovation measured the degree to which directors seek approaches to improve their systems of work (Bateman et al, 2002). Compliance quality measured the degree to which directors understand, comply and are concerned with compliance and administrative requirements and standards set by the board (Bateman et al, 2002).

that aspects essentially measure the impact external factors (namely, Sabanes-Oxley and other regulatory requirements) as well as inter- nal factors of corporate governance standards have on directors. These TTP aspects were captured through a board task performance audit scale developed by Bateman et al (2002) with questions clustered around six core themes. Because half of these themes were team dynamic measure captured in the (described above), we selected those items that directly reﬂected task performance and were not related to TIQ – skill, innovation and compliance quality. An EFA was performed as described above, and only one of the six items representing the skill factor was removed. The resulting Cronbach’s α=0.92 reﬂects the remaining items for TTP.

TP is a measure of the team’s assessment of their capability spanning many domains (Guzzo et al, 1993) and was captured with a scale created by Guzzo et al, (1993) and adapted by Collins and Parker (2010), made up of eight questions employing a 5-point Likert scale (Guzzo et al, 1993; Collins and Parker, 2010). We used all items in the validated scale. The TP Cronbach α=0.92. The scale is presented in Table 3.

measure allowed us to determine whether the proﬁtability of the participant’s company over- or under-performed the industry average and the magnitude of that relative performance.

Control variables We control for several factors, including indus- try category, company size as measured by employee count, and the proportion of inside versus outside directors on the board. Because we used an industry- and size-adjusted calcula- tion for proﬁtability performance, we did not have an additional control for industry and ﬁrm size. There is an argument to include the total number of employees as a measure of size in a study that aims to predict ﬁrm ﬁnancial perfor- mance (Zajac and Westphal, 1996; Finkelstein and Boyd, 1998). In addition, there is precedent for considering the size of the board when predicting ﬁrm performance (Yermack, 1996; Dalton et al, 1998; Eisenberg et al, 1998). Recent studies have explored how the propor- tion of executive and independent directors and board composition impact ﬁrm performance (Wagner et al, 1998; Finegold et al, 2007).

Firm-level outcome Proﬁtability Performance was the selected ﬁrm- level outcome measure. It was operationalized by comparing the participant organization’s proﬁt margin (as deﬁned by net income divided by total revenues) with the average of the size- adjusted comparable industry proﬁt margin index. The size adjustment was based on three size categories: revenues of under US$5 million, between $5 million and $50 million, and over $50 million. The company’s published ﬁnancial statements as well as rating agencies, namely, Hoovers, S&P and Mergent, were sourced both to collect information on the participant’s organization and to establish the average level of proﬁtability of all organizations in a given industry group and revenue size. This relative

Instrument development We developed a survey using items from exist- ing and validated scales to gather information for our analysis. Given the limited potential target participants (board directors of public and private for-proﬁt organizations) and their disin- clination to participate in surveys (Wagner et al 1998), we did not run a pilot study so as not to exhaust the limited number of potential parti- cipants. In addition, we used validated scales and did not introduce any original survey ques- tions. Table 1 provides details on the sources of information and scales used to operationalize each construct in our research.

to target participants, comprising board mem- bers of randomly selected public and private for-proﬁt organizations in the United States, of all sizes and industry types. Of the nearly 13 000 conﬁrmed receipts of the survey ques- tionnaire e-mails, 422 recipients completed the questionnaire, yielding a 3.5 per cent response rate. Rates this low are not uncommon including top management among samples (Stimpert, and, 1992), as these respondents are often overbur- time-pressed and generally unwilling dened, to share information about themselves or their boards.

The data demonstrate appropriate levels of diversity, gender and representation of the indus- try as a whole. We performed an ANOVA test to determine whether any of the demographic characteristics of timing of survey completion (early versus late respon- dents) had a signiﬁcant impact on any of the variables. We found that there was a signiﬁcant

# RESEARCH METHOD

Measurement model We used validated scales in a different context than the original use, and we performed an EFA and a conﬁrmatory factor analysis on the should theoretically that observed variables comprise latent constructs, with both analyses yielding passing levels of model ﬁt, reliability and validity (CMIN/DF=1.94, CFI=0.89, NFI=0.79, RMSEA=0.07, PCLOSE=0.000, StandardizedRMR=0.086,χ2=1170.9,Degrees of freedom=603). Normality of the composite variables for each of the constructs (calculated using factor scores from the measurement model in AMOS) passed tests for skewness and kurtosis, but the proﬁtability performance score was slightly skewed (2.20) and exhibited moderate kurtosis (4.49). We believe that these low levels are not problematic in our analysis. In addressing common method bias, we use multiple sources of data for our model, therefore it is less likely that common method bias will impact our results.

after adding the mediating variable; second, we conducted bootstrapping using 2000 bias- second corrected approach allowed us to determine the strength and signiﬁcance of the standardized indirect effect of (Baron the mediated relationships and Kenny, 1986; Preacher and Hayes, 2004). To best understand a surprising relationship, we ran a multiple regression analysis between the factors of TTP and proﬁtability ﬁrst-order performance, and found that the quality factor, representing the area of compliance, had a dominative negative impact, outweighing the positive impact of skills and innovation. Therefore, we consider TTP to be almost exclusively reﬂective of the team’s attention to compliance quality. The means, standard deviations and correlations of variables are reported in Table 6. We ﬁnd that board member characteristics are strong antecedents to board-level outcomes, which are signiﬁ- cantly related to ﬁrm performance. Overall, we had a stronger

In addition, we observed fairly strong Squared Multiple Correlations (R2) for TTP (0.70) and TP (0.44), presented in Table 7.

Structural model We tested our hypotheses using structural equation modeling employing IBM SPSS and AMOS software version 20. We tested the hypothesized model and then eliminated non- signiﬁcant relationships in order to achieve adequate model ﬁt. We appropriately co-varied the residual errors for TP and TTP (Bateman et al, 2002; Hare, 2003; Kenny, 2003; Collins and Parker, 2010). Thus, we were able to account for their statistical correlation, without implying theoretical causation. We employed to test mediation: ﬁrst, we two approaches took the Baron and Kenny (1986) approach in which we tested changes to the direct effect

We had excellent model ﬁt (CMIN/DF= 1.29, CFI=0.988, NFI=0.949, RMSEA= 0.04, PCLOSE=0.636, Standardized RMR= 0.0571, χ2=32.21, Degrees of freedom=25). In terms of the validity and reliability of our latent constructs, we found no concerns (that is, AVE>0.50, CR>0.70, MSV<AVE and √AVE>inter-construct correlations).

Of the 13 hypotheses tested in our model, 11 were supported. As for predicting the dependent variable of proﬁtability performance, all hypoth- eses directly and indirectly related to proﬁtability performance were statistically signiﬁcant and positive, other than TTP (compliance-driven), which had a strong negative impact.

DISCUSSION Overall, our model supports the F&M (1999) four-stage model, showing that, in fact, director characteristics accentuated by a healthy board- room dynamic will produce better board-level outcomes, which in turn have an impact on ﬁrm-level outcomes.

Antecedents to board performance PC and SC are supported in the model and have a direct and statistically signiﬁcant impact on proﬁtability performance. These attributes are aligned with the economic- based resource dependence theory. It is clear

that the knowledge and experience a direc- tor brings to the boardroom, as well as their network, are instrumental in accessing and utilizing resources in a manner that generates economic value. For this reason, we recom- mend that in the recruiting process nominating committees screen director candidates carefully functional and leadership for their industry, experience, and attempt to recruit directors who have a robust network of professional relationships. However, we see that PC and SC are not sufﬁcient antecedents for full parti- cipation in the boardroom. CQ is important and critical in producing effective team interac- tion (0.22, P<0.01), facilitating task perfor- mance (0.20, P<0.01) and generating TP (0.15, P<0.01) – all critical in predicting relative proﬁtability performance. We believe that higher levels of CQ are associated with higher levels of TIQ, TTP, TP and ultimately proﬁt- ability because of the ability of directors to perform effectively in the team setting. In addition, our prior research has shown that board recruiting practices can be linked to the quality of corporate governance, the success of the director candidate in assimilating in the culture unique to each boardroom, director satisfaction and director tenure (Charas, 2012). Executive recruiters assisting boards should be screening for this vital behavioral quality in serving their corporate clients, and board candi- dates seeking new appointments should culti- vate CQ skills.

Team dynamics TIQ appears to be the ‘intervening process’ identiﬁed by F&M (1999), however not in the manner we expected. It does not translate the director characteristics and individual behaviors to board-level outcomes of TTP and TP, but it is critical in the model in predicting TTP and TP. TIQ is a signiﬁcant and powerful antece- dent to board-level outcomes. F&M (1999) identiﬁed that there is an ‘intervening process’ at the board level that drives board- and ﬁrm-

(F&M, 1999). Others have level outcomes referred to this as the board’s dynamic (Leblanc and Gillies, 2003; Letendre, 2004; Huse et al, 2005; Leblanc and Schwartz, 2007; Huse et al, 2011). TIQ is the heart of our model, and the critical ‘intervening process’ that determines the success or failure of the board as a team, and therefore their ability to generate measurable proﬁtability enhancement, demonstrated by the relationship TIQ has with TTP (0.77, P<0.01), TP (0.66, P<0.01) and directly

with proﬁtability (0.42, P<0.01). Achieving a high level of board team dynamics reduces information asymmetry as demonstrated by Greenwald and Stiglitz (1994): the reduction of information asymmetry between those who ‘make decisions (agents) and the theoretical beneﬁciaries of those decisions (principals)’ is a way to optimize value creation (Greenwald and Stiglitz, 1994). Boards are primarily ‘decision- making groups composed mostly of outsiders who bring substantial the price of lower inside knowledge of the ﬁrm and its et al, 2012). According to the most recent survey of board directors conducted by Cloyd et al (2012), 97.8 per cent of boards are engaged in an evaluation process; however, the focus of the evaluation is on individual directors, and not the board as a team (Cloyd et al, 2012). We recommend that boards replace the individual director evalua- tion, adopting a team-based assessment (like the TLI) – to measure the effectiveness of the board’s dynamic and the resulting impact on proﬁtability performance.

Team task performance TTP is an interesting mediator as it plays an important clarifying role between TIQ and proﬁtability performance. When we measured the direct relationship between TIQ and proﬁt- ability performance, we found that it was weak and not signiﬁcant (β=0.06). This is because TIQ has both positive and negative impacts on proﬁtability performance that are ‘cancelling’ each other out (hence the low β). However, when we add TTP as the mediator, we ﬁnd that TTP is channeling the negative impact TIQ has on proﬁtability performance (indirect β=−0.33, P<0.01), which then allows the positive effect to be manifested in the direct path (β=0.42, P<0.01). Thus, the mediating role of TTP, although not as expected, provides greater clariﬁcation on the eustress and distress effects TIQ has on proﬁtability performance. The attention and concern with board policy compliance, and

enhanced by TIQ, is diminishing the positive impact that team dynamic and TP have on the board’s ability to generate positive proﬁtability results. Given the ever-increasing complexity in the governance compliance arena (Sarbanes- Oxley in 2002, Dodd-Frank in 2010), 50 per cent of directors report that they spend at least 60 per cent more time on compliance issues than they did in the previous year (Cloyd et al 2012). It is not surprising that devoting so much time and attention to regulation compliance detracts from directors’ ability to spend meaningful time on value-creating activities such as strategy development, succession planning, understanding the business operations better, developing human capital and risk management (Cloyd et al 2012; Charas and Perelli, 2013). Focusing on compli- ance issues required by legislation at the expense of other board activities and the negative impact on ﬁrm performance has been highlighted in past research (Romano, 2005a, 2005b; Shadab, 2008). In addition to the negative impact compliance has on proﬁtability perfor- mance, qualiﬁed professionals who once wel- comed the opportunity to join boards no longer accept board positions as they are loathe to take on the additional accountability of regulatory compliance as well as the reputational risk of being associated with a non-complying board (Lorsch, 2012; Spencer Stewart, 2010). Our recommendation is should consider improving the dynamic of the board- room to make their limited time together more effective, freeing up time to address strategic (less administratively oriented) and value-creat- ing topics. In addition, boards may want to consider availing themselves of advisors well versed in compliance issues, and charging that individual or (committee) with the overall responsibility for board compliance.

(Guzzo et al, 1993). Our model demonstrates that TP is a strong predictor of proﬁtability (0.44, P<0.01). The model also demonstrates the strong relationship between TIQ and TP (0.66, P<0.01), further indicating the impor- tance of a healthy dynamic in the boardroom. As expressed by Guzzo et al (1993), the way to improve potency is to energize and inspire others, enlist commitments and set high goals, and address unproductive conﬂict among team members. It is clear that team dynamics is the critical ‘intervening process’ that drives not only TTP, but TP as well, and why it is so vital in high-performing teams. On the basis of the results of our analysis, our single model could easily capture two distinct theoretical frame- works: the economic-based model that only considers director PC and SC as antecedents to proﬁtability has validity; and a second beha- vioral model that begins with TIQ and shows how critical TIQ is in generating TTP and TP, which in turn are strong predictors of relative proﬁtability. The combined theoretical frame- works have greater predictive value.

sources of data, and our research is based on primary data, we believe that our participant size is supportable. In addition, to fully under- stand the dynamics of the team, multiple per- spectives of the same team needed to be collected. Our work is based on one perspective of team performance on the board. Lastly, we the ﬁrm – selected relative proﬁtability of compared with same-sized organizations in comparable industries – as the measure of performance. There are many other measures that might be better indicators of ﬁrm perfor- mance. Future research should take these lim- into consideration when designing itations further research protocols. In addition, to isolate the impact of team dynamic, we recommend that experimental research be performed by working with boards to enhance their dynamic and measuring the impact of improved dynamic on board- and ﬁrm-level outcomes over time.

LIMITATIONS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH The model we hypothesized and presented is characterized by several limitations. First, we have approached the problem from a multi- theoretical framework, relying on economic, behavioral and team theory, and we cannot be certain that this was the appropriate framework from which to consider the problem and inter- pret the model. Second, although we have tried to show a statistically signiﬁcant relationship between board-level outcomes and proﬁtability performance, there are many factors that could explain this relationship beyond the constructs selected for this model. Third, although our model has strong predictive signiﬁcance, we based our results on a relatively small sample size of 182 directors. However, given that recent research in this area is based on published

CONCLUSIONS Our research has clearly demonstrated that there is a relationship between director char- acteristics and their impact on corporate proﬁt- ability, as a departure from the prevalent individual-focused economic-based theories. Our model shows that in fact directors do have a statistically signiﬁcant impact on proﬁtability performance, but it is a small impact, explaining less than 0.5 per cent of performance. We have demonstrated that the behaviors of directors – successfully exchanging information, develop- ing trust and a shared mindset, having collective belief in their ability to accomplish their goals – are in fact the intervening processes introduced by F&M (1999) and thus critical to corporate success. We have shown that this team dynamic – heretofore never measured – is the antecedent to economic value creation, and that the impact of ‘boards as teams’ has an 800 per cent or eight times (8X) greater predictive impact on proﬁt- ability performance, as the model suggests that up to 4 per cent of proﬁtability performance is explained by integrated actions at the team level. By considering the board as a team, we

have a basis for understanding how economic value can be created through reducing informa- tion asymmetry, improving directors’ ability to appropriately respond to the cultural/social norms of the team through the expression of CQ and develop TP. Our hope is that future research will build on our team-behavioral approach and further explore how seamlessly integrating board and top management team dynamics and strategic initiatives could be a powerful antecedent to ﬁrm proﬁtability.
