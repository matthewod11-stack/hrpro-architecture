Do you dread giving feedback?

A lot of people do. Some even get anxious before a feedback

# conversation.

For those new to management, feedback discussions can feel like

another tedious item on your list — something that you’re required

to do, but don’t necessarily enjoy. You may be concerned about how

your employee will react to your feedback, especially if it’s a tough

conversation. You may even wonder if employees really value your

words or plan to put them into practice.

If you’re having these thoughts, here’s a reality check: Your employees

do care, especially your high performers.

## According to a research paper, “The Value of Stress Free Productivity”

by Crucial Learning, high performers are the heroes of a team, often

generating more than 60% of the output. Research shows these

superstars can deliver 400% more productivity than their peers, and

just being near high performers has the potential to boost other

workers’’ output by 15%.

This means your high performers are critical to your team’s success —

and you should make an eﬀort to retain them. A part of that involves

delivering valuable feedback to help them learn and grow, as data shows

this group is highly motivated by feedback. They’re also likely to move

one and look for other opportunities when they don’t receive quality

coaching in their current roles.

Despite this, high performers consistently receive lower-quality

feedback than their colleagues, with it being worst for high-performing

women. Managers often spend the majority of their eﬀorts trying to

improve the output of lower performers. The problem occurs when

those eﬀorts lead a manager to be too hands-oﬀ with their other team

members. Given the important contributions high performers make,

you should aim to balance your feedback eﬀorts and make sure you’re

not overlooking top employees’ needs.

Here are ﬁve actions you can take to make sure your feedback approach

is fair and keeps top talent engaged — along with examples of how to

give them feedback.

# Don’t Hold Back on Constructive Feedback

It’s easy to skip critical feedback when it comes to star players. With so

many items on your to-do list, you may be tempted to just say, “You’re

doing great,” and move on, without considering where they could

grow. You may also worry you’ll discourage them by saying something

negative — but both things are mistakes.

Giving high performers constructive feedback keeps them engaged and

motivated. Research on what high performers want at work shows that

50% want “at least a monthly sit down with their managers” to help

them gain insights and improve in their roles.

So, even if your employee is delivering great work, consider what areas

of their job or performance they still need to improve on. Ask yourself:

What are their goals, and what are the team’s goals? How can they

stretch themselves to reach those goals, beyond what they’re currently

doing? What would make them an even stronger worker, team member,

# or leader?

Instead of: “You did a great job presenting all the information. No

# notes.”

This feedback is not only unclear (what exactly did the employee do

“great” at?), but it lacks concrete examples. It doesn’t tell your high

performer what’s working or not working about the way the way they

present, or how those actions are related to their goals.

Try: “Your analysis of the project and its outcome was clear and

detailed. When we needed to make a decision at the end of the meeting,

that data made it a lot easier to analyze our options. But I did notice

you dismissed several questions from the team while presenting. I know

you were eager to prove your argument, but in future meetings, I’d

like to see you be more collaborative. When you’re willing to address

counterarguments, or opinions that are diﬀerent than your own, it helps

build your credibility as a leader and shows you’re open to new ideas.

Those things are critical for collaborating and ﬁnding the smartest

# solutions to any problem.”

This feedback is speciﬁc, clear, and applicable. It tells your high

performers what they did well, what they need to work on for further

# growth, and why.

# Avoid All-or-Nothing Language

It’s important to make sure your feedback doesn’t include exaggerated

language like “you always contribute” or “you never miss an

## opportunity.” Managers typically write exaggerated feedback because

they’re trying to emphasize a point, but the hyperbole can undermine

the credibility of your words — namely because it’s incorrect. Rarely

do “always” or “never” accurately describe someone’s performance or

# actions.

With all employees (not just high performers), you’ll also want to

skip using ﬁxed-mindset language like “you’re not good at messaging”

or “you’re a creative and not analytical.” This kind of feedback

communicates the idea that an employee’s abilities and intelligence are

ﬁxed and unchangeable, which can be demotivating or make them feel

like they have no room to grow or change. When this happens, high

performers in particular may become discouraged or look for alternative

ways to grow.

Instead of: “Your questions in the meeting last week were great. You’re

always great at asking questions and rarely miss an opportunity to show

# your strategic thinking skills.”

This feedback is a little superﬂuous. It doesn’t tell the high performer

what you really liked about their questions and why asking questions is

# important or valuable in their role.

Try: “In last week’s strategy meeting, your probing questions about

the new product roadmap opened up an important discussion that

helped us reﬁne our Q4 direction. I appreciate how you showed up with

curiosity and team spirit and helped us all reach a better plan.”

This anchors the feedback in concrete examples. It’s speciﬁc and

explains what about the questions was successful, and why. Providing

feedback in this manner will help not only build trust and credibility

but also build a foundation for growth for your high performer.

# Don’t Get Too Personal

A common feedback trap is giving personality-based feedback. You may

be more likely to fall into this trap with high performers whom you

trust or have a comfortable rapport with. For example, telling someone:

“You’re the most helpful person on our team,” centers on a personality

## trait rather than the impact of their performance on the business.

This is especially problematic for women, who are 22% more likely

to receive feedback about their personality than men. When high-

performing women get personality feedback, it also impacts their

growth opportunities because they lose out on feedback that is relevant

and speciﬁc to growing skills for their role.

Instead of: “You’re so nice and a joy to work with.”

This is a compliment, not feedback. It focuses on a personality trait,

and not the employee’s strengths or the actual actions that make them

pleasant to work with. It’s also unclear why or how being “nice” or “a

joy” is relevant to their growth — or if it is at all.

Try: “Your clear communication and openness to collaborating with the

sales team on their most recent campaign helped us put together a more

cohesive pitch and improved our relationships with the clients. Let’s

work together to ﬁnd more opportunities like this, so you can continue

developing your cross-functional leadership skills.”

This feedback shifts the focus away from personality traits and towards

skills and behaviors. It highlights the employee’s accomplishments,

gives them the recognition they deserve, and explains how they need

to continue growing. This kind of feedback is key to keeping high

performers engaged and committed to your organization.

## Be Mindful of Reinforcing Negative Stereotypes

Feedback isn’t just about performance — it shapes how your employees

view themselves, their work, and your leadership. For high performers

from historically underrepresented groups, your words may carry more

weight. These individuals may be more susceptible to internalizing

feedback that results in stereotype threat — a psychological experience

that happens when someone feels stress or anxiety around conﬁrming

## negative stereotypes about their racial, ethnic, gender, or cultural

# groups.

Research on feedback internalization found high-performing women

are seven times more likely to internalize negative stereotypes such

as “being too emotional at work,” which can limit their conﬁdence

and career growth. Another study on women in leadership roles found

that stereotype threat can lower women’s perceived leadership abilities

and prevent them from pursuing those kinds of roles. Additionally,

underrepresented high performers are more likely to receive biased

feedback that labels them with negative terms like “unlikable” or “diﬃcult.”

Research also found that 42% of Black employees recall being called

“unlikable” in feedback, while white employees are two times more

likely to be called “likable” over any other group at work. These

labels can undermine even the most talented individuals and reinforce

# stereotypes about speciﬁc groups.

To retain and empower your top talent, be mindful of feedback you give

and how it can reinforce negative stereotypes or biases.

Instead of: “Your peers ﬁnd you diﬃcult to work with.”

This feedback isn’t backed by examples, and it doesn’t connect the

employee’s behaviors to any outcome. It also doesn’t reﬂect any changes

you’re looking for. An employee who hears this feedback is not likely

to take it well, as it has no foundational evidence and may even be

perceived as biased.

Try: “I’ve noticed during our team discussions, you tend to quickly shut

down others’ ideas before fully understanding them. This makes your

peers feel dismissed and aﬀects their trust in your ability to collaborate.

Let’s work on fostering more open dialogue to make sure everyone’s

ideas are heard before we decide on the right approach. I’m here to help

you ﬁnd ways to improve this in our discussions.”

This feedback is constructive and focuses on the behavior you want to

see change, as well as examples of when it has occurred, and its impact. It doesn’t label the employee as “diﬃcult,” but rather, gives them an

action to improve upon.

# Map Out Clear Paths for Growth

Career growth shouldn’t feel be a mystery to your employees. Clarity

about what’s required to move towards their goals keeps people

motivated. Feedback sessions are opportunities to map out not just

promotions, but also career-building projects, cross-functional roles,

and mentorship opportunities that match their aspirations.

This is even more critical for high-performing women and non-binary

individuals, as research shows that a disproportionate number of them

don’t know what’s required for their next promotion, indicating a gap

that needs to be closed to avoid frustration and lost opportunities.

Your one-on-ones are a great time to reinforce that you’re dedicated to

helping your high performers grow and get the opportunities they want.

Instead of: “Keep up the good work, you are on the right track.”

This feedback is not speciﬁc enough to be useful. It vaguely references

the future and doesn’t explain what it will take for a high performer

to get to the next level or, say, be picked for high-priority projects and

# tasks.

Try: “You did great work communicating with our clients on the last initiative. I know they were diﬃcult to work with, and you showed

patience and compassion. I would love for you to take the lead on the

upcoming client integration project. It will help you demonstrate your

ability to handle more complex transactions, positioning you well for

the senior manager role we’ve been discussing. Let’s detail the exact

skills and milestones you need to hit to achieve this.”

This provides a clear example of what the employee is doing well and

why they have earned this new opportunity. It also gives them a detailed

roadmap for advancement, fueling your high performers’ ambition and

helping them visualize and plan their future within the organization.

Following these tips can be helpful in giving feedback to all your

employees. But you need to be sure you’re not overlooking your high

performing employees just because they’re already doing great work.

High performers thrive on actionable feedback and clear direction,

so by delivering thoughtful, speciﬁc feedback, you empower them to

excel and maintain their engagement, ensuring they continue to drive

# success within your organization.
