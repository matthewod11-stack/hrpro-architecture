For two decades we have been hearing that HR must become astrategic partner to the business. And the fact that we’re stillhearing it suggests that in many organizations it hasn’t happened.The need to align HR with the business has become more urgentthan ever. Financial markets exert relentless pressure for growth,especially in emerging markets. Customers demand more andbetter service at lower cost. And cost-efficiency, resourceconservation and regulatory compliance have become issues foralmost every organization. Turnover among top talent is expectedto increase in 2012; globalization is requiring stronger regional HRcapabilities; and demographic shifts across the world aredramatically affecting availability of qualified people.Yet, all too often, business leaders still wonder aloud why theirorganizations even have HR departments. For their part, manyHR leaders are willing to partner with the business, but given theunique situation of each individual company, they have little inthe way of concrete guidance about how to fulfill that role.

Let me suggest a way to start. Of every action you take as an HRleader, ask this simple question: does it cause friction in thebusiness or does it create flow? Friction is anything that makes itmore difficult for people in critical roles to win with the customer.Flow, on the other hand, is doing everything possible to removebarriers and promote better performance. The question applies tovirtually any company in any business and it will take you fartherdown the road faster than the hazy, abstract injunction to becomea strategic partner. Even in what appear to be routine HRresponsibilities, you can inject the business perspective simply byasking whether what you are doing is going to enhance the flow ofthe business or impede it with friction.Why is it so difficult to inject that business perspective? Becauseas HR leaders we feel ourselves to be near the pinnacle of theorganization. The organization reports to us. It must meet ourdemands for information, documents, numbers.In fact, that’s backwards. We are far removed from the points andpeople that make a difference with customers and a difference tothe business. Our perspective should be that of seeing to it thatthe people at those points can perform as smoothly, productively,and frictionlessly as possible.Think, for example, of your talent strategy. Do you simply managetalent, or do you provide talent solutions that reduce friction andenhance the flow of the business? Often we pride ourselves ontrying to recruit the best talent we can find and consistently andfairly spending our resources and focusing our attention equallyon everyone. But does that really enhance the flow of thebusiness?

To truly be partners to the business we must identify those criticalpoints of the business where the strategy succeeds or fails, andprovide relevant talent solutions. In other words, we must thinkin terms of what Brian E. Becker, Mark A. Huselid, and Richard W.Beatty call “

the differentiated workforce,” in their book of thesame name. That means managing talent as a portfolio ofinvestments, some of which will pay a much higher return thanothers. Instead of spending an equal amount of time, attentionand resources on everyone equally, you make disproportionateinvestments in the most critical roles and critical people — notjust in terms of compensation, but in terms of development,opportunities, retention, engagement, and human capitalplanning. All jobs in a business unit are important, but not all arestrategic and have maximum impact on the economic value of thebusiness.Many business units spend time each year identifying talent andcompetency needs, but few get real about it by developing plansaround winning in their critical talent spaces. Let’s say you have,in your opinion, spent the appropriate amount of time identifyingyour strategic talent needs — the difference-making roles. Thenask yourself how much time you and your HR team and lineleaders spend focusing on solutions for acquiring, developing,engaging and retaining the talent to fill those needs? Or do youhave the “equality” mentality — devoting the same amount ofattention to everyone? It’s shocking how many HR leaders saythat their business has a strategic priority such as acceleratinggrowth in emerging markets, but they and their teams spend littletime in emerging markets. Does your investment of time andresources match your business strategy? If not, you are creatingfriction in the business that diminishes strategic impact.
