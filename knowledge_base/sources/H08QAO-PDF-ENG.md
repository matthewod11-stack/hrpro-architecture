In many organizations, managers make the ﬁrst call about which

candidates to bring in for an interview, and then later which applicant

gets the job. While their expertise is crucial to selecting the right person,

the process can be laborious and time-consuming as they must take a

step away from their core activities to focus on reviewing applications

and narrowing candidate pools. But what if the responsibility for

picking ﬁrst-round interviewees was transferred to HR? Does it have

an impact on who gets hired? Our research, published in Administrative

Science Quarterly, examines this scenario.

When a leading multinational technology company (for conﬁdentiality

reasons we’ll refer to it as Alpha) transferred the task of shortlisting

candidates from line managers to HR departments, more women were

hired—even though the company had no particular aims to improve

## gender diversity among its male-dominated workforce.

Why? It turns out that HR professionals and managers approached

the task of shortlisting much diﬀerently—which had ripple eﬀects into

who ended up ﬁlling a role. Our ﬁndings have major implications for

companies looking for a simple way to reduce some of the inadvertent

biases that can creep into the selection process.

# The Research

In 2018, Alpha introduced a change to its hiring process. In the old

system HR forwarded all applications to a line manager, who narrowed

down the pool and conducted interviews. In the new process, managers

would provide the job requirements to HR, then let HR select an initial

seven applicants for the manager to interview (managers retained the

ﬁnal hiring decision). The company made the switch for one reason: to

reduce unnecessary delays in the hiring process that might turn oﬀ top

# candidates.

Alpha did not make the change in the hiring process all at once. Instead,

they introduced it across their worldwide subsidiary locations in seven

phases, which gave us the unique opportunity to compare results before

# and after changes to the hiring process.

Analyzing data from 8,750 external hires over two years and across more

than 60 country locations, we found that more women (a noticeable 9.2

percent increase) were hired into the company when the shortlisting

was done by HR professionals.

We also found that this eﬀect was the most pronounced in countries

that had more-rigid views about which occupations women could work

in, according to the UN’s Gender Social Norms Index.

# Why Did Gender Diversity Increase?

To answer this question, we drew on internal organizational data about

the hired candidates and a dataset about Alpha’s job listings. We also

conducted both a company-wide survey and semi-structured interviews

# with managers and HR professionals.

We found the strongest evidence for the idea that the hiring disparities

had been due in part to time constraints on the company’s line

managers. Time crunches often forced them to rely on subjective data

—including recommendations from colleagues and assumptions about

who best ﬁt a role—to make quick decisions so that they could return

to their work. This likely perpetuated the company’s status quo, which

was predominantly male. The HR department, on the other hand, was

more likely to place greater weight on objective data about candidates

and whether they ﬁt the job description and requirements provided by

# managers.

Surveys also showed that HR employees were more likely to consider

hiring an important part of their job, whereas managers were more

likely to see it as a distraction from their day-to-day work.

Importantly, we also asked line managers how they felt about the

candidates that HR selected and the overall job that they felt HR did in

the new process. Before the intervention, 60% of line managers reported

being happy with HR’s role in hiring. Post-intervention, that number

jumped to 82%.

## Considerations for Organizational Leaders

While we studied the impact of HR shortlisting at one company, our

ﬁndings have implications for any organization seeking to expand

their workforce beyond a dominant demographic group (for example,

hospitals trying to recruit more male nurses).

Our research provides strong evidence that HR professionals—with

their expert knowledge in evaluating candidates and fewer competing

demands in investing time and eﬀort in doing so—can oﬀer more

objective and consistent evaluation, helping to ensure a more equitable

hiring process for applicants.

While it is outside our study in particular, our ﬁndings also have

implications for how AI in hiring might work: training AI to evaluate

applications based on clear and objective data points (years in a

role, level of education, etc.) might help mitigate a reliance on

stereotypes when determining who might best ﬁt a role. However,

simply transferring shortlisting to AI will not automatically prevent

bias. In fact, many AI tools used in hiring have been accused of

perpetuating biases in hiring by using biased data. Without proper

incentives and oversight, decision-makers may blindly follow AI

outputs or organizations might underinvest in training. A smarter

approach is to treat AI as a support tool, guided by well-trained

and properly incentivized HR professionals and managers who can

## supplement AI with their greater capacity for nuance and context.

# Some Caveats

While the intervention we studied proved an eﬀective way to improve

the hiring process for applicants and managers, challenges remain. Our

study does not give any indication about how employees hired under

the old or new hiring process fare in their subsequent organizational

lives—do they feel they ﬁt into the larger culture? We also lack data

on productivity levels and actual (team) performance. Our tests further

do not account for more subtle changes, such as those triggered by the

increased interaction between HR and managers throughout the hiring

process. While our study seems to have implications for improving

diversity, we studied gender only, and can’t speak to how this change

may impact other types of diversity, such as age or race.

. . .

Our ﬁndings suggest that letting HR select a ﬁrst round of candidates

can lead to fairer outcomes—without forfeiting the nuanced knowledge

that line managers possess by allowing them to retain control over the

ﬁnal decision. With a small tweak, companies stand to reap the beneﬁts
