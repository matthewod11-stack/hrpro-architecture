Disruption used to be an exceptional event that hit an unlucky few

companies — think of the likes of Kodak, Polaroid, and Blackberry. But

in today’s complex and uncertain world, as we face challenges ranging

## from climate change to digitization, geopolitics to DEI, organizations

must treat transformation as a core capability to master, as opposed to a

# HBR / Digital Article / 6 Key Levers of a Successful Organizational Transformation

At the same time, leaders must recognize that transformation is fraught

with risk. In 1995, John Kotter found that 70% of organizational

transformations fail, and nearly three decades later, not much has

changed. Our own research, in which we spoke to more than 900 C-suite

managers and more than 1,100 employees who had gone through a

corporate transformation, showed similar results: 67% of leaders told us

they had experienced at least one underperforming transformation in

# the last ﬁve years.

Considering that organizations will spend billions on transformation

initiatives over the next year, a 70% failure rate equates to a signiﬁcant

erosion of value. So, what can leaders do to tilt the odds of success in

their favor? To ﬁnd out, we interviewed 30 leaders of transformations

and surveyed more than 2,000 senior leaders and employees in 23

countries and 16 sectors. Half of our respondents had been involved

in a successful transformation, while the other half had experienced an

# unsuccessful transformation.

So what tactics did the leaders of successful transformations use to

manage the emotional journey? To ﬁnd out, we built a model to predict

the likelihood that an organization will achieve its transformation KPIs

based on the extent to which it exhibited 50 behaviors across 11 areas

of the transformation. This model revealed that behaviors in six of

these areas consistently improved the odds of transformation success.

Organizations that are above average in these areas have a 73% chance

of meeting or exceeding their transformation KPIs, compared to only

a 28% chance for organizations that are below average. Our research

suggests that any organization that can eﬀectively implement these six

levers will maximize their chances of success.

Our research also found that a key diﬀerence in successful

transformations was that leaders embraced their employees’ emotional

journey. Fifty-two percent of respondents involved in successful

transformations said their organization provided the emotional support

they needed during the transformation process “to a signiﬁcant extent”

(as opposed to 27% of respondents who were involved in unsuccessful

# transformations).

Transformations are extremely diﬃcult on a personal level for everyone

involved. In the successes we studied, leaders not only made sure their

teams had the processes, resources, and technology they needed —

they also built the right emotional conditions. These leaders oﬀered

a compelling rationale driving the transformation, and they ensured

employees had the emotional support they needed to execute. This

meant that when the going inevitably got tough, employees felt

appropriately challenged and ultimately energized by the stress.

By contrast, leaders of the unsuccessful transformations didn’t make

the same emotional investment. When their teams hit the inevitable

challenges, negative emotions spiked, and the team entered a

downward spiral. Leaders lost faith and looked to distance themselves

from the project, which led employees to do the same.

# The Six Key Levers of Transformations

So what tactics did the leaders of successful transformations use to

manage the emotional journey? The six levers that maximize the

chances of success, according to our research are:

- 1. Leadership’s own willingness to change

Many people believe that a leader’s job is to look outward and

give others guidance, but our research suggests that to help their

workforce navigate a transformation, leaders need to look inward ﬁrst

and examine their own relationship with change. “If you are not

ready to change yourself, forget about changing your team and your

organization,” as Dr. Patrick Liew, executive chairman at GEX Ventures,

told us.

In our interviews, leaders spoke of working on their own development,

including engaging more with their emotions and becoming

accustomed to the discomfort that accompanies personal growth.

Leaders needed to “look into a mirror,” as one told us, and realize that

they were part of the problem before the shift to a positive trajectory

could take place. They needed to remove their own fear before they

could help their employees get through this change.

“As someone who was tasked to lead this [transformation], if I’m being

honest with you, it was pretty unsettling at the start, because I think by

nature most of us like to know the path we’re going on,” as one COO

from the automative industry told us. And a senior vice president in

the global business services industry described needing to become more

vulnerable and honest on their path to self-discovery: “I think I became

even more aware of myself, who I am.”

- 2. A shared vision of success

Creating a uniﬁed vision of future success is another all-important

foundation point of a transformation. In our research, 50% of

respondents involved in successful transformations said the vision

energized and inspired them to go the extra mile to a signiﬁcant extent

(as compared 29% of respondents in low-performing transformations).

Employees must understand the urgent need to disrupt the status quo.

A compelling “why” can help them navigate the inevitable challenges

that will arise during a transformation program. Many of the workers

who took our survey said that they “wanted” and “needed” the vision

to be communicated clearly. When leaders share a clear vision, the

workforce is more likely to get on board. But if people don’t understand

the vision or need for transformation, success is hard to achieve.

“It’s not about me telling people ‘This is what’s going to happen,’” as a

managing director in the medical device industry told us. “It’s about me

creating this shared sense of ownership…and then [coaching] my team

on what they need to achieve. We very consciously want our teams to

really buy into this is how we, as a collective, want to work.”

- 3. A culture of trust and psychological safety Trust and care from leaders can make a diﬃcult transformation more emotionally manageable. At the most basic human level, we all know

what it feels like to be seen, listened to, and heard by another person.

It can validate our eﬀort, motivate us to work harder, and help assuage

emotions like doubt, fear, anger, and sadness. Workers in our study

shared that they wanted leaders who were patient and who also had, in

## the words of one employee, a “calm and teachable spirit.”

## In a workplace with a high degree of psychological safety, employees

feel conﬁdent that they can share their honest opinions and concerns

without fear of retribution. When trust and psychological safety are missing, it’s diﬃcult to persuade your workforce to make necessary

changes. For example, one senior leader told us that employees at their

company were extremely fearful of the transformation and didn’t feel

that they could speak up about the problems they saw. Not surprisingly,

the transformation did not go well.

- 4. A process that balances execution and exploration

Transformations obviously need disciplined project management to

drive the program forward. But our research showed that leaders of

successful transformations created processes that balanced the need

to execute with giving employees the freedom to explore, express

creativity, and let new ideas emerge. This empowers the workforce to

identify solutions or opportunities that better meet the long-term goals

“Innovation requires the right people and processes,” said one

respondent to our anonymous survey. “Both are critical to encourage

# collaboration and experimentation.”

We also found that creating space for small failures can ultimately

lead to big success, whereas fear of any failure can lead to missed

opportunities. Forty-eight percent of our respondents involved in

successful transformations said the process was designed so that

failed experimentation would not negatively impact their career

or compensation to a signiﬁcant extent. By contrast, only 29% of

respondents in unsuccessful transformations said the same.

- 5. A recognition that technology carries its own emotional journey

The leaders in our study ranked technology as the biggest challenge

they faced in their transformation eﬀorts. There are a lot of emotions

to manage when new systems or technology are introduced, from stress

over how it works to fear about whether it will cause job loss or slow

# down the system.

In the underperforming transformations we studied, we saw the

narrative shift away from the vision to focus on the technology

itself. Whereas in the successful transformations, leaders ensured

that technology was seen as the means to achieve the strategic

vision. Furthermore, they prioritized quick implementations of new

technology — focusing on a minimum viable product rather than

perfect implementation. Lastly, they invested resources into skill

development to ensure the workforce was ready to create value using

# the new technology.

“There were kickoﬀ sessions with our senior managers to bring them in

at the beginning of the process,” a vice president of a company in the

media/advertising industry explained. “These sessions aimed to show

them that what was being built was something that they had helped

design, rather than something that was presented to them as a fait

accompli…This minimized the numbers of active detractors.”

- 6. A shared sense of ownership over the outcome

In the successful transformations we studied, leaders and employees

worked together to co-create an environment where everyone felt a

shared sense of ownership over the transformation vision and outcome.

A prime example of this is many companies’ rapid shift to virtual and

remote working during the pandemic. Because of the speed and urgency

of the change, leaders needed to collaborate closely with the workforce

to create new ways of working and be much more responsive to their

views on what was or wasn’t going well. This mass co-creation helped

build a sense of pride and shared ownership across both leadership and

# the workforce.

“In a transformation, things pop up all the time,” as Christiane Wijsen,

head of corporate strategy at Boehringer Ingelheim, told us. “When you

have a movement around you, supporters will buﬀer it and tweak it each

time. When you don’t have this movement, then you’re alone.”

- • •

To conclude, it’s worth reiterating that all transformations are tough.

Even during successful programs, there will come a time where people start to feel stressed. The skill at this diﬃcult stage is being able

to energize your workforce and turn that heightened pressure into

something productive, as opposed to letting the transformation spiral

## downward into pessimism and underperformance.

What we saw throughout our research is that leaders who are

truly working with their employees are much more successful. They

acknowledge and manage emotions, rather than pushing them aside or

ignoring them. The best leaders create vision across the organization

and a safe environment to work together and listen to each other.

“You’ve got to be very, very respectful of people at a working level,”

## as Thomas Sebastian, CEO of London Market Joint Venture at DXC

Technology, told us. “You’ve got to understand the emotional side

and consider a completely diﬀerent perspective, such as how is this

transformation going to make their life easier.”

Success begets success. Once a workforce has undergone a successful

transformation, they will be ready to go again. And given the pace of

change in the world, organizations have got to be ready to go again.
