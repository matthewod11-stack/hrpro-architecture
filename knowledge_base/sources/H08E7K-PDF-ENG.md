Whether you want to advance in leadership or stay relevant where you

are, continuous learning is critical to success. After all, if you’re not

evolving in this ever-changing world, you may not only get left behind

the competition — you could ﬁnd that your current skills aren’t even

needed anymore.

At the same time, you might be trying to stay above water with no

energy to devote to more training. If so, you’re not alone. A 2024 study

showed that more than half of workers feel “used up” at the end of the

day. This means that not only are they depleted from meeting daily

expectations, they have limited stamina to pursue activities that truly

# matter for future growth.

As an executive coach to many talented leaders who feel constantly

overwhelmed, I’ve observed that for them, not meeting their highest

potential is just as mentally burdensome as working overtime is

physically taxing. But a learning journey that takes them out of their

comfort zone, provides meaning based on their values, and is optimized

for their style of retention is just the thing that reinvigorates them.

Consider these ﬁve strategies to ensure you’re continuously learning

even when you’re feeling depleted or overwhelmed.

## Challenge beliefs about your learning capacity.

I once worked with a senior executive leading a new team spread out

around the world. He was exhausted from all the travel required to

eﬀectively engage them. While he was excited about this prestigious

leadership role, self-doubt creeped in, and a critical inner voice led

him to question his leadership capabilities under these conditions. By

observing this inner critic from afar, he realized he was holding onto a

ﬁxed belief that he couldn’t “learn to ﬂy the plane while it was already

ﬂying.”

When you’re feeling depleted, you may start to identify so much with

the fatigue that you forget your agency over your thoughts and beliefs.

In this condition, every exclamation of “I’m so tired,” teaches your mind

to believe that it’s probably impossible to learn anything when you’re

exhausted. Instead try observing your fatigue without judgment or a

desire to get rid of it and get curious about what’s possible even with

such constraints. Making space for the fatigue enables a more mindful

response and one from which you can creatively challenge unhelpful

beliefs you’ve been holding onto while in that state.

When the senior executive I worked with challenged his assumptions,

he realized he could in fact, lead with conviction, while also learning

how to keep improving. Soon his energy shifted and he was eager to

make time for learning, reading articles on leading global teams and

watching videos on improving executive presence for his upcoming site

# visits.

Start with topics that solve urgent problems.

Similar to the way money grows faster by compounding interest on

an existing balance, your motivation to learn will accelerate when you

build on what you already know and do. Instead of laboring through

subjects that don’t feel urgent or pertinent to you, begin with topics that

relate to existing challenges and expand on your current knowledge to

# gather momentum fast.

One of my coaching clients had been feeling overwhelmed at work for

much of the last year. In a recent 360 assessment, he found that others

perceived him as “slow to make decisions.” Initially resistant to the

feedback, he decided to learn from it and had a notable insight: that his

avoidance of being decisive led to work piling up, which was probably

why he was always feeling so overwhelmed.

Suddenly learning about how to make better decisions seemed useful,

## attractive, and perhaps a way out from under his heavy workload. After

consuming various resources on the topic, he decided to teach his peers

some of the methods he learned as a way of making it stick. Coaching

them enabled him to improve his mastery of the topic and boosted

his conﬁdence in applying it. He was also able to demonstrate positive

shifts in how others perceived his work style.

# Don’t limit yourself to formal programs.

When professionals think of learning on the job, many immediately

think of pursuing a graduate degree or a certiﬁcate at a renowned

university as the best plan of action. While these programs promise

## certain valuable beneﬁts through their academic rigor and social

proof, they can also be expensive, unnecessarily exclusive, and time-

# consuming.

As you decide how to shape your learning journey, remember that

formal programs are just one of many avenues and often may be too

theoretical or tedious, making them less useful for certain on-the-job

## topics than methods like peer-to-peer learning, mentorship, or 360

# feedback.

I once coached a newly promoted VP of human resources who had very

little free time but wanted to build her ﬁnancial acumen to increase her

strategic value and counsel to the business. She didn’t want to enroll in

MBA-level courses and instead decided to ask her peer on the leadership

team, the CFO, if she could learn from him. They arranged monthly

one-on-one meetings during which he would explain the key aspects of

their P&L reviews, and she would present her interpretation to get his

# feedback.

This approach not only helped her quickly understand the nuances of

the company’s ﬁnances while burdened with an otherwise exhausting

schedule, but it also cultivated a valuable relationship with the CFO

and his team which had never existed before across their functions. Her

credibility as a business-oriented HR leader soared and, in the process,

she was also able to help the CFO better understand the people strategy

which was largely outside of his expertise.

## Make an emotional connection to learning.

Another way to learn with ease is by pursuing experiences that align

## with your deep-seated values rather than the ﬂeeting expectations

of others. When it is intrinsically motivating, continuous learning

becomes a desirable part of your life’s routine, rather than another

obligatory item on your to-do list. To take it a step further, develop

an emotional context around the learning, and the work involved will

become a source of inspiration instead of an unwelcome burden.

I worked with an executive who was always being recommended for

advanced training programs, leadership conferences, and speaking

opportunities as her managers viewed her as someone who could rise

up the ranks, perhaps even to CEO someday. She was ﬂattered by their

sponsorship but also found these activities onerous on top of her job.

She began to wonder whether she even wanted to advance.

To get clearer on what she should do, this executive ﬁrst put aside

what others wanted for her and reﬂected on her own values, which

included a love of solving big problems in her industry and an ambition

to drive change, but also a desire to be more present with her family.

She concluded that moving up the ladder might mean less time with her

family, but also more agency over decisions and where to spend time

than staying in a junior role. And on an emotional level, she felt that

if she could be successful in honoring all of her values across family

and work, it would show her daughter what was possible for women

in business. It was from this emotional context that she reframed the

learning opportunities from things others expected her to enjoy to

experiences she wanted to intentionally leverage for her aspirations.

# Work with your brain, not against it.

Once you are emotionally invested in learning new skills, you’ll often

ﬁnd your second wind to push through the fatigue and keep absorbing

the new information. But what good is the content if your brain

struggles to retain it?

Another important way to make learning eﬀective while depleted

is to design an approach that follows your brain’s preferences

## for retention. In the late-nineteenth century, German psychologist

Hermann Ebbinghaus described the “forgetting curve” to explain how

fast people forget things they’ve learned. While factors like rest and

relative complexity of the topic aﬀect how well we retain information,

we still tend to forget things rapidly. Within a day, you only remember

half of what was presented, and after a week, only about 10% of it,

making any lasting learning journey a literal ﬁght against time for your

# brain.

Fortunately, through techniques like spaced repetition and testing

recall, you can improve retention for higher learning stickiness. Let’s

say you’ve come across some valuable but complex frameworks to

improve business results and want to conﬁdently present them in

ways that improve buy-in from other company divisions. To avoid

reading and forgetting the content, you can set aside a half hour every

morning and evening to review in parts, spacing out and repeating your

exposure. Then test yourself from memory on the frameworks until they

become second nature to you.

To make your brain even more receptive, keep adding higher, original

learning to the content you’re absorbing. Research shows that the

## greater degree of original content, the slower the rate of forgetting.

You can consider developing more context around the frameworks

you memorized, such as learning the stories of companies where

they were used, or interviewing colleagues about the frameworks to

invite new perspectives related to them. Combining all these methods

your daily workload makes it hard to stay consistent. By using these
