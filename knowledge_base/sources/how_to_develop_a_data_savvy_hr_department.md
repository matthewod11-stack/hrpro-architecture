Understanding your current levels of HR analytics expertiseOur research for the book

The Power of People showed that HRprofessionals can be broadly categorized into one of three groupswith respect to their current analytical capability:

Analytically Savvy — These are HR professionals who areformally trained in analytics techniques and are adept atworking with data and interpreting analyses.

Analytically Willing — These people are open-minded aboutanalytics and are ready, able, and willing to learn, though theylack formal training in data analysis.

Analytically Resistant — This group tends to be skeptical anddismissive of the value of a data-based approach, preferringinstead to rely on intuition.

You can gauge the levels of comfort with analytics in HR bychecking for specific skills when hiring, and monitoringengagement with learning opportunities. Once you understandthe different levels of analytical comfort and expertise that existwithin your HR team, you can determine how to hire and developeach type of HR professional.

Hiring for analytical capabilityRoles that require producing analytical information demandanalytically-savvy workers, while roles that involve interpretingand working with analytical information require analytically-willing workers.

You can assess whether workers are analytically savvy byexamining formal qualiﬁcations, and by

administering well-

designed psychometric tests that measure general mental

ability. General mental ability is a good predictor ofperformance because high scores indicate workers can acquirejob-related knowledge more quickly. You should also considerless traditional evidence of learning beyond formal education,such as massive open online courses (MOOCs) provided bycompanies such as

# Coursera or

# edX.

For analytically-willing workers, consider

# personality tests that

measure “investment” traits like openness-to-experience.Investment traits describe the tendency to engage in complexthinking. Because analytical information can be complex,comfort with complexity enhances the chance that theanalytically willing will be able to extract meaning fromanalytical information.Developing analytical capabilityThe key to developing capability among existing workers is toprovide engaging learning opportunities to workers at all levels ofexpertise:

Analytically savvy. Keep these workers’ skills up-to-date byproviding opportunities for advanced training; encourageparticipation in meet-ups, online user groups and forums; andsupport participation in professional groups and conferences.Assign them responsibility for analytics evangelism andreinforce this in performance objectives. Each evangelistshould have an objective of mentoring one colleague who is lessanalytically capable. If you do not have analytically-savvypeople in your team, hiring a few will help to establish ananalytical culture.

Analytically willing. A good starting point for these employeesis to provide foundational education on HR analytics. This canbe achieved by requiring all HR staﬀ to complete an onlinecourse about the basics of workforce analytics, such as

Wharton’s Coursera HR Analytics Module, which can becompleted in just four weeks with a commitment of one to twohours per week. The analytically willing should then put theirlearning into practice by applying the techniques to their day-to-day work. These expectations can be incorporated as explicitgoals in performance management systems.

Analytically resistant. For these employees, focus on howanalytics can enhance their personal eﬀectiveness. Pair themwith analytically-savvy colleagues to use data and analytics tosolve a problem they are struggling with. If these opportunitiesare declined, it might be necessary to discuss why they arereluctant or what they are struggling with. The ultimate goal isnot necessarily to transform the analytically resistant into dataexperts, but to have them see the value in analytics and, ideally,embrace it as a path to success.

Personalize learning, and deliver it at scaleAnalytically-related learning opportunities for all HRprofessionals can be managed with a Netflix-style, online learningsystem, such as IBM’s

Your Learning platform. With platforms likeYour Learning, you can curate content targeted at each level ofcomfort with analytics. HR departments can set learning goals forworkers to suggest how many hours of learning they’re expectedto complete in a given period. A good benchmark for this wouldbe 60 hours per year, the average at IBM. Analytical skills shouldalso be designated “hot skills” for HR professionals, and as peopleacquire more of these skills, their compensation should beincreased to reflect their enhanced capabilities.It is important to pay close attention to the feedback learnersprovide and modify the content based on what’s most effective.For instance, learners can be encouraged to tag content, and tagsshould be visible to content designers and other learners. Thisenables social learning where new course participants learn frompast participants’ experiences, and allows designers to improvethe content as they go. By monitoring and rewarding learnerprogress, firms can recompose the skills of their workforce. Agood way to reward progress is via digital credentialing, with asystem like

Credly, that allows workers to share their learningsuccess as badges on social platforms such as LinkedIn.A more data-savvy HR function is entirely achievable. Byunderstanding the levels of analytics capability in your HR teamtoday, hiring for critical skills to fill gaps, and providing ongoing,targeted and engaging learning opportunities, organizations willbe well positioned to realize the promise of analytics in HR.
