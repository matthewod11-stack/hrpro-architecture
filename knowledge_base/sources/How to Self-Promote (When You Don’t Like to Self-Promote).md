## How to Self-Promote (When You Don’t Like to Self-Promote)

To rise through the ranks, you must be proactive and build thebusiness case for your own career progression. In other words,you must get comfortable with self-promotion.Self-promotion refers to communicating your interests, abilities,or achievements to others with the goal of enhancing yourprofessional reputation (or your personal brand), gainingvisibility, and improving your career prospects. Even though it’ssometimes perceived as a

taboo, self-promotion is a

can help you move up the ladder.As a marketing executive with more than 20 years in the field, I’vespent the majority of my career promoting brands into well-known household names. In my work as an executive coach, Icombine the insights I’ve gathered through proven marketingprinciples with hands-on experience to position business leadersat every stage of their careers for success.If you’re new to the workforce, and struggling with the idea of self-promotion, here’s how to overcome your hesitations and startbuilding this crucial skill.1. Understand Why Self-Promotion Doesn’t Come Easyto YouBefore you can improve, you need to reflect on why self-promotion doesn’t come naturally to you. Common reasonsamong the leaders I work with include:You think your work will speak for itself. Your competence inyour work has gotten you this far, leading to successful results and

recognition. However, as you move up the ladder and become aleader or develop as a manager, relying on past accomplishmentsto be recognized and rewarded is a risky approach. In this nextstage of your career, you can expect to face greater competition.Speaking on your behalf now equates to leadership, as it reflectsyour ability to advocate for yourself, for the business, for theorganization, and potentially for your team members in thefuture.You think that self-promotion is bra¾ing. No one wants to be theperson with a bullhorn yelling “Me, me, me.” But we all know thatsuccess is both associated with competence and likability.Fostering

positive and strong relationships with others is crucialin building a strong team. Try reframing self-promotion as ameans of owning and communicating your achievements. Bydoing so, you can open up new opportunities that will allow youto make a greater impact on yourself, your team, and theorganization.You feel inauthentic asking others for support. Until now, maybeyou’ve relied on your own abilities and hard work alone toadvance. You have accumulated the necessary knowledge,abilities, and skills needed to succeed. As you grow in your career,though, individual effort alone is usually not enough. You needpeople in your corner that can vouch for you and help you getthere. You

need a network who believes in you — even when youthink you don’t.You don’t know how. Maybe no one ever told you how to promoteyourself and your achievements. On the contrary, you were toldno one likes a show-off. It’s in poor taste, and it may come off asnarcissistic or egotistical. Yet self-promotion likely requires a lotof the same skills and capabilities you already have and alreadyleverage to grow and promote your work or your team.2. Determine Your Value Proposition

What do you want to be known for? Building a business case forcareer advancement requires you to have a clear understanding ofyour current situation, goals, strengths, and areas forimprovement. It also demands a thorough analysis of thebusiness and its needs.Perform a personal leadership SWOT analysis. The process ofconducting a self-assessment or personal SWOT (strengths,weaknesses, opportunities, and threats) analysis will elevate yourself-awareness. It will help you identify your strengths,accomplishments, and unique value proposition, which is thevalue you bring that sets you apart from your peers. It will alsohelp you identify any skills or experiences that you lack.Here are some reflection questions to start this process:Strengths:

What experiences, achievements, and expertise diﬀerentiateme from others?

What qualities, skills, and credentials do I bring to the table?

What network of supporters do I have (i.e., sponsors, mentors,advocates)?Weaknesses:

What are the areas of improvement that may hinder my careerprogression? What feedback have I received in performancereviews?

How can I address these weaknesses (i.e., gaps in myqualiﬁcations or experiences) and acquire the skills andknowledge to reach my career goals?

# Opportunities:

What opportunities exist within my organization or industry forcareer growth (i.e., professional associations, nonproﬁtvolunteering positions, thought leadership)?

Are there any emerging trends, technologies (i.e., AI, designthinking, etc.), or knowledge/capabilities that I can leverage topropel my career forward?

Are there any mentorship or coaching programs available thatcan support my career development?Threats:

Are there any potential obstacles or challenges that mayimpede my career progression?

Are there any changes in the company structure (i.e.,promotion/hiring freeze, layoﬀs, ﬂat structure, etc) that couldimpact my career trajectory?

Are there any external factors (i.e., recessions, industryconsolidation or automation) that could aﬀect my careerprospects?By identifying the skills and experiences critical for the business’ssuccess, you can determine which career advancementopportunities best align with your interests.Do a competitive assessment. Before you move forward and startadvocating for your career progression, the next step is to do acompetitive assessment. The purpose of this is to evaluate how todifferentiate yourself from your peers within the organization. Tostart, consider the following:

Who are your peers to begin with? Look for individuals whoare in similar roles, or career paths as yours. For example, thesemay be peers in your same role who have great reputations orpeers who have already achieved the career progression youaspire to.

What makes these people successful? Try to understandwhat has impacted their career trajectory (i.e. prior experience,work achievements, professional or alumni associations,professional hobbies, broad network, etc). You can evenleverage public sources, like their LinkedIn proﬁles, personalwebsites, social media, etc. The goal is to gain insights abouthow you can diﬀerentiate yourself from them and stand outwhile also gaining inspiration around how you can continue togrow.

For example, if one of your peers has an excellent LinkedInproﬁle with professional recommendations and regularlypublishes thought leadership posts, perhaps mirroring theireﬀorts will better position you for success.

Or perhaps they have a strong network internally andregularly get coﬀee with the top stakeholders and inﬂuencersat your company. Consider introducing yourself to thosepower players, or asking them to lunch and learning moreabout their work. This may help you gain more inﬂuencedown the line.

What skills, capabilities and qualiﬁcations do your peershave? Even after college or graduate school, we must continueto invest in our professional growth. Have they gainedcompetencies, knowledge or expertise relevant for progression?Have they used available resources that you may have

What career milestones and achievements help them standout? Analyzing their career path (i.e., jobs, promotions,functions, titles, etc.) and top accomplishments, awards, orrecognitions can provide insights into what worked for them.

What is their leadership style? Their presentation style? Howdo they behave in meetings? What is said about them whenthey are not in the room?After doing this assessment, you will have a better understandingof how to position yourself to your manager and other decision-makers in your organization. It will also help you further identifyyour areas of improvement.As you go through these steps, remember not to fall into the trapof comparing yourself to your peers or feel discouraged if somehave a stronger professional profile. Everyone has a differentjourney and starting point. The goal is to leverage thisinformation as insights and data about what works. I encourageyou to even think about ways to collaborate and network withyour peers. After all, they could be part of the next generation ofindustry leaders.Together, the SWOT analysis and the competitive assessment willallow to increase your skills and qualifications, align them withthe needs of the business, and seek opportunities that match yourgreatest strengths.Articulate your current unique value proposition. Use theinformation you’ve gathered in the step above to draft yourunique value proposition. In marketing, a value proposition is a

You want them to knowyou, what you’ve done, and how your work has contributed totheir success or the success of their team. You want them to beactive participants and advocates in your campaign for careerprogression.When you reach out, communicate in a clear and concisemessage. Tell them who you are and what you have done for theorganization (your value proposition), and what your futurecareer aspirations and goals are (your career plan).
