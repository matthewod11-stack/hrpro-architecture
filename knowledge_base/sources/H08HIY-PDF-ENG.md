Companies are increasingly strategizing on how to reduce all kinds

of bias in the workplace, including those related to disabled people.

Despite empirical evidence to the contrary, perceptions remain that

disabled employees are less competent, less productive, require more

supervision, and are more expensive and more dependent, which

## results in lower levels of both employment and promotion.

# HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Stigma Disabled People Face During Negotiations

However, disabilities are not a single entity, nor is the bias

uniform across people or situations. For example, research suggests

that disabilities categorized as “invisible” (including psychological

## and neurological) encounter more stigma than “visible” disabilities

(such as amputations and paralysis). Although there has been a

growing awareness and conscious eﬀort to destigmatize mental

health disabilities in recent years, tremendous bias still exists with

consequences for employment, income, and levels of stress. In addition,

research suggests that disabled women face even harsher penalties.

While disability studies often focus on bias at the level of employment

## or promotion decisions, the lived experiences of disabled employees

also involve biases on the job. One context in which this can unfold

is in professional negotiations. The prototypical image of a successful

negotiator is someone who is competent, conﬁdent, and in control —

characteristics that are not always readily applied to disabled people.

Are disabled people more stigmatized in an intense job task, such as

a potentially contentious, price-based negotiation? If so, is this stigma

more pronounced for women and/or those with an invisible disability?

To answer these questions, in partnership with the Rutgers Center

for Women in Business, we had more than 2,000 people complete an

online experiment. Participants were ﬁrst provided with background

information about a ﬁctitious company they supposedly worked for and

about a speciﬁc employee named Alex. An image of Alex was provided,

and about half of our participants saw an image of a man, while the

other half saw one of a woman.

Participants were told that they would read a partial transcript of a

negotiation and then be asked to provide their opinion about Alex,

described as a colleague who had been on the job for about a year and

was being asked to lead an important negotiation for the ﬁrst time about

the potential acquisition of a manufacturing plant. Alex was said to

be “a little nervous” but felt “ready for this challenge.” The transcript

showed Alex asking for a break before the negotiation even started.

The experiment varied the presentation of Alex, with either:

- No disability

- A visible disability, seated in a wheelchair, which was described as due

# to a spinal cord injury

- An invisible disability, described as episodic epilepsy

- An invisible disability, described as bipolar disorder

In the three disability versions, Alex also requested that the negotiation

occur over Zoom to accommodate the disability.

The ﬁrst oﬀer made by Alex in the negotiation was also varied. In

some instances, Alex oﬀered honest information about the valuation

of the property. In other instances, they misrepresented the valuation

to potentially get a better deal — a condition we set up so we could

understand whether a disabled negotiator (of either gender) would be

penalized further for this tactic.

After reading the transcript of the negotiation and learning of its

successful outcome, participants were asked to rate Alex on a series

of items related to integrity (which included trustworthiness, warmth,

## conﬁdence, morality, negotiation ethics, and perspective-taking) and

negotiation competence. Participants were also asked for their overall

# impressions of Alex.

The key question in this study was how negotiators with speciﬁc

disabilities might be evaluated diﬀerently compared to an employee

## with no disability, a diﬀerent disability, or gender. Indeed, diﬀerences

# arose.

Somewhat surprisingly, participants who saw Alex as male and seated in

a wheelchair rated him as having more integrity and more negotiation

competence than any of the other versions. This character was

perceived to be more warm, likable, and competent than others, results

## that contrast with previous research about disability perception, which

has shown that while disabled people are often considered to be warmer

and more likable, they may be considered less competent than others.

Interestingly, this eﬀect disappeared when Alex was a woman, where

the wheelchair did not seem to inspire the same bump in positive

perceptions. It’s possible that the stereotype of a man in a wheelchair as

strong and able to overcome obstacles was activated for participants. We

saw comments describing the male Alex as “conscientious,” “capable,”

“eﬀective,” and “competent.” By contrast, when Alex was a woman in

a wheelchair, the comments described her as “nervous,” “soft,” and “in

# over her head.”

Another gender diﬀerence emerged when examining reactions to the

version of Alex who described living with bipolar disorder. While

the man with bipolar disorder was perceived as having less integrity,

the woman with bipolar disorder was perceived as not only lower

in integrity but also as less competent. Neither the male nor female

version of Alex with epilepsy was perceived as having an integrity

deﬁcit, indicating a stronger reaction to a mental health disability than

# to another invisible disability.

Indeed, we found that gender stereotypes may be inﬂuencing

## perceptions of employee capability, even when their actual behaviors

are identical. When the Alex character did not employ any negotiation

tactic at all but instead chose to present honest information about the

## valuation of the property, both the man and the woman with bipolar

disorder were seen as having less integrity and lower competence

in negotiations than a person engaging in the same behaviors but

with a diﬀerent disability. When Alex was a man and used strategic

misrepresentation about the property’s value, participants seemed to

have been reassured that he was up to the task. Ratings of integrity rose,

while they were (relatively speaking) even lower for the woman.

A woman with a mental health disability seems to be perceived as a

greater risk on some level (participants described her as “awkward,”

“odd,” and “stupid,” with one person going so far as to say they would be

“wary of her”). Even a successful negotiation outcome didn’t reassure

## our participants of her value as a negotiator.

Further gender bias appeared in the responses. Many of the negative

## comments about the woman character with an invisible disability

seemed harsh and gender-speciﬁc, such as “She’s dumb. Obviously

poorly trained, or has no idea what she’s doing” or “THIS WOMAN IS

## HORRIBLE AT THE OPENING BID, LETS [sic] SEE WHERE THIS TRAIN

WRECK GOES” or “…that’s the bimbo’s initial oﬀer??? Give me a break,

how did she get this job?” There were no comparable comments about

the same character engaging in the same behaviors when Alex was a

# man.

Overall, these results speak to the extra burden of discrimination

faced by those with mental health disabilities, especially for women

who seem to face the “double bind” of the intersection of stigmatized

categories. Research into the bias faced by those with mental health

disabilities is nascent but growing, and companies are increasingly

attuned to supporting the inclusion of all individuals. Some studies

have begun to explore ways to lessen this bias, such as through speciﬁc,

## heartfelt words of inclusion in company policy statements, which may

improve the hiring process for those with mental health disabilities

# speciﬁcally.

Even when disabled employees demonstrate the same skills and

behaviors as their nondisabled peers, they may still be subjected to

## biased judgments of their performance across job categories and tasks.

For managers, the key takeaway is not to acknowledge what they likely

already know — that bias exists and lurks in the workplace — but to

confront it head-on to avoid missing out on the value that disabled

employees of all genders bring to the table. In practical terms, this

# means:

- 1. Reinforcing learning opportunities beyond one-off anti-bias sessions

While broad diversity trainings may be informative for all employees,

research suggests they don’t seem to change behavior. More eﬀective

eﬀorts include a combination of clear leadership buy-in and qualiﬁed

external trainers who create space for employees to learn, opportunities

to engage in perspective-taking, and a pathway for employees to track

# their progress over time.

- 2. Improving performance evaluation systems to reduce bias

Classic work on “management by objectives” has long endorsed goal

setting as a mechanism for creating transparency and equity in

evaluation processes. Establishing clear targets as standards for the end

products can help reduce bias across contexts.

While traditional (and often biased) performance appraisal systems look

backward, this approach shifts to a forward-looking planning process

in which both managers and employees participate in and agree on

objectives (which can include both outcomes and activities), and how

to measure them. Tools that can help include creating eﬀective rubrics

before work has been performed, creating standardized templates for

reviews and write-ups, having calibration sessions across managers, and

using a management style that includes regular open-ended questions

about how support can be oﬀered.

- 3. Adopting disability inclusion, along with sponsorship, at all levels

Having disabled employees in leadership positions — and in the

leadership pipeline — generates a sense of belonging and brings voice to

critical policy decisions. Visibility in leadership matters for disability

as for all other identities. Beyond the symbolic and the immediate

sense of belonging, the ability to bring voice to decision-making roles

# encourages more inclusivity.

## In addition, formal programs around sponsorship, mentorship, and

allyship can help companies navigate bias-prone situations so that

each employee is represented and valued for their true capabilities.

Mentors need to commit to exposing protégées to high-impact projects,

increasing their visibility, and lending their own names to promote a

## positive reception of the work and the person.

- 4. Conducting regular inventories of workplace practices

To ensure that inclusion eﬀorts are sustainable and frequently

improved upon, managers need to know where the pain points are

and what might help resolve them — especially for issues that might

otherwise ﬂy under the radar, such as bias against a mental health

## disability, or the intersection of multiple stigmatized identities.

Resources are available for gathering this type of information, such as

the “Disability Inclusion Blueprint” (a toolkit for companies to curate

questions for an internal audit), or suggestions for tracking the metrics

relevant to success (selection, retention, promotion, pay, representation,

etc.). Additionally, employee resource groups can be a valuable source

## of not only support but also information about the experiences of

# employees.

These actions are a good starting point to prevent underestimating the

contributions of disabled people and to protect companies from the

legal and reputational risks associated with bias. Companies that opt to

lose out on this talent pool do so at their own risk, foregoing the chance

to improve their collaborative culture, lower absenteeism and attrition

rates, create better relationships with stakeholders, and enhance their

# external reputation.
