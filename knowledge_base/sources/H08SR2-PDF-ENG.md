Connecting with colleagues outside of work can be a tricky endeavor,

especially for leaders. On the one hand, it can be a swift means of

creating more personalized relationships and stronger bonds: Studies

show that connecting outside of work can help leaders and employees

thrive in their work and improve team performance. On the other hand,

leaders (rightly!) see that blurring the lines between work and non-work

boundaries poses real risks. In the wrong setting, these encounters can

## lead to uncomfortable interactions that tarnish work relationships or

potentially jeopardize a professional image that’s taken years to build.

As researchers, we’ve spent years exploring whether and how this type

of boundary blurring can be a worthwhile risk to take. We found a key

factor that determines the outcome of these interactions is where these

connections happen.

The results of our multi-year study interviewing organizational leaders

and employees across a wide range of professions in the U.S. and Europe

revealed four features of non-work settings that are crucial for reaping

the beneﬁts of boundary-blurring interactions while lessening the risks.

Speciﬁcally, these non-work settings are:

- 1. Flexible: The setting can be used in many ways to meet people’s

needs, such as an all-levels yoga class near the oﬃce or an online

platform that can be used when and where it’s convenient.

- 2. Legitimate: The setting is seen as socially acceptable by others in the

workplace, such as a book club or running club.

- 3. Virtuous: The setting is viewed as inherently good or moral, such as a

# gym, library, or nonproﬁt organization.

- 4. Playful: The setting sparks a sense of fun and playfulness, like a

# festival in a park or an improv class.

The more that non-work spaces have these characteristics, the more

potential they have to function as what we term a “relational holding

environment,” a non-work setting that helps colleagues bond by easing

the unpleasant feelings associated with blurring their work and non-

work lives. Our study found that when leaders and employees connect

in a relational holding environment, it can fuel stronger relationships,

provide better access to information, and create opportunities for

# swifter career advancement.

## A Case Study on Relational Holding Environments

So where can leaders ﬁnd these types of non-work settings? While

a range of contexts can be used as a setting for blurring work and

## non-work boundaries (e.g., an interest-based club, a cohort-based

professional development opportunity) we focus here on Peloton, a virtual exercise platform that we found was particularly eﬀective at

building these deeper extra-work connections.

While we initially began studying Peloton to understand how its

members connected with the company and the Peloton community,

we were surprised to ﬁnd that our study participants consistently used

Peloton “with” their bosses, peers, and even other people in their

profession who they had never met in person. Sometimes this happened

through the use of hashtags that helped users identify others in their

company or profession. Other times a senior leader talked about using

Peloton in a large meeting and invited others to connect, or someone

created the infrastructure (e.g., Slack channel, shared spreadsheet) to

help colleagues who use the platform ﬁnd each other. This unexpected

discovery led us to ask why study participants felt comfortable enough

to blur their work and non-work lives in this setting.

We found that Peloton has those four unique characteristics listed

- It was ﬂexible: People of all ﬁtness levels could be involved remotely

# and around their own schedule.

- It was legitimate: Being a popular platform, it is a widely acceptable

# non-work activity.

- It was virtuous: It signaled a commitment to health and self-

# improvement

- It was playful: There’s a levity built into this kind of exercise produced

by engaging music, playful humor from instructors, and gamiﬁcation

# of the exercises.

These elements made participants feel comfortable to blur their work

and non-work lives with their colleagues. The experiences that they

had with their colleagues on the platform also made them see their relationships diﬀerently. As one leader in our study said:

## In the corporate workplace…maybe mostly for women…there’s this

belief that we always have to be strong and we have to be stoic and

we have to be all of these things. I think when we put on this façade,

we don’t show any of that vulnerability. By riding together, all of a

sudden, you’re extremely vulnerable… I think the humanizing [thing]

is that you really just get to see the true human element of a person

# instead of just the façade.

Viewing their colleagues—and their relationships with these colleagues

—with fresh eyes motivated our research participants to interact

with colleagues in ways that both deepened their existing positive

relationships and forged new ones. For instance, participants described

reaching out to colleagues who they would have previously avoided,

such as leaders who were far more senior to them in the organization.

They also would speak more candidly and openly to these colleagues. This process produced powerful advantages for leaders and their staﬀ,

which we outline below.

## The Benefits of Relational Holding Environments

Making positive connections across status differences

Leadership roles can feel lonely, and it is often diﬃcult for leaders to

ﬁnd the “right” ways to connect with higher-level leaders, peers, and

employees. Interacting in a relational holding environment gave leaders

an opportunity to connect with others and share more of themselves,

in a safe and bounded way. For example, one of our participants,

Lila, shared that using the platform’s “high ﬁve” function to encourage

colleagues who were in the same class at the same time, and ﬁnding

colleagues who had previously taken the class through the platform’s

hashtag feature, gave her the courage to approach someone “hugely

inﬂuential to the company” without imposter syndrome getting in the

# way:

He [was] the kind of person that I would think to myself like, “Oh,

he’s going to question my credentials”…And the way that I was able to

get over or look past some of that feeling of intimidation or a sense of

like imposter syndrome that was really heightened by my interaction

with this person was to kind of bond over our shared Peloton use.

When considering peer leaders, Jackson, who sits in the C-suite of

his company, explained how he found colleagues in other companies

through platform-related social media groups, which enabled him to

## connect outside of the platform in helpful ways:

It’s not like I can look sideways and see somebody in my company

who’s my peer, but [Peloton offers] of people I can reach out to and

say, “I want to get your opinion on something. Tell me what you think

about this.”

When leaders in our study connected with employees in a relational

holding environment, this facilitated feelings of connection and

knowing one another in a new way. Jack, a senior manager, talked about

connecting with one of his direct reports via Peloton:

We’ve been able to talk [about Peloton] during our meetings and just

connect differently…it has been cool to see how I can connect deeper

or differently with people that I already know and already have an

# actual connection with.

As another leader, Sarah, said: “Being the boss, when I’m in the Peloton

group [chat] or I’m in the Facebook group, I just get to be me.”

Furthering career advancement

Leaders in our sample shared that Peloton made interacting with

higher-ups easier and helped them receive mentorship and sponsorship

to advance in their career. Kathryn, a mid-level leader in her company,

explained how the beneﬁts of her boundary-blurring interactions

extended beyond the deepened friendships she now had at work; she

attributed a recent promotion, in part, to gaining advocates for her

career through these interactions. Kathryn described a senior leader

who knew of her “discipline and consistency and engagement” from

their interactions in a relational holding environment and put in a good

word for her when she was up for a promotion. She got the job, and is

## grateful to this senior leader for the help.

Building a culture of support

Our study also shows that employees, especially of large companies,

appreciate the opportunity to feel supported by, and to support,

leaders who often felt out of reach. For example, Margo described her

excitement about riding “with” her CEO: “We would let [a coworker]

know when I had my 500 ride. I was like, ‘Here’s the ride I’m going to

do.’ And to have the CEO do the ride with me was just incredible…We were all in diﬀerent departments, diﬀerent levels of the organization,

but found this commonality.”

While the focus of our research was on deeply understanding how co-

workers interact in this speciﬁc non-work setting, the characteristics

that emerged help us identify other settings that would achieve

the same goal. Some examples could include recurring volunteer

opportunities, cooking classes, or charity challenges.

. . .

As the boundaries between work lives and non-work lives become more

porous, it is common to consider whether and when to interact with our

colleagues outside of work. Our study highlights that concerns about

whether to blur work and non-work boundaries may be misplaced.

Rather than focusing on the boundary blurring itself, leaders should

consider where they blur the boundaries of their work and non-work

# lives.

By either proactively identifying a setting that exists (e.g., a non-work

## platform, a charity challenge, a volunteer opportunity) or building

the infrastructure for a relational holding environment (e.g., creating

a space apart from where work is done to gather), leaders can take advantage of all of the beneﬁts that a non-work setting has to oﬀer for

them and their relationships. The meaningful connections that result

## between leaders, between leaders and their employees, and between

employees, can be an antidote to loneliness and isolation, while also

enriching a culture of support of–and genuine interest in–one another.
