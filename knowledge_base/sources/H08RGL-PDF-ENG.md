Amy was a senior designer at “Glow Design,” a pseudonym for a

globally admired design consultancy known for its strong culture of

collaboration. When we ﬁrst met Amy, she was a vocal champion

of the ﬁrm’s helping ethos. Eighteen months later, she was in tears

—overwhelmed, unsupported, and considering quitting. What went

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: When Help Isn’t Helpful

Helping was woven into the fabric of Glow—so much so that it was

enshrined in the employee handbook as the “mother-lode of all Glow

values.” It was because of this culture that we approached them about

conducting an in-depth study of help at work. We spent years studying

how helping worked at Glow, including conducting 69 interviews and

analyzing 401 daily diary entries from team members about help they

gave and received. And yet, despite the strength of this culture, we

discovered something unexpected in our data: 25% of help-seeking

episodes reported in the daily diaries were rated by recipients as

# unhelpful.

That’s right: one in four times, help wasn’t actually helpful.

Decades of research has shown that helping at work, though valuable,

is all too rare. Workers often don’t get the help they need—generally,

because they don’t ask. In recent years, however, research, including

our own, has identiﬁed some forward-looking organizations that have

cracked the code of creating a culture of helping, including ﬁguring

out how managers can oﬀer help without micromanaging. That makes

helping a lot more common.

But making help more common comes with its own risks. Even in

## organizations famous for collaboration, a surprising proportion of help

isn’t all that helpful. That’s why if you want a productive helping culture

in your team or organization, you need to understand unhelpful help.

# What Is Unhelpful Help?

Unhelpful help occurs when givers oﬀer assistance that misses the

mark—because it’s poorly executed, not what was promised, or simply

not what the recipient needed. These failed attempts aren’t usually

malicious. In fact, they often stem from good intentions. But they can

still drain energy, slow down work, and erode trust.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: When Help Isn’t Helpful

In our years of studying the helping process, we’ve discovered that

help at work is a paradox. Some aspects of organizational structure that

make help common enough to fuel creativity and learning also increase

the likelihood that unhelpful help will emerge. These structures are (1)

strong helping norms, (2) ﬂat hierarchies, and (3) ﬂexible roles.

Strong helping norms increase the likelihood that people will ask for

help when they need it, and others will agree to give it. Flat hierarchies

mean that people don’t worry as much about asking others for help

—even those experts who might be hard to approach in a steeper

hierarchy. Finally, when roles are ﬂuid and everyone feels responsible,

it’s hard to know who is responsible for what.

# Why Unhelpful Help Happens

Our research identiﬁed three factors that contribute to unhelpful help:

- 1. Fuzzy Asks and Murky Understandings

In a culture where helping is expected, people ask for help often—but

not always clearly. This was Glow’s ﬁrst trap. Strong norms encouraged

asking for help, but people didn’t know how to ask for help eﬀectively.

Speciﬁcally, people didn’t want to seem too demanding, so they made

what we call fuzzy asks—vague, open-ended requests like “I just wanted

to get your input.”

As one designer in our study reﬂected, “Helping somebody help you is often quite diﬃcult when you’re overwhelmed with information and

you don’t know how to narrow down the question.”

Help-givers, in turn, were left guessing. One explained, “It was unclear

what the team wanted from me…I think it was more like, ‘Can you

come in and just be part of this discussion?’” The result? Murky

understandings that led to help that didn’t ﬁt the receivers’ needs.

- 2. Optimistic Expectations and Lack of Accountability

Fuzzy asks often led help-seekers to assume their needs were

understood—and would be met. This created what we describe as

optimistic expectations: the belief that givers could solve the problem.

Givers often felt pressure to say yes but didn’t always follow through. In

Amy’s case, many agreed to help, so Amy hoped they would solve the

problem. She stopped working on other solutions. When givers failed to deliver, the problem had become that much more diﬃcult and urgent.

- 3. An Emotionally Charged Aftermath

Unhelpful help doesn’t just derail projects—it damages relationships

and morale. Recipients often felt misled and unsupported. In Amy’s

case, the lack of follow-through made her feel undervalued. As she put

it, “If Glow thinks this is what I’m all about, to make sense of things that

are all crazy and just to hold it together, I don’t want to. That shouldn’t

be my value here.”

Givers didn’t fare much better. Some felt their contributions were

ignored or misused. Without feedback, they couldn’t know whether

they’d made a diﬀerence—or how to improve next time.

# How to Make Help More Helpful

So how can organizations improve the quality of help at work? Our

ﬁndings oﬀer three concrete lessons:

- 1. Clarify the Problem

Asking for help requires admitting you have a problem. But it’s a long

journey from “I feel anxious” to “I know who to ask and what to ask for.”

For most people, the process of ﬁnding clarity comes from talking it out.

Problems—especially in creative work—don’t come neatly packaged

when we encounter them. That’s why leaders need to encourage

subordinates to be open about their struggles and then listen carefully

to what they hear. Leaders can focus these conversations around

questions like “what are the obstacles that might prevent you

from reaching a goal on time?” and “what would be the expected

deliverable from a colleague you may bring into this project?” When an

organization’s projects require creativity and learning, many employees

aren’t actually aware of what they need. Formulating the problem and

clarifying the help required is an important work task.

Additionally, organizations need to acknowledge that clarifying a

problem is progress. Both givers and receivers who have clarifying

conversations should be praised and recognized. Just as doctors are

valued for their clear and correct diagnoses, so too should leaders and

other help-givers. Sometimes, understanding employees’ struggles is

the most important work that needs to be done.

- 2. Avoid the Politeness Trap

In our research, we found that politeness is a hidden cause of poor-

quality help. Asking for help is akin to asking for a favor, so everyone

wants to do it politely. But sometimes, help-seekers are so deferential

that they make their requests vague, asking for general “input” or

nonspeciﬁc “feedback.” Such “fuzzy asks” can feel polite and deferential

because pointed requests seem too bossy.

But help-givers aren’t mind readers. For any problem, there are a

thousand ways to help. Do you want new ideas that might send you

back to the drawing board? Or are you looking for minor feedback that

you can use quickly? It is possible to do this politely. Your helpers will

appreciate the direction and can be honest with you about whether they

can deliver.

Senior leaders play an important role in making sure that their

employees don’t fall into the politeness trap by fostering an

environment of psychological safety—the knowledge that it is safe to

take interpersonal risks (such as asking for help when you need it).

Leaders can foster psychological safety in several ways. First, they

can encourage employees to discuss problems and areas where they

need help—and praise those that do. Second, they can admit their

own errors and struggles. Third, they can accurately frame the work,

telling employees when they expect that tasks will require buy-in from

others. When leaders normalize asking for help in clear, tangible ways—

and encourage others to do so as well—it can help change the culture,

making explicit asks feel less impolite and more standard fare.

- 3. Close the Loop and Show Your Gratitude

In our research, we were surprised at how often help-givers didn’t know

the ends of their own stories. They’d chipped in on a project but then

didn’t know how their contributions aﬀected the ﬁnal outcome.

Most people say “thank you” when they receive help. That’s good—

we should feel and express our gratitude for those that help us. But

helpers often want more than momentary gratitude. They want to see

the impact of their labor—how did it aﬀect the ﬁnal output?

Besides genuinely wanting to provide value, people also help one

another in hopes of building relationships. That’s why leaders,

managers, project leads, and anyone asking for help should close the

loop after they receive it. Especially on big projects, it’s important to

keep track of those that helped along the way. One impactful way to do

this is to send contributors the ﬁnal product and point out how they,

speciﬁcally, made a diﬀerence.

For leaders, actively aﬃrming the diﬀerent ways that their staﬀ

members have contributed—and asking managers too as well—will not

only make these workers feel appreciated and helpful. It is also likely to

give leaders insight into what unique skills each of their team members

has, and how they can eﬀectively draw upon those skills in the future.

. . .

Helping is a core part of work. But like all forms of collaboration, it’s a

skill—one that requires practice, feedback, and support. When it comes

to help, it’s actually not just the thought that counts.
