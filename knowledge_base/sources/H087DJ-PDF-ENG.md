Too often, we mistakenly assume that mental health is the same for

everyone, and that race and ethnicity are not factors. But disparities

## exist between people of color and their white counterparts in the

## prevalence, incidence, symptoms, and treatment of mental health

## conditions. The Covid-19 pandemic and the wider recognition of racism

as a public health crisis have highlighted these disparities, along with

the need to acknowledge and address them in the workplace.

# The Barriers You Face

If you’re a person of color, barriers to mental health assistance

include the impact of racism, being an “only,” cultural mistrust, and

collectivism. Understanding racism and its impact is key to advocating

for your mental health in the workplace and for raising the awareness of

# leaders.

Racism takes three forms, each of which is a chronic stressor. Systemic

racism is when ideologies, institutions, and policies operate to produce

racial and ethnic inequality (such as your ﬁrm only hiring “qualiﬁed”

people of color, or employees of color only being assigned clients of

color). Interpersonal racism involves two or more people and can be

manifested through bigotry, bias, prejudice, and microaggressions (such

as a colleague making an oﬀensive comment to you). Internalized

racism is the acceptance of negative stereotypes and societal beliefs

about your racial group (such as believing you were only hired because

# of your race or ethnicity).

Research shows that experiencing or observing racism impacts

someone on a cellular level, aging them at a faster rate and placing

them at higher risk for mental health concerns. If you’re a person of

color, you likely experience one or more forms of racism on a daily basis.

As a result, you are at higher risk for anxiety and depression as well as

stress and trauma disorders. For some disorders (anxiety and trauma),

the symptoms experienced by Black Americans are more intense and

# last longer.

Employees of color tend to be an only — the only person of their race in

## the department, the division, and in some cases the entire ofﬁce. When

you’re an only, you can go days, weeks, even months without seeing or

speaking to coworkers who look like you. This means you have no one

to check in with about whether their race-related ofﬁce experiences are

similar to yours. (“Does that boss check everyone’s work, or just mine?”)

Being an only also means that if you are not at a meeting or don’t attend

an outing, people notice and comment. This can create or add to a sense

## of anxiety and isolation in the workplace.

Onlyness and racism in their various forms lead to another barrier to

receiving care: cultural mistrust, the tendency not to believe or trust

your white colleagues or leaders. This mistrust has several eﬀects: You

are wary and keep your guard up, leading your colleagues to see you as

unfriendly or not a team player. When it comes to your mental health,

cultural mistrust heightens concerns that any request you make for care

or accommodations will be used to deny you promotions and raises,

or may result in the loss of your job. Worse yet, you may believe your

request will be shared with the entire ofﬁce. Simply stated, you believe

you will be betrayed, and this belief in turn fuels mistrust.

Many employees of color are raised in families and communities

## that embrace collectivism, the belief that your successes and failures

are not yours alone but are shared by your family and community.

When difﬁculties arise, you may feel as though you have let the

family or community down. You are unable to recognize that at some

point everybody faces mental health challenges. You feel ashamed,

embarrassed, and unworthy of help or forgiveness. So you do not ask

for help and you do not respond to those who oﬀer it. As a result,

the impact of whatever you are struggling with — depression, anxiety,

# trauma — increases.

## Assessing the State of Your Mental Health

Mental health is rarely discussed in communities of color; the common

perception is that it is a “white” problem and that poor mental health

equals “crazy.” Nothing could be further from the truth. In my corporate

mental health workshops for people of color, when I explain in detail

## the signs and symptoms of depression, anxiety, or trauma, the common

response from people of color is, “This has a name? I thought it was the

way I was supposed to feel.” That’s usually followed by the question,

“How do I know if I need help?”

The following questions are a good way to assess your mental health:

- Is the way I am feeling or the thoughts I am experiencing interfering in

# my life?

- Is the way I am feeling or the thoughts I am experiencing preventing

me from doing the things I want to do?

- Is the way I am feeling or the thoughts I am experiencing making it

difﬁcult for me to be present in any or all aspects of my life?

If the answer to any of these questions is yes, it is time to pay closer

attention to your mental well-being and ask for support and help.

Asking for help is not always easy. The interaction between racism,

cultural mistrust, and onlyness can make it feel like a sign of weakness,

like mental health is a problem you cannot solve on your own. When

you feel this way, remind yourself that mental health is health — if you

had a problem with your body, you wouldn’t hesitate to get help. Your

mental health should be no diﬀerent, and not seeking help when you

need it allows the sense of shame and weakness to fester.

The ﬁrst step in asking for help is identifying the best person to ask. Is

## there a manager (perhaps your own) or another leader in the company

who you believe will listen? Often, a company has identiﬁed someone in

HR to assist employees with mental health concerns. When you ask for

help, be speciﬁc. Do you want a therapist, a group, a class? Whatever you

believe will work best for you, ask for it. It’s OK if you don’t know what

to ask for or what type of intervention you want. You can simply say,

“I’ve noticed that I’ve been more anxious (or stressed, angry, depressed)

lately at work and would like help for this. What options are available?

What have others found useful?”

Despite eﬀorts to address the barriers, some workplaces remain

## detrimental to your mental health as a person of color. In these

situations, you must determine if it’s in your best interest to leave.

Making this decision with a therapist can help reduce the anxiety and

fear that may arise. A therapist will help you evaluate the pros and cons

of leaving, develop an exit strategy, and think through steps to take for

your future, including what to look for in your next company.

If you do leave, the company may require you to participate in an exit

interview. When asked about your reasons for leaving, try as best as you

can to remain unemotional (as difﬁcult as that may be) and stick to the

facts. Sadly, and unfairly, it is easier for the interviewer to dismiss your

experiences or suggestions if you are seen as overly emotional.

# What Managers and Companies Can Do

In recent years I have spent a signiﬁcant amount of time consulting in

## corporations and companies on the mental health of employees of color.

Initially, I am invited in because the situation has reached a crisis level

— for example, an employee of color has had an outburst, or employees

of color have demanded that the company address their mental health

needs. As a leader, you can’t wait until the mental health of your

employees of color is in crisis mode to make it a priority. Research

shows that prioritizing the mental health of employees of color from

the outset enhances the workplace environment, promotes wellness,

improves productivity, and increases proﬁts.

As a leader, you must emphasize by thought, word, and deed that there

is no weakness, shame, retribution, or judgment when an employee of

color (or any employee) asks for assistance. This can be accomplished

by incorporating a segment on mental health and wellness into staﬀ

meetings, being sure to address the needs of employees of color.

And mental health ﬁrst-aid training can become part of supervisors’

training, providing those in leadership with the skills to respond

empathetically and appropriately to employees of color who seek help.

Systemic and interpersonal racism in the workplace puts employees

## of color at higher risk for mental health challenges. Leaders must

be willing to take a hard look at policies and procedures that

reﬂect systemic racism and workplace cultures that may be rife with

interpersonal racism. Then, they must work to rethink and change those

# policies, procedures, and cultures.

Empowering employees of color to protect and prioritize their mental

health involves ensuring that therapists of color and culturally

competent therapists and counselors are available through the

## employee assistance program (EAP) or company insurance plan. Most

employees of color want a therapist who looks like them. However,

currently the number of therapists of color is unfortunately small. Thus,

the inclusion of culturally competent therapists who have previous

experience counseling employees of color is critical. Due to cultural

mistrust, some employees of color will request a therapist outside the

EAP and indicate their willingness to forgo the insurance plan and

self-pay. In these cases, HR should compile and make available a list

## of therapists of color and white therapists.

As employees of color prioritize their mental health, they may require

certain accommodations. Mental health accommodations are part of

the Americans with Disabilities Act, which employers should familiarize

## themselves with. In addition, information about an employee’s mental

health is health information and by law remains conﬁdential. Common

accommodations include breaks, a limit on hours worked, and the

use of a service animal. Because mental health and faith are deeply

entwined for many people of color, requests for accommodations may

include things such as extending the lunch hour to attend midday

prayer services or playing faith-based music in their workspace.

Leaders should keep in mind that the barriers to asking for help,

described earlier, make people of color feel vulnerable when they seek

accommodations. Managers should be familiar with and understand

these obstacles and look for signs that they are interfering with a

request for accommodations. An example of this might be someone who

is an only becoming more isolated at work.

HR and DEI directors who are witnessing resignations among

employees of color should face the problem calmly, openly, and

honestly. Investigate the factors behind the company’s failure to protect

their mental health. Climate surveys, exit interviews, and focus groups

are insufﬁcient. Rather, you must observe and understand the daily

work experiences of employees of color. (One simple example: Was a

departing employee of color an only in their department or division?)

Once you identify the root causes, create and implement an action plan

with clear steps and deadlines. And do not be afraid to bring in outside

help — the expertise and knowledge to address the problem areas may

# not exist in-house.

. . .

If you’re a person of color, these steps can help you deal with the mental

health struggles you’re facing at work, even deciding whether your

company is a place you can thrive. If you’re a leader, make it a priority to

ﬁnd out more about how your employees of color really feel at work and

how you can support them. Doing so is a win for the employees and the

# business alike.
