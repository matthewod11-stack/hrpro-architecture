The ongoing trade war has dominated conversations in boardrooms

and newsrooms. On-again, oﬀ-again tariﬀs and economically bellicose

statements have led to uncertainty, confusion, and even fear. Amid

the market turmoil and operational confusion of the last few months,

it’s possible to lose sight of a profound underlying change of which

these are a manifestation. Even after things calm down (as they will,

sooner or later), businesses will have to face a new structural reality:

## HBR / Digital Article / Competing in the New Era of Industrial Policy

Global commerce has entered an era where competition is directly—and

profoundly—shaped by government industrial policy.

It used to be that legislative agendas and macro policy issues like

trade policies or environmental initiatives were long-cycle issues about

which executives could say, “Oh, let’s see what happens in the next G7

meeting.” They no longer have that luxury. We’ve come a long way, in what seems a very short time, from the days when U.S. oﬃcials could be

counted on to proclaim that it was not the job of government to “pick

winners and losers” or when leaders of advanced economies routinely

and sincerely said government policy should simply work to ensure a

“level playing ﬁeld.”

Focused or fuzzy, brilliant or bone-headed, industrial policies are here.

Business leaders thus need to know how government aﬀects their

organizations—that is, how industrial policy might endanger value

creation, strengthen it, or create opportunities to expand it.

# The Industrial Policy Landscape

As the OECD deﬁnes it, industrial policy is “government assistance to

businesses to boost or reshape speciﬁc economic activities, especially

to ﬁrms or types of ﬁrms based on their activity, technology, location,

size, or age.” Its tools include tariﬀs, incentives, subsidies, investment in

public goods like infrastructure, and more. By that deﬁnition, industrial

policy has become a strategic program in every major economic bloc.

Consider that in the U.S., while the Trump and Biden administrations

have followed very diﬀerent paths, both parties’ stated goals share

similarities: to support semiconductor and microchip research and

## manufacturing, energy production, artiﬁcial intelligence, and so on;

reduce dependence on Chinese parts and materials; and promote

# economic self-reliance in key areas.

And countries in the European Union have increased their spending

to support industry three-fold in the last decade, according to the

International Monetary Fund, while the EU itself has developed a

“competitiveness compass” designed to support a designated set of

industries and reduce the bloc’s dependence on outsiders.

Finally, in China, the hand of the state has long been on the wheel

of the economy. In 2022 a panel of experts from the Asia Society

and Stanford agreed that “under Xi Jinping, the leadership became

even more aggressive in strengthening China’s self-reliance and self- suﬃciency in critical technology domains.”

Industrial policy is a mixed blessing. At its worst, it can syphon private

capital from productive to unproductive uses, boost bad ideas, shore up

doomed industries, or become a sink of outright graft and corruption.

The best industrial policies identify areas of market failure and leverage

an economy’s inherent and unique strengths. (In the U.S., those should

include its unique venture capital and business-formation ecosystem,

## enormous defense budget, large public research universities, and ability

to attract, deploy, and reward both ﬁnancial and human capital quickly.)

Good policies also prize consistency, since erratic policy can paralyze

the very investments it aims to promote. Danger comes when public

purpose is used to cloak a private agenda.

## How to Strategize Around Industrial Policy

Some companies might try (and some might be able) to shape industrial

policy to their own beneﬁt, but all companies need to know how it will

aﬀect them, monitor both trends and details, and be able to act on what

they see. Here are six ways to go about that:

- 1. Look at your business through the eyes of policymakers.

It’s easy for defense and semiconductor companies to see how policy

## aﬀects them, but what about organizations in other sectors? A broad

view of your value chain may highlight more opportunities and impacts

coming down the pipe than appear on the surface. For example, some

policies may seem pointed at AI; but AI needs data centers, and data

centers need lots of real estate, electricity, and construction work. A

broad policy goal of encouraging manufacturing can beneﬁt bakers

as well as automakers, not to mention logistics companies, makers of

# smart-factory equipment, and more.

- 2. Pay attention to the long-term implications of industrial policy.

There’s a lot of noise in the trading system right now as the U.S. and

others throw tariﬀs at each other, but there are always signals within the

noise, and longer-lived trends despite the choppiness. Ideas and goals

that have broad political and economic support, like defending key

industries, jumpstarting industries of the future, or supporting energy

independence, will likely survive the fray. A company can make long-

term plans and investments with those in mind; at the least, it doesn’t

make sense to bet against them. In some cases, trade restrictions can

buy time for domestic producers to make investments that will close

# competitive gaps with overseas rivals.

- 3. Audit short-term, speciﬁc risks and opportunities both at home and abroad. Whether governments are using carrots or sticks, industrial policy

creates risks for companies that depend on overseas suppliers. As my

colleague Sudeep Suman and I pointed out in HBR, companies need to

identify risks quickly and be prepared even for low-probability events—

in detail, down to the SKU. Conduct the same kind of analysis to identify

markets at risk. For example, restrictions slapped on American products

by Mexico or Canada (or vice versa) or incentives given to domestic

## producers by Germany or France can all aﬀect overseas markets.

In parallel, identify opportunities to win or win back home-market

customers currently served by foreign competitors if industrial policies

raise barriers for them. Consider how to leverage industrial policies

to open markets, too; for example, by investing (directly or through

alliances) in overseas production, a company can become an insider

rather than an exporter. There are more and more incentives in more

# and more markets—look for them.

- 4. Build rapid-response capabilities.

Because threat and opportunity maps can change quickly—especially

given the current American administration’s approach to trade—an

alert eye must be accompanied by a quick hand. A combination of tariﬀ engineering, price-sensitivity analysis, and operational eﬃciency

can mitigate many of the negative eﬀects of trade barriers. Companies

also need the ﬁnancial resilience to absorb government-driven shocks

as well as the operational resilience to adapt quickly to changes—for

example, by having multiple suppliers for key ingredients, ﬂexible

# manufacturing lines, and so on.

- 5. Tell your story. Widely.

Take an ecosystem view of your company, its impact, and its inﬂuence,

and share that with people who can inﬂuence policy. How many

legislators understand that the future of the auto industry is in software

more than it is in steel? State, provincial, and metropolitan business-

development organizations can amplify the voice of middle market

## businesses and help multinationals ﬁnd allies in local government.

- 6. Don’t let the tail wag the dog.

A core business is a core business, and most of the time industrial policy

works on the margins. It doesn’t make sense to pour discretionary

funds into a non-core activity just to get government help that might

be transitory and almost certainly will come with strings attached.

. . .

The responsibility of leaders is to take advantage of the patterns they

see, correct mistakes fast, look for opportunities, and ensure that their

teams have the ability and resources to manage short-term issues. When

something is new, it’s easy to become distracted by every zig and zag,

and industrial policy is new for many executives and boards. But in

## the long run, government policy manifests itself through the familiar

competitive forces of suppliers, customers, entry barriers, substitutes,

and competitors. We know how to deal with that.
