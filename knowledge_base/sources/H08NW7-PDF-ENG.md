Ben, an executive coaching client of Ron’s who was one of three

candidates being considered as the next CEO of his company, said to

him, “I have to convince them that I’m better than I am!”

That was the worst thing Ben could have done. If he got the job, he’d

spend the entire time trying to keep up the illusion, enduring the

tension between who he’d convinced others he is and who he actually

is. Ron’s advice? “You need to convince them that you’re capable of

becoming who you need to be by continuously learning once you get the

job. Show them that you bring enough to the table to build on.”

Ben is not alone in his assumption that success comes from convincing

others that you’re more talented than you actually are. As Niccolò

Machiavelli famously wrote in The Prince (1532): “It is not necessary

to have all the good qualities, but it is very necessary to appear to have

them.” We’ve seen too many clients exhaust themselves (and others)

perpetuating a mirage of abilities they then spend a lifetime trying to

# sustain.

Some research indicates that excessive self-conﬁdence is on the rise,

and worse, it’s contagious. Here’s why outsized self-conﬁdence is risky,

as well as strategies for building (or rebuilding) legitimate credibility as

# a leader.

# The Risks of Overconfidence

If you’ve ever tried to convince others you’re better than you are, you’re

certainly not alone. While that’s a tediously unrewarding experience,

it tends to get worse when you actually succeed—getting promoted,

celebrated, and rewarded beyond your level of talent or ability.

Trying to persuade others that you’re better than you actually are,

irrespective of whether you believe that yourself or not, often backﬁres.

And believing you’ll be exempt from these consequences only increases

the likelihood that you’ll run headlong into them. Here’s what you’re

risking by showing oﬀ more than you should to land a promotion or new

# job:

# Loss of trust and credibility

When people discover that you’re not as competent, experienced, or

knowledgeable as you claim, their trust in you diminishes. Whether

in personal relationships or professional settings, credibility is hard to

rebuild once lost. Worse, any legitimate talents you do have will get

devalued as people question your credibility across multiple aspects of

# life.

Increased stress and anxiety

Keeping up a facade requires constant eﬀort and can lead to signiﬁcant

stress and anxiety. The fear of being exposed or failing to meet the

expectations you’ve set can take a toll on your mental and emotional

well-being, along with the emotional stress you cause others you’ve

coopted into your hallucination.

# Missed opportunities for growth

When you pretend to be more skilled than you are, you may miss

opportunities to learn and grow. Acknowledging your weaknesses

allows you to seek mentorship, training, and experiences that

contribute to real self-improvement, while hiding your gaps forces you

to forfeit opportunities to close them. To paraphrase Epictetus, it’s

impossible for a man to learn what he thinks he already knows. So,

when the gap between your actual and self-perceived competence is

only artiﬁcially bridged by your ego—as opposed to your actual talents

or eﬀort—you will probably stagnate.

Damaged relationships

Authenticity fosters deep, meaningful relationships, while deception

can create distance. If people feel misled, they may withdraw from the

relationship, leaving you isolated or disconnected. The isolation often

## leads to feelings of shame and a deeper sense of inadequacy, which

in turn intensiﬁes your need to double down on using an exaggerated

version of yourself to purchase the regard of others. It’s a vicious cycle.

# Limited long-term success

While faking it may provide short-term gains, sustainable success

is built on genuine competence and character. Those who rely on

appearances rather than substance eventually face harsh setbacks when

their true abilities are put to the test. The very failure you believe you’re

avoiding with an inﬂated view of your talents is likely the very failure

you’re setting in motion.

## But the biggest risks—and actual costs—are for others. Since there’s

always a strong possibility that you’ll succeed in your deception or

exaggeration, there’s a clear possibility that you’ll become like Ben, the

person we cautioned about at the start of the article: someone who isn’t

as good as they want others to believe but is able to succeed despite

being overrated.

# Rebuilding Your Credibility

If you’re feeling the urge to embellish your abilities to others—or

already have and now realize you can’t keep up the illusion—here are

some ways to start a graceful journey back to reality and legitimate

# credibility:

Identify the perceived risk of the truth.

Your choice to exaggerate isn’t random. It’s learned behavior.

Somewhere you learned that an accurate perception of your abilities

from others held risk: of being seen as less than competent, missing out

on opportunities, being perceived as just “average,” or not living up to

# some imposed expectations of perfection.

Reﬂect on that voice telling you, “If people really knew you weren’t that

good…” How does that sentence ﬁnish in your mind? What is the threat

you’re avoiding? By clarifying the perceived risk, you can interrogate the

origin story where you ﬁrst experienced it.

In Ben’s case, many of his formative years were spent competing for

opportunities he was chided for not winning. He literally had a high

school coach pushing him to win a track scholarship say those words to

him: “You have to convince them you’re better than you are.” He didn’t

get the scholarship.

Reframe the narrative.

If you’ve already set higher expectations than you can meet, instead of

admitting outright that past claims were exaggerated, you can subtly

shift the conversation toward a more grounded reality.

You might say something like, “I used to think I had a real talent for

[X], but the more I learn, the more I realize there’s so much more to

master,” or “I’ve had a lot of learning moments lately, and I see things

diﬀerently now.” This softens the retreat without making it seem like

you were being maliciously deceptive.

Own it with honesty (when appropriate).

In signiﬁcant relationships, this could actually build and repair

credibility rather than damage it. If the exaggeration is at risk of

backﬁring, or you suspect people are now questioning your ability, a

direct, accountable approach can be powerful: “You know, I’ve been

thinking about how I described my experience with [X], and I probably

made it sound more impressive than it really was. I got carried away,

but I want to be up front about what I actually believe I can do.” In

some cases, your relationships may not be strong enough to withstand

this degree of confession, but when warranted, this one is worth

considering.

# Shift focus to growth.

Taking an honest assessment of your development needs can enable

you to reframe past exaggerations as part of a journey toward

## improvement rather than a deliberate embellishment. Further, when

others hear you acknowledge gaps in your ability, it actually strengthens

their respect for you and allows them to see your legitimate talents in a

# more positive light.

You might say something like, “I used to think of myself as an expert in

[X], but working with truly skilled people has been a wake-up call. I still

have a lot to learn.” This shows humility and a commitment to personal

growth. As a leader, it also role models for others, making it safe for

them to acknowledge their shortfalls rather than covering mistakes or

avoiding asking for help.

Redirect the spotlight.

Display genuine humility by highlighting the talents of others,

especially those with abilities stronger than yours. If you embellished

because you craved recognition or felt threatened by some imagined

comparison to others, say something like, “I used to think I had a special

talent for [X], but seeing what you can do has been really inspiring. I’d

love to learn from you.”

. . .

The pressure to appear perfect is strong in a world drunk on unhealthy

comparisons, humble-bragging, and inﬂated self-importance. But true

conﬁdence and success come from developing actual skills and growing

your talents over time. Internalize your ability to become self-aware,

which starts by understanding what others think of you, including

your expertise and potential. Instead of pretending, focus on progress,

learning, and authenticity—it will serve you and those around you

better in the long run. And if you have to pretend, then at least there

will be some substance to your embellishments.
