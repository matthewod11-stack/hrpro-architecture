In almost every organization I’ve advised, I’ve encountered the same

## problem: far too many projects, and far too few that truly matter.

A CEO of a global nonproﬁt association once told me—half joking,

half frustrated—that his company had 900 employees but more than

1,200 active projects. “It’s madness,” he said. “But people love launching

projects. It feels exciting. It shows progress. Stopping them? That’s

uncomfortable. It feels like failure.”

This story is far from unique. Across the industries I’ve worked in—

global consumer brands, leading pharmaceutical companies, ﬁnancial

## institutions, large infrastructure ﬁrms, and even business schools—

the same pattern emerges. Banks run hundreds of competing digital

initiatives; consumer goods companies stretch their scarce innovation

talent across dozens of “priority” launches; health care and life sciences

ﬁrms keep long-running research or compliance programs alive long

after their usefulness has passed.

But hidden within this challenge lies a powerful opportunity: when

organizations are brave enough to focus on fewer, higher-value

initiatives, the payoﬀ can be remarkable. Energy, budgets, and talent

stop being diluted and start ﬂowing into the projects that truly

matter—accelerating delivery, boosting morale, and creating a stronger

sense of shared purpose. Based on my experience, most organizations

could cut 50% of their active projects tomorrow without any negative

consequences. In fact, in some cases, trimming 70% would make them

# faster, more focused, and more eﬀective.

And yet they don’t. In a June 2024 survey conducted for my

## upcoming book, Powered by Projects: Leading Your Organization

## in the Transformation Age (HBR Press, January 2026), only 8% of

organizations conduct monthly project reviews, 44% stop projects only

occasionally, 26% rarely, and 7% never stop them at all.

This obsession with starting everything is more than ineﬃcient; it is

strategically dangerous. In today’s project economy, value is delivered

## primarily through initiatives and transformations, but that doesn’t

mean that more projects are better. Bloated portfolios dilute resources,

slow decision-making, and prevent organizations from focusing on the

projects that could truly move the needle.

The ﬁrst rule for thriving in this new reality is simple: Kill more

projects. But here’s the catch—everyone knows this, yet few know how

to do it. They fear the politics, the tradeoﬀs, and the uncomfortable

conversations, so the overload continues, quietly draining focus and

# momentum.

# Building the Habit of Stopping

Launching projects is fun. Kickoﬀs generate energy and visibility.

Meanwhile, killing projects feels quiet, awkward, and politically

charged. It’s no wonder that organizational overload is common, and

why, despite recognizing the problem, leaders struggle to stop projects

even when the case to do so is obvious.

There’s the sunk-cost trap: “We’ve already spent too much to quit,

and we’re almost there.” Also reputational risk, emotional attachment,

pet projects, vanity projects—we all know them when we see them.

The problem isn’t awareness, it’s human nature and ingrained

# organizational habits.

Annual reviews and a stated commitment to keeping project portfolios

small may help around the edges, but these approaches fail to deliver

true organizational focus. A senior ﬁnance executive at a European

industrial group once admitted to me: “We do big portfolio discussions

once a year, but by then it’s too late. Zombie projects keep running

because nobody wants to be the one to stop them.”

Those zombie initiatives that drain resources without delivering value

are deadly. They slow down strategic transformations and exhaust

teams. Breaking this cycle requires more than better governance—it

# demands new habits and cultural shifts.

Over the past two decades, as I’ve advised executives across

various industries, I’ve developed and observed seven practices that

consistently yield results. These are practical habits that organizations

have adopted to transform how they prioritize, govern, and ultimately

# stop projects.

Each of these principles lessens the psychological challenge of stopping

projects—and ensures these decisions are as deliberate and celebrated

# as starting projects.

- 1. Make continuation a conscious choice.

In most companies, projects continue simply because no one challenges

them. Eﬀective organizations ﬂip this default.

At a global food company I advised, project reviews stopped being

passive reporting exercises. Sponsors were no longer allowed to

“update” leadership with progress charts; instead, they were asked a

single, pointed question: “If you had to defend this project to the board

today, would you still recommend it?”

This forced sponsors to think like investors, evaluating future value

instead of rationalizing past eﬀort. Leaders told me that this small

change triggered “the most honest conversations we’ve ever had about

our portfolio.” Within six months, 20% of projects were stopped or

signiﬁcantly re-scoped, releasing millions for digital upgrades that had

been stalled for years.

- 2. Create real tradeoffs.

One reason portfolios swell is that leaders rarely have to make hard

choices. Budgets stretch, priorities multiply, and every initiative ﬁnds a

way to survive.

A telecommunications company I worked with broke this pattern by

introducing “project trading sessions.” Every business-unit leader was

given a ﬁxed “budget” of talent and funding, with one rule: To launch

a new initiative, they had to stop or “sell” an existing project of equal

# value.

The process wasn’t just ﬁnancial—it was psychological. Leaders had

to publicly justify why a new project was more valuable than one

already underway, creating an actual marketplace for priorities. After

one session, a senior executive admitted: “I realized I was defending

projects I didn’t even believe in anymore, just because nobody ever

asked me to choose.” Within a year, the portfolio shrank by 35%, and

execution speed for key strategic projects improved signiﬁcantly.

- 3. Stop treating every idea as a project.

Many organizations reﬂexively elevate too many opportunities into

formal projects, complete with steering committees, governance

meetings, and complex documentation. This clogs portfolios with

initiatives that should have been quietly tested—or quietly abandoned.

One health care and life sciences company I advised created small cross-

functional “squad teams” to explore new opportunities for 30 to 60

days. These squads had a simple mandate to test the strategic relevance

and potential impact of an idea before requesting project status.

The result? About 40% of ideas were dropped after this initial

assessment, saving thousands of hours and keeping the organization

focused on high-value initiatives. Leaders described it as “one of the

most liberating changes we’ve ever made.”

- 4. Time-box projects to three or six months.

Long, open-ended projects are where focus goes to die. They create

sunk-cost inertia, locking organizations into outdated priorities.

An energy corporation I worked with shifted to a time-boxed approach:

All new initiatives were structured as three- or six-month projects, with

continuation decided at the end of each cycle.

This made it easier for executives to pivot—or stop—without political

fallout. Leaders could simply say, “This cycle ends here; we’re

redirecting resources elsewhere.” The approach gave the company

remarkable agility; for example, when customer behavior shifted

sharply during a regulatory change, the ﬁrm was able to redirect

investment within weeks, something that would have been unthinkable

# under its old multi-year programs.

- 5. Reward leaders who stop, not just those who start.

In most organizations, careers are built on launching new initiatives,

not ending them. High-performing companies change that narrative.

At a global luxury company I advised, the CEO added a new KPI to

senior leaders’ scorecards: resources freed from low-value initiatives.

Leaders had to publicly share, every quarter, which projects they had

stopped and how those resources were reinvested.

At ﬁrst, executives were skeptical. But within two cycles, the mood

shifted—leaders began competing to demonstrate their strategic

judgment. One senior executive proudly told me, “Stopping that big

IT project freed 15 engineers; they’re now accelerating our core digital

oﬀering. That’s the impact I want to be known for.”

Stopping became not a failure, but a career-enhancing signal of good

# leadership.

- 6. Spot weak projects early.

The longer a weak project drags on, the harder it becomes to stop.

The best organizations identify underperformers before they consume

# signiﬁcant resources.

A mid-sized European biotech ﬁrm I worked with used three

simple early-warning signals: declining sponsor attendance at key

meetings, repeated re-baselining of schedules, and falling stakeholder

participation. If a project triggered two of these, it faced an automatic

“continuation challenge”—a structured review where leaders had to

justify its survival.

About 15% of projects were stopped early through this process, freeing

capacity for new strategic priorities. The key wasn’t sophisticated

analytics, it was clear rules and the courage to act on them.

- 7. Restaff your people to your most strategic projects.

One of the biggest reasons leaders hesitate to stop projects is the

fear that doing so will lead to layoﬀs. When that risk is removed, the

psychological barrier to cutting low-value initiatives drops dramatically.

At a global bank I advised, hundreds of IT and operations staﬀ were

tied up in outdated compliance projects that no longer matched the

regulatory priorities of the year. Rather than cut those roles, the COO

launched a “safe landing” program: Every person from a stopped

project was guaranteed placement on one of the bank’s top 10 strategic

initiatives within 30 days. This policy not only retained valuable skills

within the bank but also fostered trust. Teams became more willing to

recommend ending projects once they knew it wouldn’t put colleagues

at risk. Swift, deliberate restaﬃng turns endings into accelerators for

what matters most.

# Winning by Stopping

What these practices have in common is not better tools, but a mindset

shift. Stopping projects isn’t about cutting headcount or shrinking the

organization—it’s about sharpening focus and amplifying impact.

When organizations streamline their projects, transformation

accelerates, strategies are achieved faster, and people are more

motivated and productive. Energy ﬂows to the work that truly matters,

and success becomes more visible and contagious. It leads people to feel

prouder to be working for your organization.

At your next portfolio meeting, resist the instinct to ask, “What should

we start next?” Ask instead: “If we could only do half of what we’re doing

now, which half would we keep?” And then act on that answer. Because

in the project economy, winning doesn’t come from starting more—it

comes from stopping what no longer matters and relentlessly focusing

on what does matter.
