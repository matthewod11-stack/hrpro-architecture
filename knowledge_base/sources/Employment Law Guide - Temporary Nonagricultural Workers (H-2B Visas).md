# Sections 101(a)(15)(H)(ii)(b) and 214(c)(1),(c)(14), and (g)(1) and (g)(9) of the Immigration and Nationality

# Act of 1952, (INA)as amended and 20 CFR Part 655 Subpart A, 29 CFR Part 503 and 8 CFR Part 214.2(h)

# Who is Covered

These regulations apply to employers who wish to import temporary nonagricultural workers to work in

temporary jobs in the United States when U.S. workers are not available. The INA requires the Department of

Homeland Security (DHS) to consult with appropriate government agencies to determine eligibility for the H-

2B program, and DHS has determined that eﬀective administration of the H-2B program requires consultation with the Department of Labor (DOL) to advise whether U.S. workers capable of performing the temporary

services or labor are available before determining whether any worker can be admitted. The INA also provides

that the number of aliens during any ﬁscal year who can be issued visas or provided nonimmigrant status

cannot exceed 66,000.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

Regulations of the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services (USCIS) require that employers who ﬁle H-2B

petitions with USCIS (except for temporary employment on Guam) must include a temporary labor

certiﬁcation from DOL stating that qualiﬁed workers are not available in the U.S. and that the foreign worker's

employment will not adversely aﬀect wages and working conditions of similarly employed U.S. workers.

The employment for which certiﬁcation is requested must, absent a one-time occurrence, be for no longer

than 9 months. The need for the service or labor can be a one-time occurrence, seasonal need, peak load

need, or intermittent need. Other detailed information may also be found on the H-2B Certiﬁcation for

Temporary Nonagricultural Work page of the Employment and Training Administration's Oﬃce of Foreign

# Labor Certiﬁcation (OFLC) website.

Note: The Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2016, Division H, Title I of Public Law 114-113 ("2016

DOL Appropriations Act"), provides that for Fiscal Year 2016, employment for which certiﬁcation is

requested generally must be for no longer than one year, absent a one-time occurrence.

For those employers who ﬁle an ETA Form 9142B on or after April 29, 2015, the regulations at 20 CFR 655

Subpart A and 29 CFR 503 apply. These regulations state that employers must register prior to ﬁling the applications for certiﬁcation of temporary nonagricultural jobs. This registration is good for 3 years as long as

the job, dates of need, and number of workers do not change signiﬁcantly (OFLC will announce in the Federal

Register when the registration process will commence). The employer must obtain a prevailing wage by ﬁling

ETA Form 9141 with ETA's National Processing Center. The employer must then initiate the required

recruitment at the same time it ﬁles the application for certiﬁcation of the temporary nonagricultural job, which must be ﬁled no fewer than 75 calendar days and no more than 90 calendar days before the employer's date

of need. Required recruitment includes submitting a job order to the State Workforce Agency (SWA) serving

the area of intended employment; publishing two print advertisements, one of which must be on a Sunday;

contacting its former U.S. workers, including those laid oﬀ in the last 120 days, employed in the same

# occupation at the same location; and, if there is a union, contacting the local bargaining representative or, if no

# union is present, posting a job notice in 2 conspicuous locations for 15 consecutive business days. The job

order must be posted at the SWA until 21 days prior to the date of need.

The employer will prepare a recruitment report summarizing the results of the eﬀort. The employer must sign

the report and include, among other items, the following information:

## Identiﬁcation of each recruitment source by name

The name and contact information for each U.S. worker who applied for the job

Explanation of the lawful job-related reasons for not hiring each U.S. worker

If OFLC denies certiﬁcation, the employer may appeal to the Board of Alien Labor Certiﬁcation Appeals.

# Employee Rights

An employer who ﬁles an application for temporary foreign labor certiﬁcation pursuant to the H-2B regulations

must meet many speciﬁc conditions, including those concerning recruitment, wages, transportation, tools and supplies, certiﬁcation and recruitment fees, labor disputes, and other conditions.

Workers who believe that their rights under the H-2B regulations were violated may ﬁle their complaints with

# their local Wage and Hour Division oﬃce (https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact/local-oﬃces).

Many of the H-2B program's worker protections also extend to other workers in the employer's workforce,

including U.S. workers hired in response to the requirement recruitment, and those who are found to be in corresponding employment. Workers may ﬁle complaints about non-compliance with H-2B labor standards

## with a local Wage and Hour Division oﬃce.

Please note: The Department of Labor Appropriations Act, 2016, Division H, Title I of Public Law 114-113

("2016 DOL Appropriations Act"), provides that the Department of Labor ("Department") may not use any

funds to enforce the deﬁnition of corresponding employment found in 20 CFR 655.5 or the three-fourths

guarantee rule deﬁnition found in 20 CFR 655.20, or any reference thereto. See Sec. 113. However, the 2016

DOL Appropriations Act did not vacate these regulatory provisions, and they remain in eﬀect, thus imposing a

legal duty on H-2B employers, even though the Department will not use any Fiscal Year 2016 funds to enforce

# them.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

# The employer must post a DOL-provided poster in English detailing workers' rights and protections under the

# H-2B program in a conspicuous location at each worksite. In addition, the employer must post additional

posters if a signiﬁcant portion of workers are not ﬂuent in English and DOL provides the poster translated into that language. The poster is currently available in Spanish.

Employers certiﬁed under H-2B must retain for three years the H-2B Registration, job order, Application,

Appendix B, H-2B Petition (DHS Form I-129), and supporting documents. Employers must also retain proof of recruitment eﬀorts, including the job order; advertising; contact with former U.S. workers; contact with

bargaining representative(s) or a copy of the posting of the job opportunity, whichever is applicable; and

additional employer-conducted recruitment eﬀorts directed by the Certifying Oﬃcer, if applicable.

Employers must also keep a copy of the ﬁnal recruitment report and any supporting resumes and contact

information; evidence of contact with U.S. workers who applied for the job opportunity, including documents demonstrating that any rejections of U.S. workers were for lawful, job-related reasons; and evidence of

required contact with any former U.S. worker in the occupation and place of employment, including

documents demonstrating that the U.S. worker had been oﬀered the job opportunity and either refused it or

was rejected for lawful, job-related reasons.

The employer must keep records of each worker's earnings, hours oﬀered and worked, and the location(s) of work performed. Records of when and how much the employer reimbursed workers for transportation and

subsistence costs must also be kept. Employers must keep written contracts with agents or recruiters,

including the written contract prohibiting an agent or recruiter from receiving prohibited payments, and the list

of identities and locations of persons working for the agent or recruiter, and these entities' agents or

employees (which was provided to DOL at the time of application).

Employers must keep the written notice provided to and informing ETA and USCIS that an H-2B worker or

worker in corresponding employment has separated from employment before the end date of employment

certiﬁed in the Application. Employers must keep any collective bargaining agreement, individual employment

contract, or payroll records used to substantiate any claim that certain incumbent U.S. workers are not

included in corresponding employment.

# Reporting

Each worker must be provided a wage statement showing total earnings for each workweek in the pay period;

hourly rate and/or piece rate; if piece rates are used, the daily units produced by the worker; itemized

deductions made from the worker's wages; the number of hours of employment oﬀered to the worker; hours actually worked by the worker in each workweek of the pay period; beginning and ending dates of the pay

# period; and the employer's name, address, and Federal Employer Identiﬁcation Number (FEIN).

# Employees must be paid at least every other week, or according to the prevailing practice in the area of

## intended employment, whichever is more frequent.

The employer must provide a copy of the job order to the H-2B worker no later than the time at which the worker applies for the H-2B visa (or at the time of the job oﬀer if the H-2B worker is already in the U.S.) and to

a worker in corresponding employment no later than on the day the work commences. The job order must be

provided in a language understood by the worker, as necessary or reasonable.

# Penalties/Sanctions

The Wage and Hour Division has a primary role in investigation and enforcing the terms and conditions of

employment under the H-2B program. The Wage and Hour Division may assess civil money penalties and

recover unpaid wages for violations of the terms and conditions of employment under the H-2B program.

Administrative proceedings may be instituted to compel compliance with an employer's obligations to workers

# under the H-2B program.

ETA and the Wage and Hour Division may debar an employer (and their successors in interest), attorneys, or

agents from ﬁling labor certiﬁcations for a period of no more than ﬁve years for substantial violations. ETA may

also revoke an approved labor certiﬁcation for substantial violations.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

Various federal, state, and local labor standards, such as the Fair Labor Standards Act, may apply to the

# employment of H-2B workers in the U.S.

# Compliance Assistance Available

Employers may obtain information on how to apply for a temporary nonagricultural labor certiﬁcation, including application forms and directives that contain prescribed procedural requirements, from the national

# oﬃce of the OFLC.

DOL provides employers, workers, and others with clear and easy-to-access information and assistance on

how to comply with the Immigration and Nationality Act. Additional compliance assistance including

explanatory brochures, fact sheets, and regulatory and interpretive materials is available on the Wage and Hour Division's immigration webpage.
