Here’s the thing: No one is “naturally” good at giving feedback.It’s a skill that’s learned over time with guidance and practice. Butas a new manager, it’s essential that you do learn it — and not justin the context of delivering yearly performance reviews. In fact,many leading companies have been

dropping annual

performance ratings in favor of more immediate and ongoingconversations. More than ever, real-time critiques are part of dailylife for managers.Fortunately, there are steps you can take to become better atproviding consistent performance feedback. It starts withbecoming aware of the mistakes you may be making and learningwhat to do to avoid those pitfalls.

A manager who gives feedback without first establishing trust islike a director who fails to set the scene before their actors takethe stage. In the absence of trust, your direct reports will have aharder time hearing, accepting, and acting on your feedback.Think about it in the context of receiving feedback from your ownboss. If they seem indifferent to your career goals, providescattered feedback without direction, and try to control yourevery move, are you going to readily accept and act on thefeedback they provide? What about if instead, they take the timeto understand you, share feedback in the context of youraspirations, and give you space to grow and learn?

The first thing you should do as a new manager is to get to knoweach of your team members —including their career aspirationsand goals. In your on-one-one conversations, you can ask: “Whatgoals are your hoping to achieve in your role over the next sixmonths?” or “How do you see your role evolving over the nextyear?” Some of your direct reports may be focused on gettingpromoted, while others may be eager to develop skills that willhelp them take on higher-profile assignments.Once context has been established, and you’re clear about howyou can support your team members’ development, you can beginto link your feedback to their goals. For example, you might say, “Iknow you want to take on more responsibility, so this is an area inwhich you need more development. One thing you can do betteris …” In those two sentences you go from critic to coach. Showingyour direct reports that you care about their growth through yourfeedback will further help instill their trust in you.

Given the

discomfort of sharing feedback with others, it’s notsurprising that your first instinct may be to

avoid it. When you seean opportunity for giving negative feedback, for example, youmay find yourself simply hoping the issue will resolve on its own.Or you may assume it will be easier to wait and deliver yourfeedback during a structured annual review.But delaying feedback, or simply waiting for a situation toimprove, helps no one. By avoiding these conversations, you’redoing a disservice to your direct reports and the overall success ofyour team.

Be consistent with your feedback sessions and build them in,rather than waiting until there is an issue to address. For example,if you’re giving a direct report an assignment — whether it’ssomething brand new or with higher stakes than their usualresponsibilities — add “pulse check” sessions into the calendarfor the end of the assignment or when the employee completescertain milestones. If an employee is supposed to win two newaccounts, you could set up pulse checks for after the first threemeetings, the negotiation, and the closure stages. Thesescheduled debriefs should include discussing what went well andwhat could have been done differently (their thoughts first, andthen your feedback). By engaging in this exercise, you’ll establisha pattern for giving and receiving feedback in real time.

As the saying goes, feedback is a gift. But too much can beoverwhelming.As a new manager, you must learn how to decide if a piece offeedback is

worth giving, or if doing so would hurt the situationmore than help it. This can be especially important (and difficult)when it comes to receiving and conveying feedback about yourdirect reports from others.Say, for example, your team is managing a conference for yourcompany. As the first day comes to a close, you overhear yoursupervisor complaining about a few elements of the event.Instead of stopping to consider if the feedback is indicative of atrend or just the opinion of one loud voice, you decide to deliver itto your team raw and without context. But in doing so, youalienate your team members and undermine your effectiveness asa new leader.

The solution is discernment. It’s your decision whether to sharethe feedback you receive from others with your direct reports.When you receive feedback for your team, remind yourself oftheir goals and then filter out any recommendations that won’t beuseful in helping them improve or reach them.Using the above example, let’s say you received feedback that thesessions during day one of the conference ran over the scheduledtime limit. Several attendees complained about the ending feelingrushed and not being able to ask questions. That feedback,indicating a consensus of opinion among several people, will helpensure a smoother event in the future. Therefore, it would beworth conveying that feedback to your direct reports. On theother hand, if you receive feedback from one person that they“didn’t like the topic of a session,” you may want to keep that toyourself. The random opinion of one person may not beconstructive, and could take your team’s attention and effortsaway from making impactful changes.You also need to learn when to deliver feedback. While deliveringfeedback promptly helps learning, there is one caveat: Whenemotions are running high or tanks are running low, it becomeseven more important to filter and focus your feedback. Forexample, day one of a three-day event is not the time for adetailed debrief. Rather, it’s a good time for focusing on one,maybe two things that might be improved the next day, liketechnology issues, making sure people can find the display booth,and ensuring that all speakers follow the schedule. A week later,with all the feedback from audience reactions, satisfaction surveyresults, and other outcomes measured, a detailed debrief will bemore useful. Delaying that detailed feedback will also help toeliminate blame and give you time to brainstorm solutionstogether as a team.

Even if you give feedback at the right time,

use the right words,and deliver it from a place of trust, it’s all useless if you don’tfollow up. When you give feedback without circling back, yourteam members could lose their motivation and may be less likelyto follow through on your suggestions. Without a follow up, youmay also not realize that your team is still struggling, or thedirection you suggested may not be working for them.

For feedback to work, it needs to be consistent. After providingfeedback, check in on your direct reports to see how they’reprogressing with their development. It can be as simple as askinga direct report: “In our last check in, we talked about you trying adifferent approach. How is that working for you?” When yourdiscussions are grounded in context — connecting the dotsbetween feedback and the person’s goals and aspirations — itbecomes a supportive conversation that promotes ongoinglearning.Keep in mind that feedback isn’t just criticism. Positive messagesdemonstrate that you see your team members’ efforts andreinforce trust. For example, you could say “You’ve been workingon refining your visual representation of customer data, and it’svery noticeable! You’re ready to be part of the next presentation tothe division head.”

Awareness of your mistakes will only get you so far — thisfoundational managerial skill demands repetition and practice.While it may feel uncomfortable or overwhelming at first, oncemastered, it will pay dividends throughout your career.
