On November 10, 2022, a tweet sent shockwaves through the

pharmaceutical industry. A veriﬁed Twitter (now X) account claiming to

represent Eli Lilly, one of the world’s pharmaceutical giants, announced

that the drugmaker would begin providing insulin free of charge.

Within hours, the post went viral, garnering over 11,000 likes and

1,500 retweets. The impact was immediate: Online searches for Eli Lilly

surged by more than 80% in just one day. For millions of people reliant

on insulin, the “announcement” signaled a potential breakthrough in

## the long-running battle over the drug’s pricing.

There was one problem: The tweet was fake, posted from a parody

account. Although Eli Lilly’s oﬃcial account promptly clariﬁed the

situation, the damage had already been done. The company’s stock

value dropped by 4%, rattling investors who feared a signiﬁcant hit to

proﬁt and reigniting heated public debates about the cost of insulin.

That wasn’t the ﬁrst time the industry had been rocked by a fake news

scandal. Several months earlier, a manipulated video appeared online

of Pﬁzer’s CEO, Albert Bourla, in which he appeared to say, “By 2023,

we will reduce the number of people in the world by 50%.” Outraged

viewers demanded his arrest, labeling pharmaceutical companies as

“evil.” Of course, the video had been edited. Bourla had actually stated

that “we will reduce the number of people in the world who cannot aﬀord our medicines by 50%.”

Fake news isn’t a problem just for the pharma industry. It has

targeted the ﬁnancial sector (Metro Bank), consumer goods (Coca-Cola),

## restaurants (McDonald’s), airlines (Delta), entertainment (Disney), the

fashion industry (Victoria’s Secret), the automotive industry (Tesla), and

others. Fake news has also proven disruptive in politics, eroding trust

in democratic institutions, deepening polarization, inﬂuencing voting

perceptions, and swaying results in closely contested elections.

Unfortunately, fake news is a stubborn problem that is unlikely to go

away. While many U.S. adults feel conﬁdent in their ability to detect fake

news, 38% of U.S. social media users have accidentally shared a fake

news story, according to the Trusted Web Foundation. Complicating

matters, fake news spreads signiﬁcantly faster than real news—it is

up to 70% more likely to be shared, according to a study of news

stories on Twitter by MIT researchers. And with each share, it gains

momentum: The more it gets shared, the more it looks true, and the

more people share it. Fake news is likely to be an even bigger problem in

the coming years as trust in legacy media continues to erode, advances

in AI and video-editing technologies make fabricated content nearly

indistinguishable from reality, and social media companies abdicate

their content-moderation responsibilities, as Meta did in early 2025

when it announced that Facebook would stop fact-checking content on

# its platforms.

Fake news is distinct from misinformation or false rumors, which can

be deﬁned as false content shared regardless of intent. In contrast, fake

news is a speciﬁc type of disinformation: It is deliberately fabricated as a

“news” story with an intent to deceive, transmitted by social media, and

characterized by virality.

The traditional corporate playbook for responding to misinformation or

false rumors assumes that a company is engaging with actors who want

to set the record straight or are open to fact-based persuasion. It calls

for companies to ignore the information, scramble to have it removed,

or provide facts and accurate information to debunk false claims. This

fact-checking approach typically involves issuing statements through

its own media channels, such as corporate Facebook pages or X

accounts, as Eli Lilly did. When it comes to fake news, all those

approaches are insuﬃcient. Through our own research and decades of

experience in studying and advising on reputation management, we’ve

found that conventional methods fail to address the full scope of the

# challenge, for several reasons.

First, ignoring fake news is rarely eﬀective. Managers often assume that

a solid reputation serves as a natural defense, believing that fake news will not be taken seriously enough to aﬀect the company. However, in

an era where disinformation can spread with unprecedented speed and

reach, silence can be risky.

Second, asking news outlets and social media platforms to swiftly

remove or correct harmful content is an important ﬁrst step, but it is

insuﬃcient to staunch the ﬂow. Fake news often resurfaces through

screenshots, reposts, or alternative formats, making it nearly impossible

to contain its spread entirely.

Third and more frustrating still, correcting the record with facts does

little to change the narrative. For instance, when Wayfair faced baseless

accusations of child traﬃcking in 2020, the company’s clariﬁcations

failed to prevent the rumors from going viral and ultimately reaching

some 4.5 million people. And when the Arab airline Saudia faced false

accusations of segregating men and women on its ﬂights, company

spokespeople denied the claims in newspaper interviews. Despite their eﬀorts, the fake news took on a life of its own, sparking ongoing

online debates about Islamophobia, sexual harassment on airplanes,

and cultural misunderstandings—conversations that continued to

propagate the fake news story.

# The Appeal of Fake News

What’s happening here? Many executives don’t understand the viral

nature of the problem and can often inadvertently amplify fake news by discussing it. This phenomenon is known as the “Streisand eﬀect,”

named after the actor-singer Barbra Streisand, whose unsuccessful

attempts to prevent knowledge about her home address from spreading

inadvertently made it more widely known. Once a piece of fake news reaches a certain threshold, eﬀorts to suppress it will be largely in

vain. For example, in 2016, PepsiCo faced a viral fake-news crisis when

stories circulating on social media falsely claimed that CEO Indra

Nooyi had told Trump supporters to “take their business elsewhere.”

The disinformation spread rapidly, sparking calls for a boycott and

temporarily driving down PepsiCo’s stock. The company’s response—

a brief clariﬁcation—was too slow and subdued to counteract the viral

outrage, damaging consumer trust.

Fact-based eﬀorts to combat fake news ignore a key insight into

human psychology. People’s opinions are often shaped less by their

own point of view than their perception of what others believe—a

phenomenon that behavioral psychologists call “social proof.” We tend

to be overly and subconsciously inﬂuenced by what we think is the

majority opinion. That’s a problem when it comes to fake news, because people believe that others are more aﬀected by fake news than they

are themselves. A 2023 Ipsos survey of 29 countries highlights this

disparity: While 66% of respondents expressed conﬁdence in their

ability to distinguish real news from fake, only 44% believed the average

person could do so. Because people think and act according to what they perceive to be the majority opinion, they can still be aﬀected by

fake news, even if they know it is false.

Our research, which examines the impact of fake news on corporate

reputations, reveals similar ﬁndings but goes even further in showing the troubling eﬀect of fake news on individuals’ judgments and

behaviors. In a series of experiments, we exposed participants to fake news about diﬀerent companies and then measured their judgments

about the companies’ reputations as well as what they thought others’

judgments were before and after the exposure to the fake news. The fake

news items were modeled after stories that actually circulated online to

enhance realism but were slightly modiﬁed to avoid memory biases.

In our ﬁrst experiment, each participant read a description of an airline

that was positive, negative, or neutral and then read a fake news story in

which the airline was accused of removing passengers from a plane for

speaking Arabic. The story was based on actual fake news that had been

shared online about Delta in 2016 and ﬂagged as fake by Snopes.com. We then measured how the story aﬀected the participants’ personal

judgments of the airline, as well as their beliefs about how others saw

the airline. We also tested whether awareness that the news story was

fake inﬂuenced judgments: Half of the participants were shown a “fake

news warning,” and the other half received no warning. We found that the warning had a minimal eﬀect on reputation judgments.

In another experiment, we followed a similar approach but changed

## the company (a hardware manufacturer) and the fake news story

(exploding batteries). Across both experiments, we consistently found that individuals believed that the fake news would aﬀect others more than themselves. This eﬀect was especially pronounced for companies

that had a positive reputation.

In an age where information is abundant and untrustworthy, Sideline Collective’s Joseph Ernst imagines a world in which there’s nothing in the news.

In a third study, we found that individuals adjusted their own

reputation judgments and behavioral intentions based on what they

believed others thought. Participants were placed in a simulated

group chat where everyone was asked to discuss a news story about

a restaurant chain. The story falsely claimed that rat poison had

been found in the company’s food. Before joining the chat, some

participants were told that the other members in the group held a

good opinion of the company; other participants were told that the

group judged the company more harshly. The results were striking.

Even when participants knew the story was fake, their own opinions

and behavioral intentions shifted in accordance with what they thought

others believed.

Overall, our ﬁndings tell us that it is not enough to ﬂag fake news as

being false: People assume that others still believe the fake news—and

this perception inﬂuences how they themselves think and act.

Despite these daunting ﬁndings, our research suggests several ways

companies can improve their response to fake news. By leveraging

## social proof tactics—a powerful yet often overlooked complement to

traditional fact-based responses to fake news—companies can build a

## more resilient defense against disinformation.

# Harnessing the Power of Social Proof

To eﬀectively combat disinformation, organizations must spread the

perception that fake news lacks widespread credibility not only because

it is demonstrably false but also because others don’t believe it. That

means crafting a multichannel strategy that addresses the falsehoods

while also signaling that experts, peers, and other key stakeholders

recognize the disinformation. The goal isn’t just to correct the record;

it’s to show that the company’s reputation remains intact in the eyes

of those who matter. When a company demonstrates that stakeholders’ opinions are unaﬀected by the fake news, it can eﬀectively neutralize—

## or at least soften—the reputational damage.

Social proof tactics are not a replacement for information-based

strategies such as corrections; rather, they enhance them. By integrating both approaches, companies can develop a more robust and eﬀective response to fake news. Drawing on our research, we oﬀer three ways

to leverage social proof to counter disinformation: monitoring social

resonance, ensuring transparency, and activating allies.

To illustrate these principles, we present a plausible scenario of a

## ﬁctional organic food company—Vero Organics—whose reputation for

pesticide-free products is challenged by a fabricated video alleging that

it secretly uses synthetic and harmful pesticides on its farms. The video

claims that certain pesticides—banned worldwide because of their links

to birth defects and terminal illnesses—were used with the knowledge

of the company’s management. According to the footage, which shows

workers spraying chemicals on crops using equipment bearing Vero’s

logo, leaders not only ignored the risks but also pressured workers

to apply the synthetic pesticides and allegedly threatened them with

termination if they spoke out. Vero navigates the unfolding situation

using the three principles.

- 1. Monitor social resonance. It is critical that companies understand

the dynamics of social inﬂuence—who is inﬂuencing the conversation

and who is being inﬂuenced—in addition to simply monitoring social

media for problems. In accordance with the traditional playbook for

countering disinformation, Vero has social-listening tools in place.

Some of these are automated, but employees and key partners (such as suppliers) are also trained by IT and internal communication staﬀ

in how to spot fake news quickly and how to report and respond to

it. Through this early warning system, the alarm is ﬁrst raised over

a spike in mentions of “synthetic pesticides” and Vero’s brand name,

which draws the crisis management team’s attention to the fake news

story. Key players on the team include the chief communications oﬃcer,

the social-media intelligence lead, legal counsel, a crisis PR specialist,

and a senior executive spokesperson. The customer service and internal

communications teams provide additional support. Given the nature of

the disinformation, specialists in cybersecurity and food security are

called in as well.

Instead of continuing to follow the traditional playbook and

immediately crafting a defensive reply, the crisis management team applies an important test to avoid the Streisand eﬀect: Has the news

reached the company’s visibility threshold? Resisting the urge to

publicly refute fake news can be diﬃcult, so Vero has established

a predetermined threshold to prevent knee-jerk reactions that might

# inadvertently amplify disinformation.

After ascertaining that the crisis has reached the threshold, the team

analyzes the data to identify the key groups that are spreading the fake

news. Social media is rife with self-proclaimed experts, bloggers, and

celebrities, so companies have to invest resources in advance of a crisis

to understand who the inﬂuencers are on topics relevant to them. In

Vero’s case, the origin of the video is traced to an anonymous activist

account, and the communities engaging most with the content are

## health-conscious consumers, organic food bloggers, and sustainability

advocates. Understanding who is shaping the conversation allows the

crisis management team to better decide how to enter the conversation

and establish social proof in a tailored way.

# Joseph Ernst/The Sideline Collective

The importance of early monitoring is seen in the case mentioned above

of Wayfair, which in July 2020 became aware of a conspiracy theory

alleging that the company was involved in child traﬃcking. Social

media posts claimed that extremely high-priced cabinets and pillows on

Wayfair’s site were actually fronts for selling missing children, pointing

to product names that coincidentally matched the names of missing

kids. What started as a conversation on Reddit quickly spread across

Facebook, Instagram, TikTok, and YouTube. Wayfair monitored social

media chatter and trending keywords as the story gained traction, with

“Wayfair” being mentioned alongside traﬃcking claims and hashtags

like #WayfairGate. Within a few days, the conspiracy posts amassed

millions of views on TikTok and other platforms. An analysis showed

that ampliﬁers were known information inﬂuencers who had previously

spread conspiracy theories, conﬁrming the need to respond—rather

than remain silent—to avoid long-lasting reputational damage.

Now consider the example of a company that didn’t recognize the

spread of fake news quickly enough. In November 2024, the Danish-

Swedish dairy company Arla Foods became aware of fake news

spreading about its use of the cow-feed additive Bovaer, which the

company trialed to reduce methane emissions in dairy herds on UK

farms. The supplement had been approved by the European Food Safety

Authority and the UK’s Food Standards Agency, and it had been in

commercial use since 2021. Despite scientiﬁc evidence that Bovaer

didn’t pose a health risk to humans or animals, social media posts on

X accused Arla Foods of poisoning consumers. Videos showed angry

customers pouring Arla milk down the sink and throwing Arla butter

in the trash. The baseless concerns were ampliﬁed and legitimized by

farmers, many of whom posted on social media that they opposed the

use of Bovaer, and by a member of the UK parliament, who demanded

on X that authorities carry out an urgent review of it. Although other

dairy brands also used the additive, the fake news targeted mainly Arla

Foods. The company eventually responded but only after the story had

been widely ampliﬁed.

- 2. Ensure transparency. To eﬀectively ﬁght fake news, companies must

demonstrate their credibility. The best way to do that is to expose their

processes to customers’ and other stakeholders’ scrutiny before a crisis hits. Companies can then enlist those stakeholders, who can oﬀer their personal validation to eﬀorts to dispel false information.

Here’s how Vero successfully orchestrates this. As a preemptive strategy,

Vero has cultivated relationships with key allies across the organic

food ecosystem: agricultural scientists, sustainable-farming advocates,

## health inﬂuencers, consumer groups, and supply chain intermediaries

such as retailers aligned with its values. Vero has invited these

stakeholders to visit production sites and learn about its rigorous

processes, ensuring that they are well-acquainted with its zero-pesticide

policies and have seen the supporting documentation. To further

build trust, Vero has welcomed external and independent certiﬁcation

agencies to assess its production processes, providing guarantees that

the company meets the highest standards of organic production.

Ordinary customers have also participated in tours of its farms, which

showcase its sustainable practices.

To further reinforce its credibility, Vero and its retail partners

## conduct educational sessions at points of purchase and on social

media platforms to reassure consumers about the authenticity of its

pesticide-free claim. “Know Your Fruit” stands are periodically set

up in major retailers’ stores, where produce is displayed alongside

descriptions of the characteristics of organic products, comparing them

with nonorganic produce and featuring tasting sessions. Additionally,

Vero maintains a dedicated online transparency platform, “Vero

Transparency,” where customers can access organic certiﬁcation details,

## farm practices, sustainability initiatives, and customer endorsements.

This platform includes myth-busting FAQs and educational content on

# organic farming standards.

Such transparency has been adopted by real companies in a range

of high-scrutiny industries. For example, to counter persistent urban

legends—such as claims that its burgers contained earthworms or “pink

slime”—McDonald’s launched the transparency campaign “Our food.

Your questions,” inviting customers to ask questions and providing

clear answers. As part of the campaign, McDonald’s invited camera

crews into its factories, hosted live Q&A sessions on social media, and

published detailed information on its website. Similarly, Starbucks has

a webpage, “Starbucks for the Record,” where the company directly addresses misinformation targeting the coﬀee maker, using CEO letters,

## statements from other company leaders, and FAQs.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How to Counter Fake News

Other companies have used more-sophisticated approaches to

authenticate their claims. For instance, some fashion companies have

adopted digital tools that allow consumers or other stakeholders to trace

the origins of their products, see where they are produced, and gather

important information about suppliers. Players in the precious metals

industry have started very ambitious programs to make the supply

## chain—from extraction to the sale of end products—more transparent

by allowing consumers, investors, and other stakeholders to digitally

monitor the path of precious metals as they move along the chain.

Domino’s Pizza turned skepticism into a marketing advantage by openly

sharing real customer feedback—even negative reviews—while live-

streaming the preparation of its pizzas to prove quality claims.

By making transparency a proactive strategy rather than a reactive

defense—“prebunking” versus debunking—organizations create an

environment in which fake news struggles to take hold in the ﬁrst place.

- 3. Activate allies. Although radical transparency lays the groundwork

for establishing social proof, it is not enough on its own. When fake

news emerges, companies must actively enlist credible voices—experts,

industry allies, and engaged consumers—to ﬂood the information

## landscape with accurate and supportive narratives.

In our hypothetical scenario, Vero mobilizes its community of partners

and experts with whom it has built a relationship through its

transparency campaign. Vero alerts these stakeholders that the fake

news about pesticide use threatens their own reputations as well. For

example, retailers selling Vero products might ﬁnd that consumers

who believe the story are starting to question their reliability. Experts

who had previously lauded Vero’s zero-pesticide policy might ﬁnd

themselves accused of industry capture—working in the interest of the

industry and not the public good. So instead of hoping that its partners

will come to its defense, Vero makes sure they understand what the

stakes are for them and asks for their help in quashing the fake news.

Here’s how the mobilization campaign plays out: Alerted by Vero,

certiﬁcation agencies issue statements verifying that Vero’s farms

meet organic standards, while agricultural scientists explain why

the viral video’s claims are implausible. On social channels, Vero

encourages customers who participated in the transparency campaign

to release videos of their experience at its farms—an authentic type

of content that resonates with other consumers. Curated collections of

the consumer-generated content are reposted on Vero’s social media

# channels.

And Vero’s outreach goes even further. The company engages its loyal

customer base, suppliers and employees through a campaign called

#RootedInTruth. The campaign involves suppliers and employees who

share personal stories about why they trust Vero, alongside photos of

their favorite Vero products and their own recipes that use them. The

#RootedInTruth campaign has two key strengths. First, it encourages

spontaneous storytelling driven by emotions and personal experiences, which eﬀectively captures attention and builds trust. Second, and most

important, it creates a perception that ordinary customers (and not just

elite experts) do not believe the fake news, further reinforcing social

# proof.

In 2011, Taco Bell faced a fake-news crisis when a class-action lawsuit

falsely claimed that its taco ﬁlling contained only 35% beef. The

fabricated allegations spread rapidly. Faced with declining public

trust, Taco Bell acted quickly, launching a multichannel response

emphasizing transparency and credible voices. As part of its traditional

PR crisis playbook, the company published full-page newspaper ads

with the bold headline “Thank You for Suing Us,” using humor and

hard facts about the chain’s actual ingredient components to combat

the false narrative. It also leveraged third-party validation by the USDA,

ensuring that consumers saw the claim debunked by a recognized

## authority rather than just by the company itself.

Going beyond traditional methods, Taco Bell’s then-CEO, Greg

Creed, addressed concerns in a YouTube video, and employees

and franchise owners spoke directly to customers in local media

interviews, reinforcing that the brand stood by its product. On social

media, Taco Bell actively engaged customers, responding in real

time to questions and encouraging satisﬁed consumers to share their

experiences, creating a wave of organic social proof. The strategy

worked. Negative online sentiment quickly declined, and within a

few months, the lawsuit was withdrawn. When facing entirely false

allegations, companies must not only correct the record but also

## mobilize credible voices—customers, employees, and authoritative

third parties—to actively shape the narrative.

. . .

The growing sophistication and reach of fake news pose a threat to

corporate reputations—even when the disinformation is blatantly false.

Traditional crisis response strategies, which focus on presenting factual

evidence to refute false claims, are insuﬃcient. A robust response

## combines the credibility of factual evidence with the persuasive power

of social proof—ensuring a stronger and more resilient defense against

# reputational threats.
