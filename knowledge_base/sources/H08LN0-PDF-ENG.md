In 2021, the average CEO at one of the top 350 ﬁrms in the U.S. was paid

$27.8 million—a rate that skyrocketed by an astonishing 1,460% since

- 1978. During this same period, the average worker’s pay grew by just a

# meager 18.1%.

When employees witness disproportionate pay for C-suite executives or

unfair treatment compared to other stakeholders, they often perceive

a lack of fairness within the organization. This perception can be toxic

for morale, leading to disloyalty and resentment. But could it lead to

increased whistleblowing?

In our research, published recently in Strategic Management Journal,

we set out to look at why employees blow the whistle on organizational

wrongdoing. We found that two factors—outsized disparities in

## executive compensation and treatment of external stakeholders—could

make employees likelier to blow the whistle on their companies. We also

identiﬁed strategies to help companies to avoid this long-term damage

## to their people, reputations, and ﬁnancial health.

# Our Research

In our two studies, we examined the consequences of such large pay

## disparities between top executives and average employees. The gap

between CEOs and average employees has been growing alarmingly

wider over time: 20-to-1 in 1965; 59-to-1 in 1989; 366-to-1 in 2020; and

399-to-1 in 2021.

We also studied how ﬁrms treat their external stakeholders, such as

the community, environment, and customers. We used Morgan Stanley

Capital International’s KLD annual ratings, which evaluate companies

based on their performance in areas including environmental impact,

## community involvement, employee relations, customer relations, and

governance. Each area includes multiple dimensions for both strengths

## and concerns. For example, a company with strong environmental

practices and positive community engagement would score 1 in the

relevant strength dimensions, while one involved in harmful activities

would be marked as 1 in the corresponding concern dimensions.

We measured ﬁrms’ treatment of diﬀerent stakeholders using

standardized strength scores, calculated as the total strength score

divided by the total number of dimensions in corresponding areas.

For instance, in 2010-2011, Amazon was recognized for its exceptional

customer service (earning 1 out of 3 KLD strength dimensions for

customer treatment). At the same time, it faced severe criticism for

poor warehouse working conditions (earning 0 out of 5 KLD strength

dimensions for employee treatment). This represents a signiﬁcant

disparity in ﬁrm’s treatment of customers and employees.

We used both archival data and experimental data to look at how

pay disparity and external stakeholder disparity aﬀect the likelihood

of employees blowing the whistle and reporting organizational

wrongdoing to external authorities (in our case, regarding unsafe/

unhealthy working conditions).

We found that in ﬁrms with greater disparities, employees were

more likely to become whistleblowers—and this likelihood was further

enhanced when employees believed they could easily ﬁnd another job.

We also conducted two experiments to further understand the

psychology behind this decision. In the ﬁrst experiment, which involved

247 full-time employees in the U.S., we manipulated CEO-employee pay

disparities (to be high or low) and found CEO-employee pay disparities

led to higher “willingness to report a health-related issue—inadequate

## ventilation—to OSHA” i.e., employee whistleblowing, through a

reduction in employees’ sense of loyalty toward the ﬁrm. In the second

experiment, which involved 217 full-time employees in the U.S., we

manipulated external stakeholder-employee treatment disparities and

found external stakeholder-employee treatment disparities increased

employee willingness to report an issue to OSHA, or whistleblowing,

through a reduction in employees’ sense of loyalty toward the ﬁrm.

In addition, our supplementary analyses also show that perceived

unfairness was the culprit of reduced loyalty, which, in turn, led

these employees to report organizational wrongdoing to the external

# authorities.

## Implications for Decision-Makers and Organizations

Our ﬁndings have implications for CEOs and top executives of ﬁrms,

policymakers, and boards of directors. They can each take the following

# actions:

CEOs and top executives: Consider taking a pay cut, and balance stakeholder treatment.

CEOs and top executives, especially in the U.S., must ﬁrst realize that

downside eﬀects of signiﬁcant pay gaps include diminished employee

## loyalty, more whistleblowing, and potential damage to the ﬁrm’s

# reputation and ﬁnancial stability.

Relatedly, CEOs and top executives need to be cognizant of imbalances

in treatment of external stakeholders versus internal stakeholders, as it

is the employees as a whole who contribute the most to the company’s

# bottom line.

While ensuring fair treatment of external stakeholders is critical,

striking a balance between stakeholder priorities is equally important.

Treating employees poorly while focusing resources on external

stakeholders creates a harmful imbalance, eroding employee loyalty.

As labor-market mobility also impacts the likelihood of employee

whistleblowing, executives also need to pay extra attention when

unemployment rate becomes lower, for instance. Conversely, investing

in fair compensation and equitable treatment for employees can create

a virtuous cycle: Engaged and loyal employees are more likely to

## champion the ﬁrm’s mission and contribute to its long-term success.

## Boards: Prioritize and safeguard employee well-being.

It’s the board’s responsibility to ensure the ﬁnancial health of the

organization. They should thus ensure that CEOs and top executives are

held accountable for wider indicators of ﬁrm performance, including

but not limited to employee wellbeing (such as enhancing employee

## safety and health), as well as short- and long-term objectives. This will

safeguard against unfair perceptions by employees, but also ensure that

the employees will remain more loyal to the organization and perform

# better.

## Policymakers: Use effective tax policies.

Exorbitant pay for CEOs and other top executives can be controlled

if an eﬀective tax policy is introduced to curtail “excessive” executive

pay beyond the values these executives bring to the ﬁrm. In addition,

another incentive may be introduced for tax cuts for those ﬁrms who

treat their employees better. For instance, if the average employee pay is

increased substantively, tax cuts may be provided to incentivize ﬁrms.

. . .

As we’ve seen in the past few decades, extreme pay disparities

and imbalances in treatment of external stakeholders can have

unintended and damaging consequences for organizations. CEOs,

boards of directors, and policymakers must take proactive steps to

address these inequities. Doing so is not just a matter of ethics

but also a pragmatic strategy for fostering trust, loyalty, and long-

term organizational success. By fostering a fairer and more equitable

organizational environment, companies can align their values with

their actions, ensuring a sustainable future for all stakeholders.
