Transformation programs have become ubiquitous, with more

than one-third of large organizations engaged in some form of

transformation at any given time. But the conventional model that most

companies rely on for transformation has faltered in the wake of today’s

rapidly changing business environment. Leaders need a fresh approach

— one better suited to the continuously evolving nature of our world.

## HBR / Digital Article / A New Model for Continuous Transformation

Typical transformation eﬀorts are organized as programs with a

deﬁned beginning and end, often overseen by a program management oﬃce. Rooted in a change model popularized by German American

psychologist Kurt Lewin in the 1950s, this approach involves three

stages: “unfreeze, change, and refreeze.” While eﬀective for discrete

projects like implementing a new payroll system, this model falls short

in today’s dynamic business environment. The continuous evolution of

the external landscape demands ongoing business transformation, with

no room for pausing, refreezing, and stepping away.

In this article, we draw on our research and experience to describe the

## three key drivers of continuous transformation:

- 1. Adopt an Agile Mindset

## Unlike the conventional “unfreeze, change, refreeze” approach, which

implies change represents only a temporary disruption, an agile

orientation embraces the philosophy of “rethink, reshape, repeat” —

an ongoing quest for excellence. Under this paradigm, transformation

becomes a perpetual journey involving assessing the company’s

strategy, prioritizing critical issues, carefully considering potential

alternatives for addressing each issue, choosing the best course of

action, adapting the organization accordingly, and then moving to the

next critical issue. Much like agile software development, where tasks

progress from “to do” to “doing” to “done,” business transformation

should involve a similar continuous process of issue identiﬁcation and

# resolution.

By embracing an agile mindset, organizations unlock the potential

for sustained innovation and adaptation, thereby making continuous

change a core capability. The transformation of State Farm, a company

we worked with, serves as a compelling example. As a leading provider

of various insurance services including auto, home, life, health, and

business coverage, State Farm had long been a trusted name in the

industry. However, in 2019, the company’s leadership recognized a shift

in the fundamentals of their business. The insurance landscape was

evolving beyond merely oﬀering coverage; it was now about delivering

personalized experiences, swift service, and seamless claims processing

within an intensifying pricing environment. Customers increasingly demanded convenience, eﬃciency, and tailored solutions. In response,

State Farm recognized the need to rethink its operations, processes,

and technology infrastructure to remain competitive in this swiftly

changing market.

A pivotal factor in State Farm’s successful transformation was the

## adoption of an agile mindset by its leadership. While previous

change eﬀorts at the company had been treated as episodic,

## the pace of change in the insurance industry now necessitated

continuous transformation. Accordingly, State Farm built a “persistent

change capability,” essentially a suite of tools empowering executives

to continually reassess and reshape the company’s strategy and

operations. In addition, in working with State Farm, we saw how the

company’s newly established “Change Center of Excellence (CoE)”

provided support and coaching to leaders throughout the organization

in driving transformative change and helping the impacted workforce

adapt. This group also served as a central repository for best practices,

approaches, and tools utilized at State Farm to strengthen ongoing

# change initiatives.

State Farm’s transformation journey has already yielded signiﬁcant

beneﬁts for both the company and its customers. By embracing

digital technologies and modernizing processes, State Farm improved customer experience, enhanced operational eﬃciency, and achieved

substantial cost savings. Notably, between 2018 and 2023, State Farm

insurance sector — grew from $100 billion to nearly $135 billion, and

the growth across its primary lines of business surpassed the average

# growth rate for each sector.

- 2. Use aspirations to continuously challenge and stretch the organization.

Relying solely on top-down targets, even those based on external

benchmarks and industry best practices, often falls short of fostering

sustained performance improvement. While these targets may initially inspire eﬃciency enhancements, they often lead to complacency once

achieved, perpetuating the rigid “unfreeze, change, refreeze” model of

# transformation.

Instead, organizations should cultivate aspirations that challenge and

motivate at every level. Unlike static targets, aspirations serve as

dynamic catalysts for ongoing improvement. They represent goals

currently beyond the reach of the company’s existing plans, but not

so distant as to be perceived as unattainable. Unlike ﬁxed targets

that stagnate progress once achieved, aspirations evolve with the

organization and its strategy. They continuously push the organization

to adapt to changing market conditions, technological advancements,

evolving customer needs, and even growing environmental concerns.

Consider the example of Ørsted, a multinational energy company based

in Denmark formerly known as DONG Energy. In 2008, its leadership

embarked on a journey to transition the company from a traditional

## power provider reliant on fossil fuels to a pioneering force in renewable

# energy.

At the heart of Ørsted’s transformation was a singular, audacious goal

encapsulated in a simple number: 85%. Historically, the company

derived 85% of its energy from fossil fuels, with only a meager 15% from

sustainable sources. The leadership resolved to ﬂip this ratio entirely,

aiming for 85% of its energy to come from renewables like wind and

# solar.

Initially, Ørsted lacked a concrete plan to achieve this ambitious

objective. There were no existing benchmarks to study, nor industry

best practices to emulate — Ørsted ‘s goal surpassed anything seen in

the sector before. This bold ambition compelled everyone within the

company to confront harsh realities about its business model, including

the urgent need to address climate change and the ﬁnite nature of fossil

fuel resources, and reshape its business portfolio.

Henrik Poulsen, who served as Ørsted ‘s CEO from 2012 to 2020,

leveraged this bold ambition to rally a workforce initially skeptical

of such monumental change, inspiring them to embrace creative

solutions. The company sold oﬀ its oil and gas business, phased-out

the use of coal for power generation, and acquired Deepwater Wind

and other assets to expand its position in oﬀshore wind. Ørsted set a

timeline of 30 years to achieve its goal, yet remarkably accomplished it

# in just a decade.

- 3. Build transformation into the company’s operating rhythm.

To thrive in today’s fast-paced environment, leaders must seamlessly

integrate transformation into the company’s operating rhythm. This

involves incorporating change initiatives into existing governance

processes and forums, ensuring that evolution becomes a natural part of

running the business.

By embedding transformation initiatives into the operating rhythm,

leadership can ensure alignment between strategic goals and day-to-

day activities. This integration fosters a holistic approach to the

change eﬀort, enabling organizations to respond swiftly to evolving

## market trends, customer demands, and competitive pressures. When

transformation becomes part of the company’s operating rhythm,

accountability for driving change is distributed across all levels of the

# organization.

Take the remarkable evolution of Dell Technologies. When Michael Dell,

in collaboration with Silver Lake Partners, took his company private in

2013, he recognized the imperative for broad-based transformation. This

decision came at a time when many were predicting the “death of the

PC.” Proving these skeptics wrong necessitated the transformation of

Dell Computer into an enterprise technology powerhouse, known today

# as Dell Technologies.

As we describe in our recent HBR article, Michael Dell has embedded

transformation into his company’s operating rhythm. Following the

privatization, the executive leadership team (ELT) instituted the

Dell Management Model (DMM), supplanting the existing strategic

## planning, resource allocation, and business performance review

processes. At the heart of the DMM lay the Dell Agenda — a backlog

## of strategic imperatives essential to the company’s transformation.

Addressing items on the Dell Agenda became a primary focus of ELT

meetings and other leadership sessions. The Dell Agenda remained

dynamic; as issues were resolved and integrated into the company’s

strategy, new issues were added, ensuring the transformation remained

an ongoing process. As the DMM became ingrained in the company’s

operating rhythm, transformation became an integral part of daily

## leadership practices at every level of the company.

The results speak volumes. By the close of 2023, the ongoing

transformation at Dell had yielded a 10-fold return on Michael Dell’s

initial investment in 2013. Our analysis of total shareholder returns for

large companies reveals that this number surpasses the performance of

any other public company with revenues exceeding $30 billion.

. . .

In today’s fast-paced world, business transformation can no longer

be treated as a one-time project. Continuous change necessitates

ongoing transformation. The traditional approach of “unfreeze, change,

refreeze” must give way to a new mindset: “rethink, reshape, repeat.” It’s

## through this continuous process of transformation that companies can

truly realize their full potential.
