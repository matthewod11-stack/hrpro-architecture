making lifelong connections, and a writer putting the finaltouches on a manuscript that I had started the past year.Looking back, I can see that the future self I had so eagerly drawnup was aspirational, but at the time, it gave me goals, and Ithought achieving those goals would make me into the personwho I wanted to be.That is, until I tried to live them out.As the fall semester came to a close, I had checked a couple ofitems off my list: I conducted some independent research andeven made progress in writing the novel.But I was unhappy.In my attempt to constantly do more, I stopped eating enough tomaintain my health and lost forty pounds of muscle. On bad days,I’d skip out on social events, go to the gym, and run for miles andmiles just to clear my head. Despite vigorously taking steps tomorph into my future self, something was missing. I just couldn’tunderstand what it was. Since then, I’ve come to realize that thefuture self I had imagined was a toxic idol.In the past few years, the concept of using visualization as tool tomanifest the dream version of our selves has come into vogue inboth personal and professional development circles. It seems likeanyone with a pulse is talking about how to adopt a growthmindset and evolve, specifically as it relates to their roles, their

qualities, or other dispositions about the self that they seek to fillor change.Admittedly, I’m somewhat guilty of doing this, but the idea ofmanifesting a future self defined entirely by our current visions ofwhat a fulfilling life would look like and what we imagine we mustdo to achieve it, as tempting as it may be, presents a pervasivephilosophical and practical problem.There’s a sense that if only we are able to

make the correct

choices, network properly, go to the right career fairs, find theright internships, and work for the right number of hours, thenand only then will we find some semblance of happiness.Ultimately, we boil down the search for happiness, personal andprofessional fulfillment, into a series of plug-and-play equations.While it’s true that we need to put in the work to grow and excel atany given thing, the matter of self-discovery and self-creation aremuch more nuanced than that.From the standpoint of an analytical philosopher, the future selfonly exists by virtue of not existing yet. It is indeterminate andalways in flux — and this is at the heart of the problem. Those ofus who hold a rigid and self-definitional vision of who we want tobe, say 10 years down the line, may unknowingly be using theconcept of our future self to understand who we are in thepresent, and this can be damaging.If, for example, you tie your hopes and dreams to a certain goal —let’s say going to a specific college or landing a competitiveinternship at your dream firm — failing to fulfill theseexpectations disrupts the path you have deemed necessary tobecoming your future self and can cause you

great distress. Thisdisruption of continuity then creates a gulf between your

understanding of who you think you should be and who youactually are.More specifically, when you tether your sense of self to suchspecific goals, you can unintentionally shut the door on a wholesubset of possibilities or predispose yourself to not takingopportunities that might seem extraneous to your goals, eventhough, in reality, they are foundational to achieving happiness orprofessional prosperity.In The Humanism of Existentialism, the French philosopher andexistentialist Jean-Paul Sartre argues that existential free choice islike a sort of artwork. Any piece of art is going to have differentmerits depending on its context and content. He writes, “We haveto take things as they are. And moreover, to say that we inventvalues means neither more nor less than this; that there is nosense in life a priori. Life is nothing until it is lived; but it is yoursto make sense of, and the value of it is nothing else but the sensethat you choose.”What Sartre is essentially arguing is that the process of becomingour future self is an inventive one. The trouble with a self-definitional concept of the future self (one that we use to makesense of ourselves in the present) is that it seeks to give a concretebasis, a mold to which we’re meant to conform, but ultimatelyself-creation is artistic. We’ve never done this before, and weshould face it as a creative endeavor. We should not treat theformative years of our lives as some sterile exercise in gametheory or cost-benefit analysis.To shift our mindsets, we first need to debunk the common beliefthat we are justified in our conceptions of future self, that ourdreams or personal goals have some a priori justification. I arguethat this is not true, especially when considering self-definitional

models of the future self. Our future selves are not aspirations, butmetaphysical judgements that we impose — either uncritically orunintentionally — to make sense of our own existence. That is tosay, our goals, roles, and aspirations are not simply “good” or“valuable” on their own. We must recognize that it is we,ourselves, who ascribe value and justification to them, and notthe other way around.Of course, changing our outlooks in this way is not easy. As Sartrenotes, our tendency to seek a unification between our sense of selfand our “purpose” is a natural instinct. We long for some Platonicessence, for the universe itself to bestow deep meaning untoourselves and our actions, but find none because humanity isungrounded and “condemned to be free.” In other words, anymeaning we choose to see is exactly that — a choice, and our ownfree choice at that.At every given moment, we must choose how it is that we willrelate to the world around us and what we choose to do with ourlives.At the same time, that is not to say that there is no place formaintaining a concept of future self at all.

Research on creativeself-expectations suggests that in creative settings, or those inwhich we give ourselves the freedom to explore and self-define,future self expectations may lead to a self-fulfilling prophecyeffect, which can allow us to be more productive in achieving ourgoals.I believe that the answer, then, is to allow ourselves to recognizethat our future selves are indeterminate. We must creatively(rather than methodically) work towards their actualization. If wecan do that, we can dream without consequence.

To demonstrate this healthier way of thinking, let’s return to ourinitial example. Let’s say you have your mind set on a dreamschool or internship, but you find yourself staring at a pile ofrejection letters. Instead of allowing that challenge to disrupt yoursense of self and make you feel like a complete failure, you can tryto accept and creatively make use of the experience. Think of it asa part of your story. There’s no honest way to escape such a thing,but there is equally nothing stopping you from using it asmotivation in your next endeavor. By weaving the experience intoyour self-understanding, you remove it as an obstacle to reachingyour future goals.This is a rather fine line to walk, and might more aptly bedescribed as a tightrope pressed against a razor’s edge. Thesimplest, and possibly quickest, way to shift our mindsets mightcome from recognizing the human “

positivity bias,” or thedisposition that we will generally be better in the future. We canrecognize this, understand it, and choose not to give into it. Wecan choose to accept that whether or not we meet theexpectations we inevitably set for our future selves, we have thepower and free will to decide how we relate to the art that our selfhas become in the present.
