## During their strategy off-site, the executives at a global retail

organization turn their attention away from the strategic plan to address

a thorny issue. A junior employee has started vociferously criticizing, in

meetings and on Slack, the organization’s commitment to sustainability

objectives. The executives’ conversation has been precipitated by

months of behind-the-scenes questioning by this person and others.

In fact, senior leaders are concerned that this group is on the verge

of speaking up publicly about their disappointment, highlighting what

they perceive to be a gap between what the company espouses and what

it actually practices. Within the executive team there is a divide: Some

want to shut the employee down while others want to invite them into

# the strategic discussion.

Leadership teams around the world are facing similar challenges about

how to engage with employee activism — whether in relation to their

organization’s impact on the environment, commitment to diversity,

## equity and inclusion, stance on the Middle East crisis, supply chain

ethics, or the myriad other topics where businesses are seen, by some, to

be contributing to problems or to have some inﬂuence on the solutions.

Our research conducted over the past decade has focused on “speaking

truth to power.” Speciﬁcally, we explore “conversational habits” — what

gets talked about and what doesn’t, who gets heard and who gets

ignored, and the consequences for performance, innovation, ethical

# conduct, and talent management.

Noticing the rise of employee activism, we decided to quantitatively

and qualitatively examine leadership responses to activist voices — why

particular choices were made and what happened in the aftermath.

As a result, we identiﬁed three key tools to help leaders make

more-thoughtful decisions rather than simply reacting and leaving

themselves open to the negative consequences of ill-considered claims

and commitments. These tools include a taxonomy to help you

understand your typical response to activism, an ACT IF framework

for choosing when to do or say something, and suggestions for how to

pause, pay closer attention to what’s happening in the world and what

your employees care about, and learn from your successes and failures.

# A Taxonomy of Leadership Responses

We’ve observed six common responses to activist issues, ranging from

oblivious to proactive. As you read this list, consider various activist

issues in your organization — and how your leadership team reacted.

- Nonexistent (“Activism? What activism?”): Leaders are oblivious to

activist voices or so distanced that they are unaware of these voices

and thus do nothing.

- Suppression (“Expel it before it spreads”): Leaders attempt to

quash voices either through directives that certain subjects are not

up for discussion or by making it clear (explicitly or implicitly) that if

employees speak up they will face negative consequences.

- Facadism (“Let’s just say the right thing”): Leaders respond with

positive words but take no meaningful action, either because they

never really intend to do anything or because they become distracted

# by the next hot topic.

- Defensive engagement (“Do what the lawyers say we have to”):

Leaders agree to engage on an issue but only up to the point of legal

requirement — they do the minimum.

- Dialogic engagement (“Let’s sit down, listen, and learn”): Leaders

understand that they don’t know enough about certain issues, are

curious to learn more, and take steps to share decision-making —

marking a critical shift in the power dynamic.

- Stimulating activism (“Let’s be the activist!”): Leaders identify

themselves and their organization as activists. They publicly stand

for a particular cause, and they recruit, reward, and retain employee

# activists.

We’ve found that the ﬁrst three responses tend to lead to employee

silence, arising from fear and cynicism, which hurts performance and

retention, so we advise staying away from them. Another key ﬁnding of

our work is that people in management perceive their responses very

diﬀerently than others in the organization do. We’ve written about this

tendency for senior leaders to overestimate how approachable they are,

the quality of their listening, and the degree to which employees feel

able to speak out. As a result, they are often taken by surprise when

## strong feelings on an issue surface, sometimes explosively.

A much-discussed example of this played out at Basecamp in 2021. CEO

Jason Fried wrote to employees that there was to be “no more societal

and political discussions on our company Basecamp account.” This was

met with a backlash, and roughly a third of employees promptly quit. A

few days later Fried blogged, “We started with policy changes that felt

simple, reasonable, and principled, and it blew things up internally in

ways we never anticipated.”

However, we are not implying that leadership teams need to sit down in

extensive dialogue or take a stand on every issue. Of course, they don’t

and couldn’t — not while sticking to their main business of running a

# business.

This raises the question of how to choose when to act.

# The ACT IF Framework

An organization can respond to employee activism in diﬀerent ways

depending upon the issue and context. In the opening example, we

outlined how diﬀerent executives wanted to respond. Some reacted

angrily, pushing for the employee to be reprimanded and cautioned.

Others appeared more open, and there was even the suggestion that

this activist employee be invited to the next leadership meeting to

lead a discussion. Our ACT IF framework describes ﬁve key inﬂuencing

factors that should shape the leadership response. (It can also be used

by activists in choosing which actions to take.)

## HBR / The Big Idea / A Leader’s Guide to Navigating Employee Activism

- Authority: How much authority, power, or status do we have in the

wider organizational system compared to other stakeholders? And how

do we wish to use the authority we have?

- Concern: Is this issue of concern to us or to stakeholders? Do we really

know how much stakeholders care about this issue?

- Theory of change: Do we feel we can make a diﬀerence? Do we feel

we can resist change in the “outside” world, or do we see how we

participate and are inﬂuenced by it? What role do we believe we can

play in inﬂuencing change?

- Identity: Do we consider ourselves to be activist? What do we stand for

and what don’t we?

- Field: What is happening in the organization/industry/country/world

that impacts the action we feel we should take? For example, is this in

the news? Are our competitors acting?

Considering these factors together and with employee, customer,

supplier, and investor input, you are more likely to make wise decisions.

One senior pharmaceutical executive we spoke to lamented over the

rushed communication his company sent out after the Hamas attacks

in Israel. A speedy response was arguably necessary, but because

the management team did no conferring with employees or relevant

network groups, it ended up having to release another statement two

days later, apologizing for the deep upset its original missive had caused

to some, including Palestinian employees, customers, and suppliers.

Had they used the ACT IF framework at the start, they may have

recognized the concern of these stakeholders and avoided mistakenly

believing they had unilateral authority in deciding how to respond.

Perhaps they would have talked about how or why they would want

to make a diﬀerence (identity and theory of change) in the situation

rather than being overly inﬂuenced by several competitors who “got

## their statements out before us” (an extremely partial understanding of

# the ﬁeld).

Had the management team paused, the executive acknowledged to

us, they would have seen that their primary concern was for the

company’s employees in the geographic region — their suﬀering and

their immediate needs. The organization’s corporate identity had never

previously included taking a stand on political or humanitarian issues

generally, but their values were to look after one another and to respect

# diﬀerent views, in dialogue.

This brings us to our third suggestion.

# Permission to Pause

Many organizations we’ve worked with seem pathologically busy, driven

by the need to achieve more with less and meet immediate targets while

discounting the longer game of creating sustainable value. A recurring

theme in our research is leaders’ wish for “permission to pause” so that

they can respond thoughtfully to issues and pay attention to the world

more broadly, rather than ﬁxating on the immediate task and “moving

fast.”

With this in mind, we asked leaders what advice they’d oﬀer, in

hindsight, about responding well to employee activists. From their

answers, we drew out four recommendations:

Notice your “baggage” about activists and activism. Activism is

becoming ever more controversial, and leaders often react without

appreciating their own and their organization’s biases, assumptions,

and emotions about the issue and the employees raising it.

Accept that you almost certainly don’t know how your employees

feel about some issues. That’s because you aren’t as available or as

approachable as you think. Every leader has a “power shadow,” which

means that they’re told only what others believe they can bear to hear.

## HBR / The Big Idea / A Leader’s Guide to Navigating Employee Activism

Engage employees with genuine curiosity about how others see the

world. This requires leaders to put long-held ideas and beliefs up for

## debate and to share decision-making duties on any action that should

be taken. You won’t be able to satisfy everyone, but you can show that

you’ve got a robust, respectful process for ﬁguring out which issues to

take a stand on.

Make sure corporate identity, purpose, and activist intentions are

discussed and included in your strategic plan. Not everyone on the

management team we referred to at the start of the article connected

the debate they’d just had on strategy with their ensuing conversation

on activist employees. You won’t be able to predict every issue that will

come up — but it will help if you have already had deep conversations

with your colleagues about your collective values and how they ﬁt into

your strategic goals, rather than having to rush those discussions in

# moments of crisis.

Employee activism challenges our assumptions about what leaders can

and should attend to when running a business — and the extent to

which organizations can stand apart from the social, economic, and

environmental issues that are part of a noisy public sphere.

Leaders must come to terms with this shift, cede some control, and work

with stakeholders to reﬂect on the case for action — and nonaction.

The tools we’ve described help them to do this and to learn, rather than

continuing to make the same mistakes.
