It’s never easy to manage people through tough times. But when

the news is disturbing, and you know your team’s minds are

understandably elsewhere, it can be particularly hard to know how

to best support your people. How do you balance your desire to be

compassionate with the need to continue to get work done? What do you

say — or not say? And what should you do if you’re feeling overwhelmed

# What the Experts Say

Most of us feel overwhelmed, upset, and anxious when faced with

uncertainty. “We have a fundamental neuroanatomy that orients us

toward stress in highly charged times,” explains Rich Fernandez, CEO

of SIY Leadership Institute. And this can start an unhealthy cycle: “A

symptom of distraction is more distraction. Then we feel more anxious,”

says Susan David, a founder of the Institute of Coaching at McLean

Hospital and author of Emotional Agility. On a team, these feelings

can be contagious. “We subtly pick up on the emotions and start to

feel or mimic them ourselves,” she explains. Fernandez believes in

“compassionate management,” where you “seek to understand how you

can be of service and beneﬁt to employees while balancing the need to

keep them on task.” Here are practical ways to do both of those things

while oﬀering support.

Take time to process your own emotions

You’ll be better able to support your team and model resiliency if you

acknowledge and manage any stress and anxiety you feel yourself. Start

by taking the time to understand what you’re feeling. “You want to label

your emotions. Put distance between yourself and them so that you

can make a conscious decision about how to act in a way that’s in line

with your values,” David says. Even when world events feel like they are

spiraling out of control, “you still get to choose whom you want to be,”

David explains. Ask yourself: What’s most important to me? “If one of

your core values is to be collaborative, for example, ask, ‘How can I help

people feel like they’re part of the team?’”

Acknowledge what’s happening

Bottling your emotions, or expecting employees to do the same, can be

counterproductive. These feelings of concern and distress are very real

and “can’t be ignored, denied, or repressed,” says Fernandez. Pretending

that everything is ﬁne, or just trying to go about work as if nothing is

going on, can cause people to disengage or to feel resentful. Instead,

directly address the issue, acknowledging that people may be on edge

and that things are uncertain. At the same time, you should avoid

brooding, where you get stuck in a negative spiral. Acknowledge how

people are feeling, but then “move on to talk about how you want to

act as a team,” David says. You can do this by asking, “How do we want

to treat one another during these times?” Members might agree that

they want to continue delivering a quality product to clients while being

respectful and kind to one another, for example. “It helps a team stay grounded when you reassert and reaﬃrm a shared sense of purpose,”

says David.

# Encourage self-compassion

Some of your team members may be looking around and wondering

how their colleagues are keeping it together while they’re losing sleep.

Encourage them to have some self-compassion and acknowledge that

stress is a normal, physiological response to feeling out of control or

threatened. “Help staﬀ recognize that change can bring about a lack

of agency,” says David, which can send our brains and bodies into

overdrive. If you’re feeling stressed, admit it, or talk about previous

situations in which you’ve felt anxiety, so they know they’re not alone.

Ask people what they need

Talk with employees one-on-one and let them describe what they’re

going through. Do some “perspective-taking by putting yourself in

their shoes,” says Fernandez. You want to “truly understand what they

think and feel, even if you don’t agree or feel the same thing.” This

empathy forms the basis of trust so that you can move into problem-

solving mode. And don’t assume that everyone needs the same things.

Fernandez suggests saying, “It’s a tough time for many people. What

would be most helpful at the moment? Let’s think about it together,

because I want to help and make sure you can navigate the current

challenges so you can be your best.” Maybe they need some extra

guidance on how to reduce distractions or advice on re-prioritizing their

work. You might also give people more ﬂexibility in dictating their work

schedule, and “encourage them to balance the work to be accomplished

## with important self-care needs and their life outside work,” Fernandez

says.

# Model self-care

Sleep, exercise, and good nutrition are proven to help with resilience. So

encourage your team members to take care of themselves, says David.

For example, if an employee tells you they’re taking their phone to

bed to read the news, you might share that you’ve been trying to leave

yours in a separate room. If people tell you that they’re having trouble

staying oﬀ Twitter during the day, invite them to go out for a walk

during your next check-in (you can do this virtually by having a phone

chat while walking in your respective neighborhoods). Of course, it’s

not a manager’s place to dictate these behaviors, but it’s OK to share

what’s worked for you. Mindful breathing also helps to calm anxiety

and increase focus, Fernandez says. Although it may seem awkward to

remind your staﬀ to inhale and exhale, you can share the research on its

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Normalize stress — it’s a common physiological response to

# uncertainty

- Help your team feel grounded by reaﬃrming your shared purpose

- Encourage people to take care of themselves in whatever small ways

help build their resilience

# Don’t:

- Neglect your own anxiety and concerns

- Ignore people’s emotions

- Assume that everyone on your team needs the same types or level of

# support
