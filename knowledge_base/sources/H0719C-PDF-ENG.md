You will likely experience a mental health challenge at some point

in your life. Recognizing this possibility should motivate you to be a

workplace ally for mental health, to treat your colleagues dealing with

mental health issues with the empathy you would want under similar

# circumstances.

## Yet the stigma and lack of information about mental health block the

way in many workplaces. The myth that people with mental health

conditions cannot make meaningful contributions leads to conscious

and unconscious bias. We must work together to eradicate the stigma

and its devastating impacts. We may struggle with mental health, but

we can recover. We can thrive at home and work, and we can help make

this possible for each other by being allies, collaborating to create a

# supportive workplace for all.

To be a mental health ally at work is to help those struggling

with mental health issues feel valued and needed. This can have

positive long-term beneﬁts, including increased employee engagement,

productivity, and loyalty. Strengthening and deepening relationships

between colleagues can also beneﬁt the broader employee community.

When we’re supported, we’re also often eager to support others, creating

# a virtuous self-reinforcing cycle.

Some of the most eﬀective ways you can be a mental health ally

are to talk one on one with colleagues who are struggling, use

supportive language, educate yourself and colleagues about mental

health, encourage group engagement, and create policies that help

employees who need it.

# Talking to a Colleague One on One

Knowing when and how to engage with someone who may be struggling with their mental health can be diﬃcult. Talking about mental illness

## isn’t easy, particularly at work and particularly for people with a mental

health condition. You don’t want to jump to conclusions about someone

or seem judgmental. You don’t want to oﬀend a colleague. And you

want to respect professional and personal boundaries. It may be most

challenging to speak to people who have a serious mental illness, as they

are often the most stigmatized, making them extremely reluctant to talk

# about the issue.

Before talking to someone, listen and watch for signs that they are

struggling, as well as for their potential sensitivities. For example,

colleagues with serious and chronic issues may disclose their feelings

but not their diagnosis. They may also experience self-stigma, or the

internalization of the stigma, which can amplify the impact of others’

negative beliefs. Further, people with mental illness may experience

an anticipated stigma, or the belief that they will experience prejudice,

discrimination, and stereotyping. For these reasons, they often have

heightened sensitivity to the stigma and rejection.

Keep in mind the following strategies and considerations for your

# conversation.

# Prepare yourself.

Reﬂecting on and correcting your own implicit bias around mental

health will help you be an ally to your colleagues. You may not mean

to contribute to the stigma, but even an unintentional stigma is hurtful.

Think about any assumptions or preconceptions you may have about

mental health conditions and the people who deal with them. Then,

discard them.

Be open and approachable with your colleague and consider sharing

## your own vulnerability or experience with mental health challenges. If

you have this experience directly or through other relationships, talking

about it to open a dialogue can be very powerful, putting you and the

other person on more equal footing and showing that you are empathic

# and understanding.

Being an ally requires patience, gentle persistence, and creativity. Don’t

be frustrated or discouraged if your initial eﬀorts to comfort a colleague

are unsuccessful. The goal of any conversation should be to help your

coworker talk about their struggles, support them by asking whether

and how you can help, and gently remind them of any beneﬁts or

resources your company or health-care plan provides.

# Find a good time.

If you notice a signiﬁcant change in a colleague’s mood or behavior, you

may want to initiate a conversation. Watch for impaired concentration,

missed deadlines, reduction in work quality, less communication,

“worried” appearance, tardiness, and repeated unexplained absences.

You might be inclined to ignore this behavior as a private matter or as

something for your manager or HR to address. But if you’re close with

the person, you might be in the best position to identify an issue and

connect with your colleague by reaching out in a friendly and caring

way. Timing is important; try to pick a “good day” when your colleague

seems approachable or relaxed.

Some people show no outward signs of struggle or work concerns,

such as those who suﬀer from high-functioning anxiety. You can’t

always assume that someone is not struggling merely based on their

appearance or work performance. Creating a workplace culture where

colleagues demonstrate understanding and empathy will help people

feel more comfortable reaching out or seeking support when needed.

HR and managers should make resources, including a mental health

## handbook, available and easily accessible to all.

# Start gently.

Talking about mental health should be as normal as possible. Simply

asking, “How are you feeling today?” or “How was your weekend?” or

“How’s that assignment going?” can create space for a mental health

discussion. Of course, you’ll want to strike an open, genuine, and

empathic tone. A casual, nonconfrontational approach can facilitate a

# more open dialogue.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Be a Mental Health Ally

Be prepared that your colleague may be defensive or try to hide their challenges. They may fear being stigmatized, a topic of oﬃce gossip.

So don’t insist that your colleague talk with you. Instead, gently nudge

them by telling them you’re available to listen if and when they want to

# speak.

Validate the person’s performance; they may experience strong self-

doubt, which can be paralyzing. They may also experience imposter

syndrome or feel guilty for being a “weak link” or not “keeping up” with

the team. Remind them of how they were able to overcome challenging

tasks in the past, reassuring them that things will be OK, and making

them feel valued and needed. You can also help brainstorm other

ways to reduce their workload if that is negatively contributing to their

# mental health.

Use the right approach.

Try reaching out in diﬀerent ways. Starting with a face-to-face

discussion may not be ideal, as people with mental health challenges

may feel ashamed or embarrassed. Reaching out with a call or text

message may be more eﬀective. If you talk in person, consider whether a spot away from the oﬃce would provide more privacy. Begin the

conversation by assuring that what you discuss will be kept private and

conﬁdential — and, of course, honor what you say.

After the initial discussion, continue the conversation if the person

is willing to, especially if they have shared sensitive information.

Many people with mental illness fear being disliked, abandoned, or

rejected once others learn of their illness. So continue to have regular

conversations while gently checking in. Sometimes people are more

willing to talk about stressors than a mental health challenge, even if

the stressor led to their challenges. For example, you can ask, “How are

the kids adjusting to school?” instead of, “Are you still stressed about

# your kids?”

# Using Supportive Language

When talking to a colleague who is or may be struggling with their

mental health, always be mindful of what you’re saying and how you say

it. The following are a few samples of what to say and not say. Every

person has their own trigger points or vulnerabilities, so stay thoughtful

# and considerate.

# Be sensitive

Don’t say: “I have to talk to you about your attitude [behavior, mood].”

Say: “You don’t seem like yourself lately. Would you like to talk about it?

I’ll understand if you don’t want to.”

Don’t say: “You seem to be falling behind on your work. Why can’t you

keep up?”

Say: “I know that work can sometimes be challenging. Is there anything

I can do to help?”

Don’t say: “I don’t believe you are struggling; you’re so strong. You’ll get

over this.”

Say: “I suﬀer from ____ ; I’ve had a really hard time in the past when

_____. I can’t imagine what you’re going through, but it seems hard.”

Don’t say: “Cheer up.” Never use platitudes.

Say: “I hope you feel a little better tomorrow.”

If you’re a manager talking to someone who may beneﬁt from a work

# break:

Don’t say: “I think you need to have some time oﬀ.”

Say: “You’re a valuable member of our team. We need you, but you can

take time oﬀ if it would help. We can give you part-time work, you can

work from home, and you can stay connected with your colleagues.” Of

course, adapt this language to whatever your company policies allow.

# Avoid stigma

Don’t say: “You are bipolar.”

Say: “You are a person with bipolar disorder.” Always use person-ﬁrst

language — you would never say “You are cancer.”

Don’t say: “I understand what you’re going through” unless you have

mental illness. Even if you do, be sensitive, as each person experiences

# mental illness diﬀerently.

Say: “I don’t know what you’re going through, but I would like to help

you. Is there any way that I can?”

# Encourage

Don’t say: “You don’t seem to be getting better.”

Say: “Mental illness can be managed and treated; sometimes it just

takes ﬁnding the right care team and plan. I will be here to support you.

You can count on me.”

Don’t say: “Maybe you should try _____ and ______.” Unsolicited advice is

usually not welcomed.

Say: “I heard ____ can be helpful or has helped me in the past. Would you

like to look into it together?”

Don’t say: “You’ll ﬁgure this out. You don’t need any help. You’re not

# weak.”

Say: “I think it’s brave that you recognize that you are struggling and

willing to get help.”

# Cooperate

Don’t say: “You have to see a doctor.”

Say: “I wonder if a doctor might be able to help you. Our mental health

handbook provides referrals, or you can reach out to your insurance

company for help. Or maybe a therapist could be useful to you.”

Don’t say: “You need to focus on getting better.”

Say: “We can get through this together. We are here for you.”

# Educating Employees About Mental Health

Education on mental health issues is the foundation for helping people

be better allies. If you’re a leader, encouraging or instituting better

education at your company is a big-picture way you can be a mental

health ally. There are two broad types of educational programs: personal

## accounts in an intimate gathering or auditorium environment and

## informational events in a workshop or classroom format.

# Personal accounts

Events that feature intimate, lived experiences and personal accounts

are often the most eﬀective, as they can humanize challenges and

## foster empathy. Leaders, in particular, can share their experiences with

mental health, which can also impact corporate culture and policy.

Employees can share their stories, which often have the greatest impact

since they’re more likely to be more relatable to other employees. The

speakers at these events don’t have to be folks on staﬀ but people who

have experience leading these kinds of discussions.

# Workshops and classes

Informational events can provide useful background knowledge to all

employees. Several organizations oﬀer workplace training, the most

popular being the Mental Health First Aid Course oﬀered by the

National Council for Mental Wellbeing. Mental health nonproﬁts such

as the National Alliance on Mental Illness – New York City (where I am

on the board) also provide training.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Be a Mental Health Ally

Another helpful employee resource is a mental health handbook that

covers mental health basics, beneﬁts information, and a list of vetted

health-care providers. Be sure to refer employees to reputable sources,

## such as NAMI or Mayo Clinic, for additional information.

# Engaging Employee Groups

Peer-to-peer contact can beneﬁt those employees who struggle with

loneliness and isolation. Employee resource groups (ERGs) can

provide a forum for those impacted by, living with, or supporting

someone with mental illness and identify opportunities to address

any workplace issues. All employees should be welcome to join, but

privacy for members should be preserved. Managers should promote

and participate in these groups where relevant to help normalize these

# issues.

In addition to ERGs, you can model good behavior in groups by openly

and publicly talking about mental health, sharing your own challenges,

## lobbying for good mental health for all employees at all levels, and

supporting mental health activities, initiatives, and events.

## Group self-care activities in the workplace promote peer-to-peer

engagement. Popular activities include exercise and ﬁtness classes,

## healthy meals, meditation, and mindfulness programs. These

## experiences also foster more in-person conversations, which can

facilitate discussions about mental health. Sometimes people with

mental health challenges ﬁnd it comforting to do things with

colleagues that aren’t directly focused on mental health; many fear

the loss of such social connections due to their issues. Extracurricular activities organized around a shared interest or aﬃnity can create

a space in which to create connections with other employees that

facilitate engagement. These may include employee involvement in

## DEI initiatives and discussion groups or community service programs.

Sponsoring or encouraging participation in mental health nonproﬁt

events such as fundraising walks also helps raise awareness and invites

open employee discussion while beneﬁting programs.

## Supporting Mental Health with Company Policies

## Deploy a supportive mental health policy.

Implementing and maintaining a strong policy against stigma and

promoting mental health creates a supportive work environment

and culture. Provide all employees with a clear overview of the

mental health beneﬁts your company oﬀers. Communicate that any

stigma associated with mental health will be treated in the same

## manner as other forms of discrimination, and encourage managers

and employees to speak up against it. Also encourage employees to

confront colleagues that espouse any and all stigma, whether or not

intentional, and report such conduct to supervisors. Your company’s

mental health policy can include a transparent company commitment

to best practices for addressing mental health issues. Employees should

have clearly identiﬁed and available resources to report concerns and an

uncomplicated complaint or feedback process that provides anonymity.

If you’re in management, you can create a mental health director

position to develop, implement, and enforce your company’s mental

health policy. A workplace mental health committee comprising a

diverse group of stakeholders, especially employees living with mental

illness, can help shape, implement, and maintain this policy.

Offer ofﬁce accommodations. Allies and leaders should lobby for and support oﬃce accommodations

that can beneﬁt all employees by helping prevent mental health

challenges and mitigating workplace stressors that can worsen mental

## health. Some easy and low-cost examples of accommodations from the

American Disabilities Act include oﬀering late starts (many psychiatric

medications can be sedating), breaks to attend medical appointments,

ﬂextime, quiet workspaces, oﬃce psychiatric service dogs (or emotional

support animals), remote work, and part-time work. Encourage all

employees to discuss accommodations for their team and suggestions

for how best to incorporate them.

Managers should consider oﬀering these accommodations proactively

to employees in need. Assure employees that they will not experience

repercussions if they ask for accommodations, and that if they

disclose a mental illness, it will be kept strictly conﬁdential. Telling

an employee that an illness will be “kept oﬀ the record” can be

comforting. Employees with mental illnesses are entitled to reasonable

accommodations under the law, but to beneﬁt they must disclose their

condition. Managers should keep in mind that many think the risks of

disclosure far exceed the beneﬁts.

Increase access to care.

Oﬀer access to good mental health care beneﬁts, including a

comprehensive package that accords physical and mental health parity.

It should include coverage for a wide range of mental health services

## and medications. Oﬀer generous short-term and long-term medical

leave policies with clearly stipulated durations and possibilities for

extensions. Leave policy should not require disclosure of speciﬁc

conditions. Another beneﬁcial measure is on-call therapy assistance

(as mental health crises often occur outside the workplace). General

wellness programs should also be available to all employees to ensure

a positive impact on mental health. Ensure that employees are

## aware of these beneﬁts through information sessions and company

# communication channels.

## Finally, anonymous online peer-to-peer support communities that

preserve conﬁdentiality can be helpful. Many companies use mental

health apps to support employees, but their eﬀectiveness may be

questionable. According to the American Psychiatric Association (APA),

many apps lack evidence of their eﬀectiveness; in addition, they

may not be secure, lack adequate privacy controls, or may sell user

data without appropriate disclosure or authorization. The APA has

developed an evaluation model to assess associated risks and rate

mental health apps. Employers should carefully evaluate mental health

apps for these risks and their potential eﬀectiveness before promoting

# them to employees.

. . .

## People with mental health challenges, no matter the severity, can

thrive in the workplace and be valuable team members. Allies play

an important role by helping to provide the empathy and compassion

they need to overcome key challenges. Our collective will, empathy,

and compassion can break down the formidable barriers of stigma.

Workplace mental health initiatives can and do help. In the end, what

matters most is bringing our shared humanity into the workplace.
