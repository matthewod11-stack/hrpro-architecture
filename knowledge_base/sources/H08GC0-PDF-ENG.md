“I’ll sleep when I’m dead.” I’m embarrassed to admit that this is a line I

used to repeat, whether to justify working until 2:00 am to hit a deadline

or squeezing in just one more email or skipping meals because “I don’t

have time.”

But I learned the hard way that this joke isn’t funny. The 2024 Mercer

Global Talent Trend Report data supports agrees. This robust study

of more than 12,000 global participants suggests that 82% of the

workforce is at risk of burnout, citing excessive workload, exhaustion,

## and ﬁnancial strain as the main culprits.

## HBR / Digital Article / Let’s End Toxic Productivity

This is toxic productivity in a nutshell — essentially an unhealthy

compulsion to be productive at all times, often at the expense of our

## mental and physical well-being, relationships, and overall quality of

life. It’s a common sentiment in today’s work culture, where the drive

to be constantly productive is often celebrated, if not expected. But this

mindset isn’t just harmful; it’s dangerous.

## Understanding the Roots of Toxic Productivity

Toxic productivity is multifaceted and stems from a complex mix

of psychological and societal factors. Productivity norms are deeply

embedded in our psyches from growing up in environments that

equate arduous work with virtue, and rest with laziness. This belief is

further reinforced by a culture that encourages perfectionism, where

individuals feel that their self-worth is tied to their achievements.

Social media ampliﬁes the pressure of toxic productivity by fostering

a constant sense of competition. Research ﬁnds that upward social

comparisons are linked to low self-esteem and depression, with women

most negatively aﬀected. It contributes to workaholism, which emerges

## as a coping mechanism for anxiety or low self-esteem, with “busyness”

serving as a distraction from negative thoughts and feelings.

The pandemic exacerbated these tendencies, with many people using

work as a way to maintain a sense of control and purpose during

uncertain times. As gross domestic product (GDP) fell sharply in the

middle of the crisis, outdated labor productivity metrics created an

irrational fear that we were in an economic downward spiral. Instead

of recognizing that the world was in a massive health crisis and this

was not business as usual, there was an accelerated push to return to

# pre-pandemic GDP levels.

What’s more, the rise of generative artiﬁcial intelligence (gen AI) is

further skewing our ideas about productivity. I ask you this: If gen AI

is here to save us time in minutes and hours, then how will we measure

productivity? If someone is done with their work early because of AI,

shouldn’t that be rewarded? Toxic productivity will never end — and

may even get worse — unless we start measuring goals achieved, not

hours worked.

# The Era of Overdoing Everything

People are already struggling to meet their core job requirements, but

when you factor in a staggering 192% increase in weekly meetings

post-pandemic, it becomes signiﬁcantly more challenging. We are over-

## meeting, over-looping, and over-collaborating — one of the worst

work habits brought on by the pandemic. Despite the longstanding

perception that more hours worked means higher productivity, data and

research are ﬁnding otherwise.

Slack’s Workforce Index analyzed more than 10,000 desk workers

around the globe and found that “employees who feel obligated to work

after hours register 20% lower productivity scores.” They also suﬀer

## from “2.1x worse work-related stress, 1.7x lower satisfaction with their

overall working environment, and 2x greater burnout.”

## Laura Giurge, professor at the London School of Economics, studies

the impact of “time poverty,” which means having too many things

to do and not enough time to do them. Giurge’s research found that

employees working on weekends and holidays versus the standard

Monday to Friday, 9-to-5 hours showed decreased intrinsic motivation.

Working after hours caused people to consider better uses of their time

— leading to higher attrition.

Research by Atlassian found that 78% of respondents struggle to

complete their work due to excessive meetings and a shocking 67% of

people at the director level and above report having to work overtime

due to meeting overload. Seventy-six percent of respondents feel

drained after days packed with meetings, and 80% believe they’d be

# more productive with less meeting time.

Annie Dean, global head of team anywhere at Atlassian, came to her

role after recognizing that her job as a corporate lawyer on Wall Street

was starting to feel toxic. Sending an email just minutes before her son

was born was a wake-up call. I could relate. In the early days of our

start-up, I brought my two-week-old daughter into an investor meeting.

As a woman, it’s hard to reconcile that prioritizing your well-being is not

# antithetical to ambition.

“When I started to go through that process of adapting as a young

parent, I was like, there is something really broken here,” Dean told me.

She took on the role at Atlassian because she felt that they’re making a

genuine eﬀort to ﬁx what’s broken at work. With more autonomy and

work/life harmony, Dean felt the beneﬁts. She suggests that this current

fracturing of work isn’t a bad thing. “The way we work needs to break

down completely, because that will create completely new and better

ways of working.”

# The Stigmatization of Rest

Unfortunately, “rest” is a bad four-letter word in most workplaces.

“Hero culture” is when people who stay late, skip vacations, and work

weekends are celebrated. This philosophy can create an environment

where rest is seen as a weakness or a lack of commitment.

Despite the well-known beneﬁts of taking time oﬀ — including

reduced stress, improved mental health, and increased productivity

upon return — several studies have shown that workers are vacation-

deprived. According to Expedia’s annual global survey of 11,500 global

employees, 62% of global workers don’t feel they have enough time oﬀ

or breaks. The 2024 PTO Report by ﬁntech ﬁrm Sorbet found persistent

underutilization of vacation time, with employees taking around 10

days in 2023. It also found that women in the U.S. are 19% less

comfortable with taking a vacation than their male counterparts. No

wonder U.S. workers are feeling the eﬀects of vacation deprivation.

Pew research ﬁnds that 49% of people who don’t take their full PTO say

they worry about falling behind, 43% say they would feel badly about

coworkers taking on extra work, and 19% worry that taking time oﬀ

might hurt their chances of getting a promotion.

Slack’s report also found that “half of all desk workers say they rarely

or never take breaks during the work day.” Compass Group’s Global

Eating at Work Survey 2023 found that one third of employees globally

are eating alone. “Dining al desko,” or “desktop dining” may sound

like just another TikTok trend, but it comes with serious consequences.

Research found that eating alone signiﬁcantly increases depressive

symptoms and people who sat for more than eight hours a day with

no physical activity had a mortality risk similar to that posed by obesity

# and smoking.

Unfortunately, for the people taking their allotted time, it’s not like

they’re getting the kind of rest and recovery they need. People who

take time oﬀ wrestle with feelings of guilt and fear of judgment from

colleagues or supervisors, who might perceive them as less dedicated or

committed.

burdened with the “second shift” of domestic duties. A joint LeanIn.org

and McKinsey study found that mothers are over three times more

likely than fathers to handle the majority of household tasks, and 1.5

times more likely to spend additional hours on chores and child care.

This dual burden makes it even harder for women to justify rest, leading

# to higher burnout.

“During the pandemic organizations showed employees what they

could do when the rubber hit the road and change was required,” says

Rachel Thomas, CEO and cofounder of LeanIn.org. “Today, women are

witnessing a reversal and they’re saying, we don’t want to go backward,

we want to go forward. Women no longer think that prioritizing one’s

personal life and being ambitious and being deeply committed to work

are somehow antithetical,” Thomas told me.

Could this explain why the growth in women’s representation among

all senior leadership positions in the U.S. dropped to the lowest rate

in more than a decade? Or could it be a result of 2022 data from

Lean In that shows that for every woman at the director level who

gets promoted to the next level, two women directors are choosing

to leave their company? S&P Global Market Intelligence found that in

the C-suite, women lost seats for the ﬁrst time over the study period

(2005-2023). They now only hold 11% of the over 15,000 CEO seats of

publicly-traded companies in the U.S. With women continuing to make

only incremental gains in executive and C-level positions, it’s time we

recognize that work isn’t working for women. And toxic productivity

isn’t helping.

## The Role of Leadership in Breaking the Cycle

Leaders play a crucial role in either perpetuating or breaking the

cycle of toxic productivity. Unfortunately, many leaders model the very

behaviors that contribute to this unhealthy culture — sending emails

late at night, forgoing time oﬀ, and glorifying overwork.

To foster a healthier work environment, leaders should actively model

healthy work habits themselves. This includes taking a vacation and

sharing it openly — a new trend called “loud vacationing” — so

employees feel like taking PTO is encouraged.

Managers should also exemplify clear boundaries between work and

personal time, and highlight their commitment to well-being. It’s good

for business. Slack’s study found that employees who log oﬀ at the end

## of the workday register 20% higher productivity scores than those who

feel obligated to work after hours. Three out of every four desk workers

report working in the 3-to-6 pm timeframe, but of those, only one in

## four consider these hours highly productive.

Managers can help their teams avoid toxic productivity by practicing

empathy. “There was once a time when managers and leaders didn’t

have visibility into the personal lives of their employees,” shares Lindsay-Rae McIntyre, chief diversity oﬃcer at Microsoft. “At this stage,

we are beyond the question of whether empathy is necessary. Instead,

we must focus on how to create the environment for it to show up in

relevant and meaningful ways,” she says.

To get at the root cause of toxic productivity, start by analyzing

employee workloads to make them more manageable. You want to make

incremental reductions in many places so the change is sustainable and

enduring. Taking a week oﬀ to ﬁx burnout is a losing strategy if you’re

returning to the same conditions that led to burnout in the ﬁrst place.

But reducing over-meeting? That’s a winning strategy.

When Shopify canceled all recurring meetings involving more than

three people, made Wednesdays meeting-free, and pushed meetings

with 50+ staﬀ into a six-hour window on Thursdays, it saved the

company 322,000 hours. The experiment, which the company named

“Chaos Monkey” was so successful the company developed and

embedded a cost calculator in employees’ calendar app. When meetings

with three or more people are initiated, the widget will spit out a

price estimate by factoring in the number of attendees, the average

compensation for their roles, and meeting length. A 30-minute meeting

with three employees can cost up to $1,600, and a meeting with an exec

# starts at $2,000.

Asana took on a similar experiment, but in a more DIY approach for

team managers. Employees believed meetings were broken and that it

was time for a meeting “doomsday” to get rid of unnecessary meetings.

The company oﬀers a helpful template for doing this:

# How to Get Rid of Unnecessary Meetings

Conduct a meeting audit.

Have your team analyze their meetings and determine which ones don’t

add value.

# Schedule a meeting doomsday.

On this day, employees can delete all recurring meetings from their

calendars for 48 hours. Then, have them repopulate their calendars, but

only with those meetings that are valuable — according to their own

meeting audit. Asana found that when their employees were given the

freedom to step back and assess, they made meetings shorter and less

# frequent.

Celebrate the time savings.

Get everyone to calculate how much time they saved by comparing the

time they spent in meetings after doomsday with their initial meeting

audit. For Asana, over the course of their one-month experiment,

participants saved 11 hours per month on average and roughly 17

# workdays over the course of a year.

Breaking the cycle of toxic productivity is no simple task. We’re trying to

change a values-based belief that’s the size of the Titanic and centuries

older. But I see glimmers of hope in these subtle shifts as some groups,

particularly women and Gen Z employees, have started to push back

on this antiquated perspective. That tends to happen when you have

a collective existential crisis — priorities change, and how you really

want to spend the rest of your days comes into focus. This mindset gets

people wondering, “What will my biggest regret in life be? I can almost

guarantee that no one will say, “You know, I wish I’d spent more time in

# meetings.”
