People’s motivations for making big career moves — including

changing companies, starting new ventures, and leaving the workforce

altogether — amid the Great Resignation vary. The pandemic showed

some people that remote and ﬂexible work was possible. It prompted

others to reevaluate their priorities, particularly around the balance

between work and the rest of their lives. And for some, the pandemic

came with a large blinking “YOLO” sign that pushed them past fears that

kept them from doing what they had always wanted.

While far from an exhaustive list, these three examples show how

profoundly the pandemic has aﬀected how we think about our work.

But before we all jump on the Great Resignation bandwagon and make

potentially life-altering decisions, a word of caution is in order. We

shouldn’t ignore the lessons learned during the pandemic, but we

should pressure test these insights against some of the most obvious

biases we struggle with and try to avoid getting trapped on the wrong

# side of a one-way door.

Why we should be careful

Our decision making isn’t perfect. Nobel laureate Herbert Simon taught

us that it’s never the fully rational process we’d like to think it is, in

part because we’re working with incomplete information. Amos Tversky

and Daniel Kahneman also pointed out that our own psychology further

biases our decisions. Unfortunately, these factors are playing a large role

in people’s thinking during this time of transition.

I recently spent time with two diﬀerent managers within the same

organization, both of whom were looking to change jobs. Jason* wanted

to change to a position that allowed for more remote work, citing

his increased productivity at home. Helen,* in contrast, was feeling

disconnected, out of the loop, and isolated as the only member of her

# team at her location.

In this “grass-is-greener” scenario, both Jason and Helen focused on

aspects of their work situations that were particularly vivid and salient

for them individually. What both needed was to take some time to think

about the whole picture and weigh the pros and cons of each setup.

Almost no job-change decision will be unilaterally good or bad — each oﬀers beneﬁts but comes with costs. As diﬃcult as it is, we need to step

outside our immediate contexts to get a more objective view.

Making things even more diﬃcult, the exceptional experiences we’ve

had during the pandemic are aﬀecting our psychology. Data shows a

## clear link between the pandemic and declines in mental health, which

can have a very real impact on decision making. I spoke to a manager,

Chris,* who had decided it was time to quit and look for a new job.

He told me he felt unmotivated and disengaged in his current role

— his work didn’t feel meaningful or inspiring and he didn’t see a

career trajectory that excited him. Further discussion revealed that

Chris’s concerns were less about his current job but more broadly about

his state of mind. He was one of the large percentage of employees

experiencing a decline in mental health since the pandemic began. In

his particular case, discussing with his family helped him realize he was

misattributing the cause of his dissatisfaction and that the alternatives

he was considering wouldn’t meaningfully address what he felt was

missing — and in fact, leaving his current organization would take away

a support network he had come to rely on.

Before making a big — and potentially irreversible — career decision,

take the following steps to make sure you’re approaching your decision

making methodically and thinking about how to reduce your personal

# risk.

# Improve decision input

First, consider how you can improve the data (and interpretation) going

into your decision to yield a more accurate outcome.

Start by quickly refreshing your memory on some of the most common

psychological biases to increase your odds of recognizing them when

they arise. As someone who has taught them for over 20 years, my own

decision making is still aﬀected by biases like:

- Anchoring: The tendency for decisions and estimates to be inﬂuenced

by a starting reference point or “anchor,” like the asking price on a car

# or home.

- Conﬁrming evidence: The inclination to favor information that

conﬁrms what we already believe, like noticing and believing news

stories that align with our views.

- Availability: The propensity to over-weight information that’s more

“available” in memory due to being more recent, vivid, or emotionally

charged. For example, lottery ticket sales tend to increase after a big

win is announced.

- Framing: The fact that our decisions are profoundly aﬀected by how

the decision itself is laid out. For example, we’re generally more willing

to act to avoid a loss than to achieve a gain.

All of these (and more) are aﬀecting how we approach the critical career

decisions we’re talking about.

One of my favorite mantras is “outsource what you’re bad at” — in

this case, that’s remaining objective. Outsource to people by discussing

your decision (and its parameters) with people you know will challenge

your assumptions and therefore counter your biases. Devil’s advocacy

is nothing new and may seem like a given, but particularly in tough

situations, we tend to retreat to the safety of discussing our ideas with

people we feel conﬁdent share our views. Look for someone who has no

vested interest in your ultimate decision, and remind them that they

can only help you by being completely honest.

Outsource to process by putting some structure around how you make

your decision. Career decisions are immensely complicated and high

stakes — trying to maintain your objectivity while tackling them head

on in their entirety is almost impossible. Instead, take a systematic

approach to break them down and outsmart them. For example, before

you start to think through it, lay out a roadmap of how you will evaluate

each of the elements in your decision and allocate a time frame for

each. This ensures you won’t miss — or spend too much or too little

time on — any piece of the equation. Importantly, nail down your

process before starting to think through the decision. That way, you’ll avoid inadvertently reworking your process in a way that reaﬃrms your

# biases.

# Improve decision output

Next, consider how you can improve the execution of your decision to

reduce the downside risk if your conclusion proves wrong.

Even with the best data and processes, we all still sometimes arrive at

what turns out to be a sub-optimal conclusion. In light of the Great

Resignation, such errors can be particularly costly. Remember, you are your own chief risk oﬃcer, so spend some time thinking about how to

reduce your exposure if your decision turns out not to be the best one.

One way to do this is to apply a decision-making approach favored

## by Jeﬀ Bezos and Sir Richard Branson: divide decisions into one-way

versus two-way door decisions. Two-way door decisions are those that

are relatively easy to undo. Both Bezos and Branson argue that we

shouldn’t waste a lot of time deliberating and debating such decisions,

but rather try them out and then roll them back if needed. Two-way

door decisions are great opportunities for learning. In contrast, one- way door decisions are those that are diﬃcult (if not impossible) to

reverse, and therefore worth the time and eﬀort to carefully consider

and evaluate all options prior to making the decision ﬁnal.

The ﬁrst question to ask, therefore, is whether the career change you’re

contemplating is a two- or one-way door decision. Maybe you’ve wanted

to start a side business or transition to a new role within your current

organization. If you think the change you’re considering is relatively

easy to abandon or undo, you’re in luck — try it out and see what you

# learn.

However, if that’s not the case and you think the costs make the

door one-way, ask yourself if there’s a way to turn that one-way door

decision into a two-way door decision. In one oft-cited example, when

Sir Richard Branson was launching Virgin Atlantic, he negotiated a

clause in his contract with Boeing that would allow him to return the

plane he bought if the airline didn’t take oﬀ. He ultimately didn’t have

to exercise that clause, but in negotiating it, he helped turned a one-way

# door decision into a two-way door one.

Is there a way to achieve a similar set of career objectives within the

context of your current ﬁrm or job? Could you take a sabbatical or

transition to part time to try something out or collect more data? Can

you build or strengthen your ties and professional network to increase

your options if your intended course of action turns out not to be all that

you were hoping?

Recognize that the one-way/two-way door distinction is a decision

heuristic — identifying something as one- or two-way is itself a

judgment call that depends on your own level of risk tolerance and the

costs you’re willing to bear. What’s too costly to roll back for one person

might be within reason for another.

Also keep in mind that you don’t need a costless “undo” button to turn

## a one-way door decision into a two-way door decision. Remember, a

one-way door decision is really just one where you think the costs of

failure are too large to bear. Reducing your exposure for a decision you

can’t undo is another way of ultimately making it a two-way decision.

So, if you can’t walk away from your one-way door decision, see if there

are ways to make a bad decision less costly. If you can get the cost low

enough that you’re willing to incur it if things go wrong and you walk

away, you’ve in eﬀect made it a two-way door decision.

# Communicate

Many of these ideas require an open and honest dialogue with your

current employer — which may be scary and itself comes with some

risk. Remember, if your current employer truly values you, it’s in their

best interest to help you resolve your uncertainty and work with you

to negotiate a good resolution, as the alternative is a resignation letter

that leaves little room for a mutually beneﬁcial solution. One lesson I’ve

learned after watching 20 years of MBAs go through the recruitment

process is that we often underestimate our power and ability to outline

our own needs, negotiate, and ﬁnd a workable middle ground. There

is no guarantee, but learning how seriously your employer takes your

well-being is itself good data to have and very relevant to this whole

# process.

The past two years have had a profound impact on everyone and have

sparked some signiﬁcant realizations and reprioritizations for many.

These are important, valid, and should not be discarded — there’s

no question that the Great Resignation is a very real phenomenon.

However, we’re also all human, operating under the inﬂuence of a lot

of factors that aﬀect our ability to make decisions. Recognizing and

consciously addressing these biases when making critical life decisions

are important steps toward making sure we don’t ﬁnd ourselves locked

## outside on the wrong side of a one-way door.

Author’s note: I would like to thank my wife, Melissa, who was instrumental in both recognizing and thinking through this critical challenge, all while we walked through the forest.
