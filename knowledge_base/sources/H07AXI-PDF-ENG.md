We’re now in the next chapter of the great pandemic-instigated work

experiment. According to Gallup, more than half of people who can

work remotely expect or prefer to do so at least part of the time from

now on. For their organizations the goal is clear: Make hybrid work more

# viable and sustainable.

As an employee of LinkedIn and consultant at NBBJ, respectively, we’re

always trying to better understand workplace trends and support both

our employees and our user base in navigating them. Most recently,

## HBR / Digital Article / How LinkedIn Redesigned Its HQ for Hybrid Work

we’ve put new thinking on hybrid work to the test in designing

LinkedIn’s 250,000 square foot global headquarters, called B1, on the

existing 29-acre campus in Silicon Valley.

Although this eﬀort started before the pandemic, we’ve worked together

to adapt our plans for this moment in work history. Through research,

design, and now the adoption of the new space, including norms around

its use, the process has been one of testing and reﬁnement — balancing

in-person, hybrid, and remote work in a way that supports employee

well-being while continuing to move the company forward.

Here are three of the central lessons we’ve learned so far.

Optimize the office for all use cases.

The oﬃce should accommodate diverse roles and preferences. For

working parents, that might be a station where they can do heads-down

work away from the distractions and responsibilities of home. For many Gen Z employees, the return to the oﬃce is a welcome opportunity to

ﬁnd what they’ve been largely missing during the pandemic — space

for in-person mentoring, learning opportunities, and growth. Most

employees are looking for places to build (or rebuild) the social capital

— which McKinsey deﬁnes as “the presence of networks, relationships,

shared norms, and trust” — that has eroded over the last two years.

That’s why LinkedIn’s new HQ incorporates spaces that accommodate

all of these use cases: focus, collaboration, learning, and socialization,

as well as rest. We oﬀer everything from a quiet library to a bustling

café, and employees can choose to work wherever they want whenever

they want. We learned during lockdown that productivity goes up when

workers have more personal agency. Workplace design has to allow

people to ﬁnd individualized routines and rhythms that feel good for

them. This includes working from home when that feels right.

As a member of LinkedIn’s sales team noted, “It doesn’t make sense to come into the oﬃce on days where I will be in a meeting room for most

of the day. So, I plan my visits when I can spend time meeting the team

informally.”

One of the biggest changes we made to the original pre-pandemic

headquarters design was cutting the number of traditional workstations

by about 40% and replacing them with several dozen seating areas —

distinct “neighborhoods” for each team laid out to suit their typical

activities. Some look like living rooms and serve as an area for

socializing or group discussions; others have perch points for individual

work or pair meetups. The entire building is also vertically organized to

map to a gradient of work styles, from the most social on the ground

# to the most heads-down at the top.

Accommodate a more diverse workforce.

Some of the backlash around a return to the oﬃce in corporate America

comes down to a rejection of old models of professionalism. Work culture in general and oﬃce design in particular need to reﬂect a more

complex and varied workforce, including and those with physical and

cognitive disabilities. Thus, inclusive design principles informed all

the choices we made for the new LinkedIn headquarters. Taking into

account conditions such as paralysis, visual or auditory impairment,

neurodivergence, anxiety, and more, we considered everything from

## ramps to light and glare, stimulation level to acoustics, degree of privacy

to furniture that would accommodate 60 diﬀerent postures.

We also made clear that our norms about attire and other aspects of

showing up to work are more ﬂexible than ever before. We refer to this

as “the new professionalism,” where people can bring more of their

unedited selves to work, reducing formality in favor of authenticity and

# personal comfort.

This was an important way to ensure that many of the employees

from underrepresented groups, who prefer to work from home because

it involves less code-switching, also feel comfortable returning to the oﬃce.

# Test, re-test and adjust accordingly.

People will use the oﬃce if it’s a space they want to be in.

That’s why we’ve adopted a mindset of testing and experimentation

and adjustment throughout this process. We’re constantly soliciting

feedback from employees to learn what’s working and what should

change. This includes easels throughout the building where people can

leave handwritten comments, frequent surveys, feedback forms, focus

## groups, interviews, and quantitative data like attendance and sensor

# mapping

One area of investigation is the best types of conference and meeting

rooms: outdoor or indoor? Long table and chairs, or sofas, lounge

chairs, and stadium-style risers? Or all of the above?

Based on feedback from team so far, we’re making changes to the

technology and AV systems to create an even better experience for our

hybrid colleagues. We are also switching to lighter-weight chairs in our

conference rooms to better support teams that need to adapt the space

to ﬁt a range of diﬀerent meeting types.

Another persistent challenge is how to help people navigate moving back and forth between in-oﬃce and remote work — particularly

most utilized workspaces are actually the standard desks and phone

rooms, but they must be equipped with all the technology needed

for hybrid work, including all-in-one video conferencing and digital

whiteboarding solutions (that combine touch, writing, and video-

conferencing capabilities for example) and dual and adjustable monitor

setups that support paired coding and team working. But we’re still

asking: Do we need more social space? What’s the best conﬁguration

for large teams vs small teams? Do we need more desks? What will

employees need next quarter or next year? Does the technology in the

## space enable connectivity and productivity?

In fact, since we opened our new HQ, we’ve found that, even though

employees are free to work from home or on campus, 63% of people

technically assigned to other buildings now make their way to B1 since

opening in January, taking advantage of the variety of work zones,

amenities and conﬁgurations the space provides. We’ll keep listening

to their suggestions to see what else might draw them in and how we

might experiment as a result in order to help them feel more eﬀective

# and their work more enjoyable.

We know we haven’t gotten everything right and we don’t expect

everything to work as planned — the key is to ask why, tweak the design,

and then test again. Either way, this next step is less about ﬁguring out the end game and more about creating an oﬃce space dynamic enough

to adapt to our evolving world of work.
