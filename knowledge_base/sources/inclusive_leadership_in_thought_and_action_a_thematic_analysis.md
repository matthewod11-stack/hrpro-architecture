Abstract While research in the diversity and leadership literatures has given attention to the concept of inclusive leadership, work in these areas has progressed within relatively independent theoretical streams with little integration of ﬁndings. To integrate ﬁndings from these literatures and develop theory on inclusive leadership, this study explores the concept and enactment of in- clusive leadership from the leader’s perspective. Through manual and assisted thematic analyses of 27 leaders’ written responses to questions regarding how they perceive and demonstrate inclusive leadership, we investigate how leaders do sensemaking about what it means to be inclusive. Consistent with the ﬁndings of prior research, conceptualization themes emerged related to understanding, valuing, and utilizing differences as well as encouraging a shared identity and collaboration. The ﬁndings also highlight the importance of re- lational leadership—speciﬁcally, relating to, showing a genuine interest in, and generating trust from others on the team. In the demonstration of inclusive leadership, the results emphasize behaviors to recognize diversity, respond to individual needs and work styles, and actively listen to what team members voice. Our ﬁndings also highlight the importance of building environments in which members share and build on each other’s ideas freely and leaders make time and space for leveraging member contributions for decision-making, even when such contributions diverge from team norms. Based on these

## Inclusive Leadership in Thought and Action: A Thematic Analysis

With workforces characterized by countless differences, leaders have been increasingly challenged to not only lead across such differences but to ﬁnd ways for valuing and leveraging them for organizational functioning. To this end, organizations have explored programs and initiatives for the last 20 years that emphasize the removal of barriers that block employees from using the full range of their skills and experiences (see Harvey, 1999). While initially considered to be interventions for accepting diverse employees—particularly, women and underrepresented minorities—into interaction networks and upper echelons of organizations (Ibarra, 1993), such efforts have evolved into more expansive change efforts to embed a value for diversity in all forms into the culture of organizations. Organizations have come to focus on the con- ﬁguration of its structures and systems to value and leverage the potential of differences in the workforce, including the removal of obstacles to the full participation and contribution of all employees (Roberson, 2006).

Early research on inclusive approaches to diversity management drew attention to diversity within organizations and the degree to which it is in- tegrated into organizational strategies, structures, and process as hallmarks (Cox, 1991; Thomas & Ely, 1996). Although not referred to using the term “inclusion,” researchers distinguished between initiatives to simply increase workforce diversity versus those that represented a more material change in organizations. More recent research has attempted to identify human resource practices and programs for facilitating climates for inclusion or the en- gagement of employees’ whole selves and learning from diverse perspectives (Nishii, 2013; Roberson, 2006). Still, other research suggests that inclusive environments are dynamic systems not only prescribed by the values, policies, and practices of an organization but enacted by people at all levels (Ferdman & Davidson, 2002). As such, leaders are considered to be essential to the creation of such environments given their direct inﬂuence on employee experiences within organizations (Ferdman, 2014).

Research has given attention to the concept of inclusive leadership. Some researchers view inclusive leadership as a particular form of relational

# Roberson and Perry

leadership that establishes norms of active consultation and participation to drive shared decision-making within a team or organization (Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006). Distinguished from participative leadership, inclusive approaches refer to situations in which members’ statuses vary according to the degree to which they are considered insiders and behaviors for including the perspectives and opinions of those who might otherwise be ignored (Edmondson, 1996, 2003). Accordingly, high-quality relationships between leaders and their followers signal norms of equality and power sharing and subsequently inclusiveness (Hollander, 2009; Nishii & Mayer, 2009). Deriving from the concept of inclusion, researchers also view inclusive leadership as behaviors to create the psychological experience of feeling a sense of uniqueness and belonging within a team or organization (Randel et al., 2018). For example, behaviors to encourage employee differences in perspectives and approaches and fully incorporate them into the group’s work are posited to facilitate feelings of uniqueness while those to treat all employees fairly, support their ideas, and share decision-making are con- sidered to facilitate perceptions of belongingness. Still, as few studies have explored the demonstration of inclusive leadership, our understanding of what leaders do in an attempt to create inclusive environments is limited. This study explores the concept and enactment of inclusive leadership from a leader perspective. Through manual and assisted thematic analyses of leaders’ written responses to questions regarding how they perceive and demonstrate inclusive leadership, we investigate how leaders do sensemaking about what it means to be inclusive. Consistent with early work in this area (see Edmondson, 2003), this qualitative design allowed us to diverge from researchers’ conceptions of inclusive leadership and examine the phenom- enon from leaders’ unguided perspectives. In addition, it enabled us to explore the richness of people’s natural language accounts of how they enact inclusive leadership and to detect themes, patterns, and nuances that might not be revealed through other methodologies. Accordingly, this study provides in- sight into how leaders view and interpret their experiences with being in- clusive or their relative sensitivity to various facets of those experiences. These design features also enable our aims of advancing our theoretical understanding of the concept of inclusive leadership.

# Theoretical Background

The underpinnings of inclusion are described in the work of Schutz (1958), who posited that inclusion (along with control and affection) is a basic human need that people experience in their interpersonal relationships. Schutz argued that people express their needs to be included by how they communicate with

# 757

# 758

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

others. He contends that we experience less anxiety if our need to be “in the group” matches the degree to which we want others to “include us.” This suggests that it is beneﬁcial when leaders engage in behaviors to include all followers, but not to the extent that the individual differences of others get muted or lost in the process. As individuals from diverse social and cultural groups are often excluded from networks of information and opportunity in organizations (Ibarra, 1993; Pettigrew & Martin, 1989), inclusion has also been used to describe worker participation and empowerment. For example, Mor-Barak and Cherin (1998) deﬁne inclusion as the extent to which in- dividuals can access information and resources, are involved in work groups, and have the ability to inﬂuence decision-making processes. Rather than emphasizing difference as an organizational commodity, inclusion is focused on the degree to which individuals feel a part of critical organizational processes (Roberson, 2006). While it encapsulates diversity in its various forms, including characteristics that are both observable and unobservable within a social system and recognizes such diversity as a means for achieving collective goals, inclusion requires that all individuals feel able to fully and meaningfully contribute to shared goals regardless of group memberships and to do so without assimilating to established norms or relinquishing any part of their identity (Ferdman, 2014).

In conceptualizing inclusion, researchers have proposed a variety of in- dicators. For example, deﬁning inclusion as the degree to which people feel involved in critical work processes, Mor-Barak and Cherin (1998) argue that individuals’ access to information and resources, input into goals and work design, and inﬂuence over decisions are reﬂective of their inclusion expe- riences at work. Similarly, Pelled, Ledford, and Mohrman (1999) describe inclusion as “the degree to which an employee is accepted and treated as an insider by others in a work system” (p. 1014) and rely on the extent to which employees have inﬂuence over decisions that affect them at work, are kept well-informed about the company’s business strategies and goals, and are likely to retain their jobs as indicators of inclusion. Others have discovered additional yet macro-level attributes of inclusion, such as employee in- volvement and participatory work systems, information sharing and 360- degree communication, and power sharing (Roberson, 2006).

Given the identiﬁcation of organizational factors that may be indicative of inclusive work environments, it is important to understand leaders’ role in shaping such environments. A body of research has explored inclusive lead- ership to understand leadership approaches and behaviors for driving employee experiences of inclusion at work. However, such research has been conducted from two different theoretical perspectives—diversity and leadership. Below, we review the ﬁndings of inclusive leadership research from these perspectives.

# Roberson and Perry

## Inclusive Leadership From a Diversity Perspective

Diversity researchers view inclusive leadership as behaviors to create the psychological experience of feeling connected within organizations. This experience is rooted in the concept of inclusion, which derives from socio- psychological theories that describe humans’ fundamental need to afﬁliate with others, such as human motivation (Maslow, 1943), social comparison (Festinger, 1954), and the belongingness hypothesis (Baumeister & Leary, 1995). According to these theories, the desire to form and maintain mean- ingful relationships with others is central to individuals’ physical and psy- chological well-being as people use such relationships as a gauge of their acceptance by, or position within, social groups. Consequently, individuals are motivated to monitor the social environment for indicators of the degree to which they are treated as an insider. Research also suggests that this need to be part of a group is balanced by a need to maintain their own individuality. Based on optimal distinctiveness theory (Brewer, 1991), which posits that individuals strive to balance their basic human need to be part of larger social groups with their need to maintain a distinctive self-concept, some diversity researchers describe inclusion in terms of the tension between human motives for belonging and differentiation that regulate a person’s capacity for group identiﬁcation. For example, inclusion has been explained as individuals’ full participation in work environments, including equal access to decision- making and positions of power, but also as being invited to participate be- cause of their differences (Holvino, Ferdman, & Merrill-Sands, 2004). Shore et al. (2011) deﬁne inclusion as “the degree to which an employee perceives that he or she is an esteemed member of the work group through experiencing treatment that satisﬁes his or her needs for belongingness and uniqueness” (p. 1265). Following this conceptualization, indicators of inclusion incorporate opportunities for individuals to contribute, and be appreciated for, their unique perspectives and talents.

Because leader values and actions inﬂuence member experiences within work groups, they are considered to be essential to creating such environments (Ferdman, 2014). Accordingly, inclusive leadership encapsulates a set of leader behaviors to foster a sense of inclusion among members of a group. From a diversity perspective, this leadership approach captures differences in its various forms within a social system and recognizes differences as a means for achieving collective goals (Holvino et al., 2004). Further, inclusive lead- ership necessitates that all individuals have the ability to fully and meaningfully contribute to shared goals regardless of group memberships and to do so without assimilating to established norms and relinquishing any of part of their identity (Ferdman, 2014). In effect, inclusive leadership is proposed

# 759

# 760

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

to fundamentally address individuals’ needs for being valued for their uniqueness while feeling part of the group (Shore et al., 2011). As such, it is considered to enable work group functioning in a way that has not yet been addressed by other forms of leadership (Randel et al., 2018).

While diversity researchers have conceptualized inclusive leadership, our understanding of leader behaviors to facilitate an inclusive environment is relatively limited. Randel et al. (2018) proposed categories of behaviors that signal a value for uniqueness and help to facilitate belonging. Speciﬁcally, behaviors that make group members feel comfortable and supported, dem- onstrate fair and equitable treatment, and provide opportunities for shared decision-making are posited to create a sense of belongingness while be- haviors that encourage different perspectives and approaches and reduce barriers to participation are posited to facilitate a sense of uniqueness (Randel et al., 2018). Yet, while such behaviors are believed to enhance employees’ experiences of inclusion, little attention has been given to whether these behaviors are enacted by leaders in organizations. In this study, we explore leader recollections of the behaviors in which they engage to create and maintain inclusive environments.

## Inclusive Leadership From a Leadership Perspective

Research on inclusive leadership has also evolved within the leadership literature. Viewed as a particular form of relational leadership, which focuses on the relationship between a leader and follower as the unit of analysis and assumes that the speciﬁc nature of the relationship is socially constructed through their interactions (Uhl-Bien, 2006), inclusive leadership is considered to be driven by the two-way inﬂuence process between leaders and followers. Rather than leaders directing followers, inclusive approaches establish norms of active consultation and participation, which drive shared decision-making within a team or organization (Hollander, 2009). In effect, by inviting and appreciating the contributions of all individuals, this leadership approach helps people feel they are genuinely valued members of the team or orga- nization (Tyler & Lind, 1992). Accordingly, inclusive leadership is con- sidered to be fundamental focuses on to relational interpersonal relationships and drives followers’ perceptions that leaders are fair and accountable and attentive to their needs.

# leadership as it

Foundational research on inclusive leadership from a leadership per- spective derives from qualitative insights from healthcare teams and leader behaviors. Speciﬁcally,using data from operating room and intensivecare unit teams, researchers found evidence of leader approaches for creating psy- chologically safe environments within teams regardless of professional role or

# Roberson and Perry

status relationships. The ﬁndings showed that nurse managers and surgeon team leaders who proactively invited and acknowledged others’ input helped team members to feel greater psychological safety in the team (Edmondson, 1996, 2003). Based on this evidence, Nembhard and Edmondson (2006) put forth the concept of leader inclusiveness, which represents words and actions by leaders to include the opinions and contributions of all employees. With a focus employee involvement in decision-making and empowerment, in- clusive leadership is considered to be related to participative leadership. Yet, it is considered to be a unique approach given its relevance in situations characterized by status or power differences, which constrain the ability of some groups to express themselves and feel that their contributions are valued (Nemhard & Edmondson, 2006). Inclusive leadership is argued to be ap- plicable to situations in which members’statuses vary according to the degree to which they are considered insiders and incorporates behaviors to include those whose perspectives and opinions might otherwise be ignored (Hollander, 2009). As such, it is considered to be characterized by be- haviors that invite and genuinely appreciate others’ views and expertise regardless of group memberships or background (see Nemhard & Edmondson, 2006).

Edmondson (2004) proposed indicators of inclusive leadership. Speciﬁ- cally, she speculated that leaders who are available and accessible to em- ployees both physically and psychologically may help to create a climate of approachability, which reduces barriers to voice and input. Edmondson (2004) also reasoned that because leaders model acceptable behavior in teams, displaying an openness to others’ points of view may encourage employees to more freely share their thoughts and be receptive to others’ input. Consistent with this model of inclusive leadership, Carmeli, Reiter-Palmon, and Ziv (2010) developed a measure that speciﬁes behavioral manifestations of these indicators. Through this measure, they suggest that a leader’s discernable presence and readiness for consultation on any issue helps to communicate norms of availability and accessibility. In addition, they speculate that a leader’s attentiveness to, and encouragement of, opportunities to improve work processes and achieve group goals convey norms of openness that embolden employees to take risks.

Despite research that explores elements of inclusive leadership, there are some limitations. While some researchers have attempted to conceptualize inclusive leadership, it has at times been used as an all-encompassing con- struct for any approach to leadership that incorporates behaviors to form high- quality interpersonal relationships with followers and show appreciation and support for their efforts (Javed, Naqvi, Khan, Arjoon, & Tayyeb, 2017). As a result, ﬁndings regarding dimensions of participative, servant, and other

# 761

# 762

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

forms of leadership have been confounded with those of inclusive leadership. Similarly, in research to identify inclusive behaviors, some researchers have instead focused on actions to create psychologically safe environments. Consequently, we cannot adequately distinguish between leadership ap- proaches to foster employees’ feelings of inclusion versus their comfort to take interpersonal risks and be their whole selves without repercussions. In this study, we focus on inclusive leadership and investigate behaviors de- scribed by leaders to facilitate inclusiveness.

## Reconciling Perspectives on Inclusive Leadership

Although inclusive leadership theory and research derive from both diversity and leadership research traditions, there are a few common elements that emerge from these literature streams that together suggest behaviors for enacting an inclusive approach to leadership. Based on prior research in this area, we expect that inclusive leadership incorporates behaviors to create a sense of shared identity among work group members. According to leadership research, information regarding an individual’s value to the group is communicated by the leader (Tyler & Lind, 1992), who is also seen as a representative or prototype group member, establishing behaviors that group members should adopt. Accordingly, we expect leaders to enact behaviors that facilitate a common identity within the group and that invite and appreciate others’ contributions. We also anticipate leaders to emphasize behaviors that treat individuals as an insider and address their needs for belongingness.

The enactment of inclusive leadership within the leadership and diversity literatures also incorporates behaviors to reduce status differences within workgroups. Drawing from leadership perspective on inclusiveness, we expect leaders to highlight behaviors to solicit and integrate the viewpoints and opinions from those whose input into decision-making processes may not typically be valued. We also conjecture that leader efforts to be approachable and reachable by all members of the work group, which prior research posits to reduce potential barriers to interaction and information exchange, partic- ularly among those who might typically be considered outsiders, will be salient. In effect, we also anticipate that leaders will draw attention to be- haviors focused on eradicating cliques and other status boundaries within the team. As this reduction of status distinction is also an important component of inclusive leadership from a diversity management perspective, we expect leaders to describe actions to ensure equity and justice within the work group as critical to the enactment of inclusive leadership.

Existing theory and research also underscores the importance of follower participation and involvement in decision processes. Leadership researchers

# Roberson and Perry

posit leader inclusiveness to be a relational approach that operates according to norms of input and shared decision-making, even when members’ con- tributions may be divergent from those of the leader or others in the team. Likewise, diversity researchers emphasize the importance of work group members having a sense of uniqueness, such that their distinct characteristics and contributions are considered to be valuable to the group’s success. Yet, rather than simply acknowledge members’ individuality, leader inclusiveness takes action to ensure that decision-making power is distributed across group members and members have a say in how the group’s work is done. Ac- cordingly, we expect leaders to describe behaviors that display an openness to member input, even when their perspectives and opinions may diverge from the norm, to be highlighted as critical to the enactment of inclusive leadership.

# Methods

# Sample

The sample consisted of 27 leaders of a large healthcare system in the United States who were enrolled in a 2-day executive education course on inclusive leadership. Although professional development credits were received for participation in the course, participation in the survey was voluntary. The sample included low-to-mid-level managers (e.g., program ofﬁcer, senior coordinator, manager, and director) and had an average of 30 direct reports (including temporary workers, contractors, part-time workers, and volun- teers). The sample was 70% female and 90% white.

# Procedures

Prior to the start of the course, participants were provided with a survey on which they were asked to answer the following questions: “What is inclusive leadership?” and “How do you demonstrate inclusive leadership in your role?” To ensure anonymity, respondents were able to submit their answers via completed paper surveys or an online survey platform. For those that com- pleted paper surveys, their responses were transcribed verbatim into a data ﬁle that contained only survey identiﬁcation numbers.

# Analyses

In analyzing survey responses, we used two different approaches. Given the absence of a preexisting taxonomy specifying dimensions and a frag- mented literature on indicators of inclusive leadership, we used an inductive

# 763

# 764

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

content-analysis approach to develop themes. Using a basic analytical ap- proach that involved data reduction, data grouping, and the formation of concepts (Anandarajan, Hill & Nolan, 2019), we produced extracts of re- spondents’ natural language responses to the survey questions that allowed us to summarize concepts and themes. Further, by conducting both manual and assisted thematic analyses, we were able to validate the descriptions of leaders’ perspectives of and experiences with inclusive leadership.

Manual content analysis. To explore inclusive leadership dimensions and behaviors, we content analyzed verbatim responses to the open-ended questions using pattern coding procedures (Krippendorf, 1980; Miles & Huberman, 1994). First, two graduate research assistants independently an- alyzed respondents’ comments to identify common themes and formed content areas that captured them.They recognized a total of 25 themes and had an overall agreement of 86%. An analysis of the themes showed that most of the discrepancies were due to differences in level (i.e., superordinate vs. subordinate categories with the same theme) rather than content. For example, one coder separated appreciation and utilizing of diversity into two thematic areas while the other subsumed these dimensions into a single theme. Col- lapsing these ﬁne-grained distinctions into superordinate themes yielded 21 themes—11 for the ﬁrst question and 10 for the second question. These themes were then validated by a third independent coder, who recoded all responses using the composite list of themes for each question. This con- ﬁrmatory coding yielded 88% agreement with our themes. All disagreements were resolved through discussion and consensus.

Assisted content analysis. To conﬁrm our emergent themes, the original tran- scripts were also analyzed using a qualitative data analysis program, NVivo. After entering the transcripts, we ran a separate analysis for each of the questions. Each question yielded seven second-order themes that we cross- checked with the manual content analysis. Comparing the autoanalysis to the manual coding, we found a substantive overlap between the themes provided by the auto-coding and those provided by the manual coding.

# Results

All respondents provided answers to the survey questions, resulting in 54 total comments. These comments were then separated into 151 phrases— speciﬁcally, 63 regarding the concept of inclusive leadership and 88 re- garding the enactment of inclusive leadership. Our manual content analysis of responses to the question, “what is inclusive leadership?”, yielded several

# 765

themes (see Table 1). As anticipated, the results highlighted themes related to reducing status differences in teams. Speciﬁcally, relational themes, such as relating to and showing a genuine interest in others, generating trust, and treating people fairly, emerged. Although these themes seemed to focus on relationships between leaders and followers, other themes associated with fostering team climates in which people feel motivated to engage, such as

creating a welcoming and constructive environment, maintaining an open mind when interacting with others, and creating a sense of empowerment among employees, surfaced as well. Given these themes regarding openness, it follows that themes related to creating a shared identity and facilitating employee participation and involvement were also found. Speciﬁcally, re- spondents referenced encouraging people to provide input and share ideas, listening to and learning from others, and facilitating teamwork and col- laboration as aspects of inclusive leadership. Respondents also underscored the importance of balancing the tension between a shared identity and a sense of uniqueness by identifying the creation of diverse teams and appreciating and utilizing the varied experiences, talents, skills, and perspectives that come with such diversity as key dimensions of inclusive leadership.

Our assisted analysis of responses to the question on the concept of inclusive leadership revealed a number of keywords that yielded ﬁve second- order themes, as shown in Figure 1. In deﬁning inclusive leadership, re- spondents emphasized a focus on the team as a collective and utilizing the unique skills within the team. In addition, they highlighted the importance of allowing everyone to be involved in work processes and contribute their perspectives to the team. Themes related to acknowledging and understanding differences among team members and valuing such differences also emerged. Based on a hierarchy chart of these second-order themes, our third coder was

able to collapse them into four distant aggregate themes: maintaining a team focus, understanding and valuing differences, skill utilization, and allowing action. The derivation of these aggregate themes is presented in Figure 1.

Our analysis of responses to the question, “how do you demonstrate in- clusive leadership in your role?”, yielded several themes (see Table 2). While

a belongingness theme of cultivating regular team interactions emerged, leadership actions related to creating a sense of uniqueness were also ref- erenced by respondents. Such themes included recruiting, hiring, and re- taining a diverse staff; encouraging and valuing diverse work styles and contributions; and acknowledging and accounting for individual needs. Themes relatedto the utilization of employee uniqueness, such as encouraging employees to voice their opinions and share feedback in different ways and inviting disagreement and debate, were also present. Leaders also recalled behaviors focused on creating opportunities for staff contributions, in par- ticular through being available and responsive to all staff. The results also revealed several themes unassociated with inclusive leadership in extant research in leaders’ descriptions of their demonstration of inclusive leadership. Speciﬁcally, role modeling emotional intelligence and cultural competence, showing appreciation for people’s talents and work, and developing others were key themes.

Our assisted analysis of responses to the question on the demonstration of inclusive leadership yielded six second-order themes, as shown in Figure 2. In demonstrating inclusive leadership, respondents emphasized practices to attract, leverage, and retain diversity in their teams. In addition, they high- lighted actions to recognize and use unique member skills and contributions that accompany such diversity. To further demonstrate inclusive leadership,

Figure 2. Emergent themes from assisted content analysis: demonstration of inclusive leadership.

# Roberson and Perry

respondents described engaging in behaviors to reduce communication barriers, facilitate open communication, and provide everyone with an op- portunity to provide input. Themes related to allocating time to demonstrate inclusiveness through various approaches, such as one-on-one staff meetings or team review and feedback sessions, also emerged. Based on a hierarchy chart of these second-order themes, our third coder was able to collapse them into four distant aggregate themes: communication, diverse human resource management, person-role ﬁt, and agency. The derivation of these aggregate themes is presented in Figure 2.

# Discussion

Based ontheoryand research to understand inclusive leadership behaviors, we adopt a complementary approach to explore how leaders do sensemaking about the concept and enactment of behaviors to create inclusive work en- vironments. In particular, we analyzed leaders’ deﬁnitions of inclusive leadership and accounts of their actions to demonstrate inclusive leadership in their roles. This approach enabled us to both explore current inclusive leadership themes within our data and broaden the range of behaviors that might be studied under this approach to leadership. Although our data proved more challenging to analyze than those typically generated in quantitative research, we were able to study unobtrusive indicators of inclusive leadership from leaders themselves. Accordingly, we were afforded insight into their interpretation patterns for inclusiveleadership andoffer a different perspective on the phenomenon. We summarize our key ﬁndings below and place them in context within the inclusion and leadership literatures. We also consider the limitations of our work and offer directions for theory, research, and practice.

## Conceptualization of Inclusive Leadership

Given that inclusive leadership research has progressed along distinct the- oretical paths within the diversity and leadership literatures, our study allowed for a more integrated investigation of the concept and related behaviors. Through an analysis of leaders’ deﬁnitions of inclusive leadership, we identiﬁed several themes. Consistent with prior conceptualizations of work group inclusion for which uniqueness as a key component (see Shore et al., 2011), leaders in our study highlighted the recognition of differences within a team or organizationas a critical component of inclusive leadership. Referring to both observable and unobservable diversity within teams, the importance of having diverse perspectives represented in the team was emphasized. However, contrary to having such diversity for the sake of diversity, themes regarding

# 769

# 770

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

leveraging diversity to enhance team performance emerged. Leaders described the utilization of diverse perspectives and skills within a team as a facet of inclusive leadership yet also noted the importance of building and maintaining environments that enable employee contributions, such as treating employees equitably and creating a sense of empowerment, in order to do so.

In line with the belongingness component of work group inclusion (Shore et al., 2011), our results also suggest a shared identity as a component of inclusive leadership. Speciﬁcally, leaders highlighted collaborative ap- proaches to work and employee involvement in critical work processes as important to leader inclusiveness. However, as our ﬁndings also emphasize the importance of reducing status differences, we might extrapolate that inclusive leadership involves something more than leaders facilitating par- ticipation and creating a sense of community. Leaders in this study em- phasized the importance of developing and maintaining interpersonal relationships with followers by relating to, and showing a genuine interest in, others. With listening and learning from others’ perspectives and generating trust from others on the team also salient, our results may underscore the relational aspect of inclusive leadership. Speciﬁcally, while leaders may build environments that engage and leverage the diversity of perspectives within a team, inclusion may be driven by the two-way inﬂuence processes that help to generate trust between leaders and followers (see Uhl-Bien, 2006). Such interactions may help to abate the effects of power and status differences and develop relationships that create the experience for team members of feeling like an insider and subsequently included.

We also recognized a category of comments focused on the importance of inclusive leadership mindsets. Some leaders noted “allowing” for employee action within the work environment, such as allowing people to feel they can be their authentic selves or allowing diverse employees to contribute. On one hand, such comments may highlight the role of leader intention in creating psychologically safe work environments. On the other hand, they may capture respondent perceptions of the roles of power andstatusin inclusive leadership. Allowing follower action may be reﬂective of leaders recognizing yet at- tempting to diminish power and status differences within the team. They may also be indicative of a more informal leadership component, which can be exercised outside of a leader’s formal or positional authority. Allowing team member action may be used to signal inclusion in the form of legitimacy with the norms, values, and approaches accepted by the work group (see Zelditch, 2001), although the resultant experience for members may differ from that conceptualized in the inclusion literature. Thus, while creating a space in which employees can be themselves and contribute to work discussions and decisions is important for inclusive leadership, the ﬁndings of our study

# Roberson and Perry

highlight the importance of distinguishing between actions to build and maintain inclusive environments versus providing approval or implicitly granting individuals permission to engage with the group’s work.

# Demonstration of Inclusive Leadership

Our study also explored leader accounts of behaviors for demonstrating inclusive leadership. Consistent with the emergent themes related to leaders’ conceptualization of inclusive leadership, we identiﬁed behavioral themes that represent a subset of actions for inviting and appreciating team members’ contributions and leveraging those contributions to enhance work processes and outputs. The results showed efforts to attract, build, motivate, and retain diverse workforces to be considered critical for fostering inclusive work environments, although encouraging and valuing the diversity in member talents were also highlighted as important. Diverging from the ﬁndings of inclusive leadership research, leaders in our study also drew attention to responding to team member needs by enabling their contributions in areas that offer a ﬁt to their unique skill sets. Notably, however, inclusive approaches to doing so were noted to involve assigning members to projects for which they might be well-suited as well as asking members for their perspectives on how and where they might best contribute.

Also congruent with prior research ﬁndings, the results of this study emphasized behaviors related to inviting and acknowledging others’ view- points. Importantly, leaders highlighted the importance of providing team members with opportunities to voice their opinions and provide feedback in different ways and encouraging member input even when their opinions may be divergent from those of the leader or others in the team. As team par- ticipation norms may inﬂuence who speaks up and who gets heard, inviting input in different forums or via different mechanisms may account for in- dividual communication styles and decrease the potential effects of commu- nication barriers on team processes and performance. Further, leader behaviors to facilitate communication with and between team members may increase the likelihood that each member’s knowledge, skills, and perspectives are in- corporated into the team’s work. Our ﬁndings also suggest that purposefully inviting disagreement and debate may be useful for eradicating intragroup boundaries and engaging those who might typically be excluded from decision- making processes. As such, future research should examine leader commu- nication behaviors as a key component of inclusive leadership models.

Building upon the set of inclusive leadership behaviors identiﬁed in prior research, our results highlight the importance of leaders’ responsibility for creating opportunities to engage with team members. In line with inclusive

leadership research which speculates that leaders who are available and accessible to employees help to create climates of approachability and psychological safety (Edmondson, 2004), the leaders in our study emphasize behaviors for making time to meet individually with team members and proactively doing so. While reporting such behaviors may be reﬂective of leaders’ aspirational behavior for creating an experience of inclusion, this emergent theme suggests that the actual establishment of environments (e.g., space, time, etc.) in which inclusive behavior can occur is important. Ac- cordingly, research is needed to examine leader agency in terms of availability and accessibility as a behavioral dimension of inclusive leadership.

## Limitations and Future Research Directions

As with any study, there are limitations that should be acknowledged. Given our sample, we should be cautious in presuming the generalizability of the research ﬁndings. Speciﬁcally, with a relatively small sample, we may have detected more variability in our results, thus reducing the reliability of ﬁndings. While themes emerged within the data, a larger sample may reduce the magnitude of speciﬁc themes or be useful for detecting superordinate categories related to inclusive leadership. Our ability to draw conclusions about universal approaches to inclusive leadership would be further strengthened by data collection outside of the sampling organization as multiple source data would allow us to rule out the likelihood that themes identiﬁed in this study are speciﬁc to our research site. Therefore, future research is needed to assess inclusive leadership and its demonstration across a variety of contexts ranging in size, industry, mission and strategy, and culture. Further, while we did not capture leader individual differences in order to maintain a level of anonymity, data from a larger and diverse group of leaders may help to offer additional insight into antecedents of inclusive leadership and enhance the reproducibility of our ﬁndings.

There are also disadvantages to our methodology as our results are con- strained by the reliability and validity of the questions posed to respondents. While our approach allowed them to describe in their own words the meaning and enactment of inclusive leadership, their responses may have been inﬂuenced by our phrasing. Speciﬁcally, by asking about the demonstration of inclusive leadership, respondents may have focused on strategies for pre- senting as inclusive leaders or on an ideal set of behaviors rather than on actual behaviors. Accordingly, future research using interview data from leaders or matched data from employees may offer additional insight into what leaders can actually do to create and maintain inclusive environments. Further, re- search to assess leader behaviors for reducing employee exclusion and

promoting inclusion may be effective for understanding the breadth of in- clusive leadership and the range of effects on employee inclusion experiences. Future research could also beneﬁt from an examination of outcomes of the inclusive leadership behaviors identiﬁed in this study. As prior research suggests that leader inclusiveness enhances psychological safety and work engagement (Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006; Choi, Tran, & Park, 2015), studies for exploring the degree to which behaviors highlighted here for inviting and appreciating others’ perspectives and skills, even when they diverge from established norms or are in conﬂict with established views, and leveraging and enhancing employee contributions may advance our un- derstanding of the inﬂuence of inclusive leadership. Based on research that shows leader openness to, and respect for, new ideas and feedback facilitates a supportive climate in which employees feel comfortable experimenting and offering alternative perspectives (Choi et al., 2015, Choi, Tran, & Kang, 2017; Javed et al., 2017; Qi, Liu, Wei, & Hu, 2019), studies to investigate the relationship between inclusive leadership behaviors and employee creativity and innovation would help us to further understand its impact. As feelings of psychological safety resultingfrom leader inclusiveness have also been shown to inﬂuence employee learning from errors and failures (Hirak, Peng, Carmeli, & Schaubroeck, 2012; Ye, Wang, & Li, 2018), research to observe associ- ations between speciﬁc inclusive leadership behaviors and various perfor- mance measures may be useful for highlighting how this approach affects group and organizational functioning.

# Practice Implications

From a leadership perspective, our results highlight strategies for creating more inclusive environments. While leaders may struggle with distinguishing between actions for diversity management versus those for fostering a sense of inclusion, the ﬁndings of this study emphasize the invitation and genuine appreciation of employee contributions as supporting the latter. For example, askingteammemberswhatandhowtheywanttocontributeaswellasassigning projects to different members of the team may help to uncover and utilize employees’ diverse talents and work styles. Similarly, efforts to create sup- portive environments, such as learning how team members want to be treated and encouraging teamwork and communication skills in others, may facilitate a sense of belonging and establish a community in which employees feel comfortable contributing and taking risks. Our results also suggest that leaders may makeemployees feel includedbyengaginginbehaviors to invite all voices into work conversations and value those points of view. For example, breaking up cliques and making sure outspoken members do not dominate conversations

and decisions may reduce status differences within the team and accentuate the team’s identity. As such, individuals may feel valued as both individuals and members of the team, thereby strengthening their sense of inclusion.

Given the range of behaviors to enact inclusive leadership, leaders may beneﬁt from resources to understand the concept and demonstration of in- clusive leadership as well as the different approaches to building more in- clusive work climates. Instruments that provide a list of inclusive leadership behaviors in which leaders may engage, similar to the one offered by Chrobot- Mason & Roberson (in press), may be useful for highlighting inclusive leadership behaviors in a variety of settings. Such instruments may also help leaders learn more about inclusive behaviors that can be incorporated into their daily activities and interactions as well as recognize areas for future development. We might also normalize inclusive leadership by integrating the knowledge and development of such behaviors into business curricula and other leadership training programs.

The ﬁndings also provide insight into the design of leadership development initiatives to create more inclusive leaders. Development programs should provide current and future leaders with opportunities to experiment with and practice inclusive leadership behaviors. For example, special projects or other stretch assignments with teams characterized by different types and amount of diversity may help leaders learn how to foster inclusive environments. Such experiences may be further supplemented by assessments that allow leaders to self-evaluate and gain insight from their direct reports on behavioral areas of improvement for becoming more inclusive. Coaching to strengthen leaders’ capacity for inclusive leadership as well as rewards for exhibiting inclusive behaviors may also be important for bringing about behavioral change and strengthening climates for inclusion in organizations.

# Conclusion

As the workforce becomes increasingly diverse and organizations continue to operate in increasingly competitive environments, inclusive leadership may be viewed as a strategy to ensure that the potential beneﬁts of a diverse workforce are realized. That is, inclusive leaders play a critical role in creating environments in which different ideas, perspectives, experiences, and values are leveraged to foster the beneﬁts of diversity and enhance individual, team, and organizational outcomes. A key takeaway from this study is that prac- ticing inclusive leadership requires both a mindset and behaviors to create experiences of inclusionwhichensurethat everyone feels liketheyare part of the group, they can participate fully, and are valued for their contributions.
