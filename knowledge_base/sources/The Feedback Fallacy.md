The Feedback Fallacy For years, managers have been encouraged to praise and constructively criticize just about everything their employees do. But there are better ways to help employees thrive and excel. by Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall

The debate about feedback at work isn’t new. Since at least the

middle of the last century, the question of how to get employees

to improve has generated a good deal of opinion and research. But

recently the discussion has taken on new intensity. The ongoing

## experiment in “radical transparency” at Bridgewater Associates and the

culture at Netﬂix, which the Wall Street Journal recently described as

“encouraging harsh feedback” and subjecting workers to “intense and

awkward” real-time 360s, are but two examples of the overriding belief

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Feedback Fallacy

that the way to increase performance in companies is through rigorous,

## frequent, candid, pervasive, and often critical feedback.

How should we give and receive feedback? we wonder. How much, and

how often, and using which new app? And, given the hoopla over the

## approaches of Bridgewater and Netﬂix, how hard-edged and fearlessly

candid should we be? Behind those questions, however, is another

question that we’re missing, and it’s a crucial one. The search for ways to

give and receive better feedback assumes that feedback is always useful.

But the only reason we’re pursuing it is to help people do better. And

when we examine that—asking, How can we help each person thrive and

excel?—we ﬁnd that the answers take us in a diﬀerent direction.

To be clear, instruction—telling people what steps to follow or what

factual knowledge they’re lacking—can be truly useful: That’s why we

have checklists in airplane cockpits and, more recently, in operating

rooms. There is indeed a right way for a nurse to give an injection safely,

and if you as a novice nurse miss one of the steps, or if you’re unaware

of critical facts about a patient’s condition, then someone should tell

you. But the occasions when the actions or knowledge necessary to

minimally perform a job can be objectively deﬁned in advance are rare

and becoming rarer. What we mean by “feedback” is very diﬀerent.

Feedback is about telling people what we think of their performance

and how they should do it better—whether they’re giving an eﬀective

presentation, leading a team, or creating a strategy. And on that, the

research is clear: Telling people what we think of their performance

doesn’t help them thrive and excel, and telling people how we think

they should improve actually hinders learning.

Underpinning the current conviction that feedback is an unalloyed

good are three theories that we in the business world commonly accept

as truths. The ﬁrst is that other people are more aware than you are of

your weaknesses, and that the best way to help you, therefore, is for

them to show you what you cannot see for yourself. We can call this our

theory of the source of truth. You do not realize that your suit is shabby,

that your presentation is boring, or that your voice is grating, so it is up

to your colleagues to tell you as plainly as possible “where you stand.” If

they didn’t, you would never know, and this would be bad.

The second belief is that the process of learning is like ﬁlling up an

empty vessel: You lack certain abilities you need to acquire, so your

colleagues should teach them to you. We can call this our theory of

learning. If you’re in sales, how can you possibly close deals if you

don’t learn the competency of “mirroring and matching” the prospect?

If you’re a teacher, how can you improve if you don’t learn and practice

the steps in the latest team-teaching technique or “ﬂipped classroom”

format? The thought is that you can’t—and that you need feedback to

develop the skills you’re missing.

And the third belief is that great performance is universal, analyzable,

and describable, and that once deﬁned, it can be transferred from one

person to another, regardless of who each individual is. Hence you can,

with feedback about what excellence looks like, understand where you

fall short of this ideal and then strive to remedy your shortcomings.

We can call this our theory of excellence. If you’re a manager, your boss

might show you the company’s supervisor-behaviors model, hold you

up against it, and tell you what you need to do to more closely hew to it.

If you aspire to lead, your ﬁrm might use a 360-degree feedback tool to

## measure you against its predeﬁned leadership competencies and then

suggest various courses or experiences that will enable you to acquire

the competencies that your results indicate you lack.

What these three theories have in common is self-centeredness: They

take our own expertise and what we are sure is our colleagues’

inexpertise as givens; they assume that my way is necessarily your

way. But as it turns out, in extrapolating from what creates our own

performance to what might create performance in others, we overreach.

Research reveals that none of these theories is true. The more we

depend on them, and the more technology we base on them, the less

learning and productivity we will get from others. To understand why

and to see the path to a more eﬀective way of improving performance,

let’s look more closely at each theory in turn.

# The Source of Truth

The ﬁrst problem with feedback is that humans are unreliable raters of

other humans. Over the past 40 years psychometricians have shown in

study after study that people don’t have the objectivity to hold in their

## heads a stable deﬁnition of an abstract quality, such as business acumen

or assertiveness, and then accurately evaluate someone else on it. Our

evaluations are deeply colored by our own understanding of what we’re

rating others on, our own sense of what good looks like for a particular

## competency, our harshness or leniency as raters, and our own inherent

and unconscious biases. This phenomenon is called the idiosyncratic

rater effect, and it’s large (more than half of your rating of someone

else reﬂects your characteristics, not hers) and resilient (no training can

lessen it). In other words, the research shows that feedback is more

# distortion than truth.

This is why, despite all the training available on how to receive feedback,

it’s such hard work: Recipients have to struggle through this forest of

distortion in search of something that they recognize as themselves.

And because your feedback to others is always more you than them,

it leads to systematic error, which is magniﬁed when ratings are

considered in aggregate. There are only two sorts of measurement error

in the world: random error, which you can reduce by averaging many

readings; and systematic error, which you can’t. Unfortunately, we all

seem to have left math class remembering the former and not the latter.

We’ve built all our performance and leadership feedback tools as though

assessment errors are random, and they’re not. They’re systematic.

Consider color blindness. If we ask a color-blind person to rate the

redness of a particular rose, we won’t trust his feedback—we know

that he is incapable of seeing, let alone “rating,” red. His error isn’t

random; it’s predictable and explainable, and it stems from a ﬂaw in

his measurement system; hence, it’s systematic. If we then decide to

ask seven more color-blind people to rate the redness of our rose, their

errors will be equally systematic, and averaging their ratings won’t get

us any closer to determining the actual redness of the rose. In fact, it’s

worse than this. Adding up all the inaccurate redness ratings—“gray,”

“pretty gray,” “whitish gray,” “muddy brown,” and so on—and averaging

them leads us further away both from learning anything reliable about

the individuals’ personal experiences of the rose and from the actual

truth of how red our rose really is.

What the research has revealed is that we’re all color-blind when it

comes to abstract attributes, such as strategic thinking, potential, and

political savvy. Our inability to rate others on them is predictable and

explainable—it is systematic. We cannot remove the error by adding

more data inputs and averaging them out, and doing that actually

makes the error bigger.

Worse still, although science has long since proven that we are color-

blind, in the business world we assume we’re clear-eyed. Deep down

we don’t think we make very many errors at all. We think we’re reliable

raters of others. We think we’re a source of truth. We aren’t. We’re a

# source of error.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Feedback Fallacy

## When a feedback instrument surveys eight colleagues about your

business acumen, your score of 3.79 is far greater a distortion than if it

simply surveyed one person about you—the 3.79 number is all noise, no

signal. Given that (a) we’re starting to see more of this sort of data-based

feedback, (b) this data on you will likely be kept by your company for a

very long time, and (c) it will be used to pay, promote, train, and deploy

or ﬁre you, you should be worried about just how fundamentally ﬂawed

it really is.

The only realm in which humans are an unimpeachable source of truth

is that of their own feelings and experiences. Doctors have long known

this. When they check up on you post-op, they’ll ask, “On a scale of one

to 10, with 10 being high, how would you rate your pain?” And if you

say, “Five,” the doctor may then prescribe all manner of treatments, but

what she’s unlikely to do is challenge you on your “ﬁve.” It doesn’t make

sense, no matter how many operations she has done, to tell you your

“ﬁve” is wrong, and that, actually, this morning your pain is a “three.” It

doesn’t make sense to try to parse what you mean by “ﬁve,” and whether

any cultural diﬀerences might indicate that your “ﬁve” is not, in fact, a

real “ﬁve.” It doesn’t make sense to hold calibration sessions with other

doctors to ensure that your “ﬁve” is the same as the other “ﬁves” in the

rooms down the hall. Instead, she can be conﬁdent that you are the best

judge of your pain and that all she can know for sure is that you will be

feeling better when you rate your pain lower. Your rating is yours, not

# hers.

Just as your doctor doesn’t know the truth of your pain, we don’t know

the truth about our colleagues, at least not in any objective way. You

may read that workers today—especially Millennials—want to know

where they stand. You may occasionally have team members ask you

to tell them where they stand, objectively. You may feel that it’s your

duty to try to answer these questions. But you can’t—none of us can.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Feedback Fallacy

All we can do—and it’s not nothing—is share our own feelings and

experiences, our own reactions. Thus we can tell someone whether

his voice grates on us; whether he’s persuasive to us; whether his

presentation is boring to us. We may not be able to tell him where he

stands, but we can tell him where he stands with us. Those are our

truths, not his. This is a humbler claim, but at least it’s accurate.

# How We Learn

Another of our collective theories is that feedback contains useful

information, and that this information is the magic ingredient that

will accelerate someone’s learning. Again, the research points in the

opposite direction. Learning is less a function of adding something

that isn’t there than it is of recognizing, reinforcing, and reﬁning what

already is. There are two reasons for this.

The ﬁrst is that, neurologically, we grow more in our areas of greater

ability (our strengths are our development areas). The brain continues

to develop throughout life, but each person’s does so diﬀerently.

## Because of your genetic inheritance and the oddities of your early

childhood environment, your brain’s wiring is utterly unique. Some

parts of it have tight thickets of synaptic connections, while others are

far less dense, and these patterns are diﬀerent from one person to the

next. According to brain science, people grow far more neurons and

synaptic connections where they already have the most neurons and

synaptic connections. In other words, each brain grows most where it’s

## already strongest. As Joseph LeDoux, a professor of neuroscience at

New York University, memorably described it, “Added connections are

## therefore more like new buds on a branch rather than new branches.”

Through this lens, learning looks a lot like building, little by little, on

the unique patterns already there within you. Which in turn means

learning has to start by ﬁnding and understanding those patterns—your

# patterns, not someone else’s.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Feedback Fallacy

Focusing people on their shortcomings doesn’t enable learning; it impairs it.

Second, getting attention to our strengths from others catalyzes

## learning, whereas attention to our weaknesses smothers it. Neurological

science also shows what happens to us when other people focus on

what’s working within us instead of remediating what isn’t. In one

experiment scientists split students into two groups. To one group they

gave positive coaching, asking the students about their dreams and how

they’d go about achieving them. The scientists probed the other group

about homework and what the students thought they were doing wrong

and needed to ﬁx. While those conversations were happening, the

scientists hooked each student up to a functional magnetic resonance

imaging machine to see which parts of the brain were most activated in

## response to these diﬀerent sorts of attention.

In the brains of the students asked about what they needed to correct,

the sympathetic nervous system lit up. This is the “ﬁght or ﬂight”

system, which mutes the other parts of the brain and allows us to

focus only on the information most necessary to survive. Your brain

responds to critical feedback as a threat and narrows its activity.

The strong negative emotion produced by criticism “inhibits access

to existing neural circuits and invokes cognitive, emotional, and

## perceptual impairment,” psychology and business professor Richard

Boyatzis said in summarizing the researchers’ ﬁndings.

Focusing people on their shortcomings or gaps doesn’t enable learning.

It impairs it.

In the students who focused on their dreams and how they might

achieve them, the sympathetic nervous system was not activated.

What lit up instead was the parasympathetic nervous system,

sometimes referred to as the “rest and digest” system. To quote

Boyatzis again: “The parasympathetic nervous system…stimulates adult

neurogenesis (i.e., growth of new neurons)…, a sense of well-being,

## better immune system functioning, and cognitive, emotional, and

# perceptual openness.”

What ﬁndings such as these show us is, ﬁrst, that learning happens

when we see how we might do something better by adding some new

nuance or expansion to our own understanding. Learning rests on our

grasp of what we’re doing well, not on what we’re doing poorly, and

certainly not on someone else’s sense of what we’re doing poorly. And

second, that we learn most when someone else pays attention to what’s

working within us and asks us to cultivate it intelligently. We’re often

told that the key to learning is to get out of our comfort zones, but

these ﬁndings contradict that particular chestnut: Take us very far out

of our comfort zones, and our brains stop paying attention to anything

other than surviving the experience. It’s clear that we learn most in

our comfort zones, because that’s where our neural pathways are most

concentrated. It’s where we’re most open to possibility, most creative,

insightful, and productive. That’s where feedback must meet us—in our

# moments of ﬂow.

# Excellence

We spend the bulk of our working lives pursuing excellence in the belief

that while deﬁning it is easy, the really hard part is codifying how we

and everyone else on our team should get there. We’ve got it backward:

Excellence in any endeavor is almost impossible to deﬁne, and yet

getting there, for each of us, is relatively easy.

Excellence is idiosyncratic. Take funniness—the ability to make others

laugh. If you watch early Steve Martin clips, you might land on the idea

that excellence at it means strumming a banjo, waggling your knees,

and wailing, “I’m a wild and crazy guy!” But watch Jerry Seinfeld, and

you might conclude that it means talking about nothing in a slightly

annoyed, exasperated tone. And if you watch Sarah Silverman, you

might think to yourself, no, it’s being caustic, blunt, and rude in an

incongruously aﬀectless way. At this point you may begin to perceive

the truth that “funny” is inherent to the person.

Watch an NBA game, and you may think to yourself, “Yes, most of them

are tall and athletic, but boy, not only does each player have a diﬀerent

role on the team, but even the players in the same role on the same team

seem to do it diﬀerently.” Examine something as speciﬁc and as limited

as the free throws awarded after fouls, and you’ll learn that not only do

the top two free-throw shooters in history have utterly diﬀerent styles,

but one of them, Rick Barry—the best ever on the day he retired (look

him up)—didn’t even throw overhand.

Excellence seems to be inextricably and wonderfully intertwined with

whoever demonstrates it. Each person’s version of it is uniquely shaped

and is an expression of that person’s individuality. Which means that,

for each of us, excellence is easy, in that it is a natural, ﬂuid, and

intelligent expression of our best extremes. It can be cultivated, but it’s

# unforced.

Excellence is also not the opposite of failure. But in virtually all aspects

of human endeavor, people assume that it is and that if they study

what leads to pathological functioning and do the reverse—or replace

what they found missing—they can create optimal functioning. That

assumption is ﬂawed. Study disease and you will learn a lot about

disease and precious little about health. Eradicating depression will get

you no closer to joy. Divorce is mute on the topic of happy marriage. Exit

interviews with employees who leave tell you nothing about why others

stay. If you study failure, you’ll learn a lot about failure but nothing

about how to achieve excellence. Excellence has its own pattern.

And it’s even more problematic than that. Excellence and failure often

have a lot in common. So if you study ineﬀective leaders and observe

that they have big egos, and then argue that good leaders should not

have big egos, you will lead people astray. Why? Because when you do

personality assessments with highly eﬀective leaders, you discover that

they have very strong egos as well. Telling someone that you must lose

your ego to be a good leader is ﬂawed advice. Likewise, if you study

poor salespeople, discover that they take rejection personally, and then

tell a budding salesperson to avoid doing the same, your advice will be

misguided. Why? Because rigorous studies of the best salespeople reveal

that they take rejection deeply personally, too.

As it happens, you ﬁnd that eﬀective leaders put their egos in the

service of others, not themselves, and that eﬀective salespeople take

rejection personally because they are personally invested in the sale—

but the point is that you will never ﬁnd these things out by studying

# ineffective performance.

Since excellence is idiosyncratic and cannot be learned by studying

failure, we can never help another person succeed by holding her

performance up against a prefabricated model of excellence, giving her

feedback on where she misses the model, and telling her to plug the

gaps. That approach will only ever get her to adequate performance.

Point out the grammatical ﬂaws in an essay, ask the writer to ﬁx the

ﬂaws, and while you may get an essay with good grammar, you won’t get

a piece of writing that transports the reader. Show a new teacher when

her students lost interest and tell her what to do to ﬁx this, and while

you may now have a teacher whose students don’t fall asleep in class,

you won’t have one whose students necessarily learn any more.

# How to Help People Excel

If we continue to spend our time identifying failure as we see it and

giving people feedback about how to avoid it, we’ll languish in the

business of adequacy. To get into the excellence business we need some

# new techniques:

Look for outcomes. Excellence is an outcome, so take note of when a

prospect leans into a sales pitch, a project runs smoothly, or an angry

customer suddenly calms down. Then turn to the team member who

created the outcome and say, “That! Yes, that!” By doing this, you’ll stop

the ﬂow of work for a moment and pull your colleague’s attention back

toward something she just did that really worked.

There’s a story about how legendary Dallas Cowboys coach Tom

Landry turned around his struggling team. While the other teams were

reviewing missed tackles and dropped balls, Landry instead combed

through footage of previous games and created for each player a

highlight reel of when he had done something easily, naturally, and

eﬀectively. Landry reasoned that while the number of wrong ways to

do something was inﬁnite, the number of right ways, for any particular

player, was not. It was knowable, and the best way to discover it was to

look at plays where that person had done it excellently. From now on, he

told each team member, “we only replay your winning plays.”

Now on one level he was doing this to make his team members feel

better about themselves because he knew the power of praise. But

according to the story, Landry wasn’t nearly as interested in praise as he

was in learning. His instincts told him that each person would improve

his performance most if he could see, in slow motion, what his own

personal version of excellence looked like.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Feedback Fallacy

You can do the same. Whenever you see one of your people do

something that worked for you, that rocked your world just a little, stop

for a minute and highlight it. By helping your team member recognize

what excellence looks like for her—by saying, “That! Yes, that!”—you’re

oﬀering her the chance to gain an insight; you’re highlighting a pattern

that is already there within her so that she can recognize it, anchor it,

re-create it, and reﬁne it. That is learning.

Replay your instinctive reactions. Unlike Landry, you’re not going to

be able to videotape your people. Instead, learn how to replay to them

your own personal reactions. The key is not to tell someone how well

she’s performed or how good she is. While simple praise isn’t a bad

thing, you are by no means the authority on what objectively good

performance is, and instinctively she knows this. Instead, describe what

you experienced when her moment of excellence caught your attention.

There’s nothing more believable and more authoritative than sharing

what you saw from her and how it made you feel. Use phrases such as

“This is how that came across for me,” or “This is what that made me

think,” or even just “Did you see what you did there?” Those are your

reactions—they are your truth—and when you relay them in speciﬁc

detail, you aren’t judging or rating or ﬁxing her; you’re simply reﬂecting

to her the unique “dent” she just made in the world, as seen through

your eyes. And precisely because it isn’t a judgment or a rating it is at

# once more humble and more powerful.

# Instead of

# Try

# Good job!

Here are three things that really worked for me. What was going through your mind when you did them?

Here’s what you should do.

Here’s what I would do.

Here’s where you need to improve.

Here’s what worked best for me, and here’s why.

That didn’t really work.

When you did x, I felt y or I didn’t get that.

You need to improve your communication skills.

Here’s exactly where you started to lose me.

You need to be more responsive.

When I don’t hear from you, I worry that we’re not on the same page.

You lack strategic thinking.

I’m struggling to understand your plan.

You should do x [in response to a request for advice].

What do you feel you’re struggling with, and what have you done in the past that’s worked in a similar situation?

On the ﬂip side, if you’re the team member, whenever your team leader

catches you doing something right, ask her to pause and describe her

reaction to you. If she says, “Good job!” ask, “Which bit? What did you

see that seemed to work well?” Again, the point of this isn’t to pile on the

praise. The point is to explore the nature of excellence, and this is surely

a better object for all the energy currently being pointed at “radical

transparency” and the like. We’re so close to our own performance that

it’s hard to get perspective on it and see its patterns and components.

Ask for your leader’s help in rendering the unconscious, conscious—so

that you can understand it, improve at it, and, most important, do it

## processor’s immediate attention, and the machine halts normal

operations and jumps the urgent issue to the head of the processing

queue. Like computer processors, team leaders have quite a few things

that demand their attention and force them to act. Many of them are

problems. If you see something go oﬀ the rails—a poorly handled call,

a missed meeting, a project gone awry—the instinct will kick in to stop

everything to tell someone what she did wrong and what she needs to do

to ﬁx it. This instinct is by no means misguided: If your team member

screws something up, you have to deal with it. But remember that when

you do, you’re merely remediating—and that remediating not only

inhibits learning but also gets you no closer to excellent performance.

As we’ve seen, conjuring excellence from your team members requires

a diﬀerent focus from you. If you see somebody doing something that

really works, stopping her and dissecting it with her isn’t only a high-

priority interrupt, it is your highest-priority interrupt. As you replay

each small moment of excellence to your team member, you’ll ease her

into the “rest and digest” state of mind. Her understanding of what

excellence looks and feels like within her will become more vivid, her

brain will become more receptive to new information and will make

connections to other inputs found in other regions of her brain, and she

will learn and grow and get better.

Explore the present, past, and future. When people come to you asking

for feedback on their performance or what they might need to ﬁx to get

promoted, try this:

Start with the present. If a team member approaches you with a

problem, he’s dealing with it now. He’s feeling weak or challenged, and

you have to address that. But rather than tackling the problem head-on,

ask your colleague to tell you three things that are working for him right

now. These things might be related to the situation or entirely separate.

They might be signiﬁcant or trivial. Just ask the question, and you’re

to think about speciﬁc things that are going well will alter his brain

chemistry so that he can be open to new solutions and new ways of

# thinking or acting.

If you see somebody doing something that really works, stop her and dissect it.

Next, go to the past. Ask him, “When you had a problem like this in

the past, what did you do that worked?” Much of our life happens

in patterns, so it’s highly likely that he has encountered this problem

at least a few times before. On one of those occasions he will almost

certainly have found some way forward, some action or insight or

connection that enabled him to move out of the mess. Get him thinking

about that and seeing it in his mind’s eye: what he actually felt and did,

and what happened next.

Finally, turn to the future. Ask your team member, “What do you

already know you need to do? What do you already know works in this

situation?” By all means oﬀer up one or two of your own experiences to

see if they might clarify his own. But operate under the assumption that

he already knows the solution—you’re just helping him recognize it.

The emphasis here should not be on whys—“Why didn’t that work?”

“Why do you think you should do that?”—because those lead both of

you into a fuzzy world of conjecture and concepts. Instead, focus on

the whats—“What do you actually want to have happen?” “What are a

couple of actions you could take right now?” These sorts of questions

yield concrete answers, in which your colleague can ﬁnd his actual self

doing actual things in the near-term future.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Feedback Fallacy

. . .

How to give people feedback is one of the hottest topics in business

## today. The arguments for radical candor and unvarnished and pervasive

transparency have a swagger to them, almost as if to imply that only

the ﬁnest and bravest of us can face these truths with nerveless self-

assurance, that those of us who recoil at the thought of working in a

climate of continual judgment are condemned to mediocrity, and that

as leaders our ability to look our colleagues squarely in the eye and lay

out their faults without blinking is a measure of our integrity.

But at best, this fetish with feedback is good only for correcting

mistakes—in the rare cases where the right steps are known and can

be evaluated objectively. And at worst, it’s toxic, because what we want

## from our people—and from ourselves—is not, for the most part, tidy

adherence to a procedure agreed upon in advance or, for that matter,

the ability to expose one another’s ﬂaws. It’s that people contribute their

own unique and growing talents to a common good, when that good is

ever-evolving, when we are, for all the right reasons, making it up as we

go along. Feedback has nothing to oﬀer to that.

We humans do not do well when someone whose intentions are unclear

tells us where we stand, how good we “really” are, and what we must do

to ﬁx ourselves. We excel only when people who know us and care about

us tell us what they experience and what they feel, and in particular

when they see something within us that really works.
