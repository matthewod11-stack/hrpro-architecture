A few weeks into my ﬁrst maternity leave, a former colleague and

friend called to check in on me and my infant son, Jay. It had been a

rough birth physically and happened in Manhattan, in the aftermath

of Hurricane Sandy, which added to the stress. I welcomed her call,

thankful to hear her familiar voice.

“How are you doing?” she asked me gently, as we swapped new mom

stories and made plans to meet up soon. “Is everything okay job wise?

Are you still planning to return to work?”

“Oh yes,” I replied quickly, changing my son’s diaper as we spoke. “Why

# wouldn’t I?”

She was silent for a moment, then said, “A recruiter called me about

your job, and it’s also posted online, so I thought you weren’t coming

back. I’m sorry to be the one to have to tell you that.”

I don’t remember what I said next. I don’t remember how the call ended.

I do remember that my head was spinning. I ﬁnished feeding my son

and put him down for a nap.

Why would my job be posted online when I was going back? Why were

they looking to backﬁll me when I was on maternity leave? Why hadn’t

anyone told me?

I thought back to the period before I’d taken leave. When the doctor

advised me to stop traveling to customer meetings in my third trimester,

my bosses weren’t happy. When I stayed at the oﬃce until 11 pm to work

on urgent requests at seven months pregnant, no one ever suggested

that I order dinner. (I recall ﬁnding old airline crackers in my bag.)

When I wrapped up things a few days before my due date, management

assured me that I would come back to my role. But now I didn’t trust

them. I resigned towards the end of my maternity leave after ﬁnding

# another opportunity.

The lesson I drew from this was simple. Maternity leave is one thing. Support for new mothers is an entirely diﬀerent issue.

Asha Santos, a partner at Littler Mendelson P.C., who advises U.S.

companies on employment law and how to build respect in the

workplace, agrees: “How a woman is treated in the months leading up to

her maternity leave and then during leave and shortly thereafter when

she returns to work will determine whether or not a company will be

able to retain her,” she explains.

According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 60% of organizations oﬀered 12 weeks of maternity leave and 33% oﬀered longer leaves. Some organizations are also making policies more inclusive: Spotify, Etsy, Twitter and more oﬀer paid parental leave for

both birth and non-birth parents to step in and ﬁll the void in countries

like the U.S. where no mandated paid parental leave exists.

But paid time oﬀ is not enough. Organizations need to create a broader

ecosystem to support them. Here are ﬁve questions to focus on as we

look to retain, develop and promote new parents, especially mothers:

Who will take on her work?

I have been on maternity leave twice. I have also had a number of

bosses, team members, and peers take leave. When there’s no clear

plan for transitioning responsibilities or one that simply throws work

onto employees and colleagues, it creates a great deal of anxiety. A new

mom might feel like she is burdening her team, while her peers become

# resentful.

One solution is to create a pool of former employees who know your

organization well and could consult for a few months to cover the work,

or partner with an organization like The Second Shift, founded by Gina

Hadley and Jenny Galluzzo, which has created a marketplace to match

companies with female experts who can help on certain projects or to

cover leaves. This is how my second maternity leave was handled: My

boss hired a former employee as a consultant to cover my work for the

ﬁve months I was out.

If you can’t bring in a consultant and need current team members to

help, ensure they are compensated with a cash bonus or an increase in

base salary. If they don’t have bandwidth, consider tapping other people

in the organization to help and reward them.

How will you assess her performance?

I once received a poor performance review after I’d just come back from

maternity leave. I’d previously been told that I’d met my deliverables

and was leaving the team in strong shape, and the rationale for the new

rating was vague: “The business is now in decline.”

Don’t operate this way. Instead, sit down with people before they take

leave and give them detailed feedback on their performance year-to- date versus their goals. If necessary, explain how the leave will aﬀect

any merit or bonus pay. If a formal review would have taken place while

they’re out, promise another formal review when they return. Some

might want to have this conversation during their leave.

If you are forced to rank team members on a “bell curve,” evaluate those

on maternity leave based on their performance before it. If you ﬁnd that

new parents are falling to the lower end of the curve, your organization

needs to have an open and honest dialogue about the biases you’re

bringing to the table.

What are her career aspirations?

When I once raised my hand for a role that would require signiﬁcant

travel, a former boss said to me: “Your kids are too young. You don’t

want to be on the road and away from them that much.” I wasn’t given

the option to apply; the decision was made for me.

Don’t assume that new mothers want to be on the “mommy

track.” Instead, continue to ask about and understand her career

aspirations, checking in as you would with any employee on how they

want to grow in the organization. Come into those conversations with

an open mind and listen carefully.

If you hear that her ambitions are unchanged, ensure she is guaranteed

her same role when she returns and included in succession planning

for key roles. Give her clear guidance on what it takes to get that next

assignment or promotion and ask her if she would like to be contacted

## during her leave about upcoming opportunities or not.

What other policies do you have to support new mothers?

Companies need a robust suite of policies to make motherhood work for

new working mothers. According to the Society for Human Resource Management (SHRM), 81% of companies oﬀer new mothers ramping

back to work options after they return from leave.

While some women will want options to help them ramp back to full- time work, others will want to explore alternative options. Oﬀer a suite

of possibilities including ﬂexible working, part time, or job-sharing

# opportunities for all individuals.

Ensure that all your oﬃces have a mother’s room, where women can

pump comfortably and privately. Consider installing a hospital-grade

pump so she can bring just her pump parts instead of her machine in.

Design rooms to include comfortable seating, a fridge, a sink, and a

microwave. Allowing women who travel for work the beneﬁt of shipping

their breast milk home can be a game-changer.

Back-up child care is another key oﬀering, which many companies

have added during the pandemic. Finally, tech companies including Facebook, Google and Salesforce, have also started to oﬀer additional paid time oﬀ for caregivers.

How will you know if you are successful?

What gets measured gets done. How do you know if you are retaining

mothers? Track how many return from leave (and don’t assume it’s

because they don’t want to work anymore). Measure how long they stay

out after their ﬁrst child and any subsequent children. Patagonia is a

great example of a company that focuses on this data and has strong

retention. It supports working mothers with policies such as onsite child

care and an organizational culture that embraces rather than ignores

# employees’ families.

Ask your new working parents what more they want. Host roundtables

and listening tours to ensure you are meeting their needs. Crowdsource

ideas and co-create solutions to be a better place to work for employees

# with young children.

Senior leaders have to commit to creating an infrastructure that

supports new parents, and particularly mothers, beyond paid leave.

Once you do, these employees will feel that they can build a long-term

career — and their families — at your organization.
