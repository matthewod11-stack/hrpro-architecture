After participating in a good leadership development program, you’ll

no doubt feel inspired to transform yourself, your team, and your

organization. That’s why companies spend more than $46 billion

per year on such training. They want their employees, from high

potentials to top executives, to gain energy and purpose by learning and

envisioning the future with others.

However, many program participants ﬁnd it challenging to sustain

momentum and achieve durable post-program results. As an executive

who recently graduated from one of ours told us: “I left incredibly

motivated. I had a clear plan for how I needed to lead and restructure

my area. Three weeks later, I was extremely frustrated. It felt like

nothing had changed.”

Most often, leaders are making progress — just not at the speed they had

hoped. Success requires determined eﬀort combined with care about

pacing and adjustment. Here are some practical strategies to help you

navigate the crucial post-program “reentry” phase and maximize the

# impact of your experience.

# Anticipate reactions.

When you return from your program, colleagues will be curious about

it. When they ask you how it went, don’t overwhelm them with too

much information or gloss over your answer. Instead, have ready a

few 60-second elevator pitches – each highlighting a key takeaway, its

strategic implications, why it’s important to you, and how it will shape

# your thinking in the future.

You will likely need diﬀerent pitches for diﬀerent stakeholders. For

example, your pitch to your direct reports might be about what you

learned about empowering the team. At the same time, the one to your

boss might be targeted to executing the strategy or achieving business

results. A well-crafted reentry pitch will engage the heads and the

## hearts of listeners and signal potential changes.

Recognize others’ contributions.

Take the time to recognize the people who made it possible for you to

attend the program. Tell reports how much you appreciate their hard

work ensuring operations ran well when you were away.

Also, explore what they learned and how they developed during your

absence and any impact it’s had on their future goals and aspirations.

Any post-program change agenda will require the support of your team,

and this is an opportunity to both create goodwill and explore how you

might free up time by shifting responsibilities.

Make sure to thank your boss, peers, and others, too, emphasizing

how they might beneﬁt from your new insights and ideas. By

demonstrating your gratitude and connecting your experience to group

and organizational success, you reinforce your commitment to others.

# Embrace the opportunity.

Leaders often worry that their newly acquired behaviors or visions

will be met with skepticism and jokes about just returning from a

course. “Who kidnapped the real you and substituted this alien?” is a

common refrain. But don’t let this fear hold you back. You will be more

disappointed in the long run if you fail to make any changes or if others

fail to recognize your growth.

Remember that this is an opportunity. Acknowledge that while you are

committed to continuous, long-term personal and team development,

the course was indeed a catalyst for new thinking. Emphasize that you

are dedicated to working with others to drive meaningful change.

Communicate your intentions.

To gain support for your change ideas, it’s essential to be candid about

your intentions and the challenges you anticipate. The idea isn’t just to

inform them and eliminate any preconceived notions they might have;

it’s also to involve them in speciﬁc areas of transformation.

Be mindful that you have been thinking about this evolution for longer

than they have, though, and allow them time to process, reﬂect, and

adapt. Ultimately, the goal is to create a shared understanding and

facilitate a smoother transition.

# Pace yourself.

You may return to your professional life inspired and impatient to ﬁx

things right away. But pace and prioritization are paramount.

Of course, if the program has prompted you to realize that you have

been procrastinating on a critical change and have the authority to

make it, do so immediately. Be courageous, communicate clearly, and

take action.

However, most changes will beneﬁt from a more gradual approach.

Introduce new ideas incrementally, respecting others’ adaptation

process. Small, consistent individual and team shifts are better accepted

and less disruptive. Allow time for practice and reﬁnement to solidify

# changes.

Build a support network.

You’ll want a support network both inside and outside your team.

Stay in touch with people you met in your development program to

share advice and hold one another accountable. You might consider

creating a group on platforms like WhatsApp or establishing a buddy

system whereby partners check in every four to six weeks. Within your

organization, identify individuals in the best position to discuss and

advise on your intended changes and enlist them to provide regular

feedback and help you work through challenges.

Stay the course.

The only way to achieve change is through consistent eﬀort. Accept

that your initial work is unlikely to yield immediate results, that there

might be resistance and setbacks, and stay patient. Communicate often

and clearly, balancing understanding with determination. Recognize

that small steps add up to signiﬁcant ones, and stick with it. With

work, your development program experience can lead to long-lasting

## personal, team, or organizational change.
