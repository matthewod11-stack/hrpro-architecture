# Immigration and Nationality Act of 1952, (INA) (http://www.uscis.gov/portal/site/uscis/menuitem.f6da51a2342135be7e9d7a10e0dc91a0/?

# vgnextoid=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&vgnextchannel=fa7e539dc4bed010VgnVCM1000000ecd190aRCRD&CH=act)

as amended

The INA includes provisions addressing employment eligibility, employment veriﬁcation, and nondiscrimination. These provisions

apply to all employers.

# Under the INA, employers may hire only persons who may legally work in the United States (i.e., citizens and nationals of the U.S.)

# and aliens authorized to work in the U.S. The employer must verify the identity and employment eligibility of anyone to be hired,

which includes completing the Employment Eligibility Veriﬁcation Form (I-9)(http://www.uscis.gov/I-9Central). Employers must keep each I-9 on ﬁle for at least three years, or one year after employment ends, whichever is longer.

The INA protects U.S. citizens and aliens authorized to accept employment in the U.S. from discrimination in hiring or discharge

## on the basis of national origin and citizenship status.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Notices and poster requirements vary by the classiﬁcation of alien or foreign worker being hired. Please see the speciﬁc INA chapters to determine the notices and poster requirements for each immigration category.

Recordkeeping requirements vary by the classiﬁcation of alien or foreign worker being hired. Please see the speciﬁc INA chapters

to determine the recordkeeping requirements for each immigration category.

# Reporting

Reporting requirements vary by the classiﬁcation of alien or foreign worker being hired. Please see the speciﬁc INA chapters to

determine the reporting requirements for each immigration category.

Employers who fail to comply with the employment obligations of a speciﬁc visa classiﬁcation enforced by the Wage and Hour

Division may face penalties speciﬁc to that visa program.

Additionally, employers who fail to complete and/or retain the I-9 forms are subject to penalties. The Department of Homeland

Security (DHS) enforces the INA requirements on veriﬁcation of employment eligibility. The Department of Justice's (DOJ) Oﬃce of Special Counsel for Immigration Related Unfair Employment Practices enforces the INA's anti-discrimination provisions.
