At ﬁrst glance, workplace friendships can seem trivial — a nice

to have that’s distinct from traditional organizational objectives like

## productivity, eﬃciency, and proﬁtability.

Nothing could be further from the truth. A wealth of studies reveal

that by fueling our basic human psychological need for belonging,

meaningful workplace connections drive many of the outcomes central

# to high-performing teams.

For starters, employees with close connections at work are more

productive, creative, and collaborative. They also report being more

satisﬁed with their job, are less susceptible to burnout, and are less

likely to leave their organization to pursue another role. In other words,

not only are they better contributors, they provide more stability to a

# team.

In contrast, when employees feel disconnected from their team or

lonely at work, their performance craters. Their ability to focus

deteriorates and their willingness to collaborate plummets. Worse, they

devote valuable cognitive resources attempting to hide their loneliness

from others, leaving less mental ﬁrepower for completing projects. In

short, they become less capable of doing their jobs.

Now, it’s one thing to logically appreciate the value of close

connections, and another to know what to do about it. After all, what

can a single leader possibly do to get coworkers to bond?

The short answer is plenty.

Research suggests that workplace friendships don’t just happen by

chance. They blossom under certain conditions, many of which leaders

can strategically engineer, even in a remote or hybrid environment.

Here are three evidence-based strategies that leaders can use to leverage

## insights from the science of close connections.

- 1. Use commonalities to spark friendships.

Studies indicate that one of the strongest drivers of friendships is

similarity. The more workers have in common with one another,

whether it’s a favorite TV show, weekend hobby, or even the same

birthday, the more likely they are to click. In a fascinating study of best

friends who remained close for nearly 20 years, researchers found that

the strongest predictor of long-term bonding is the level of similarity

when friends ﬁrst meet.

Managers can leverage this insight by making it easier for employees to identify commonalities. Onboarding oﬀers the perfect opportunity.

Instead of simply introducing new hires by their professional

experience, consider interviewing them to uncover a few colorful details

about their personal interests, and sprinkle these details into your

# welcome message.

Introducing new team members by their personal interests immediately

humanizes them and empowers existing team members to ﬁnd

commonalities over which they can bond. Moreover, inquiring about

personal interests demonstrates to new hires that you care about them and value their individuality. It’s also a diﬀerentiator. In a world where

88% of employees believe their company’s onboarding process can

improve, designing an introduction that sets the stage for friendship not only sets an organization apart, it paves the way for more eﬀective

# collaboration.

- 2. Highlight shared goals.

It’s easy to assume that employees reporting to the same manager will

naturally view themselves as a team. Yet that’s not always the case. A

crucial aspect of leading teams is therefore ensuring that employees

view their colleagues not just as coworkers, but as teammates. The

question is, how?

Social psychologists have long appreciated that shared goals, or the

experience of working together toward a common objective, supports

the development of friendships. And indeed, studies show that workers

who view their colleagues as essential to their success build closer

friendships, have fewer disagreements, and view their work as more

# meaningful.

The challenge in many organizations is that shared goals are often

surprisingly diﬃcult to identify, especially when members of the same team are working on diﬀerent projects. It’s when we don’t feel like

our objectives align with those of our colleagues that we witness the

## emergence of cliques, silos, and conﬂicts.

And yet shared goals can still oﬀer leaders a valuable opportunity for

building a team mentality, even when collaboration is limited. For

example, managers can draw attention to the ways projects require a team eﬀort. Doing so can be as simple as highlighting an important

collaboration, or publicly thanking an individual whose contributions

are vital to a team’s success but are easy to overlook.

Another option is to emphasize team-wide goals (such as objectives

and key results, or OKRs) that can only be achieved through working

together. Depending on the department, team OKRs may include

increasing referrals, improving organic traﬃc, or optimizing employee

# engagement scores.

Shared goals can also foster team-building outside the oﬃce, during

recreational activities. A well-designed social activity can do more than

deliver a fun experience, it can present the conditions that empower

colleagues to work shoulder-to-shoulder toward a common objective. In

other words, skip the oﬃce happy hour and invest in a collaborative

cooking class.

- 3. Turn tension into connection.

Research indicates that workplace disagreements often erupt when

people experience an absence of relatedness — when they feel

undervalued, unappreciated, or perceive a lack of respect. The less connected people feel, the more likely they are to interpret a diﬀerence

# of opinion as a personal slight.

But disagreements can oﬀer a lot of value if you navigate them correctly.

Far from signaling oﬃce dysfunction, workplace disagreements can

## yield more creative solutions, better decision-making, and higher

# performance.

The best leaders do more than defuse conﬂict — they use relationship-

building statements to turn tense moments into opportunities for

deeper connections. These can take the form of recommitting to

the partnership (“I bet we can ﬁgure this out”), acknowledging your

partner’s contributions (“You clearly put a lot of work into this”),

or valuing their expertise (“I’ve always appreciated your insight into

clients like this.”). The trick is to quickly reassure your colleague

that your disagreement has nothing to do with your relationship, and

everything to do with ﬁnding the best solution.

Used correctly, relationship-building statements can do much more

than put out relationship ﬁres. They are a vital conversational tool

for fostering collaboration, expressing appreciation, and ensuring that

contributors feel valued.

For too long, workplace friendships have been left to chance. Yet

the research is clear: feeling connected to our colleagues elevates

productivity, reduces turnover, and fosters better teamwork. As such,

Fortunately, research indicates that leaders can do a great deal when

it comes to nurturing employee friendships. By utilizing insights from

the science of close connections to promote bonding, teaming, and
