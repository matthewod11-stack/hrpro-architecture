# Abstract

Employees’ productivity has been extensively addressed by psychologists for a long time. With the emergence of positive psychology (PS), positive psychologists started to fill the literature gap which addresses the influence of individual’s positive traits on employees’ performance and organizational productivity and how it could be improve it by identifying these traits and build sitive individuals’ traits organizational policies based on them. Unlike traditional psychology, PS focuses on the employees’ po such positive traits, - rather than on curing the negative psychological aspects of the individual. This research identifies three Optimism, Well-Being and Personal Strength and analyses their impacts on employees’ productivity, hence or ganizational licy productivity. The research explicitly investigates these three positive traits, their identification and the development of a po based on these aiming at positive effects on increasing the employees’ performance, hence their productivity. The research proposes a “process” and a “framework” which reflect the relationships between Positive Psychology traits, employees’ performance and Organizational Productivity. Hypotheses were drawn from the framework and a questionnaire was prepared to collect data to verify the validity of the relationships proposed on the framework. The questionnaire was administered on employee in a selected organization. Each hypothesis was tested, and the results were analyzed using statistical approaches. The results demonstrated quite interesting findings which demonstrated that, implementing positive psychology concepts and individual p ositive traits such as optimism, well-being and personal strength at the workplace increase employees’ performance hence organizational productivity, and this was verified by the acceptance of all the hypotheses following the data analysis.

- 1. Introduction

Mental processes such as thoughts, memories, dreams and perceptions are hard to be defined, seen or felt because what is in the individual’ mind is highly complex and enigmatic. Many wonders how psychologists can study such an intricate, seemingly abstract and extremely sophisticated science. Even if scientists look inside autopsy or during a surgical operation, all they see is grey matter (the brain). Contemplations, comprehension, feelings, recollections, dreams, recognitions, and so forth can't be seen physically, similar to a skin rash or heart deformity.

Currently, mental anxiety and stress are the most common problems affecting the state and behavior of individuals. It is believed that these states and behaviors affect the individual’s performance and productivity. In traditional psychology, the a recognizing the emotional well-being of individuals, patients, such as depression and tackling the state with conventional methods and drugs. This is fundamentally essential for those facing psychological illness, it g ives a deficient picture of emotional well-being. Positive psychology is a generally new branch of psychology that shifts the concentration from what is clinically wrong, to the advancement of prosperity and the making o f a satisfying life loaded with significance, happiness, delight, engagement, positive relationship and achievement.

and theorizing [1].

Positive Psychology is a current branch of psychology which stresses ordinary, successful advancement instead of the treatment of psychological sickness. The field promises to strengthen traditional psychology rather than replacing it as PS fundamentally focuses on what is “good” in the individual, positive traits, and strengthen them.

Martin Seligman is considered the father of Positive Psychology, although the term is coined to Abraham Maslow, 1951, and he concentrated on the individuals’ happiness, prosperity, well-being and how the individual’s mental state could be improved by focusing on these traits. Seligman successfully amalgamated thoughts an researchers, philosophers and scientists and related them to the consciousness. The concept of practical importance of positive psychology has been originated in late 90s in its cotemporary form. This took place when Martin Seligman as the president of American Psychological Association invigorated the necessity of i ncluding a strength-based approach to the field of Psychology [2].

- 3. Positive psychology at the workplace

The 21st Century workplace heavily depends on advancement on technology, hence putting pressure on both th e employees and the organization in terms of performance and productivity. In such an environment, organizations are working hard to find ways to improve employees’ performance and productivity. The paper proposes that both could be increased by building work policies which incorporate individuals’ positive traits.

To accommodate for the fast-paced technological advances, organizations are expecte

d to depend more on

employees’ creativity and expertise. This is integral for the overall organizational productivity. Individually, the identification of employees’ knowledge, expertise, well-being and happiness become part of the o rganizational aim and develop processes which insure cross-talk and adaptability, undertaking plans that take benefit of human capital,

which influence the organization's structure, human capital needs and so forth [3]. Components that attempt to enhance physic al health, knowledge, achievement and motivation among group members are to be suggested based on the assumption that a relaxed member engages more positively [4].

Hence, this requires key choices that shape the objectives and mission of the organization,

The paper addresses the increase of employees’ performance from a positive psychology perspective. Three positive traits are identified and used as the ba sis for developing a framework which demonstrates the relationships between them and employees’ performance/productivity and hence o rganizational productivity. The paper proposes that these traits are the roots for ensuring an environment which is stress free, friendly and motivating for the employees.

nt and rstand the relation between implementation of effective organizational strategies. POS provides an insight to unde organizational strategies and its employees’, its impact on human behaviour on workplace and subsequently provides a vision to analyse why some strategies are more productive than the rest [5]. The role of positive psycholo gy in improving positive organizational behaviour is undebatable and has gained more popularity in recent years [6]. Many companies/organizations develop their strategies and policies to identify employ ees’ positive traits or attributes (e.g. trustworthiness, loyalty, resilience) to achieve their business goals and maintain sustainability [7]. Since positive psychology focuses on human strengths, such as, positive traits and personal strength for organizational prosperity, it is believed to create positive impact to develop organized system that values potential in their employees [8].

The theories and ideas of positive organizational scholarship (POS) are used in the developme

While organizational behaviour focuses more on issues related to uncertainty management, disorganization theory and chaos theory; POB put forward the concept positive traits of employees and their interdependency which contributes equally in to the development of good work environment [10].

# of positive aspect of work;

Based on the fact that POB applies in the organizational setting with a positive outcome and succeeded in realizing the positive employees’ traits to maximum for a better organizational career, we posit that the employ ees’ security compliance behaviour can be improved through positive organizational behaviour. If the orga nization embraces its employees’ positive traits and strengths and develops organizational culture and se curity compliance policies’ based on these traits, better security compliance can be achieved [10].

For instance, it is not a matter of motivating employees to do their work, yet rather how to inspire them to do better work, or their best work. Today, organizations expect employees to be creative, cooperative a nd contribute to the knowledge sharing and at the same time do their routine work while only 14% of employees global ly exhibit highly engagement. Approximately, about a quarter are vigorously disengaged, and 62% are only moderately engaged. Then the questions arise like by what method can such groups build up an innovative cooperative energy that will benefit from the numerous visions available, in what capacity would businesses be able to and bunches b enefit from their diversity and so far as that is concerned, what would organizations be able to do to ensure that the correct individuals tion of diversity, they get on board and remain with the organization.

What these inquiries h common is that they are trying to go beyond fixing complications and into encouraging excellence and quality. It is basically a direct result of this point of view that the business world needs to swing to the branch of psychology named as Positive Psychology that deals with human prosperity and human abilities [11, 12].

- 5. Optimism in the workplace

Optimism is an important psychological trait that plays an important role in the life of individuals. Optimism helps an individual in terms of his/her power to influence actions whereas the pessimism makes a per son feels helpless. According to Scheier and Carver [13], optimism is a set of over-all positive result outlooks. In their inven tion of the concept of optimism they stated that people who usually expect that anything in the life will go according to its way and be certain of the fact that it will always have more good outcomes than ba Accordingly, optimism is considered as one of the pillars of positive psychology. Optimism at the organizational level has its origin in the administrative realism. Hawthorne studies were part of a refocus on managerial strategy incorporating the socio-psychological aspects of human behavior in organizations which deals with how variations in the workplace environment might increase productivity. These experiments ultimately resulted attention to workers and their requirements, organizational management would expect increase in the e mployees’ performance.

that by paying

People with positive informative style are better ready to deal with the vulnerability of change. Accordingly, these people show more controlled observations and execute more dynamic coping strategies at their work, and th at employees with positive perspective reinterpret the negative occasion as an opportunity for growth and development. As a result, an employee with positive perspective can deal with the problems in a successful ma nner which in turns keep him/her free from stress and anxiety thus his/her performance increases. These findings strengthen the fact that encouragement and recognition by management and acknowledging their work positively influence their performance.

- 6. Well-being and employees in the workplace

In the implementation of positive psychology, employees’ well-being is a significant fac tor to be considered by organizations. The workplace environment plays an integral role on the employees’ ov erall well-being, hence their k [14]. The performance and productivity. Fifth of the people exercise better life if they are satisfied at their wor properties of work such routes, management, and intricacy, are used to measure and control the individual’s depression [15]. Employees’ well-being is likewise to the greatest advantage of businesses that s pend considerable resources to hire the employees and make efforts to produce their products, get benefits, and sustain their reliable clients. To prevail with this regard to hire employees, managers must give tangible advantages. Though, employees need mo re than a forthcoming generations of fixed employment with pensions and various other benefits. Researches of later and employees undoubtedly reveal a larger part of employees want more prominent significance and self-awareness from their work and recommend numerous other workers to see their work comprises of enjoyable, satisfying, and socially helpful [16]. While the type of work affects the damage risks in a working environment, a limited characteristic basic to all working environments influence the work environment wellbeing risks to employees. Universal proced ures of well-being are useful when researchers are interested in the employees’ level of affecting well-being in general.

Work environments strengthen employee wellbeing and prosperity from various perspectives, including by giving get medical care,

sick leaves and graduated come back to-work programs. Paid sick leave enables employees to recover faster, and keep the work environment free from communicable serious health issues and preventing the spread of illness and disease in the work environment. While paid sick leave gives surety to workers, it likewise adds to expanded efficiency by enabling unwell employees to recover even more adequately and come back to full profitability more quickly. Graduated return-to work programs help to prevent employees from the effect of long-term illness and determine the value of the employee to the workplace.

Well-being in the workplace is, overall, a purpose of serving employees to do what they feel is right by giving them a freedom to do so with the help of actions that effect workers’ engagement and therefore that rise the rate of positive emotions.

- 7. Research framework

The main aim of this research is to identify employees’ positive traits and develop a process where these traits will help to improve their performance and consequently the organisational productivity. After identifying positive traits, the focus is to develop a policy based on these traits in order to achieve better employee’s satisfaction, which in turn, affect the employee performance positively. As a result, overall performance of the organisation can get improved. In this research, it gets clear how the innovative evolving field of Positive Psychology helps to manage workplace environment effectively and to increase productivity in the organization.

Considering the objectives and the aim that has been established for the conduction of the research, there are some of the questions regarding it. This is a portion of some real issues that are considered; by leading this exploration and this research provide detailed discussion on such issues.

Based on the framework (Fig. 1) a set of hypotheses were developed in order to find out the validi

A framework was introduced which incorporated the three positive traits and showed their relationships to the employees’ performance, organizational po licies and organizational productivity. The paper proposed that organizations are to develop strat egies which identify its employees’ positive traits and build their policies accordingly. These traits are integral for the employees’ well-being and if nurtured by the organization will eventually makes employees more eager to engage and increase their performance. This paper lay down a comprehensive investigation of the concept of Positive Psychology and the role of positive traits to Optimism, Well-Being and Personal Strength. Based on the framework, questionnaires were developed to find out whether the relationships on the framework are valid hypotheses test the hypotheses using analytical methods. The survey was conducted on employees in a selected organization and results of the survey were analyzed following a statistical approach that has followed to accommodate for the outcome of each of the hypothesis. The primary results demonstrated that building Organizational Policies based on Positive Psychology conce pts increases the employees’ performance, hence their overall productivity. The results also demonstrated that Individual yees with better Positive Traits such as Optimism, Well-Being and Personal Strength leads to more focused emplo performance and Organizational Productivity.

As a result, implementing Positive Psychology in Organizational policies focusing on the positive traits (Optimism, Well-being and Person al Strength) would result in happier, more focused, and satisfied employees.

We concluded that implementing positive psychology concepts and individual positive tra
