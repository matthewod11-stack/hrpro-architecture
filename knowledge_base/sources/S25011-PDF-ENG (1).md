When Mars Wrigley decided to digitize its supply chain, it invested

in several AI and analytics capabilities. It built a digital twin of its

production line (a virtual replica simulating its operations in real time)

and fed data from it into a machine-learning model to predict the line’s

output and reduce overﬁlling and waste. It worked with a “decision

intelligence” vendor, Aera Technology, to create visualizations of the

## data, generate recommendations about preventive maintenance, and

automate some operational decisions. It hired Kinaxis, a vendor whose

AI software gave the staﬀ suggestions on how to balance supply and

demand, automate invoice processing, and increase truck utilization by

15%. As a result of all these improvements, the company was able to ﬁll

orders more quickly, and customer service ratings rose by a couple of

# percentage points.

More recently, Mars Wrigley began building machine-learning models

that forecast sales, which will help factory managers set production

levels. On the manufacturing line it plans to deploy smart robots and new AI systems to improve eﬃciency and sustainability. In sum, Mars

Wrigley has been using AI to reimagine process management in a wide

# range of operations.

Process management isn’t a complicated concept. Its goal is to

understand how a sequence of tasks ﬁt together to create a speciﬁed

outcome and then to make improvements. It can be applied at multiple

levels—to work performed by individuals or by a small group, key

activities within a department, or end-to-end processes that cross the

## entire organization and even company boundaries.

Done correctly, process management is extremely eﬀective. Better-

managed processes mean higher productivity: Error rates, cycle times, and low-value work are all reduced. But it can be diﬃcult to implement

## on a large scale—even with a boost from artiﬁcial intelligence.

AI supports narrow tasks or subprocesses, rather than end-to-end

processes, so organizations must string together multiple AI use cases

to improve an entire process. Process management requires massive

amounts of change management—persuading stakeholders, retraining

workers, and integrating many moving parts. Moreover, it’s often at

odds with traditional hierarchical management because it cuts across departments to boost eﬃciency. And its reputation took a hit when

process reengineering became a fad that left too many failed projects

and mindless layoﬀs in its wake in the early 1990s. No wonder it fell out

# of favor.

At the same time, AI and other information technologies have also

disappointed companies when it comes to generating productivity

gains. Robert Solow’s 1987 comment that “you can see the computer

age everywhere but in the productivity statistics” is sadly still relevant.

Organizations have invested trillions of dollars in data and the

technology to analyze and enhance productivity but have little to

show for it. Most organizations don’t even have ROI ﬁgures beyond

# productivity metrics for IT projects.

A new approach to process thinking can help reverse this situation.

Indeed, new ideas about processes—including scientiﬁc management,

statistical quality control, total quality management, Six Sigma, agile,

and lean methodologies—have a rich history of impact. The fact that

new thinking about process management keeps emerging is testimony

to its importance. There’s a constant need in organizations to improve

operational performance, and managing processes is a reliable way to

do so.

We, the authors of this article, are proponents of all forms of

process management. One of us, Tom Davenport, helped launch the

process-reengineering movement in the early 1990s. The other, Tom

Redman, has applied process thinking extensively in his data advisory

services. After extensive conversations with hundreds of leaders, we’ve

arrived at a new philosophy about process that captures how people,

data, analytics, and technology—especially AI—can come together to

# strengthen business performance.

In this article we’ll describe that new philosophy and detail the ﬁrst

steps senior leaders should take to apply it.

## How Technology and Process Management Enhance Each Other

## A lack of technology support—particularly in incremental process

## improvement approaches like lean and Six Sigma—contributed to the

decline in the popularity of process thinking. But over the past several

years new technologies have created opportunities for organizations to

transform process management. This is a key reason that we argue that

companies should now return to employing it broadly.

Process management and technology are mutually reinforcing. New

technologies help companies signiﬁcantly scale up improved processes,

and it’s much easier to deploy and get value from a new AI algorithm

when the process it supports is well-deﬁned and well-managed. End-

to-end integrated processes also make it easier to obtain the huge

quantities of high-quality data needed to train AI.

Good process management requires departments to adopt common

## data standards and share data freely across an organization, although

many departments may be reluctant to do so. After all, they’ve

implemented systems tailored for their speciﬁc needs, not necessarily

for end-to-end eﬀectiveness. When departments don’t coordinate their

data, however, it often leads to problems.

Consider an operations department whose job is to assemble the

various components of orders. Its employees receive orders from the

sales department but quickly ﬁnd lots of holes and errors. So they do

their best to clean up the data—after all, they have key performance

indicators to meet. One can’t fault sales, which has no idea that the

data it provides is bad. Still, the people in operations have to spend a

lot of time on a task for which they’ve received no training or support,

often under enormous pressure. The obvious solution is to make fewer

errors in sales, but operations people, trapped in their silo, don’t see the

# opportunity.

Process management helps bust or at least bridge such silos. It shines a harsh light on errors and the ineﬃciencies they cause, motivates

improvement, and provides the structure needed to systematically

eliminate the causes of mistakes.

# Where to Begin

Organizations without a strong process orientation may have diﬃculty

getting started. In that case it may be best to focus initially on one

or two processes that are critical to performance and address the rest

as the organization becomes more used to process thinking. Many

companies we know start with order-to-cash (OTC) processes—which

encompass all the steps from when a customer places an order to when

payment is received. They have a crucial impact on performance at

most companies and are a popular target for reengineering.

European companies have managed OTC and other cross-functional

processes for years. Siemens, despite having highly decentralized

business units, has created common OTC subprocesses in areas like

order management and purchase-to-pay. BMW has standardized most

of its global production processes, which used to vary greatly around

the world, and has now focused on optimizing support processes.

The consumer products company Reckitt is streamlining the entire

OTC process by using process mining and process automation to

improve invoicing, the purchasing of supplies, order fulﬁllment, and

more. These companies have made IT-enabled process management an

# essential aspect of their operations.

In North America, in contrast, companies generally have taken a much

more incremental approach. Uber focused ﬁrst on customer service,

## PepsiCo on accounts receivable and payable processes, Cardinal Health

## on order management, and Johnson & Johnson on its supply chain. All

have made signiﬁcant improvements with this narrower focus. As we

mentioned earlier, this is a good way for organizations that don’t have a

strong history of process management to get started.

Now we’ll use OTC to explain how AI can ﬁt into process management,

walking readers through how to apply it—including how to address the diﬃculties they will inevitably encounter.

Step 1: Establish ownership. The ﬁrst goal is to bring together a team

of managers willing and able to take end-to-end responsibility for the

performance of the process. That means naming a “process owner”

to coordinate the work required and recruiting a team of “process

managers” from the departments involved. For OTC processes, the team

will include people from sales, operations, shipping, and ﬁnance, and

other areas may contribute as well. These employees must be able to

## speak for their departments and advocate for the interests of the entire

# organization.

Naming the right process owner is important. That can be tricky

because it’s an entirely new senior management role in most cases.

The best owners will know how to exercise inﬂuence without formal

authority; at the beginning of the process journey they may not have

# much of the latter.

And there’s another challenge that makes process management diﬃcult: Because it tends to be aligned with the priorities of customers

while day-in, day-out line management tends to be aligned with

the priorities of the boss, conﬂicts are sure to arise. Employees will

inevitably need guidance on how to answer the question “When time

is short, who’s more important, my boss or the process owner?”

Salespeople, for instance, encouraged by their managers to enter orders

for which the buyer demands delivery in 10 days so that they can meet

their sales quotas, will be in a tough spot when the process owner

advises that inventory is low and a more realistic delivery date is 20

# days.

Step 2: Identify process customers. At the beginning of an initiative,

process managers should always ask, “Who are the customers? What

do they want, and what do they need most? How do we deliver

it?” Any gaps or uncertainties in the answers signal opportunities to

fundamentally rethink the process.

The people who ultimately get value from the process may be internal or

external. With OTC, it’s easy to identify the primary customers: People

who buy the products or services, who need to receive them in top-

quality form, on time, and where expected; and the company, which

needs to manage cash.

There may also be secondary customers. Marketing, for instance, may

be one of the OTC process if it wants to position the company’s on-time

## delivery performance as a competitive advantage. Another customer

could be a sustainability group that wants to reduce the company’s

carbon footprint. Herein lies one of the beauties of process management

—it forces managers to determine priorities and then to align work with

# them.

Technology can help companies capture and analyze customer data

and the customers’ views on the current performance of processes.

Customer relationship management systems can provide insights

## into customer attrition, numbers of service requests, and customer

proﬁtability. Generative AI systems can analyze and summarize

customers’ comments in inbound service calls, emails, and social media

posts—and are getting better at it all the time.

Step 3: Map out the existing process. Next you need to develop a high-

level ﬂowchart depicting the current process, including the physical

movement of goods and the creation, ﬂow, and use of data. This work

used to be done manually with Post-it notes representing tasks on

whiteboards, but today AI can automate it.

We ﬁnd that descriptions of the interfaces between departments are

especially useful, particularly early on. Often these interfaces lie in

a “white space”: They’re not clearly the responsibility of any one

department and, as such, are likely sources of delays, errors, and ineﬃciency.

Process mining, which extracts process data from IT systems for

modeling, analysis, and business optimization, can be enormously

helpful during this step too. This technology, which wasn’t available

during earlier waves of process management, uses information gathered

from enterprise-system log ﬁles to see how an organization’s processes

are performing. With OTC, for instance, companies can ﬁnd out almost

in real time what computer-mediated tasks are underway and how long

it’s taking to ﬁll an order, deliver a package, and get paid by a customer.

Process mining can highlight the pain points a redesign should focus

on. Once those have been uncovered, the team can try “task mining,”

which is oﬀered by some technology vendors and typically focuses on

improving smaller processes through automation.

New technologies help scale up improved processes, and it’s much easier to deploy and get value from AI when the process it supports is well-defined and well- managed.

PepsiCo started its process-mining eﬀorts with the accounts payable

process in 2019. Since then the company has shaved thousands of hours

of human labor oﬀ that process each year and reduced write-oﬀs by

millions of dollars. Now the company is using process mining (from the

vendor Celonis) across nine more processes, including broad end-to-end

ones like OTC. Some activities, including the creation of messages to

customers on overdue receivables, have been automated within these

processes. AI was used to identify the biggest problems to address, such

as an initial 30% order-rejection rate when PepsiCo installed a new SAP

system. Thanks to process mining with AI, the rejection rate dropped to

4%.

## Step 4: Establish process-performance measures and targets. The

next step is to deﬁne and put in place the metrics you need to

manage the revised process. For OTC, end-to-end cycle times (how

long it takes from the placement of an order to the receipt of payment), customer satisfaction, data accuracy, and process eﬃciency

are especially important. Companies should also determine what

level of improvement to the existing process is needed. During the

reengineering movement, 10-fold improvements were often sought,

but with the lean and Six Sigma methodologies, goals became much

more incremental. Instead of setting arbitrarily large or small goals,

companies should base targets on what is needed and what seems

# possible.

## Analysis of the performance metrics for the current process may also

provide insights that can help drive the design of the new process and

the use of technologies to enable it. One telecom ﬁrm, for example,

determined that it took about 90 days to deliver a particular type of

service. Digging deeper, it found that the actual work time was about 10

days, with the remaining 80 days spent waiting between steps. Sorting

out how to better coordinate the work helped the ﬁrm eliminate 60 of

those days, which made customers happier and got cash in the door

# much faster.

Step 5: Consider process enablers. Robotic process-automation tools,

which are sold by Microsoft, UiPath, and other vendors and use bots

to automate repetitive and routine workﬂows, are likely to be helpful

## with the design of small processes; both generative AI and traditional

machine learning can enhance the performance of larger ones. With

OTC, for instance, generative AI can draft contracts, help customers

make more-accurate orders, and alert them about delivery changes.

Traditional machine learning can help companies optimize pricing, speed up credit approvals, prevent fraud, and estimate needed staﬃng

# levels.

Other new technologies may also be relevant. Internet-of-things sensors

may be used to monitor manufacturing equipment and prevent failures,

and blockchain can be used to track the movement of goods along a

supply chain. Traditional business analytics can also improve decision-

making throughout processes.

Step 6: Redesign the process. The redesign should be led by a cross-

functional team made up of people from the departments involved in

the process in question. The goal is not just to map out a better workﬂow

but also to identify the skills, technologies, and organizational structure

changes needed and the expectations of partners and customers.

While designing processes was once a highly labor-intensive activity, today AI has made that work much faster and more eﬃcient. One

long-term vendor of process-management software, Pega, for instance,

has created tools that use generative AI to draw best-practice process

designs from a library and suggest them to design teams.

## One of its customers, Deutsche Telekom—the largest

telecommunications company in Germany—used a new tool from Pega

called Blueprint to rebuild its HR processes and the systems that

support them. Over the years Deutsche Telekom had established some

## 800 HR processes across more than 20 countries, and their complexity

was daunting. It had initially addressed many HR subprocesses using

traditional design and systems-development tools, but progress had

been slow. Misunderstandings between people on the business side

and in IT were causing delays, but Blueprint helped eliminate them

with a simple communication interface that allows business experts to

describe processes in their own words. Blueprint also made suggestions

about things that the redesign team might have overlooked and created

process templates, greatly reducing the time it took to ﬁnd solutions

and improve workﬂow systems.

With the help of Blueprint, the company has already streamlined 250

processes, and plans are in place to tackle the remainder. Employee

satisfaction has increased and HR personnel have been freed from

repetitive tasks, giving them more time to provide the staﬀ better

service. The business has also saved many millions of euros in

application operation and management costs. The combination of

generative AI and business expertise is transforming how process

design is being done at Deutsche Telekom, and we believe it will do

# so at many other organizations.

Other tools that we have high expectations for are generative-AI-based

image-creation capabilities and generative design tools (which are

currently used by architects) and digital twins. We predict that they will

help teams imagine new process designs, simulate them, and in time

# optimize process design and ﬂow.

Step 7: Implement and monitor the process. As we mentioned earlier,

rolling out new process designs requires considerable eﬀort. Though

software and AI-based tools can be used to automate key tasks within

the new process, employees will need training, data will need to be

integrated, systems will need to be built, and customers will need to

be briefed. Implementation may take months—but it should not take

# years.

After an improved process has been put in place, companies must

establish a new normal in which control and continuous improvement

prevail. The essence of control is predictability—conﬁdence that

process performance will not deteriorate in the future. It is the

antithesis of ﬁreﬁghting, which is the norm all too often.

Process mining is perhaps the single most valuable tool for monitoring

process performance and establishing control. It will uncover the

variations that all processes exhibit. Excessive variation should be

investigated and eliminated. For instance, in OTC, companies may

use multiple carriers to make ﬁnal deliveries. One lower-cost but less

reliable carrier will add enormous variation. That’s why as part of its

supply chain redesign, Mars Wrigley turned to a fourth-party logistics

company to work with carriers, monitor their performance, and ensure

# reliable delivery.

Process mining can identify the most important and costly problems

to address. It should be constant because the only thing that’s certain

in business is change. New customers have new needs; new products

require special treatment; new regulations require new reporting;

new technologies, such as those for managing inventory, may oﬀer

productivity gains; and so forth. Smart process-management teams stay

ahead of these developments and strive to keep improving processes—

even radically redesigned ones.

. . .

The reasons for companies to employ process management are greater and the diﬃculties of doing so are smaller than ever before. The

## virtuous cycle of better data, easier technology implementation, and

productivity gains has increased the payoﬀs, while numerous new

technologies now make the work faster and easier. And though the focus

on process has fallen out of favor, those who’ve maintained it have

reaped the beneﬁts. We believe that all companies should give process

management a hard look and that it’s essential for ﬁrms that are serious

Executives need to think broadly about how people, data, technology,

AI, and analytics come together to improve business performance.

Process needs to lie at the core. After all, it’s through processes that

organizations deliver value. It’s time for senior managers to put process

back on their radar screens and begin to sort out how to make it better in
