A Winning Parental Leave Policy Can Be Surprisingly Simple You really just need two elements. by Hilary Rau and Joan C. Williams

## Published on HBR.org / July 28, 2017 / Reprint H03TBY

An employee handbook update doesn’t usually merit a press release

and glossy promotional video — except when there’s a beneﬁts arms

race on. The paid-parental-leave arms race is red-hot because employers

see a unique opportunity to nab talent and headlines by one-upping

their competitors. Although 86% of American employees have no access

to paid parental leave, at elite ﬁrms access is growing. Six weeks! 20

weeks! A full year! From 2015 to 2017, more than 75 large companies

issued press releases touting new or expanded parental leave policies.

Forward-thinking companies recognize that generous paid parental

leave and other family-friendly policies provide reputational beneﬁts,

confer a competitive edge in recruitment, and increase employee

# productivity and retention.

Sad fact: Employers often shoot themselves in the foot by designing old-

fashioned leave policies that undercut their recruitment and retention

goals and may expose them to public relations backlash and legal

liability. The most common misstep is making paid leave contingent

on employees identifying as “primary caregivers.”

# HBR / Digital Article / A Winning Parental Leave Policy Can Be Surprisingly Simple

Primary-caregiver policies are holdovers from the days when maternity

leave was available to birth mothers only, with partners and adoptive

parents left out in the cold. Such policies reﬂect the assumption

that families will have one primary caregiver, supported by a partner

with few, or no, caregiving responsibilities. It’s the old-fashioned

homemaker/breadwinner model clothed in a tissue-thin veneer of

# gender neutrality.

Out of 75 new and expanded leave policies proﬁled in a recent report

## by CLASP and the National Partnership for Women and Families, more

than 34% required employees to attest that they were the primary

caregiver for their child in order to obtain the maximum leave beneﬁt.

Several of the policies proﬁled throw even the pretense of gender

neutrality out the window. One policy states expressly that pregnant

women are assumed to be the primary caregiver. Another states that the

maximum leave beneﬁt is available only to birth mothers and primary

## caregivers in cases of adoption and surrogacy only (sorry, biological

fathers!). A third puts its thumb on the scale more subtly by deﬁning

## primary caregiver as the parent with primary-caregiver responsibility

# immediately after birth.

Even a policy that looks neutral on paper can be applied in a manner

that is anything but. Imagine this scenario: A new father tells his boss

that he wants to designate himself as the baby’s primary caregiver and

take 12 weeks oﬀ. The boss is aﬀronted: “I only took a few days oﬀ after

my kids were born, and they turned out great. Twelve weeks is a long

time — what will you do that whole time? Your wife will be home, won’t

she? We really need you at work right now!” Policies and practices like

these are sex discrimination lawsuits waiting to happen.

The legal risks of primary-caregiver policies are not purely imaginative.

which the ACLU contends discriminates against fathers. JPMorgan

Chase’s paid leave policy, which provides 16 paid weeks to primary

caregivers and two weeks to secondary caregivers, is not unusual.

Unequal leave policies for primary and secondary caregivers are

widespread, a fact that has not escaped the ACLU’s notice. To

reduce legal risk, companies should eliminate primary-and secondary-

## caregiver categories from their leave policies.

When it comes to leave for new parents, you need just two simple

categories: disability leave for women who are physically unable to

work due to pregnancy, childbirth, or related conditions, and parental

leave that’s equally available to all employees, regardless of gender or

# caregiver status.

Legal risk aside, primary-caregiver policies risk alienating the very

workers they are designed to attract and retain: Millennials and women.

Millennials, who will make up 75% of the American workforce within

10 years, place a high value on paid parental leave and workplace

ﬂexibility. Paid leave is not merely a women’s issue for this generation:

78% of Millennials are part of a two-career couple, and it is the growing

expectation of Millennial workers that both partners will work and

parent. They ﬁnd the homemaker/breadwinner model of family life

unappealing, and so are likely to be put oﬀ by primary-caregiver

policies. We know one Millennial, a systems engineer at a Fortune 500 company, who recently told her ﬁancé, a fellow engineer, that

they would not be having children until he committed to taking equal parental leave. Her ﬁancé admittedly had not thought that far ahead

prior to their conversation, but is now fully on board with the plan. A

leave policy that allows for just one primary caregiver could be a deal

breaker for partnered Millennial employees who are committed to joint

# career advancement and equality at home.

Primary-caregiver policies are also counterproductive to employer

eﬀorts to recruit and retain women, who leave industries like tech at

twice the rate of their male counterparts. Research shows that the more

parental leave fathers take, the more likely mothers are to return to work

full-time. Gender-neutral leave policies allow families to take parental

leave equitably and are the better bet for employee retention.

A recent report on paid family leave by the New America Foundation

reports that women who take paid leave are far more likely to return

## to the workforce and work longer hours, on average, one to three

years later. Companies that have expanded their paid leave oﬀerings

have seen the attrition of new mothers drop by as much as 50%.

Forcing working women to accept the old-fashioned primary-caregiver

role as a condition to taking leave, however, fuels family dynamics

## that ultimately hurt women — and their employers. Primary-caregiver

policies pressure couples into breadwinner/homemaker roles instead of

diving childcare responsibilities equally — the exact opposite of what

employers should be doing to decrease attrition.

Paid leave is a powerful tool for recruiting and retaining top talent

— if it sends a strong signal that a company values its employees

and is committed to equity and diversity in the workplace. Employers

can avoid undercutting this powerful message by making sure that

their paid leave policy applies equally to all new parents — mothers

and fathers, biological and adoptive, LGBT, salaried and hourly —

without requiring that employees ﬁrst prove themselves to be primary

caregivers. Many companies are ditching primary-caregiver policies in

favor of gender-neutral policies and are expanding paid leave beneﬁts

to hourly workers, and for good reason: When you enter the paid-leave

arms race, you want to win it.
