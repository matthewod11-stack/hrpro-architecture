Deb Liu is CEO of Ancestry, the $5 billion genealogy platform, and the

author of Take Back Your Power: 10 New Rules for Women at Work. While

overt discrimination against women may have receded in recent years,

she says covert discrimination, including unconscious bias, can be just

as pernicious, keeping women from reaching the peaks of success. She

pushes for women to ﬁnd themselves not just mentors oﬀering advice,

but a sponsor who will put their own career on the line to advance that

of someone they believe in.

HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Liu in this episode of our

video series “The New World of Work” to talk about:

- How women can survive and thrive in stereotypically “bro” industries

# like the technology sector.

- How to constructively combat imposter syndrome, and actually use its

energy to fuel your drive.

- How Ancestry uses cutting-edge technologies to help families tell their

## genealogical stories to each other and a wider community.

“The New World of Work” explores how top-tier executives see the

future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for

success. Each week, Ignatius interviews a top leader on LinkedIn Live —

previous interviews included Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and former

PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. He also shares an inside look at these

conversations —and solicits questions for future discussions — in a

newsletter just for HBR subscribers. If you’re a subscriber, you can sign

ADI IGNATIUS:

Deb Liu, thank you very much for being with us today. I read your book,

Take Back Your Power: 10 New Rules for Women at Work. Before I get

into questions, I’d love to hear your take. What would you like to be the

## primary takeaway for people from that book?

DEB LIU:

I actually start the book saying, “Power is not a dirty word,” and

that is absolutely true. I think we have this weird impression that

actually wielding or having power is actually a bad thing. But the actual

deﬁnition of power is just the ability to inﬂuence people and events

around you, which is something we should all want with every single

day of our lives. That just means having impact. But it’s really that you

have more power, which means that in the circumstances that you’re in,

actually taking advantage of the things that you can do to move things

towards justice, move things towards what you’re passionate about, that

you’re actually delivering to your customers, that’s what I want everyone

to walk away with.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I’d say the book attempts to be inspirational, but it’s also quite

clearheaded about the problems that women have faced and continue to

face in the workplace. Have you seen progress? In recent years, is there

notable progress that you could talk about?

DEB LIU:

We have made so much progress over the years. I’ve talked to a lot

of women and some of the women I interviewed actually came of age

and led through decades when things were really diﬀerent. I talked to

Lenore Blum, she was one of the ﬁrst professors of math at Berkeley, and she was talking about how diﬃcult it was and how eventually her

contract was not renewed, how she was almost kicked out of her next

university, before she went on to a great career and success.

What you have to realize was that overt discrimination was happening

back then. Now, it’s actually much more covert. It’s actually really

unconscious bias. Very rarely is a woman told, “You can’t have this

job,” or, “You can’t accomplish X,” but instead it’s just the small things,

the small things being: for every 100 men that are promoted into

management, only 86 women are.

We don’t tell the other 14 women that they didn’t get promoted because

they’re a woman like they might have done 20, 30, 40 years ago. But

instead, there’s these subtle stumbling blocks that we’re facing. And

the challenge now is rather than having something to point to, is that

if you’re one of those women that didn’t make it, you always wonder,

“Is it me? Could I have done something diﬀerent?” When actually,

structurally, the system is a little bit set up so that there’s a slightly tilted

playing ﬁeld. And yet, that small slight change makes a huge diﬀerence

in the lives of the women that actually face it.

ADI IGNATIUS:

This is Harvard Business Review’s 100th anniversary, and as part of

the celebration we’ve been talking about some of the great articles

that we’ve published and that have had the most impact. We’ve also

unearthed some of the howlers that we’re frankly embarrassed about.

And it took us a long time to start to get gender right. I was recently at

a public event on stage, and I read from a 1956 article that talked about

how women needed to support their husband’s career, and they should

tolerate and even encourage their husband to work late, to go on trips.

And then speaking to the husband, it sort of said that you might just

need to ﬁnd a new wife who will accommodate this lifestyle. This is

1956, I wasn’t in the job then, but we did publish it and have to own it.

So there is a lot of progress. And yet, I think a lot of women feel a lot

of frustration still in the workplace. You’ve decided to write this book

even as you are CEO of a nearly $5 billion corporation. What was the

calculation there to try to be able to do both?

DEB LIU:

Actually, I had been thinking about this book for a long time. Even

before I became the CEO of Ancestry, it was eight years ago, I started an

open door policy. I let women who wanted to reach out, who needed an

ally, reach out to me. And over the course of eight years, I’ve coached

over a thousand women and I realized it wasn’t scalable. One of the

things I wanted to do with this book was to say, “What are all those

lessons? What are the themes I was hearing?” Women were asking, “Hey,

why wasn’t I promoted? Why is my peer now my manager? What am

I doing wrong?” Women would say, “Hey, I don’t know why I’m not

given stretch opportunities. I don’t have a sponsor.” And I realized if

I just shared those lessons and took all of the things I learned from

those thousand conversations and put it in a book, I could scale that to

## hopefully tens of thousands, if not millions of people.

ADI IGNATIUS:

How has your life changed since you published the book? I mean, now

you’re sort of out there as an authority. Has that changed your life?

DEB LIU:

My life is: before running in here, I was literally cooking lunch for my

family. So I feel like in some ways, having a family of three, with three

kids and my husband and my mom who has cancer living with us, has

kept me humble. And in fact, it reminds me that so much of our life is

not lived like what you see on social media, right? The successes, getting

the amazing job, or joining X board, or getting your book published,

[but] so much of life is actually the day to day, which is what keeps me,

reminds me, that we can have inﬂuence in small ways and big ways.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One truism, and I want to know if you think it’s true, is that the #MeToo

movement, in some ways, has run out of steam. To what extent do you

think the MeToo movement has changed the status of women in the

# workplace?

DEB LIU:

Well, I think it’s changed the conversation. It’s made us so much

more aware of things that were hidden for so long. I think that the

#MeToo movement itself is not just about the actual talking about what

happened, but it’s really changing our behavior and what is acceptable

in the workplace. You look at what happened 30, 40 years ago, the kind

of sexual harassment that was very open. And now, as we evolve, I think

that we are learning every single year, every decade, how we can be

better and more sensitive, and how we can actually call each other into

account about some of these things. Things that were acceptable 10, 20

years ago and no longer acceptable today, and that will continue over

time. And so I think each of these movements, there’s two steps forward,

one step back, and then we keep moving forward towards more equality

# and more opportunity for everybody.

ADI IGNATIUS:

So what would you say to women who are enormously capable, but feel

that somehow they just don’t have the right stuﬀ to be in the C-Suite, to

be CEO?

DEB LIU:

I felt that way not long ago. In fact, I shared this story of my friend

Fidji Simo, she is the CEO of Instacart. And many years ago, I went to her oﬃce, I was upset about something at work and I just was grousing

about something and she goes, “You know what, Deb? We’re going to

be CEO someday.” And I laughed because I just thought that was such

a crazy idea. And you know what? This time, about two years ago when

I was talking to Blackstone about the Ancestry role, she eventually

became CEO.

We joked about how she knew where we were going to go and I didn’t.

But regardless, I was the person who never aspired to this, and she was

somebody who had such clarity of vision. She knew the world, the mark

she was going to make in the world, and both of us ended up in similar

places. And that means that it is possible. You don’t have to have dreamt

since you were a little girl that you wanted to be CEO. But it is possible

if you just take back your power and you take those opportunities as

they’re given to you.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One issue that comes up with women in the workplace is this idea of

## imposter syndrome, that not just women, but women in particular feel

that they don’t belong where they in fact do belong it. It’s been written

about so much that we ran a piece recently that actually said, “Stop

talking to women about this idea of imposter syndrome.” But what do

you think? There’s imposter syndrome, there’s also the “fake it ‘til you

make it” idea, to act like you belong until you get there. Where do you

come down with some of these concepts?

# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

DEB LIU:

Recently, I went to a CEO conference, and there were over 200 CEOs

there. In that room, I was the only woman of color, and it was probably

less than 10% women. I stopped for a second, and I thought about it

and I said, “You know what? I could think about it as I’m an imposter.

I don’t belong here. Or I can think of myself as, ‘I’m the ﬁrst person

that looks like me in this room, and that means that next year, there’ll

be two, three, four, or ﬁve, and that it will change, and over time, we

will change this together’.” So, I have always taken this idea of imposter

syndrome because everyone feels that, men and women, there’s been a

lot of studies to say that, but the bigger thing is what do you do about it?

Do you let it cow you? Do you let it put you inside of yourself? Or do

you actually say, “You know what? I’m going to take that energy and I’m

going to use it as fuel to get to where I want to go,” which is, I might feel

like an imposter, but I’m going to turn it on its head. One idea of turning

on its head and how I do it is I say, “You know what? I might not be the

expert at X and I might not be as smart, I might not look like anyone

else, but I bring something really special to the table. I’m going to learn

faster, I’m going to try harder than other people.” And that has given me

the ability to overcome that when the time comes.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Another truism that people casually throw out there is this idea of the

“Queen Bee syndrome”, that women who have made it to the top hold

onto it so tightly that they actually are not encouraging other women.

Instead of being a role model, and a sponsor, and a helpful hand,

they actually prevent other women from rising similarly. Is that a real

phenomenon or is that an incorrect perception?

# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

DEB LIU:

I wrote about this in my book because I had just done so much research

in the book, and I actually had to shove a note in at the end that says, “A

## note about “Queen Bee syndrome,” in the middle of the allies chapter.

And it’s because it’s something we hear a lot: women are terrible

mentors and leaders, and they push other women down. And actually,

I was reading a number of studies. One of them, the most salient said

that that’s only true in a circumstance where there’s only one slot. When

women are competing for the one slot, say, in a law ﬁrm partnership or

in the C-suite, then yes, it’s absolutely competitive. But actually, if you

look at all the studies, when women make it onto boards, when they’re

the CEO or in the C-suite, when they run organizations, they actually

bring more women, more diversity in.

So, if you look at it on a broad scale, it actually is the opposite. And

I hate the idea of “Queen Bee syndrome” because it’s saying, “Women

push each other down.” But that’s absolutely not true unless it’s set

up in a competitive way. Instead, you actually see transformation

happening because women are in leadership positions.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One of the takeaways from your book is that women really will beneﬁt

from having allies, and particularly, sponsors in the workplace. I think

there’s some people who feel like, yeah, I’ve had that or I’ve had that all

my career, and some people who ask how to do it? And so, what is your

advice: how do you get a sponsor who can help you in your career?

# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

DEB LIU:

Well, ﬁrst, I want to deﬁne what a sponsor is. We often hear about

mentors, people who give you advice, and there’s tons of women who

are over-mentored and under-sponsored. Women are given a lot of

mentors. People give them advice. But a sponsor is someone who puts

their career on the line to open doors for you to actually say, “I vouch

for this person at my own expense should this go wrong.” And women

actually have fewer sponsors. Part of the issues with sponsors is that

people tend to sponsor people who are most like them. When I sponsor

somebody, I’m much more likely, any individual is more likely, to

sponsor somebody who I can say, “I can see myself in that person 10,

20 years ago. I can see them becoming me someday, and I can remember

what it felt like to be in their position.”

But in a workplace where we’re not equal in a number of diﬀerent ways,

it means that those who get sponsored tend to look like the people who

are already there. So, it’s so important to cultivate sponsors. And I often

ask, “How many of you in the audience have a sponsor?” And when

you look around, a lot of people don’t know. And the answer is, if you

don’t know, you don’t have one. Because a sponsor is like a tailwind in

your career. You can feel it. You can feel people pushing you towards

something greater, giving you opportunities you never thought, opening

doors for you. And I greatly beneﬁted from that. I absolutely would not

be where I am today but for the handful of people I wrote about in my

book, who actually accelerated my careers in ways that I could never

have imagined. And without each of those individuals giving me the

tailwinds I needed to get to here, I would not be here. Absolutely.

ADI IGNATIUS:

You talked about having people on the way, but were there one or two

crucible moments in your career that made you who you are today,

# Deborah Liu, author and CEO of Ancestry?

DEB LIU:

Well, I just remember when I joined PayPal, I actually accidentally

stumbled on a job at PayPal because I stopped by a career fair. And

when I ﬁrst became a product manager, I remember having to admit

that I had no idea what the role was. And I went to the VP I worked for,

Amy Klement, and I said, “I got this job, and I have no idea what this is.”

And she actually taught me the ropes. She showed me what it was to be

a successful product manager, and I was leading the buyer experience,

and we were at PayPal, and we were acquired by eBay. And suddenly,

I was in charge of a big chunk of the integration. And she took a huge

risk on me. I had only been a product manager maybe two or three years

when she in fact chose me to run that team to lead the integration.

She gave me such conﬁdence that she had a choice amongst many

seasoned professionals. And she picked somebody who was really new

and made me not only manager, but the head of the team, the biggest

line of business at PayPal. And this is the kind of career accelerant that

you can only dream of. It would’ve taken me 10 years to earn that role,

but I didn’t want to fail her. I worked incredibly hard, and I built that

team out and built that integration out.

And the same thing was true. I was really stuck after six years of having

kids. I was working at PayPal, then I went to eBay, and then I went

to Facebook, and I felt really stuck for six years, and not only didn’t

get promoted, I took a demotion to go to Facebook. And I had gone

from a manager of the buyer experience at eBay managing 18 product

managers to being a nice individual contributor in product marketing.

And along came my seventh manager at Facebook, and after two and a

half years he said to me, “You’ll be a vice president here someday.” And

I remember laughing at him because he wasn’t a vice president, and he

had bet his career on me. And when you see that, you feel it, you can be

nothing but grateful and want to pay that forward.

ADI IGNATIUS:

When you look inside and look at your own skills and capabilities, what

counts as your superpower, what do you think has gotten you where you

are?

DEB LIU:

So we talk about how your superpower is something that comes easy

to you, but really hard to other people. And as a result of it, people

can’t see it. I love strategy. I love kind of unwinding and weaving

through, and saying, “Hey, here’s what we should do,” because it’s

gathering all the information, the customer research, the data, and then

powering through and saying, “Here’s a recommendation.” I started my

work actually as a strategy consultant, and I have carried that through

products, through becoming a GM, and so on and so forth. It’s really a

clarity of understanding of what our strategy should be. And so I have

spent my career honing that and then building out teams to actually

# execute on those strategies.

# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

ADI IGNATIUS:

You written and talked about how you’re an introvert, and I’d love to

hear a little bit about how you’ve made it as an introvert in a world that

seems to demand extroversion.

DEB LIU:

I don’t know if you’ve read Susan Cain’s book, Quiet, but the world has

a huge bias that we don’t talk about, which is towards people who are

extroverted, who don’t need time to process, who are able to speak on

any topic on a dime, and be comfortable in all circumstances. And that

was not me for a long time, and it took me a long time to get to here. I

worked very hard at it. But I had to work at it like it was a skill, like it was a second language. It does not come natural to me. It is very diﬃcult for

me to speak. And yet at the same time, by treating it as a skill, I believe

you can learn almost anything, if motivated and you put enough time

# into it.

I think for me, I really taught myself. I would force myself to speak.

I would grade myself, I would count how long I’d speak, how much I

spoke. And eventually it got me to a level of comfort. I had multiple

speaking coaches, and it did take a lot of time to get here. But I think

that’s a reminder that almost anything is teachable.

The thing I hope, though, is that we don’t have to conform ourselves to

what leadership looks like today. I hope that there are more ways that

people think leaders could look like. That there can be quiet leaders,

extroverted leaders. There can be leaders who lead in diﬀerent ways,

and that we can honor all of those things. But in the meantime, we do

have a model of leadership that is strongly biased towards extroversion.

And that’s something which I felt like I needed to conform and learn.

# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

ADI IGNATIUS:

My guess is, once you started to speak openly, and maybe publicly,

about that character trait, a lot of other people said, you know what? Me

too. I’ve never been able to talk about it, but me too.

DEB LIU:

Absolutely. I share a lot about it and people seem surprised that this was

such a struggle for me. But then it’s given a lot of people hope too. A lot

of people write me notes and say, “If you can do this, I can do this too.”

And so it’s been really a great learning experience for me to talk more

about some of these challenges because I see so many people say, “It’s

so great to see how far you’ve come and that you’re willing to share it.”

Because I think a lot of times, we don’t talk about it either.

ADI IGNATIUS:

All right. So let’s talk about Ancestry. You’ve been in the CEO role

for nearly two years. I’d love to get a quick sense of what you’ve

accomplished to date and what you want to accomplish coming up.

DEB LIU:

When I ﬁrst got here, one of the things that was really important to

me was that we look at the next chapter of where we want to go. We’ve

had a successful company in business for so many years. It’s a 35 year

old company, and it’s an innovator in the space of discovering and

documenting your family story and history.

And so our next chapter was really something we call Ancestry for All.

So how do we make the product more accessible to everyone who loves

their family? 80% of people have said that they want to learn more about

their family history, and we have such an opportunity to help them,

but we don’t necessarily have all the records today. We don’t have the

connections to all the archives. We don’t have as rich a rich database in

certain communities. And so a lot of the work we’ve been doing over the

past two years is really moving towards Ancestry for All.

The second thing we’ve done is really work from me to we. For a long

time, a lot of the work on Ancestry was a solo activity, and we want to

make it a family and a new community activity, because people do this,

not just because they want to document their family history and story

for themselves, but because they want to share it with their family. They

want to talk about their memories, they want to actually make their

family part of their experience. And so a lot of the work we’ve also been

doing is actually moving from me to we, and actually connecting people

## and their families through their history.

ADI IGNATIUS:

So you talked about how there are limitations to source materials.

Do you envision a technological breakthrough that could signiﬁcantly

change that, where we’d get access to information that is unthinkable

# right now?

DEB LIU:

Well, I think ﬁrst, digitization costs are going down, and so that’s going

to help access more records and has made it much more possible for us to get access to records that would’ve been really diﬃcult and expensive

to key in many years ago. I think that will make a huge diﬀerence.

# HBR / Digital Article / Ancestry CEO Deb Liu Says Women Need to Reframe Their Rela…

I also think it’s a matter of focus as well. We focused on areas where we

could easily get access to the records. As we grow our record database,

we have the largest exclusive database of historical records in the world.

And one of the things that we want to do is to continue to grow that

archive in areas, in countries, where it might not be as easily accessible.

And so there’s some work that will be done there, but technology is only

making this easier over time. And so we’re going to continue to invest in

and grow that.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Have you been able to learn anything about your own family and your

# own background through Ancestry?

DEB LIU:

I actually was able to pull my mother-in-law’s immigration papers,

actually her immigration card. And I showed it to her, and I found the

record that was the attestation of her good character. And I showed it

to her and she said, “Oh…” My husband saw it and he goes, “Oh, that’s

Aunt Mary from church.” And so just to see that kind of the story. They

never told me the story of how they came to America and how she got

her green card, and how she stayed in America. And so it just opened

up that conversation and that’s why we’re here. It’s not just, you have

this record. It’s the story behind the record. It’s actually the story of a

person who left her home with almost nothing and came to America to

go to college not knowing how she was going to go back. And the life

that she’s unfolded here.

I’m torn because in some ways, everything is being recorded now.

Everything is digital, everything is for history. On the other hand, I

look back at letters that I used to exchange with friends and family, and

they were these wonderful detailed record. We don’t do that in email. So

sometimes I worry that the quality of the kind of raw material that we’re

creating now is not nearly as rich as what we had before.

DEB LIU:

Well, when you look at your photographs, like Google Photos has

probably 10,000 photos of my family. And it used to be that even a

single photograph was so hard to get for a family in the early 1900s because it was so expensive and it was so diﬃcult. And so those precious

archives are so important, and I think we’re losing them. There are

boxes, shoe boxes, we call it, in closets and attics that are deteriorating,

but they’re so precious because they’re so rare as well. And so one of the

things we hope to do is make it easier to digitize. With our app, actually,

we recently did a partnership with Photomyne that allows people to take

## photos, a large number of photos, and actually crop them automatically

and store them in Ancestry. And so it’s really powerful to really bring

things that might be a letter, or something in an archive, or a photo, to

# life.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I assume facial recognition technology can now help identify previously

## unidentiﬁable photos from the past archive.

DEB LIU:

Yeah, I think there’s a lot of technology that’s helping. One is also

communities are helping each other. People say, “Hey, there’s a photo

of my great-grandfather. Where do you think he is?” And you see

communities come together and help people. And so I do think that

technology is making it easier. Also, if there’s a damaged photo, being

able to restore it easily through AI is so much more powerful because

restoration used to be so incredibly expensive.

ADI IGNATIUS:

You’ve been in this role for a couple years. Tell me what you think is the

secret to leadership, or what does good leadership look like in 2022?

DEB LIU:

I think the biggest thing is people’s lives are so diﬀerent than they

were even just three or four years ago. We have a ﬂexible work policy, and it allows people to live their lives as well as come into the oﬃce

if they choose. And that’s changed so much. If I had told you that you

were going to write an article in 2022 about people working from home

primarily in 2019, I think you would have been really surprised. And

so life has changed so much, and we’ve reorganized our lives in the

last three years. That is the biggest challenge, but it’s also the biggest

opportunity. This gives us a chance to rethink how we structure our lives

and our work and it gives us the opportunity to really look to the future

and shape work how we want it to be.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I’m going to go to some questions that we solicited before for the

interview, and this is from Rachel in New York. The question is, “With

growing concerns about data security, what is Ancestry doing to ensure

that customer’s data is protected?”

DEB LIU:

So ﬁrst, with data, it’s really important that you can control it. You can

keep your trees private, you can request to delete your DNA. You can

choose so many diﬀerent things in our system to ensure that you are

protected the way you want to be. Second, though, is also ensuring data

security so that no third party is actually accessing it as well. And we

really take that very, very seriously.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Okay. Another question, this is from Nicole in Atlanta. She says she’s

been told over and over again, don’t share too much of yourself at

work. She said she struggles with that idea because she’s a remote

worker. She imagines it helps others get to know her personally, to make

them comfortable with her, but she doesn’t want to be unprofessional.

So the question is, in a leadership role, how would you deﬁne what’s

the right balance between sharing your authentic self and keeping it

# professional?

DEB LIU:

I think that the blurring line between work and home has changed a

lot during the last couple years. But many years ago, I was one of the

few people at Facebook who had children. It was a company where

everybody was in their 20s, and I was deﬁnitely not. I was in my 30s

when I joined, I had two kids already, and it was just a very diﬀerent

culture and I was really worried people didn’t think I took my job very

# seriously.

The challenge though was that you shared everything in your life

on Facebook and you friended every coworker after every meeting,

which was really daunting to me. I would share these little stories

about my kids called “hashtag mommy school”. And I actually have

mommyschool.net, if you want to see some of them. It’s a comic strip.

But I used to share it just on Facebook as a funny thing and I realized

that it helped people connect to me. A lot of people who didn’t have kids

would laugh and they would reference it, and I realized that there are

things where people want to get to know you. They want to know that

you’re human and that you have things going on. They want to know

who you are. But doing that well and doing that so that it’s professional,

they’re a line we’re all walking.

But I don’t think we should hide some of the challenges we have

because it makes it harder for us to connect with one another. We’re not

automatons. We’re not computers and AIs talking to each other. We’re

humans with challenges and dreams and desires. And sometimes in the

background you can hear our kids sick and crying. And I think it builds

empathy for us to actually know each other a little bit better, especially

in a remote environment where you might not meet people more than

# once or twice a year.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One more audience question, and this is from Julia in Boston. It’s really

pressing you on women in tech. I think we all have this impression that

a lot of the Silicon Valley companies have this bro culture and that it is

particularly diﬃcult for women to break in, to rise. She’d love to hear, is

there progress there? Or what needs to happen there? It seems to be a uniquely diﬃcult environment for women these days.

DEB LIU:

I founded a non-proﬁt called Women in Product, and part of it was that

I started out in a ﬁeld, product management, and these are the people

who decide what products you see, what apps were on your phone,

how things are designed across hundreds of companies, thousands of

companies where you interact with their products. It’s the product

manager who actually sets the roadmap and what gets launched. And

when I started in that ﬁeld, it was 50/50 men and women. And then

somewhere along the way I woke up one day and it was less than

10% women, and I just did not know what happened. And I spent

years looking into it and we realized that, at some point in 2004,

Google decided they wanted their product managers to have a computer

science degree. And less than 20% of computer science degrees are

earned by women.

So you’re probably wondering why I’m telling you the story. Well,

basically, we went from a ﬁeld where there were lots of women, lots

of diverse voices, to many fewer diverse voices. And so while we think

we’re making progress, sometimes we see setbacks as well. And then we

have to work our way back up towards more equality. But something

interesting happens. Amongst the ﬁeld of product management, that is

also where future founders come from. That’s where they fund people

with ideas because these are builders. And so, again, you see fewer

startups getting funded and all women teams only make up 3% of VC

funding whereas even with mixed teams, men and women, it’s about

18%. So you can’t tell me that 82% of the best ideas in the world are from

one gender because that’s not true. So we still have a lot of work to do.

That doesn’t mean that we can’t change things. One of the things I

did and advocated for across the entire industry was removing the

computer science requirement. I advocated for removing the technical

degree, the technical interview. And over time you see more people

of diverse backgrounds actually entering the ﬁeld. So each individual

person, we can make a diﬀerence. We can change the arc of history. You

don’t have to be very senior to do that. I did that when I was actually a

relatively junior employee. And so there are things that we can do, but

it’s going to take time and it’s going to take people saying, “This is the

set of problems and here’s how we’re going to solve it.”

ADI IGNATIUS:

That is a great note to end on. Deb Liu, thank you very much for being

# our guest.

DEB LIU:

Thank you so much for inviting me.
