Returning from parental leave can be a jarring inﬂection point that too

often results in people curtailing their responsibilities or leaving their jobs

altogether. While many women choose to return to work after maternity

leave, many others ﬁnd that it’s not sustainable and leave or take on

reduced roles. Seventeen percent of women and 4% of men stop working

in the ﬁve years following childbirth, according to research recently

conducted at the Universities of Bristol and Essex in the United Kingdom.

Harvard economist Claudia Goldin has found that the gender wage gap in

America is the largest for women in their prime childbearing years.

Navigating a system that was not designed for career paths that balance

work with family can easily feel like a mission-practically-impossible even

in the best of times. And when the job market is weak, many people will

become even more pessimistic about the possibility of persuading an

employer to accept a ﬂexible work arrangement.

After two maternity leaves, I’ve discovered that some companies are

willing to let people redesign their positions in a way that will allow them

not just to continue their careers, but even to accelerate them. But it

means setting clear goals, forensically analyzing how you spend your time,

consciously not doing things that aren’t core to meeting your goals, over-

communicating, and then course-correcting when required.

Set Clear Goals In order for any corporate machinery to try to accommodate your career

goals, you ﬁrst need to identify them. If you’re not sure what your dreams

are, no one can help you realize them. So step back and ask yourself: What

is it that I really want?

What are your immediate objectives after you return from your parental

leave? What are your long-term goals? Do you want to run your company

one day? Or do you want to slow down your career and focus on your

family? Or do you hope for some combination of both? In my experience,

all of these options can work — as long as you’re honest with yourself and

# your employer.

If you cannot articulate your answers, a parental leave is a great time to

reﬂect on them. Being up with a tiny human at 3AM can give you some

time for self-reﬂection. In my case, it was difficult to envision my long-

term goals and to ﬁgure out how to achieve them until I took a break from

the daily grind on my maternity leaves. During my ﬁrst leave, I resolved

that I wanted to continue in consulting, a ﬁeld with predominantly male

leadership, as a partner at the consulting ﬁrm Oliver Wyman. But I also

wanted to leave work every day at 6PM to spend time with my family, and

I wanted to take August off to travel from my base in London to visit

# family in Canada.

During my second leave, I decided that I hoped to play a major role in

building out our ﬁrm’s public sector practice and lead our anti-ﬁnancial

crime business, where I would interact widely and often at the highest

levels of our ﬁrm, overseeing multiple project teams in multiple countries

at any given time. But I also wanted to be able to prioritize my family

whenever I needed to. I adjusted my schedule accordingly, so now, instead

of leaving work at 6PM every day, I might take off one Monday per month.

If I have an emergency doctor’s appointment for my child, or if any of

## potentially a million other things crop up unexpectedly with my family

life, I can drop work if I need to or I can comfortably agree with my

partner that he will handle the situation. In turn, if I have to work in the

evening, I don’t let it stress me out.

Forensically Analyze How You Spend Your Time After you’ve identiﬁed your goals, forensically analyze how you spend your

time at work and cut out anything that’s not aligned with your objectives.

Before you go on maternity leave, be clear about what you’re working on,

who you are working with, and how you intend to rejoin your team. That

way, once you return, you can more easily delegate or drop anything that

does not speed up progress.

For people who already work fairly autonomously, this is generally

straightforward. But if you are senior in a corporation, you will likely have

to say “no” more often to supporting projects and corporate initiatives that

are not directly related to your ambitions. This can be tricky, since there’s

a risk of being perceived as less committed to your company if you turn

down extra work. Still, you must: If you take on too much, you may

## underdeliver on your work or family commitments, or both. Discuss the

right balance with coworkers. People will generally understand this if you

can make it crystal clear how you will still contribute on a broader level,

but in a deliberate and agreed-upon way by focusing on your goals.

Concentrate on what you can do within the time you have, and excel at

that. When I returned to work following my second maternity leave, I gave

up supporting a major part of our business in order to focus purely on

building out our economic crime advisory work with the public sector.

Narrowing my focus in this way allowed me to devote the time necessary

to develop much more insightful content in my speciﬁc area. As a result,

we’ve been able to support the most sophisticated ﬁnancial centers in

improving their ﬁnancial crime defenses. I miss supporting the other part

of our business. But I would make the same decision again.

# Overcommunicate Overcommunicate your aspirations with your employer, colleagues, and

family openly and honestly. Share a detailed maternity plan with your boss

that lays out what you want to achieve and the clients and areas that you

want to cover. Schedule meetings with your boss before you leave, about a

month before you come back, and monthly afterward to discuss how

things are going. That way, they can step in to offer support when needed.

It’s also important to have continual conversations with your partner at

home. Persistently check on how your balance of work and home life is

going. In my house, this changes every week. We constantly talk — or

frantically text in the middle of the day — about who will pick up our

oldest from daycare and who can travel on which dates.

Course Correct Then, be prepared to adjust. It’s impossible to know what it’s like to juggle

your family and your career until you’re in the thick of it. So be open to

reassessing your goals and course correct as required.

You may ﬁnd that you can do more than you expected. When I ﬁrst came

back from maternity leave, I was convinced that I wouldn’t be able to

commit to multiple client-facing roles. But once I set boundaries and

became better at delegating, I found I had more time in my day than

anticipated and could gradually take on more.

But accept that things will also not always work out as you’d hoped. I had

to take a step back from one global initiative because the team, spread out

across multiple time zones, would meet exactly at the time that I wanted

to be home with my boys. After sleepless teething nights, I’ve lost four —

yes, four — passports and misplaced countless bank cards and travel coffee

cups. At times, our kitchen looks like it was hit by a tornado after we rush

out the door in the morning. Don’t let these kinds of mishaps cause stress

— just smile and realize that you’re doing the best you can.

Be open and honest when your best laid plans go awry. That way, the

broader team can understand that it is not always an easy journey.

Be a Champion for Others By bringing your whole self to work, you can encourage your employer to

think through, and overcome, the potential obstacles involved in

supporting not just your own ﬂexible work arrangements, but also those of

others. Be sure to actively and visibly support people in a similar position.

Support individuals when the risks they have taken have failed and remind

the organization, and the individual, that taking risks is a part of being

successful — the important thing is to maintain faith in the individual’s

# underlying ability.

Spearhead initiatives with senior leaders in your organization to support

new models of working. For example, an initiative called “Men4Change” in

our ﬁrm is designed to close a gender gap in senior leadership roles.

Senior men help to create and assist with customized work arrangements

for many high-potential women. A “Boost” program assigns sponsors to

support individuals with everything from designing their ﬂexible work

arrangements before parental leave to ensuring these agreed-upon plans

are successfully implemented afterward.

We have not only a moral imperative to make it possible for more women

and men to return to work from parental leave, but also a commercial

imperative to develop the best-performing teams. As you navigate your

own return to work from a parental leave, take the time to step back and

ﬁgure out what you really want to accomplish. Find the sponsors who can

help you shape and accelerate your career on your own terms. Then pay it

forward by being an effective role model and sponsor to other new parents

coming up through the ranks after you.
