trees, and so on—can falter in the face of the scale and complexity of the

biggest problems that groups and leaders face.

This is where AI can help, and is helping. With its ability to analyze vast

troves of data about the status quo, understand group preferences, run

sophisticated simulations to evaluate hundreds of future possibilities

## against those preferences, and facilitate consensus-building among

participants, AI can be a powerful tool for all leaders facing complex

decisions, especially those that must be made collaboratively.

One ﬁeld already taking advantage of AI’s collective decision-making

support is city planning. Three years ago, we started working with the

United States Conference of Mayors to understand how AI is helping

cities solve their most pressing challenges. Along the way, we studied

the story of the German city of Hamburg, which has addressed a

housing crisis exacerbated by an inﬂux of refugees.

In 2016, Hamburg partnered with MIT Media Lab, the creator of an

AI platform called CityScope. The platform allows urban planners to

collect and digest the needs and preferences of swaths of residents,

simulate hundreds of building scenarios, identify hidden opportunities,

and ﬁnd common ground among conﬂicting factions. By demonstrating

how CityScope is working in Hamburg, we hope to show leaders across

## governments, nonproﬁts, universities, and corporations how they can

harness data and AI to democratize and improve their decision-making

# processes and outcomes.

# The Crisis in Hamburg

In 2016, Germany decided to welcome 1 million refugees from the

Middle East, and Hamburg was tasked with ﬁnding housing for an

## anticipated 80,000 families in a city of under 2 million people. At

the time, the city had been stuck in unproductive conversations about

zoning laws for decades, struggling to build enough houses for its own

# residents.

Three challenges tend to come to the fore in situations of collective

decision-making, and Hamburg was no exception:

Processes and incentives are broken.

The traditional process to get things done (in this case, to get new

housing built) involves dozens of steps and institutions, each with

its own procedural logic and internal culture. A single technical

impropriety can delay a project by months, if not years. Stakeholders

have no incentive to come together. In Hamburg, the city struggled to

get anything built because each project required the approval of a dozen

## bureaucracies, often sclerotic and opaque.

Information is increasingly abundant and isn’t equally distributed.

Every decision (in this case, about speciﬁc developments or zoning

laws) involves vast amounts of information across domains—from resident preferences and technical documents to traﬃc and usage

metrics. Furthermore, processes are often expressed in long, detailed,

technical documents that the average person cannot be expected to

understand. Those with more resources have the time, money, and

expertise to get the information they need to form an educated opinion

while other community members do not.

# Other inequities.

Dominant players possess a wide array of tools to block transformations.

In this case, property owners can stop urban developments with

historic preservation regulations, minimum lot size requirements,

height restrictions, etc. In Hamburg, the only people who participated

in decision-making about housing and zoning were wealthier, older

homeowners. Successive mayors had launched a few outreach

campaigns to get other parts of the community engaged in zoning

debates, but none had gained traction.

# How CityScope Helped

AI can help to solve these challenges and improve the way that groups

make decisions together. Ariel Noyman, one of the key engineers

behind CityScope, told us that his team designed the platform to fulﬁll

# four key functions:

- Insight: Building a dynamic model of social, economic, and

## environmental conditions through comprehensive data collection, an

## environmental scan, transaction analytics, and sentiment analysis;

# visualization with feedback.

- Prediction: Identifying needs and simulating the impact of alternative

interventions by evaluating thousands of “what-if” scenarios.

- Transformation: Iterating possible interventions into validated paths

# of action.

- Consensus: Engaging stakeholders in a shared, facilitated decision-

making process to reach a uniﬁed vision of the future.

Here’s how these functions played out in the process of working with

residents and planners in Hamburg to move the needle forward.

The ﬁrst step involved gathering as much data as possible.

CityScope drew on data about housing and zoning laws, but

also economic development, purchasing patterns, city-wide events

## and amenities, transportation and infrastructure, employment

opportunities, demographic diversity, environmental impact, safety,

and more. It also administered surveys to residents to gather their

# preferences.

To deliver the ﬁrst function, insight, the platform then correlated the

## core dimensions of housing—density and diversity of people—with

performance indicators such as energy use, safety, resident preferences,

and so on. With that data, the platform analyzed the relationship

## between housing and quality of life in the status quo.

Then the platform went on to make predictions about current trends

and hypothetical transformations, identifying constraints that might be

valuable to alter along the way. CityScope highlighted the systematic

underuse of commercial properties, for instance. It also highlighted the

areas where public services were most likely to be strained and those

with the most capacity to welcome new residents.

Once the analysis was done, CityScope displayed the results in a simple,

easy-to-understand diagram to help citizens and other participants

to easily see how potential changes would aﬀect key performance

indicators that reﬂect the common priorities of the city’s residents.

The labels on the vertical bars indicate that the community cared about

environmental impact, energy performance, infrastructure, innovation,

and overall livability (each of these indicators aggregated hundreds of

metrics). The height of the ﬁll of each bar indicates the city’s current

performance on each priority (higher is better), and the horizontal

lines on each bar indicate the performance for each of these priorities

for a given future scenario. The bars with red ﬁll indicate areas that

would change for the better; those that are green show the city has

already met the targets. Through this chart, CityScope helps residents

understand their situation (insight again), extrapolate current trends

(prediction again), evaluate possible alternatives (transformation), and

# ﬁnd common ground (consensus).

In Figure 2, these metrics are aggregated by street into a 3D map

of the city. Positive changes are in green, negative ones in red, and

alternatives can be modeled at the scale of the individual street,

neighborhood, or the city as a whole. In Hamburg, these representations

allowed users to understand trade-oﬀs and ﬁnd ways to overcome

them. For example, the visualization made starkly clear the diﬀerences between the preferences of aﬄuent communities, where proposals that

threatened lower-density zoning received the worst ratings, and the city

as a whole, where building more houses in underdeveloped areas to

welcome refugees scored well.

CityScope then helped the residents ﬁnd the best way to accommodate

these conﬂicting preferences. By evaluating competing proposals, it

demonstrated that wealthier neighborhoods could beneﬁt from more

houses provided that a new metro line were also built in the process,

thereby paving the way to consensus.

The vizualizations also allow CityScope to yet again collect people’s

preferences, this time on the trade-oﬀs and competing proposals. In

Hamburg, the team administered surveys and organized workshops

## across the city with an augmented reality (AR) version of the platform

(see Figure 3).

The AR interface allowed participants to collaborate with CityScope

to see the implications of their choices. Hamburg residents would

come into the room and rearrange the LEGO-like bricks representing residential units, oﬃce buildings, parks, and other urban amenities in a

speciﬁc zone, redesigning the city one brick at a time (Figure 3). When

participants made these changes, the digital projection updated in real

time to show how the proposed changes would aﬀect quality of life.

The platform also connected these changes with the zoning laws that

would make them possible, bridging the gap between the LEGO game

# and policymaking.

The interface also allowed participants to collaborate with each other

in workshops across the city. That way, CityScope became a platform

## of direct community engagement, where technical and non-technical

people, with diﬀerent levels of understanding, gathered around the

table to understand the impact that their common decisions would

have on their city (the consensus function again). In Hamburg, 5,000

residents participated in CityScope workshops in 2016, considerably

more than at any conventional town hall. What’s more, by targeting

diverse communities across the city, the CityScope team has managed

to attract a representative sample of the population, rather than just the

older, wealthier citizens who have historically participated in the city’s

# urban planning.

# Making Decision-Making More Democratic

Through its use of AI, CityScope addresses the key challenges we

## identiﬁed in city planning, and in group decision-making more

# generally:

First, they circumvent slow bureaucratic processes. By aggregating all

the relevant data into a dynamic model, CityScope analyzes trade-oﬀs better than city oﬃcials ever could on their own because it integrates

all perspectives and tests thousands of alternatives. The result is

a considerably streamlined process, and also one that takes more

## perspectives into account more accurately.

Second, they solve the problem of information overload and asymmetry.

By intaking and processing vast troves of data and then providing clear

visuals and methods for interacting with and sharing them, CityScope

removes the informational barriers that favor those with more resources

over those who lack money, time, or expertise, giving anyone the

opportunity to understand and propose changes.

Third, CityScope enables the full community to ﬁnd a path to

consensus, not just the elite. Residents may not agree on this or that

housing project, but they can ﬁnd common ground around shared

priorities. By shifting the focus of deliberation from speciﬁc projects or

laws to broader priorities for the city, CityScope reframes the discussion

towards the bigger picture. Larson calls the platform a “consensus

# machine” for a reason.

Eighteen months after the partnership with CityScope began, Hamburg

had not just housed thousands of refugees: It had strategically

distributed them across the city to maximize social cohesion, economic

opportunity, and community resilience. Since then, the city has been

integrating CityScope into its decision-making processes more broadly,

## for transportation, energy use, and environmental regulation. When

Russia invaded Ukraine in 2022, Hamburg had the tools to welcome tens

of thousands of refugees in a fraction of the usual time And the United

Nations now funds a project exporting CityScope to other cities that face

# an unexpected inﬂux of refugees.

# Beyond CityScope

Humans are not especially good at processing immense amounts of

information and translating it into policy. They struggle to understand

complexity and, left to their own devices, seldom ﬁnd common ground

on contentious issues. CityScope shows that AI can help.

However, by themselves, platforms like CityScope cannot solve

contentious problems. Most group decisions remain inescapably prone

to conﬂict and while AI can help us understand and navigate

tradeoﬀs, it cannot make tradeoﬀs disappear. No algorithm, however

sophisticated, can replace a culture of healthy disagreement and mutual

respect. In Hamburg, it was the residents and their leaders who made

## this conversation productive, not just the platform itself.

Further, these tools only matter if they are integrated into the right

ecosystem. In Hamburg, the city could not take advantage of CityScope

without also reforming bureaucratic hurdles that prevented certain

spaces from being repurposed or built upon. CityScope helped identify

and prioritize those reforms, but without them, the remainder of its

functions would have been futile. While AI can streamline processes

and help us make better decisions together, only with the right

leadership can these tools translate into collective action.

Nevertheless, tools which combine sophisticated simulations with

direct engagement can change how we make decisions in all kinds of

## institutions—cities, but also corporations, universities, or non-proﬁts.

Platforms like AnyLogic, FlexSim, and Visual Components are already

developing similar tools for corporations, a trend that is likely to

accelerate in the years to come. Far from a substitute for human

decision-making, these platforms will oﬀer a powerful complement to

it: a way to harness data at the service of common goals.
