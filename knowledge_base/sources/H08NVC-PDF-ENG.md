Employee mental health challenges affect companies worldwide. Due

to reduced productivity linked to anxiety and depression, for example,

a total of 12 billion working days are lost globally every year. A recent

survey with HR professionals across 10 Asian countries found that 82%

of employees in this region still have signiﬁcant mental strain. And

across the ocean, UK employers still lose GBP 51 billion annually to poor

mental health, with nearly half stemming from presenteeism, where

employees are at work but are not fully functioning.

The stakes are particularly high for large multinational companies

that operate across diﬀerent regions. Not only are their organizational

## structures more complex, but their well-being strategies and programs

must cater to a wide cross-section of global workers with diﬀerent

## ethnic backgrounds, beliefs, value systems, attitudes about mental

# health, and more.

Despite real money spent on interventions from wellness apps to counseling services, chief human resources oﬃcers, regional heads of

people and culture, and well-being leads at several multinationals have

told me they’re not seeing enough uptake by their employees. In fact,

some workplace mental health initiatives and trainings suﬀer from such

low engagement that companies wind up not expanding or continuing

them at all, and initial energy spent on the programs goes down the

# drain.

What’s stopping these companies’ mental health initiatives from

engaging employees and creating real change?

My consulting experience with over 60 global and regional

organizations has led me to conclude that the main pitfalls for mental

health initiatives across cultures tend to be about three things.

First, many HR oﬃcers mistakenly attribute initiative failures to local

cultural norms and stigma, assuming that individuals in some locations

are simply unwilling to discuss mental health when, in fact, there’s

another underlying issue at play. Second, when stigma does come into

play, they wrongfully assume that silence and disengagement mean that

attitudes of particular groups of employees are unchangeable.

Finally, while the importance of mental health at work is more widely

accepted today, many HR leaders fail to thoroughly strategize or

plan initiatives that suit the companies’ employees across the world,

expecting one-oﬀ events to magically change mindsets and behaviors

# overnight.

Fortunately, I have also observed leaders who have successfully

navigated all three traps using the strategies I describe in this article.

Their results include enhanced employee engagement, increased

awareness of mental health issues at diﬀerent levels of the organization,

and a more eﬀective use of company resources, which contributes to

an organizational culture that prioritizes well-being. Most importantly,

these eﬀorts go beyond organizational beneﬁts and support employees

who may experience mental health challenges in a variety of diﬀerent

# ways.

## Have an Open Mind and Question Assumptions

The ﬁrst issue that trips up companies is misreading the underlying

reason for a mental health initiative’s failure. This happens because, rightly, multinationals need to be sensitive to local cultures of oﬃces in

## diﬀerent countries. Sometimes, however, this well-intentioned mindset

can mask the other, more surprising root causes.

## For example, a major ﬁnance institution’s HR director for the Asia-

Paciﬁc region was nervous about hosting a lunchtime talk about mental

health. “Asians don’t talk about mental health, because it is a private

matter,” she remembered being told by others in the region. Plus, being

Asian herself, she had been socialized for a long time to not talk about

such “shameful” topics, so was sensitive to the broader context around

the stereotype. But she wanted to encourage colleagues to think about

mental health as she knew it was important.

Her team did lots of internal communications promoting the session,

but only 50 people showed up (they had hoped for 150). During the

event, no one said much, and the atmosphere was tense, despite the

# great food and free coﬀee.

Her initial assumption was to regard the event as unsuccessful and

interpret it as evidence that discussions on mental health were

unwelcome in that local culture. In some organizations I have

collaborated with, which encountered similar situations, future mental

health initiative budgets were reduced, purportedly out of respect for

# local cultural norms.

However, this HR director decided to dig deeper and discovered that

the issue wasn’t cultural at all. In fact, there had been prior breaches of conﬁdentiality around the topic at this oﬃce. Although these breaches

were unintentional and certain colleagues just wanted to help, it made

people feel that their privacy and boundaries were not respected, and

they started to doubt whether they could really talk openly to their

## managers and HR teams about such sensitive issues.

After learning this, the HR director altered her approach to focus

on conﬁdentiality training ﬁrst, highlighting the distinctions between

assistance, privacy, and gossip. The director spent a whole year building

awareness around respecting others’ private matters. Consequently, employees in her regional oﬃce became more willing to talk about

## mental health with each other and their managers, and the utilization

rate of the organization’s counselling hotlines also went up.

In this case, blaming culture for why people avoid discussing mental

health at work was an overly simplistic assumption. By fostering strong

trust and respect for privacy, mental health didn’t have to be a taboo

# topic at this workplace.

## Engage Different Mindsets with Creativity

Sometimes, of course, cultural stigma around mental health issues does

play a role in low uptake. But the trap is in assuming that stereotypes

are accurate in all circumstances and giving up prematurely when

encountering resistance based on them. Instead, companies can use the

knowledge of the stigma as a springboard to try out other methods of

engaging with mental health issues.

Two case studies demonstrate indirect but eﬀective methods to address

# this issue.

First, consider a global consulting ﬁrm’s UK oﬃce. The oﬃce’s well-

being lead realized that majority of its senior management belonged

to a generation and gender group that found it challenging to discuss

mental health, both in and outside of work. They were taught that

mental health and stress were not topics to be discussed with anyone

else, and that they simply had to “tough it out.” Yet, in reality, they

still needed outlets to open up during hard times, as accessing and

articulating emotions is a pivotal way to process experiences, reduce

stress, and maintain mental well-being.

Recognizing the importance of encouraging the senior leaders to

## express themselves and their emotions in a comfortable way, this

organization created close-door, small-group activities for these leaders

to meet and share, as opposed to open-invitation company-wide events

and talks commonly used by many multinationals to save cost. In

small groups, the leaders were encouraged to reﬂect on the challenges

managing the organization, using art materials such as plasticine or toy

bricks to make a structure that represented their sentiments. They then

shared what they had built with each other. Through the practice, these

senior leaders were able to “see” their emotional experiences through

the object they had built. Feeling less threatened or confronted, they

could speak more freely about the anxieties in their roles, and better

cope with them without directly talking about burnout or being forced

to sit through a lecture of theories on stress.

Similarly, a global bank’s Northern China oﬃce found a creative way to

engage its local executives in mental health practices. They focused on a common challenge faced by the leaders: parenting. The oﬃce organized

a series of workshop for leaders on how to speak with their children

about emotions as part of the program design. As they practiced with

their children, the barriers to expressing themselves lowered. The

executives started to check in with their peers and their team members

without feeling that doing so would make them any less of a “strong

leader.” These conversations built a sense of camaraderie, more open

dialogue between leaders and their employees, and allowed HR to tune

## into vulnerabilities and indistinct calls for help.

The takeaway: It takes creativity to engage groups with diﬀerent

mindsets and attitudes toward mental health. As such, multinationals

cannot just do one global roll-out. While they may be able to use

## something general as a base, like a subscription to well-being apps, HR

leaders need to make the program relevant and concrete to the target

audience’s demographics and localities to truly change mindsets.

## Prioritize Strategic Planning from the Outset

This relates to the most common, and perhaps most detrimental,

pitfall I observe in multinational companies: the hasty implementation

## of mental health initiatives or interventions without thorough

strategic planning about how they will be adapted globally. Without

understanding the diﬀerent “end users,” any product or program,

however well-designed, will not ﬁt their needs or solve the problems

that hinder progress. Worse, this wastes company resources and

people’s energy, leading to exasperation and exhaustion.

To avoid a low return on their investment, multinationals must have

a comprehensive understanding of employees’ diverse needs and lived

experiences related to mental health.

This was the challenge faced by a multinational investment institution

that employs over 50 diﬀerent nationalities. Instead of just copying best

practices from other banks, the institution decided to take a customized

path for its mental health initiative. It surveyed and interviewed representative employees from a variety of roles, positions, oﬃces, ages,

and language spoken to understand the varying levels of awareness and

# experiences of mental health.

The result was workshops customized to three groups of audiences. For

## individuals with prior knowledge of mental health information, they

could attend focused discussions using case studies created from actual

in-house issues to support the goal of changing mindsets and behaviors

around mental health. Those with limited awareness of mental health

were able to join sessions with more introductory content aimed to shift

attitudes ﬁrst.

Meanwhile, managers received additional training speciﬁc to their

roles and responsibilities around supporting employee mental health—

without needing to become everyone’s therapist. During the training

session, facilitators led participants through exercises based on real

## experiences from interviews with managers and employees. Through

targeted questions and debrief sessions, participants gained knowledge

and skills on best practices. As a result, managers learned how to

support team members struggling to cope and understood where their

duty of care began and ended. This training made them more adept

(and proactive) at addressing mental health matters at the workplace.

By listening to the diﬀerent voices of employees, the HR leaders

at this institution created increased mental health awareness, from

## employees and frontline managers to senior management and board-

level executives. Such awareness generated demand for an in-house

## counselor knowledgeable about the speciﬁc work environment of the

organization, and the institution ended up providing counseling service

to families of the employees as well. In a later survey, both employee

engagement and employee well-being scores increased. The workshops,

enriched with teaching materials and real examples accumulated

over the years, also became an essential part of the organization’s

onboarding.

. . .

## For multinationals, employee diﬀerences in mental health awareness

and experiences don’t need to hinder the development of successful

initiatives. Instead, they can be the catalyst for planning impactful

## programs with high returns on investment, especially if the programs

are relatable to the employees’ direct experiences. Just as multinational

companies would approach any new product launch or business

implementation, they should invest time in understanding their

employees’ well-being needs and experiences, plan tiered mental

health programs, and consider incorporating mental health awareness

workshops into onboarding processes—because employees are their

# greatest assets.
