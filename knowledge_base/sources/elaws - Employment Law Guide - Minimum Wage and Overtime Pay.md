# Fair Labor Standards Act of 1938 (FLSA)(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/statutes/FairLaborStandAct.pdf), as

amended

(29 USC §201 et seq(http://www4.law.cornell.edu/uscode/29/201.html).; 29 CFR Parts 510 to

## 794(https://www.dol.gov/dol/cfr/Title_29/Chapter_V.htm))

Who is Covered

# The Fair Labor Standards Act (FLSA or Act) is administered by the Wage and Hour Division (WHD). The Act

# establishes standards for minimum wages, overtime pay, recordkeeping, and child labor. These standards

aﬀect more than 135 million workers, both full time and part time, in the private and public sectors.

The Act covers enterprises with employees who engage in interstate commerce, produce goods for interstate

commerce, or handle, sell, or work on goods or materials that have been moved in or produced for interstate

commerce. For most ﬁrms, a threshold of $500,000 in annual dollar volume of business applies to be covered

(i.e., the Act does not cover enterprises with less than this amount of business).

In addition, the Act covers the following regardless of their dollar volume of business: hospitals; institutions primarily engaged in the care of the sick, aged, mentally ill, or disabled who reside on the premises; schools

for children who are mentally or physically disabled or gifted; preschools, elementary and secondary schools,

# and institutions of higher education; and Federal, state, and local government agencies.

Employees of ﬁrms that do not meet the $500,000 annual dollar volume threshold may be covered in any

workweek when they are individually engaged in interstate commerce, the production of goods for interstate commerce, or an activity that is closely related and directly essential to the production of such goods.

In addition, the Act covers domestic service employees, such as housekeepers, cooks, gardeners, nurses, or

home health aides, if they work in a private home. These employees are subject to the minimum wage and

overtime provisions if they receive at least $2,200 in 2020 from one employer in a calendar year, or if they work

a total of more than eight hours a week for one or more employers. (This calendar year wage threshold is set by the Social Security Administration each year, and can be found at

https://www.ssa.gov/oact/cola/CovThresh.html). For additional coverage information, see the Wage and Hour

## Division Fact Sheet #14: Coverage Under the FLSA .

The Act exempts some employees from its overtime pay and minimum wage provisions, and it also exempts

certain employees from the overtime pay provisions only. Because the exemptions are narrowly deﬁned, employers should check the exact terms and conditions for any applicable exemption by contacting their local

# Wage and Hour Division oﬃce.

The following are examples of employees exempt from both the minimum wage and overtime pay

# requirements:

Executive, administrative, and professional employees (including teachers and academic administrative personnel in elementary and secondary schools), outside sales employees, and certain skilled computer

professionals (as deﬁned in the Department of Labor's regulations)

## Employees of certain seasonal amusement or recreational establishments

# Employees of certain small newspapers and switchboard operators of small telephone companies

Seamen employed on foreign vessels Employees engaged in ﬁshing operations

Employees engaged in newspaper delivery

Farm workers employed on small farms (i.e., those that used less than 500 "man days" of farm labor in any

calendar quarter of the preceding calendar year) Casual babysitters

# Persons employed solely by the individual receiving services (not an agency, non-proﬁt, or other third party

# employer) primarily providing fellowship and protection (companionship services) to seniors and/or

## individuals with injuries, illnesses, or disabilities

The following are examples of employees exempt from the overtime pay requirements only:

Certain commissioned employees of retail or service establishments

Auto, truck, trailer, farm implement, boat, or aircraft salespersons employed by non manufacturing

establishments primarily engaged in selling these items to ultimate purchasers

Auto, truck, or farm implement parts clerks and mechanics employed by non-manufacturing establishments primarily engaged in selling these items to ultimate purchasers

Railroad and air carrier employees, taxi drivers, certain employees of motor carriers, seamen on American

vessels, and local delivery employees paid on approved trip rate plans

Announcers, news editors, and chief engineers of certain non metropolitan broadcasting stations

Domestic service employees solely employed by the individual, family, or household receiving services (not an agency or other third party employer) who reside in the private home where they provide services

# Employees of motion picture theaters

# Farmworkers

Certain employees may be partially exempt from the overtime pay requirements. These include:

Employees engaged in certain operations on agricultural commodities and employees of certain bulk petroleum distributors

Employees of hospitals and residential care establishments that have agreements with the employees that

they will work 14 day periods in lieu of 7 day workweeks (if the employees are paid overtime premium pay

as required by the Act for all hours worked over eight in a day or 80 in the 14 day work period, whichever is

the greater number of overtime hours) Employees who lack a high school diploma, or who have not completed the eighth grade, who spend part

of their workweeks in remedial reading or training in other basic skills that are not job speciﬁc. Employers

may require such employees to engage in these activities up to 10 hours in a workweek. Employers must

pay regular wages for the hours spent in such training but need not pay overtime premium pay for training

# hours

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The Act requires employers of covered employees who are not otherwise exempt to pay these employees a

minimum wage of not less than $7.25 per hour. Youths under 20 years of age may be paid a minimum wage of

not less than $4.25 per hour during the ﬁrst 90 consecutive calendar days of employment with an employer. Employers may not displace any employee to hire someone at the youth minimum wage. For additional

information regarding the use of the youth minimum wage provisions, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact

# Sheet #32: Youth Minimum Wage - FLSA.

Employers may pay employees on a piece rate basis, as long as they receive at least the equivalent of the required minimum hourly wage rate and overtime for hours worked in excess of 40 hours in a workweek.

Employers of tipped employees (i.e., those who customarily and regularly receive more than $30 a month in

# tips) may consider such tips as part of their wages, but employers must pay a direct wage of at least $2.13

# per hour if they claim a tip credit. They must also meet certain other requirements. For a full listing of the

requirements an employer must meet to use the tip credit provision, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #15: Tipped Employees Under the FLSA.

The Act also permits the employment of certain individuals at wage rates below the statutory minimum wage

under certiﬁcates issued by the Department of Labor:

## Student learners (vocational education students);

Full time students in retail or service establishments, agriculture, or institutions of higher education; and Individuals whose earning or productive capacities for the work to be performed are impaired by physical or

mental disabilities, including those related to age or injury.

The Act does not limit either the number of hours in a day or the number of days in a week that an employer

may require an employee to work, as long as the employee is at least 16 years old. Similarly, the Act does not

limit the number of hours of overtime that may be scheduled. However, the Act requires employers to pay covered employees not less than one and one half times their regular rate of pay for all hours worked in

excess of 40 in a workweek, unless the employees are otherwise exempt. For additional information regarding

overtime pay requirements, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #23: Overtime Pay Requirements of

# the FLSA.

The Act prohibits performance of certain types of work in an employee's home unless the employer has obtained prior certiﬁcation from the Department of Labor. Restrictions apply in the manufacture of knitted

outerwear, gloves and mittens, buttons and buckles, handkerchiefs, embroideries, and jewelry (where safety

and health hazards are not involved). Employers wishing to employ homeworkers in these industries are

required to provide written assurances to the Department of Labor that they will comply with the Act's wage

## and hour requirements, among other things.

The Act generally prohibits manufacture of women's apparel (and jewelry under hazardous conditions) in the

home except under special certiﬁcates that may be issued when the employee cannot adjust to factory work

because of age or disability (physical or mental), or must care for a disabled individual in the home.

Special wage and hour provisions apply to state and local government employment. For more information

regarding these special provisions, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact Sheet #7: State and Local Governments Under the FLSA.

# Employee Rights

Employees may ﬁnd out how to ﬁle a complaint by contacting the local Wage and Hour Division

oﬃce(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/contact/local-oﬃces), or by calling the program's toll-free help line at 1- 866-4-US-WAGE (1-866-487-9243). In addition, an employee may ﬁle a private suit, generally for the previous

two years of back pay (three years in the case of a willful violation) and an equal amount as liquidated

## damages, plus attorney's fees and court costs.

# It is a violation of the Act to ﬁre or in any other manner discriminate against an employee for ﬁling a complaint

# with an employer or the Wage and Hour Division or for participating in a legal proceeding under the Act.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Every employer of employees subject to the FLSA's minimum wage provisions must post, and keep posted, a

notice(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm) explaining the Act in a conspicuous place in all of their establishments. Although there is no size requirement for the poster, employees must be able to

readily read it. The FLSA poster is also available in

Spanish(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsaspan.htm),

Chinese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwagecn.pdf),

Russian(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/FLSAPosterRuss.pdf), Thai, (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageThai.pdf) Hmong,

## (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/MinWageHmong.pdf)

## Vietnamese(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageViet.pdf), and

Korean(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/minwageKorean.pdf). There is no requirement to post the

poster in languages other than English(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm).

Covered employers are required to post the general Fair Labor Standards Act poster. However, certain

industries have posters designed speciﬁcally for them. Employers of Agricultural Employees (PDF)

# (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/wh1386Agrcltr.pdf) and State & Local Government Employees

(PDF)(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/wh1385State.pdf) can either post the general Fair Labor

Standards Act poster(https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/ﬂsa.htm) or their speciﬁc industry poster. There are also posters for American Samoa (PDF)

# (https://www.dol.gov/whd/minwage/americanSamoa/ASminwagePoster.pdf) and Northern Mariana Islands (PDF)

## (https://www.dol.gov/whd/regs/compliance/posters/cnmi.pdf).

Every employer who employs workers with disabilities under special minimum wage certiﬁcates is also

required to post the Employee Rights for Workers with Disabilities/Special Minimum Wage Poster(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/whd/posters/section-14c).

Every employer covered by the FLSA must keep certain records for each of its covered employees. Employers

must keep records on wages, hours, and other information as set forth in the Department of Labor's regulations. Most of this data is the type that employers generally maintain in ordinary business practice.

There is no required form for the records. However, the records must include accurate information about the

employee and data about the hours worked and the wages earned. The following is a listing of the basic

payroll records that an employer must maintain:

Employee's full name, as used for Social Security purposes, and on the same record, the employee's

identifying symbol or number if such is used in place of name on any time, work, or payroll records

# Address, including zip code

# Birth date, if younger than 19

## Sex and occupation Time and day of week when employee's workweek begins

Total wages paid each pay period

Date of payment and the pay period covered by the payment

The following is a listing of some additional information that an employer must maintain unless the employee

is an executive, administrative, or professional employee (including teachers and academic administrative personnel in elementary and secondary schools) or outside sales employee who is exempt from the Act's

# minimum wage and overtime requirements:

Hours worked each day and total hours worked each workweek

Basis on which employee's wages are paid (e.g., "$9 per hour", "$440 a week", "piecework")

## Regular hourly pay rate Total daily or weekly straight-time earnings

# Total overtime earnings for the workweek

## All additions to or deductions from the employee's wages

For a full listing of the basic records that an employer must maintain, see the Wage and Hour Division Fact

Sheet #21: Recordkeeping Requirements Under the FLSA. Employers are required to preserve for at least three years payroll records, collective bargaining agreements, and sales and purchase records. Records on

which wage computations are based should be retained for two years. These include time cards and

piecework tickets, wage rate tables, work and time schedules, and records of additions to or deductions from

# wages.

# Reporting

The FLSA does not contain any speciﬁc reporting requirements; however, the above referenced records must

be open for inspection by the Wage and Hour Division's representatives, who may ask the employer to make

extensions, computations, or transcriptions. The records may be kept at the place of employment or in a

# central records oﬃce.

# Penalties/Sanctions

In addition to the rights and remedies available to persons through private suits for violations of the Act, the

Department of Labor uses a variety of remedies to enforce compliance with the Act's requirements. When

Wage and Hour Division investigators encounter violations, they recommend changes in employment practices to bring the employer into compliance, and they request the payment of any back wages due to

# employees.

Willful violators may be prosecuted criminally and ﬁned up to $10,000. A second conviction may result in

imprisonment. Employers who willfully or repeatedly violate the minimum wage or overtime pay requirements are subject to civil money penalties for each violation.

# For child labor violations, employers are subject to a civil money penalty for each violation. In addition,

# employers are subject to a civil money penalty for each violation that causes the death or serious injury of any

minor employee - such penalty may be doubled when the violations are determined to be willful or repeated.

When the Department of Labor assesses a civil money penalty, the employer has the right to ﬁle an exception

to the determination within 15 days of receipt of the notice. If an exception is ﬁled, it is referred to an

Administrative Law Judge for a hearing and determination as to whether the penalty is appropriate. If an

exception is not ﬁled, the penalty becomes ﬁnal.

The Department of Labor may also bring suit for back pay and an equal amount in liquidated damages, and it may obtain injunctions to restrain persons from violating the Act.

The Act also prohibits the shipment of goods in interstate commerce that were produced in violation of the

minimum wage, overtime pay, child labor, or special minimum wage provisions. The Department of Labor may

seek to enjoin such shipments.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

State laws on wages and hours also apply to employment subject to this Act. When both this Act and a state

law apply, the law setting the higher standards must be observed. For example, if a state law requires a

minimum wage higher than the minimum wage required by the Act, the employer must pay the higher

# minimum wage.
