Time off gives us much-needed space to slow down and zoom out.

Ideally, we return to work ready to reﬂect on our career progress with a

renewed focus on our professional development; however, the pressures

of our day jobs can lead us to abandon our good intentions and stall our

# development.

Engaging in a post-summer reset can help you gain motivation and

build momentum for your professional development. The idea is to

identify actions that will kick-start your learning in a way that’s easy to

add into your day. Here are four ways to get there.

- 1. Set a growth goal

You’re likely used to having performance goals at work. These goals tend

to be set by or in conjunction with your manager and focus on your

day-to-day deliverables. At most organizations, it’s less likely that you’re

setting similar goals for your professional growth.

Growth goals focus on the strengths you want to stretch or the skills

you’d like to learn. You don’t need someone else to deﬁne them for you

or give you permission to get started. However, sharing your growth goal

with your manager and colleagues makes it easier for them to support

you and spot opportunities you might not see for yourself.

To create a growth goal, ask yourself the following questions:

- What do I want to be known for, and how can I use that skill/strength

# more?

- What do I want to be true about my impact in three months’ time?

- Who am I learning from?

- What haven’t I done before that I would like to try out?

- What am I curious to learn more about?

Here are a few example growth goals:

- To lead my ﬁrst global project in the next six months

- To improve my presentation skills and use them in more situations

- To develop my coaching capability and use it to support my colleagues

- 2. Connect with a learning community

It’s much easier to prioritize your development when you’re not trying

to do it on your own. When you learn with other people, not only are you

more likely to stick to what you start, but the learning gain is more likely

to be retained.

Community learning is eﬃcient and eﬀective, which makes it a great

use of your time when you’re trying to ﬁt professional development into

your busy workweek. A learning community is simply a small group of

people who are connected by their curiosity and shared interest in a

speciﬁc topic. For example, it could be a group of people who want to

learn about design thinking or who want to develop management skills.

There’s no limit to what a group can learn about, and if one doesn’t

exist for your area of interest, you can easily start one from scratch. For

# example:

- Book clubs or “podsquads,” where people who share an interest in the

same topic read or listen together

- Technical communities of practice for people who want to learn and

# experiment with new tools and systems

- Career clubs for peers who discuss their development goals and help

each other achieve them

- 3. Start a skill sprint

Skill sprints create a short-term focus for your development and feel

easy and motivating to do. Completing a skill sprint gives you a sense

of achievement that keeps you committed to your career development, even when the demands of your day job pull you in a diﬀerent direction.

A ﬁve-day skill sprint is a good way to get started. First, pick a skill

you want to learn more about. (For inspiration, look at the top skills for

work shared by the World Economic Forum.) Then use the sprint plan

below to design your daily focus. Reserving just 15 minutes a day on

your schedule helps make the sprint an unmissable moment.

Consider this example plan:

- Day 1, Learning landscape: Use search and ChatGPT to ﬁnd out

key facts, thought leaders, and available research on the skill you’re

focusing on.

- Day 2, Expert insight: Pick an expert in the area and dive deeper into

their work. Look at their posts on LinkedIn, listen to their perspective

on a podcast, and watch what they have to say on video.

- Day 3, Put it into practice: Try out a tool or test an idea you’ve read

about in your research. Get some feedback from your colleagues to

understand how useful it was.

- Day 4, Ask for help: Find someone in your organization who’s good at

what you want to learn. Get in touch with them, share your insights,

and ask for their advice about what else you could do.

- Day 5, Capture your learning: The last day of the sprint is for

reﬂection. Ask yourself: What have I learned? How might I apply it

at work? How else might I want to develop in this area?

- 4. Increase your feedback frequency

Feedback is one of the quickest ways you can learn about your impact.

The more comfortable you are asking the people you work with for their

thoughts, the more insights you’ll accumulate and the more informed

you can be about your development.

An easy way to increase your feedback frequency is to ask the same question to several diﬀerent people. Comparing and contrasting

their responses helps you see where you are (or aren’t) showing up

consistently at work. The more consistent you are with your impact, the

stronger your brand will be.

Consider these feedback questions:

- What three words would you use to describe me at my best?

- Where do I have the biggest impact in my work?

- What one piece of advice would you share with me to increase my

# inﬂuence?

. . .

Using this moment in time to reset your approach to development can

create new energy for your career. Instead of feeling like another thing

to ﬁt in, it can be a new source of motivation that supports everything

else you’re trying to do.
