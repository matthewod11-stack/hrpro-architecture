Trying to predict what the future will look like is doomed to fail. Yet this

is what most executives do when they strategize. They — we — do this

because we have been trained and educated to use trends and statistics

to predict what is likely to happen and prepare accordingly. As a result,

companies struggle to react to changes in their environments when

they should be shaping them proactively. This is an issue for executives

around the globe whose strategizing, anchored in the past, misses out

## on important opportunities to envision, and design, possible futures.

## HBR / Digital Article / Using Fiction to Find Your Strategy

Over the past seven years in working with about 50 executive teams

around the world, we’ve been experimenting with an alternative

approach to strategy: design fiction. Design fiction is a technique that

immerses executives and employees deeply in various possible futures,

and uses artifacts such as short movies, fictitious newspaper articles,

and imaginary commercials to generate transformation roadmaps.

Rooted in the future but helping to act in the present, design fiction

results in concrete actions taken to adjust companies’ visions, strategies,

and activities to create a better future.

Unlike many strategic foresight tools, design fiction does not attempt

to identify what is more likely to happen. Nor does it limit strategy

conversations to the C-suite; in fact a core component is the

participation of a wide range of stakeholders. Consequently, the teams

that we’ve seen deploy design fiction are able to formulate and shape

desirable futures that other tools do not enable people to see.

# How We Use It

The first step of putting design fiction into practice involves crafting

scenarios of possible futures. For example, in a project with a major

car insurance company, we analyzed information from urban mobility

trends, autopilot flight modes, Luc Besson’s notorious movie The Fifth

Element, and interviews with early electric car adopters to develop

scenarios of possible futures. These atypical data sources help spotlight

less obvious aspects that would otherwise remain unnoticed in the

strategizing process. In this example, from talking to an airline pilot

we understood how the risks will be shifting in an autonomous driving

ecosystem. Bumper shocks and losing control of the vehicle will not

happen anymore, but new risks such as system hacking and break down

of vital sensors will arise.

Akin to strategic foresight tools, we do analyze current trends and

weak signals, but importantly, we also leverage the best design tools by

## building on analogous situations, science fiction inspiration, interviews

with extreme users and other stakeholders. Typically, we also interview

employees to understand which possible developments have (not) been

considered by the company. We ask questions such as “What has been

the biggest failure you’ve seen in the company?” and “What could kill

# the company?”

From this data we craft a mix of scenarios which depict different

versions of the future. For example, by talking to employees of a major

fragrance brand, we identified the limiting belief that the company’s

sales would forever be driven by the end of the year season, as it has

always been since the creation of the brand more than a century ago.

Using this information, we crafted a “Christmas is over” scenario in

which sales seasons were spread out over the year.

Next, we run immersive workshops in which we discuss three or four

## of these scenarios with employees from all areas and levels of the

company. The participation of a wide group of individuals helps expand

strategizing to certain stakeholders, such as frontline employees, who

can contribute different and necessary perspectives as well as identify

opportunities to seize. In small groups, we help them reflect on the role

that their companies could play in these scenarios of possible futures

and how to provoke the conditions for a more desirable future. Design

fictions emerge from these discussions. They describe new missions

and visions for companies and how to get there. In the project we

conducted with the car insurance company, this part of the design

fiction process triggered a change in the mission of the company from

insuring cars against damages to enabling individual journeys with

all mobility means. Workshops with the fragrance brand around the

“Christmas is over” scenario generated a new mission that was more

inclusive by focusing on events such as Black History Month and Pride

Day. While discussing how to get there, the company also realized that

its targeting strategy would be much more accurate as a result.

Finally, we use the design fictions to design shareable artifacts (e.g.,

short movies, fictitious newspaper articles) which can be considered as

a prototype of the companies’ future. From these artifacts, a roadmap

of strategic transformation is created. For instance, a design fiction

project with a large construction company ended up shifting their

innovation strategy after they invented a future in which 3D printing

made building construction carbon-emission free. The transformation

roadmap included areas of 3D printing to focus on and investments

needed to shape this desirable future.

# Inventing the Future

Design fiction has helped dozens of multinational companies to

strategize differently. And while creating fictional futures may sound a

little quirky, we know that it works. For example, a recent design-fiction

project conducted with a major oil and gas company helped identify

how to shape a future in which people living in remote areas were

less socially isolated. The company decided to repurpose gas stations

into places galvanizing community through services such as car sharing

## hubs, medical centers, delivery platforms, and ghost kitchens. Although

company executives had engaged in various strategizing and foresight

exercises in the past, only design fiction enabled them to envision this

# possible version of the future.

It’s not always easy. Using design fiction successfully requires

executives to be creative and open to all possibilities. Yet as much as

design fiction helps bring back imagination in the strategizing process,

executives can be resistant to it. By force of habit, most executives tune

down their imagination when strategizing and it is challenging for them

to do otherwise. To work past that, we remind them that they are the

ones in charge, that they are the ones with the power to shape a more

desirable future, and that they have the responsibility to do so. After all,

you can’t predict the future, you can only invent it.
