In an increasingly data-driven world, many companies, including

Adobe, Morgan Stanley, and Goldman Sachs, have made the surprising

move to do away with number-based performance reviews. Some have

opted for more open-ended, narrative-based performance evaluations,

while others have eliminated reviews completely, conducting regular

## “check-ins” instead. The argument for the shift away from numerical

reviews is strong: narrative performance reviews allow for more context and can better oﬀer employees ways to improve while aﬃrming

their particular strengths. At the same time, some companies who’ve

eliminated numerical reviews have reverted to creating “shadow”

rankings, where narrative feedback is oﬀered to employees, but internal

numbers are used in order to track growth or to have a more objective

way to tie performance to bonuses or raises. This can leave employees

feeling like they’re being secretly judged in ways they can’t ﬁght or

# speak to.

So how should companies conduct performance reviews? Do employees

actually ﬁnd narrative structures to be more encouraging and

motivating? Are there some circumstances where employees prefer

# numerical reviews?

In new research, published in the Academy of Management Discoveries,

we conducted a series of studies to determine which feedback format

employees ﬁnd most fair and motivating. While our ﬁndings suggest

that narrative feedback is often the most well-perceived, we also

found that there are circumstances in which numerical reviews are

considered equally fair by employees — including when they are used

determine monetary incentives, like bonuses. We plumb our ﬁndings to

oﬀer considerations for organizations and managers looking to fairly

and accurately motivate, encourage, and improve engagement and

# performance on their team.

## How Employees View Performance Review Formats

Much research has been conducted on how diﬀerent formats

of performance review impact organizational growth. But to our

knowledge no studies, until now, have looked at how employees view

# these feedback formats.

To determine how diﬀerent forms of feedback impact employees’

perceptions of fairness as well as their motivation to improve, we

ran four experiments, using online crowdsourcing platforms to recruit

## about 1,600 U.S. participants with work experience.

In some experiments, we gave participants hypothetical jobs,

responsibilities, and yearly accomplishments and then showed them

their manager’s review of their performance from the year. Some

participants received numerical feedback, some narrative, and some a

combination of the two. We then probed which of these was considered

the most fair, which gave them a sense of how to improve, which

provided greater motivation to do better, and more. We also ran studies

to determine if these perceptions changed when reviews were positive

or more negative or whether they were tied to monetary gains, like

bonuses. Finally, we ran an experiment asking participants to actually

complete a task — providing customer support to a complaining client

at a made-up furniture company — and gave them feedback in one of

the three formats based on their performance.

Here are our key ﬁndings:

Narrative feedback is perceived as the fairest. Across our experiments,

narrative-only feedback was consistently rated as the fairest among

the three formats tested. Employees responded positively to the

detailed, contextual information provided in narrative feedback, which

often included speciﬁc examples of behaviors and actions linked to

performance outcomes. This format allowed supervisors to convey

not just what was achieved but how it was achieved, enabling

## a deeper understanding and appreciation of the feedback among

## employees, without the distraction of numbers. Importantly, narrative-

only feedback was seen as less arbitrary, and the employees likely

viewed it as more reﬂective of the entire performance spectrum,

addressing both strengths and developmental areas in a balanced

# manner.

We found that when feedback included numbers, showing room for

improvement — in both numerical-only and combined formats —

people seemed to assume that the manager was unfairly focusing

on their negative aspects. This was true even when the content of

the feedback in the combined format was the same as that given to

the narrative-only feedback group. In these instances, narrative-only

recipients did not seem to ﬁnd the content unfairly focused on the

negative. Employees who received the narrative-only feedback likely

thought it was the most fair because they felt the least negatively

evaluated by it.

A narrative component is essential to motivate employees. We

also found that the motivational impact of narrative feedback was

substantial. Employees reported having more understanding of how

to improve and reported feeling more inspired and driven to improve

when feedback included narrative elements than when it did not. This

may be because narrative feedback not only evaluates past performance

but can also be used to set future goals and development paths. It

helps employees visualize their growth trajectory and understand the

practical steps needed for advancement. Because narrative feedback

is often perceived as fairer than numerical ratings, it can serve as

## positive reinforcement for employees whose morale and engagement

are inﬂuenced by perceptions of fairness, thereby strengthening their

## commitment to both personal and organizational goals.

There are exceptions. While narrative-only feedback typically enhances

perceptions of fairness, our experiments revealed that its eﬀectiveness

is not uniform across all scenarios. In one study, we explored how the

valence of feedback — whether it is highly positive or more negative —

aﬀects employees’ responses to diﬀerent feedback formats. Our ﬁndings

revealed that the superiority of narrative-only feedback in fostering

perceived fairness diminishes with extremely positive feedback. This

## suggests that employees may value narrative-only feedback more when

there is ambiguity about their performance levels, as it provides a

richer, more nuanced evaluation that can soften the blow of negative

assessments. When feedback is overwhelmingly positive, such as when

an employee achieves the highest performance ratings, the format

is less inﬂuential. Employees respond well to very positive feedback

regardless of whether the feedback is numerical, narrative, or a

combination of the two, since the positive outcome is clear and there

is little room for interpretation.

In another experiment, we investigated how knowledge of monetary

outcomes, like bonus amounts, inﬂuences reactions to feedback

formats. Initially, employees who received narrative feedback perceived

their evaluations as fairer and more positive than those who received

numerical or combined feedback. Yet, once employees were informed of

their speciﬁc bonus amounts, perceptions of fairness became similar

across all feedback formats. Being informed of tangible outcomes

clariﬁed the implications of the feedback, leading to more uniform

perceptions of fairness across all formats. In other words, while

narrative feedback can initially be perceived as more favorable, such

perceptions may diminish once concrete outcomes are revealed,

leveling the playing ﬁeld between diﬀerent feedback types.

# Lessons for Organizations

Our ﬁndings suggest that feedback format inﬂuences employees’

responses to feedback in a variety of ways. Diﬀerent feedback

formats oﬀer varying levels of detail. Narrative feedback does a better

job of explaining the context and providing personalized insights

that can clarify performance expectations and enhance employees’

## understanding of the rationale behind their feedback. Numerical

feedback, on the other hand, may be seen as providing more direct

information about relative performance and where someone fell short

of standards. Employees may also be highly focused on how feedback

## reﬂects their performance as either positive or negative, which can

aﬀect their perceptions of fairness and motivation. In light of our

ﬁndings, we suggest that organizations consider several key factors

when designing or improving their performance feedback practices.

Choosing a feedback format. Our research indicates that purely

numerical feedback without narrative components is not ideal. Even

mid-range numerical ratings can make employees feel negatively

evaluated and therefore are perceived as unfair by recipients. And the lack of context may make it diﬃcult for employees to understand how

to improve. Although replacing numerical feedback with a narrative

can be time-consuming or uncomfortable for managers, particularly

when describing negative aspects of an employee’s performance, it

provides crucial beneﬁts. Narrative-only feedback prevents employees

from feeling too negatively evaluated and therefore enhances their

perceptions of fairness, which are linked to, such as lower employee

turnover, higher job satisfaction, stronger organizational commitment,

## and greater displays of organizational citizenship behaviors.

Balancing feedback formats to meet organizational needs. Despite

the advantages of narrative-only feedback in enhancing fairness

perceptions, providing only narrative comments may not always be

practical. Organizations often need to link performance appraisals

to tangible outcomes like bonuses and promotions, which can be

challenging with narrative-only assessments. In cases where only narrative feedback is used, managers might resort to creating unoﬃcial

or “shadow” rankings to make decisions about organizational outcomes

which can lead to perceptions of unfairness due to a lack of

## transparency. The numerical–narrative combined approach caters to

a broader range of needs, enhancing transparency while providing

meaningful, actionable insights by accurately informing employees

where they stand. Many organizations have already adopted this

format, accompanying a performance score with a detailed commentary

explaining the reasons behind the rating. However, managers often

avoid writing detailed narratives, particularly for negative reviews, due

to the time-consuming and unpleasant nature of the task, resulting in

employees receiving only numerical feedback. If combination formats

are used, our research shows that managers must devote time and eﬀort

to delivering detailed and constructive narrative feedback to ensure

performance reviews are still seen as fair and motivating.

Building consensus and transparency. A critical element of

eﬀectively delivering performance feedback, regardless of its format,

is establishing a clear consensus on performance standards and

maintaining transparency throughout the process. This approach

ensures that employees can accept and engage with feedback

constructively, even when it’s negative. Many organizations facilitate

this through “People Sessions”— strategic meetings where leaders meet

and discuss employee performance, development, and potential. These

sessions ensure that decisions regarding promotions and compensation

are transparent and align with the company’s strategic goals. They

help set clear benchmarks among managers for what constitutes

high and low performance within the organization. Leaders can then

draw upon these strategic discussions to provide employees with a

## comprehensive understanding of the speciﬁc reasons behind their

feedback, pinpointing areas for improvement. This method enhances

both transparency and the perceived fairness of the feedback process,

fostering an organizational culture of open communication and

# continuous development.

Delivering negative performance feedback. Eﬀectively delivering

negative feedback is a pivotal part of helping your employees

understand how they can improve and grow. Though while employees

generally respond well to positive feedback regardless of how it’s

delivered, negative feedback can evoke resistance, defensiveness,

or even feelings of helplessness among employees. For managers,

presenting negative feedback can be challenging and uncomfortable.

## Luckily, feedback intervention theory (FIT) oﬀers valuable insights

into eﬀective delivery, suggesting that feedback should be speciﬁc

and behavior-focused, avoiding personal critiques that may trigger

defensiveness. FIT stresses the importance of aligning feedback with

an employee’s values and perspective to increase its receptivity and

eﬀectiveness. This alignment involves tailoring feedback to match

employees’ personal goals and values, thereby enhancing its relevance

and ensuring it is perceived as supportive and constructive rather than

punitive. It’s crucial to frame negative feedback as an opportunity for

growth and development to foster a forward-looking and constructive

dialogue that encourages continuous improvement and learning. Our

research shows that negative feedback may feel even more negative

when accompanied by numbers. Managers should consider this when

delivering negative feedback. Numerical ratings might be useful to

highlight areas for improvement but could also unintentionally amplify

criticism. The value of numbers thus depends on the message managers

wish to send.

Performance feedback is more than just a routine administrative task

— it’s a strategic tool that shapes organizational culture and employee

## engagement. Like many other management practices, feedback systems

— whether narrative or numeric — are never ﬂawless, even within

## leading organizations. However, performance management should not

be neglected simply because it is not perfect. Instead, it is crucial

to continually reﬁne performance management practices to assess

employees’ performance more holistically and make decisions that are

as fair and transparent as possible. In alignment with this perspective,

we support the recent trend of incorporating narrative components

into employee feedback, moving away from purely numeric ratings. As

organizations evolve, so too should their methods for evaluating and

communicating performance. By eﬀectively leveraging both numerical

and narrative feedback, companies can ensure they are not only

measuring performance accurately but also engaging and motivating

# their employees in meaningful ways.
