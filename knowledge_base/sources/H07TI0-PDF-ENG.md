Jobs today are changing fast, and traditional job descriptions can’t

keep up. As new technologies disrupt processes and require new skills,

and as companies are moving toward more and more project-based

work, we are beginning to see the evolution of job descriptions away

from static, holistic prescriptions that follow an employee for years to

dynamic guidance that changes based on needs.

## HBR / Digital Article / A New Approach to Writing Job Descriptions

For example, a company that hired an employee for a certain set of tasks

might ﬁnd that four months later, a diﬀerent set of tasks takes strategic

priority. Even though that employee has the right skills for the new

tasks, the employee can point to their job description to decline to do

the new task by saying that it wasn’t what they were hired to do — or, if

they take on the new tasks, their job description becomes quickly out of

# date.

Because most job descriptions are ﬁrmly embedded in the employee’s

core area of work, they also tend to encourage silos in the organization

by discouraging cross-functional collaboration. Rigid job descriptions

also discourage experimentation with new technologies that may have

been unimaginable at the time the description was written. And ﬁnally,

narrow job descriptions can mean that an employee isn’t able to fulﬁll

the full range of their talents at work, leaving them dissatisﬁed.

In response, companies are starting to approach job descriptions in new,

more ﬂexible ways based on outcomes, skills, and teams. I’ll describe

each of these in turn, but ﬁrst let’s look at how job descriptions came to

be what we know them as today, and what they do.

# Why Job Descriptions?

Modern job descriptions can be traced back to the industrial revolution.

As factories and other large organizations became more common, there

was a need to deﬁne roles and responsibilities more clearly to improve eﬃciency and productivity. This led to the creation of standardized job

titles and descriptions, which outlined each position’s tasks, duties, and

# requirements .

By the mid-20th century they became even more formalized and

detailed.

## HBR / Digital Article / A New Approach to Writing Job Descriptions

Today, job descriptions are used for several purposes:

- 1. Recruitment: They help prospective applicants understand whether

they would be a good ﬁt for the position by providing a clear outline

of what a role involves and what skills and qualiﬁcations are required.

- 2. Role clariﬁcation: They help clarify the responsibilities, tasks, and

expectations of a role, helping to avoid role ambiguity and conﬂict.

- 3. Performance management: They serve as a benchmark for

assessing employee performance.

- 4. HR management: They help plan employee development, set

compensation, and serve as legal documentation.

So how can job descriptions be made more ﬂexible but still address

# these needs?

# The More-Flexible Approaches

We’re seeing three new approaches taking hold as companies grapple

## with rapidly-changing, project-based roles.

# Outcome-focused role descriptions

Some companies are beginning to articulate the outcomes expected

from a role rather than the speciﬁc tasks or duties the employee is

required to perform. This approach provides ﬂexibility for the employee

to determine the best way to achieve those results, fostering innovation

and initiative and, importantly, allowing them to change their approach

# as conditions shift.

For instance, instead of a sales manager’s job description listing tasks

such as “meet key clients once per quarter ” or “prepare sales reports on

a monthly basis,” it would describe outcomes such as “increase regional

sales by 15%” and “improve customer retention by 10%.”

## HBR / Digital Article / A New Approach to Writing Job Descriptions

Google uses results-oriented job descriptions to keep their top talent

motivated. Laszlo Bock, the former senior vice president of people

operations, explains: “At Google, we believe that results-oriented job

descriptions are essential for attracting and retaining top talent. When

employees know what is expected of them and how they will be

measured, they are more likely to be motivated and engaged in their

work.”

For example, traditionally, a design ethicist job description might have

listed analyzing Google’s search algorithm for bias once per month, or

keeping a privacy risk log up to date. But in an outcomes-based job

description, a design ethicist is instead given the broader mandate of

identifying ethical risks in Google’s products or developing guidelines

for the ethical design of products. That gives both the employee and

Google leeway for the speciﬁc tasks of the design ethicist to change

as technologies develop — as generative AI is introduced into Google’s

# oﬀerings, for instance.

# Skills-focused role descriptions

Other companies create dynamic documents that outline the skills and

capabilities an employee brings to a position or should aim to develop.

With this approach, the emphasis shifts from the tasks a person is

supposed to complete to their talents and how those can be applied

# within company projects.

For a company to execute on this approach means identifying the

skills and qualiﬁcations needed for each role and developing training

programs and career paths that help employees build those skills. The

aim is to fully utilize and develop an individual’s abilities and strengths,

which can lead to increased job satisfaction as well as performance. It

also means that companies can quickly assemble teams of people with

the skills and experience needed to tackle speciﬁc projects or initiatives.

## For example, a data analyst with superior visualization skills could

seamlessly shift from creating complex data models to crafting visual

reports, depending on project needs. The analyst would follow a

specialized training regimen tailored to enhance speciﬁc skills, such

as advanced visualization techniques and data storytelling. By focusing

on the analyst’s unique strengths and broader skill set, the organization

not only hones their existing expertise but also creates a more well-

rounded, versatile professional.

# Team-based role descriptions

Lastly, instead of giving each team member a job description, some

companies assign individuals to teams that are given a collective set

of objectives, outcomes, and deliverables. It is then up to the team to

collectively decide how each member will contribute.

A well known example is Spotify, where employees are part of small,

cross-functional teams called “squads,” each of which has a speciﬁc

mission. Each squad autonomously decides how to meet its objectives

best, relying on collective decision-making and their deep knowledge of

each member’s strengths and preferences. The teams meet frequently

to discuss challenges, assess progress, realign goals, and resolve any

conﬂicts or bottlenecks that result from the task distribution.

# Overcoming Challenges

Beyond simple resistance to change, there are a number of challenges

that companies moving away from traditional job descriptions need to

# address.

The most basic is unclear job and performance expectations. Without

a traditional job description, how does an employee know what is

expected of them? How can a manager evaluate their performance

objectively and follow fair compensation and promotion practices

# without clear guidelines in hand?

There are other ways that managers can work with their teams to deﬁne

roles and responsibilities and create a shared understanding of what

each person is responsible for. For example, let’s say you manage a team

of software developers, and your company is shifting to team-based job

descriptions. You might work with your team to create a skills matrix

that identiﬁes the skills and capabilities of each team member and then

use tools like Agile methodology or Kanban boards to help manage

workloads and prioritize tasks.

For recruitment, a competency-based interview process is a more

eﬀective way to assess a candidate’s suitability for a ﬂexible, dynamic

role than a traditional interview, which often focuses on the candidate’s

# experience and qualiﬁcations.

## For performance evaluations, tools such as 360-degree feedback can

help a manager to assess the employee’s performance in various areas,

including their skills, capabilities, and contributions to the team.

More thorny issues can include legal compliance —such as Fair

## Labor Standards Act (FLSA) position status in the U.S. — which can

be challenging without a formal job description. Creating a “role

compliance document” for each employee that provides a broad outline

## of the job and details such as job classiﬁcation (exempt or non-exempt)

can help here. Also, monitor employee tasks, responsibilities, and

actual working hours to ensure that they align with labor guidelines;

depending on your circumstances, this could be a periodic review or

meticulous record-keeping enabled by modern HR software.

As organizations become more agile and responsive and technology

enables new forms of work in the coming years, the trend towards

## project-based work and the need for more ﬂexible job descriptions

will continue. This radical disruption requires a shift in mindset and

right mindset and approach can lead to a more agile, responsive, and

innovative organization better equipped to meet future challenges.
