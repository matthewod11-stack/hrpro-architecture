If the past ﬁve years have taught us anything, it’s that change is

still the only constant in business. We’ve had to navigate a global

pandemic, geopolitical crises, supply chain disruptions, a shift to hybrid

work, and the rise of generative artiﬁcial intelligence. As former U.S.

Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld would put it, we’re facing many

more “unknown unknowns” than “known unknowns” nowadays. But

in our daily work lives, it’s often the smaller-scale unpredictabilities

that threaten to derail our projects and decisions, particularly under

unfamiliar circumstances brought on by macro events.

For the past 13 years, I’ve worked as an agile-product-development

consultant in various industries, and I’ve found that new

initiatives face unpredictability in four key areas: human behavior,

## interpersonal dynamics, technological change and interoperability, and

organizational interdependencies. These unpredictabilities are routine

in any initiative that aims to change the way people interact with one

## another, with data, and with organizational processes and teams.

The agile methodology oﬀers an important tool for dealing with

## unpredictability: vertical slicing. Traditional project-management

approaches are all about running tests, analyzing results—and then

implementing the project. The slicing technique is diﬀerent: It delivers

the project test by test. Each slice builds on the previous one to ﬂesh

out the larger-scale initiative. Think of the project as a cake—each

slice has layers of frosting, ﬁlling, and cake, representing the diﬀerent

components of the project. Using the slicing technique, managers can

run many small tests in diﬀerent areas of uncertainty, and use the

ﬁndings to make better decisions and deliver ﬁnal products more

quickly. An early slice of a new dating app, for example, might be a

simple website to sign up customers and a psychologist in the back oﬃce who manually proposes matches to the ﬁrst 100 people and

connects them by email. For users, the app tastes like the whole cake,

so to speak: They sign up, get matched, and connect with other users.

Product managers use the ﬁndings about what makes a successful

match to continue to build out the app, focusing new slices on becoming

more appealing to female users, for example, or introducing messaging

# within the app.

## HBR / Magazine Article / How Project Leaders Can Tame Unpredictability

Whether you are revamping a marketing plan, overhauling a

distribution system, or implementing a new protocol for interviewing

job candidates, you can slice the work in diﬀerent ways to speed up the

pace of learning and delivery. Here’s how it’s done in each of the four

# areas of unpredictability.

# Human Behavior

Human behavior is unpredictable, especially when it comes to change.

Most new initiatives require that people do certain things diﬀerently

than they did before, so it’s important to begin with a narrowly deﬁned

test group that is representative of your broader one before committing

your resources to a particular plan. The slice allows you to implement

the change you eventually want to see across the board and observe how

# the people in the test group react.

Consider Kirsten, a transportation company executive embarking on

a brand awareness initiative. Her ﬁrm wanted thousands of its drivers

—employed by external service providers—to wear T-shirts featuring

its corporate logo. Some project managers might have started out

by designing the shirts and ordering the total amount needed. But

Kirsten knew that her success would require behavior change from three

diﬀerent groups: executives at the transport providers, who would need

to agree to new contract terms; drivers, who would have to consistently

wear the new shirts; and customers, who would have to notice the

logo and remember the brand. She realized that it would be prudent

to conﬁrm whether such behavioral shifts were possible before making a

# large investment.

So Kirsten printed a small run of shirts and collaborated with one

transport provider in her company’s largest geographic region to get

a commitment that its 15 drivers would wear the shirts at work every

day for a month. This slice allowed her to gather valuable insights about

the initiative: Drivers wanted a selection of styles to choose from (some

wanted T-shirts; others, polos), and all the drivers needed double the

number of shirts initially provided. The test also revealed guidelines

for usage that had to be hammered out, including pickup and drop-oﬀ

locations, laundry services, and what to do when substitute drivers

ﬁlled in or routes changed. And she learned that the material chosen

for the shirts was not suitable for long-term use (many shirts looked

worn out very quickly). Most important, through customer surveys she

conﬁrmed that the eﬀort had led to a small but measurable increase in

# brand awareness.

Kirsten’s second slice involved three larger service providers, one of

which operated in a diﬀerent country. This slice revealed the challenges

associated with scaling up the initiative: It took longer to negotiate

processes with the larger service providers, and drivers’ compliance in

wearing the shirts was spotty. It was clear that a lot more time and eﬀort

would be needed to advance the project more broadly.

# Interpersonal Dynamics

## Unpredictability increases signiﬁcantly when strong interpersonal

dynamics exist among the people whose behavior you’re trying to

change. This is particularly the case when changes to organizational

structures or processes aﬀect incentives, careers, or areas of shared

responsibility. Unpredictability also goes up whenever network eﬀects

are important for your product or service, or when a range of employees,

consumers, and other stakeholders will be interacting within the system

you’re building or ﬁxing.

In such cases, you don’t want to start with a narrow group. Instead,

your ﬁrst slice should encompass a sample large enough to exhibit

the dynamics at play while tackling a smaller but still representative

# behavioral change.

## Oliver, the head of sales at a large European

medical-device provider, wanted his

hundreds of reps to be able to more quickly

# shift recommendations among a range of

oﬀerings when selling to client doctors,

hospitals, and patients. His goal was to

adapt to price and availability changes,

supporting the company’s proﬁts while

ensuring top-notch care. Transitioning

# Vicki Turner

sales reps from selling one product to

another normally took more than a year of

# conversations, by which point the shift

might no longer be beneﬁcial. Oliver needed to come up with a slice that

would test ideal tactics, his reps’ behavior, and clients’ reaction. He

started by focusing on one type of device and introducing a point

system to reward salespeople for moving customers from one to another

## in appropriate cases with no negative impact on patient outcomes. The

test allowed him to carefully gauge the risks of speeding up the process

and to gain acceptance for it. He continued with diﬀerent slices, and

after a year, he had a more ﬂexible recommendation system in place.

## Technological Change and Interoperability

It is now almost impossible to ﬁnd a product or service that doesn’t

rely on modern technology. And as technology continues to advance

at an exponential rate, we are bombarded with dramatic changes in

what we consume and how it’s delivered. To reduce uncertainty when

launching new tech initiatives or products, it’s important to focus from

## the start on integration—within the business, with legacy systems, and

# with external technologies.

The best way to test this category of unpredictability is to create a slice

called a “tracer bullet.” Just as gunners use incendiary ammunition

to see the trajectory of their shots, you create and test a minimum

viable version of the future solution that integrates with all necessary

# technologies.

Take Peng, a manager at an online travel company. He is responsible for

collating the schedules of hundreds of plane, rail, and bus services to

help customers plan travel between cities. He always starts with a tracer

bullet when onboarding new bus providers, which tend to be small

businesses with nonstandardized, often self-made scheduling systems.

Peng’s team manually retrieves and integrates the data for a single

bus route into the company’s system to test the provider’s schedule

system and integration protocols. The slice is complete when the route

is searchable on the company’s consumer-facing website. This process

helps Peng anticipate the challenges associated with integrating the

provider’s full schedule. For more complicated use cases, like multileg

trips using an existing service and a newly added one, he conducts

additional tests. Sometimes these slices reveal the need for system

changes on the provider’s side. Only after thorough testing does he

# greenlight a full integration.

# Organizational Interdependencies

Most projects require collaboration across multiple teams within an

organization, and some also involve outside stakeholders. Each of these

groups can introduce their own elements of unpredictability, which may

increase your risk in ways you can’t control. However, you can slice the

interdependencies with an “organizational tracer bullet” that tests, for

## a single scenario, all the connections among the teams responsible for

providing and receiving goods or services. This approach allows you

to identify the hurdles that must be overcome to achieve larger-scale

# collaboration.

## For example, Anna, a compliance manager at a major ﬁnancial

institution, was facing new regulations that required her organization to

## prepare rapid and targeted responses to many potential risk scenarios.

Previously she might have engaged in a lengthy analysis, planning,

and contracting process with the ﬁrm’s many partners and service

providers, only to ﬁnd that they weren’t able to help her pass the stress

tests. This time, she used slicing: She ran through each individual risk

scenario within her own ﬁrm and with relevant partners after only a few

weeks of preparation. With each slice, she and her counterparts learned

what new processes were needed, making it easy to agree on next steps

# and necessary contract changes.

. . .

When asked for advice on how to make decisions under uncertain

## conditions, Daniel Kahneman, the pioneering behavioral economist and

psychologist, recommended “delaying” one’s intuitive response to a

question by breaking the decision down into smaller parts. Slicing is

that art. It may seem counterintuitive to managers who are accustomed

to starting with “low-hanging fruit” to ensure quick, low-cost gains.

But in the early stages of most initiatives, there are so many areas

of unpredictability that forging ahead without ﬁrst slicing into the

murkiest parts of the project often results in costly changes at a later

# stage.

Astro Teller, who leads Alphabet’s “moon shot” division, illustrates this

problem with a funny question: If your end goal is to have a monkey

standing on a pedestal reciting Shakespeare, do you start by building

the stand or teaching the animal how to talk? The answer, of course,

is to tackle the most challenging part of the project ﬁrst to see if it’s

doable before you invest any time or resources in the easier part. That’s

why Kirsten evaluated the behavior of partners, drivers, and customers

before she designed and ordered thousands of branded T-shirts; why

Oliver introduced incentives for reps one device at a time; why Peng

integrates a single bus route into his company’s system before adding a

whole ﬂeet; and why Anna carried out test runs for each risk scenario

prior to ﬁnalizing new arrangements with external partners.

Once you have tested several slices, identiﬁed and overcome challenges,

and veriﬁed success (or failure), you can proceed with traditional

project management. You’ve turned your unknown unknowns into

known unknowns.
