It might sound like a cliché, but the idea for Bitty & Beau’s Coﬀee really

did come to Amy in the shower. At that time, in 2015, our youngest two

children, both of whom have Down syndrome, were six and 11, and we’d

been talking about what their future as teens and then adults would

# look like.

# HBR / Magazine Article / The Founders of Bitty & Beau’s Coffee on Building a Business…

When we learned that 80% of people with disabilities in the United

States are unemployed, we were determined to make sure that our kids

Bitty and Beau would not become part of that statistic. We thought the

solution could be as simple as demonstrating the intrinsic value we saw

in their lives and those of others living with disabilities.

Amy’s shower idea? To open a coﬀee shop in our hometown of

Wilmington, North Carolina, that would employ mostly people with

intellectual and developmental disabilities. What better way to both

create jobs and bring people together? Within three months we’d hired

19 team members and opened the ﬁrst Bitty & Beau’s Coﬀee. Within six

months business was so good that we were able to move to a space 10

times the size of the original one and build our own roastery. Seven

years later we have 17 locations across 11 states and the District of

Columbia—with four more slated to open in 2023—employing more

# than 400 people with disabilities.

The mission of our business is to put people with disabilities—either

congenital or acquired—to work. We’d love to see more entrepreneurs

follow in our footsteps. But we also believe that any organization can

open its doors to people with disabilities—and can regard them as

a competitive advantage. In fact, all corporate diversity, equity, and

inclusion (DEI) strategies should include a commitment to broadening

the talent pool in this way. We’ve learned through experience how

to overcome challenges, get the best from our team members, and

capitalize on all the value they provide. Our kids motivated us to make a

diﬀerence. We hope we can do the same for you.

# Family Inspiration

Our path to the hospitality industry was a circuitous one. We met at

## the University of Cincinnati College-Conservatory of Music while in our

twenties. Ben had already appeared on Broadway in his teens, so after

graduation we got married and moved to New York for a while to make

a go of show business. We had the good fortune to perform together on

Broadway in State Fair, but we soon decided that as we started having

children, we wanted to be closer to family in North Carolina. There

we both went to work for Amy’s dad, who owned a precision sheet-

metal fabrication company, and got an education in operations and

manufacturing. Meanwhile, Amy’s entrepreneurial spirit manifested

## in the founding of an after-school theater program for kids, and we

welcomed our ﬁrst two, Lillie and Emma Grace. Ben also tried diﬀerent

paths—contemplating stints at divinity and law schools—before settling

in ﬁnancial services with ﬁrms including Edward Jones, Smith Barney,

## and Wells Fargo Advisors Financial Network.

When Beau was born with Down syndrome, in 2004, we felt a mix

of emotions: fear of the unknown, because neither of us had had any

experience with disability; worry about what our newborn son would

need and how we could help him navigate the world; and, candidly,

grief over the loss of the child we’d expected to have. Thankfully, we

both quickly transitioned to a more positive mindset—embracing Beau

as he is and feeling very blessed to have him.

Five years later, when Bitty, too, was born with Down syndrome, we

weren’t afraid, worried, or sad. Not only had our fourth child made

it into this world—despite doctors’ having given her a 25% chance of

survival—but she had the same disability as Beau.

Hands together for the company cheer; customers get personal messages on their cups Matt Ray

As the parents of Beau and Bitty, we quickly learned that in the United

States and most other places around the world, people with disabilities,

particularly intellectual and developmental ones, are treated diﬀerently

from everyone else. Sure, charitable and advocacy organizations and

some K–12 school systems are working to shift that dynamic. But in

all the years we’ve spent fundraising for and blogging and speaking

publicly about this issue, it often feels as if we’re preaching to the choir.

The disability community remains a subculture disconnected from

mainstream society. Adults especially still struggle to integrate. And one

of the greatest obstacles they face is a lack of access to employment.

# Our First Shop

Bitty & Beau’s Coﬀee is our attempt to change that. We started planning

our ﬁrst shop in November 2015. Friends in the coﬀee business advised

us on sourcing quality beans and what machinery we’d need. We

researched other aspects of food and beverage service online. We found

a 500-square-foot spot to rent and set to work to outﬁt it properly. We

included signage that explained our mission and a TV monitor on which

a video loop would present disability statistics and showcase our team

members. We used social media to announce our launch plans to the

community and to put out a call for job applicants.

In December we rented a room and hosted an informational session

for would-be employees. It was a packed house—about 50 people of all

ages and varying abilities, often accompanied by a family member. Most

had never been to a job interview before and didn’t have a résumé, so

it was informal. We simply explained that we were looking for people

with a positive attitude who were interested in learning something new

and assured them that our plan was to ﬁgure out through the training

process which jobs best ﬁt their skill sets and personalities. Then we

made the rounds to meet everyone.

We ended up hiring 19 people from that group—some with Down

syndrome, some on the autism spectrum, some with cerebral palsy,

others undiagnosed. We then spent time with them on-site and assigned

roles: greeting customers, running the point of sale, making drinks,

calling out orders when ready. Amy and other neurotypical supervisors

we later brought in would ﬂoat in the background and assist only when

necessary. We were clear about this: Employees with disabilities would

be the face of our business. Customers would see them doing these

## familiar jobs and interact with them directly.

Our doors opened in January 2016 to great local fanfare, and it was

exactly as we’d imagined. People were coming in; slowing down; receiving friendly, eﬃcient service; drinking great coﬀee; and, most

important, having meaningful personal exchanges with our team

members. And our customers weren’t just from the neighborhood. Some

saw the employee stories we shared on social media (“Look what Matt

did today!” “This is Joann’s ﬁrst job!”) and drove from all over the

country to visit the shop; others planned vacations to come see us.

Things were so busy that we quickly realized we’d need more space.

In June we moved into 5,000 square feet that had previously housed

a Hummer dealership. Soon thereafter we invested in our own fully

automated roastery, and Ben sold his ﬁnancial services practice to join

# the business full-time.

# The Path to Growth

With so much interest from outside Wilmington, we started to consider

how we might grow. Emails from would-be Bitty & Beau’s operators

ﬂooded our inboxes; we got about two dozen a week. Our ﬁrst thought

was to franchise, so we began accepting applications. But as hundreds

poured in over the next few months, we realized that we should pump

the brakes and experiment with expansion ﬁrst. We decided to open a

single shop outside Wilmington, in Charleston, South Carolina, to prove

that our concept could be scaled up and that success didn’t depend on

the two of us being there every day.

We hired for the new shop in the same way as for the ﬁrst: We found

people who were excited to work and learn, and we assigned them

to the stations they were best suited for. We would embrace any

kind of disability and make accommodations. Our aim was to give

team members meaningful work to do—whether they used only sign

language or were in a wheelchair or had limited dexterity or were

uncomfortable with social interactions—and to stay ﬂexible. If someone

was put in the wrong role to start, we’d simply have that person try a

# new one.

Shift supervisors were chosen for their ability to adjust and adapt in

this way. They didn’t necessarily need previous experience interacting

with people with disabilities; they just needed the courage and the heart

to share expertise and lead from behind in the diverse workplace we’d

created.

The Charleston shop was as popular as the Wilmington one, so we added

## another in Savannah, then one in Annapolis, and then two more in

Wilmington. Now we had a playbook to oﬀer franchisees, and we knew

that would be the fastest route to bringing a Bitty & Beau’s to—and

carrying out our mission in—as many cities and towns as possible.

We embarked on that process in 2021, in the midst of the Covid-19

pandemic, but we’ve still managed to open 11 franchises across the

United States in the past two years, and we will have opened another

# four locations by the end of 2023.

Our headquarters staﬀ has grown in tandem: We now have franchise

liaison teams, creative services, and a much larger roasting operation

and fulﬁllment group that sends our coﬀee beans around the country.

We may eventually add more corporate-owned shops, but that takes

time; meanwhile, franchising helps us capitalize on the momentum

we’ve created. Indeed, international expansion may also be on the

horizon. We’ve had people from Australia, Canada, England, Ireland,

## Italy, Japan, South and Central America, and Switzerland emailing to

say, “Bring Bitty & Beau’s to our country.”

Of course, we choose and vet our franchisees carefully, spending Zoom

call after Zoom call getting to know them. It’s wonderful if they have

some business and franchise experience, but we also want to make sure

they’re fully aligned with the Bitty & Beau’s mission. Many applicants

are people like us: They have family members with disabilities and want

to create a place where they can work without feeling marginalized.

Others just believe in what we’re doing and see what a diﬀerence they

can make by bringing one of our shops to their hometown.

Although each franchisee owns the franchise’s assets and a license to

use our trademark, trade dress, systems, procedures, and operations,

as prescribed in the franchise agreement, we own the business and

remain heavily involved in maintaining and developing our culture and

commitment to it. Retail is hard if you’re not located in the right spot,

so we advise on the areas that can work best. We also don’t currently

have drive-throughs, because we’re not selling just coﬀee—we’re selling

an experience. All the shops use our signature signage, drink machines,

and unique accommodations, such as giving customers playing cards

that match up with their orders rather than writing their names on the cups (which can be diﬃcult for some of our team members). It’s critical

to us to ensure that each Bitty & Beau’s maintains the quality drinks

and food, excellent service, and communal environment we’ve become

known for. After all, our kids’ names are on the sign.

# Beyond Our Business

We’ve been so focused on our own business over the past seven years

that we haven’t had much time to speak to other organizations about

how they might incorporate some of what we do at Bitty & Beau’s.

Maybe, as an initial step, corporate leaders could simply look at our

example: If the majority of our workforce is made up of people with

disabilities in frontline roles, could you really not employ one such

# person?

We do have more advice to oﬀer, however. First, recognize that

disabilities are part of the human condition. Some people are born with

them. Others acquire them through a health challenge or an accident,

and that could happen to any of us. But disability is a diﬀerence

that continues to engender severe marginalization. Let’s normalize

it instead, and move toward integrating people with disabilities into

society as we’ve tried to do with all other nonmajority groups.

To that end, we need to put more than charity dollars to work on

this cause. Business leaders should be investing real capital in and

innovating around this population of people, who can add value in a

variety of venues. Too often people with disabilities aren’t even given

a chance. Employers think it will take too much eﬀort to get them up

to speed. But in our experience the learning curve isn’t that steep, and

you’ll soon have highly reliable, deeply engaged, and ﬁercely loyal new

# team members.

Remember that it’s OK to start small. You don’t need to bet the house on

a big initiative right away. Begin by ﬁnding one person with a disability

whom you can bring into your workplace—even for just a few hours

one day a week—so that all those who don’t have a disability will start

to get comfortable with being around someone who does. Trust us:

Team members who are put in the right roles and set up to succeed

will display dedication and infectious enthusiasm. You can grow your

# initiative from there.

As you build, try to look at your new employees through a parent’s

eyes. See their untapped potential. Give them opportunities. Keep your

expectations high, but also aﬀord them grace and understanding. Be

their biggest cheerleader. (For what it’s worth, we think this is good

advice for managing people without disabilities too.)

There are no shortcuts to ﬁguring out who will work best in which

role. It’s important to consider every applicant who has a disability as a

## unique individual with certain strengths and weaknesses (but also the

capacity to learn and grow) and then evaluate that person’s ﬁtness for a

## desired role, perhaps with accommodations.

When a workforce diversiﬁes in this way, the existing employees will

pay attention. Perhaps one of them has a child with autism at home,

or a sibling who experienced brain damage, or a parent who was

forced into early retirement by arthritis. Such people will appreciate

the work you’re doing to promote full inclusivity. Other employees will

beneﬁt from seeing the resilience, determination, and spirit of their

coworkers with disabilities. It will open their minds to what’s possible

and encourage them to consider new perspectives, which can lead

to more-creative thinking. We’ve found that the morale of our mixed

workforce is exuberantly high.

So far we’ve worked with three other companies directly—not to advise

them on their DEI strategies but to serve Bitty & Beau’s coﬀee in their corporate oﬃces. Our two newest Wilmington locations are at the

## buildings where Thermo Fisher Scientiﬁc and nCino, a cloud banking

company, are headquartered. Salesforce has also been a strong partner,

serving our coﬀee at its world headquarters and sending it to clients

during the pandemic. We’re in discussions with numerous hospitals and

universities that are interested in Bitty & Beau’s shops as well. We’d love

to see every commercial or government building have one in its lobby—

in part because we think it would inspire other organizations to realize

that they, too, can successfully employ people with disabilities.

# Lasting Impact

As you can imagine, our entire family is invested in Bitty & Beau’s. Beau,

now a junior in high school, and Bitty, a seventh-grader, are still too

young to become oﬃcial team members, but they’re proud to represent

the company, especially at new store openings. Bitty loves making the

rounds at our ﬂagship, chatting with customers and serving coﬀee. Beau

at a place that serves burgers or doing taste testing for the restaurateur

At 22, having recently graduated from New York University with a

major in ﬁlm and television, Emma Grace is our creative director. And

## Lillie, 24, a graduate of UNC Wilmington with a degree in political

science, who only four years ago was diagnosed as being on the autism

spectrum, is a standout performer in our fulﬁllment center. At family

dinners we’re always talking about what’s on the horizon for Bitty &

Beau’s and how we can have an even bigger impact in the world.

What started as an idea in the shower has become our life’s work and

our legacy. We don’t know of any other business that is focused on

employing people with disabilities and is trying to scale up the way we

are. We’re ﬁguring it out as we go, and we’re happy to be ﬁrst movers.

But we sincerely hope that others will choose to join us. The business

world is uniquely positioned to help people with disabilities ﬁnd

## meaning, create value, and connect with their communities through

# work.
