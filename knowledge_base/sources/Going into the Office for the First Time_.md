# which currently

has a 55% return to office rate compared to

Europe at 75% and Asia-Pacific at 85%.For everyone — but especially for those who entered theworkforce during the pandemic — this shift may bring upconflicting emotions, including excitement for the chance toconnect with colleagues, apprehension around a potentially longcommute, and curiosity about the new environment. Thesefeelings are normal, and you should expect to make someadjustments.The most obvious? You’ll no longer be able to roll out of bed andwork from your couch or take care of everyday errands during theday. You will have more time to grab lunch with peers, askquestions without setting up Zoom meetings, and ward off the

sense of isolation that comes when it’s just you and your screen.So, how can you successfully navigate this transition?Here are my top tips for reentering the office with as little stressand anxiety as possible.Reimagine your routine.When you return to the office, you’ll need to rethink all thedifferent components of your schedule. Find out when you needto be at your desk and then work backwards, reorganizing yourcurrent routine to ensure that you show up on time.For example, let’s say that you need to be at your desk by 8:30 am.This is what working backwards might sound like:

I want to be walking in the office doors by 8:15 am to givemyself a few minutes to put down my things, go to thebathroom, and get a cup of coffee. That means I need to leavemy home by 7:45 am to give myself a few minutes to get tomy car or the train stop, 20 minutes to commute, and thensome margin for walking to the building.If I’ll be leaving by 7:45 am, then I need to set my alarm for6:30 am so I can snooze a few times and still have time toshower, get ready, take out my dog, eat breakfast and packmy lunch. And if I’m setting my alarm for 6:30 am, I’ll needto get in bed by 11 pm to not feel exhausted the next day.You can run through this thought process for the remainder ofyour day as well, thinking through when you’ll exercise afterwork, how you’ll get groceries, and what you want to do for mealprep. I recommend doing a dry run of your routine at least oncebefore you officially need to show up at work, just to make sureyour estimates are accurate.Pro tip:If you’re a caretaker or have responsibilities outside of work thatyou were able to manage alone while working remotely, you’lllikely need to find extra support for those tasks. That could looklike hiring a dog walker, coordinating a carpooling schedule foryour kids, or asking a family member or friend (or hiring aprofessional if possible) to help care for a loved one at home.Get the right gear.As you organize the new flow of your day, you’ll want to thinkthrough what gear you’ll need for working away from home. Thismight involve investing in a laptop bag or backpack to carry yourwork equipment when you commute, getting waterproof boots if

you need to walk outside in the elements, or clothes and shoesthat are office appropriate now that your colleagues won’t just beseeing you via Zoom.You should also consider what you’ll need to feel comfortable andproductive in your new space. If you plan to pack your own food,for example, you may need a lunch cooler, ice packs, and athermos. If you work in an open area and are easily distracted bysounds, you may want to purchase ear plugs or noise-cancellingheadphones. If the temperature in your office is cooler than youlike, bring an extra sweater or blanket for the back of your chair. Ifyou want to make your desk feel more like home, frame a photothat brings you joy, or bring your favorite plant, and set it on yourdesk.Pro tip:Returning to the office can be a fun, fresh start — similar to thefeeling of going back to school after summer break. Write a “back-to-the-office” checklist to make sure you have everything youneed. You may find new things to add to your list as you spendmore time in the office.Update your tech.If you don’t already know the IT department’s contactinformation, find it before you return in person. The last thingyou want to do is show up at the office and be hit with a long listof technical difficulties when trying to connect to the company’sintranet or other internal systems. To avoid a stressful start, do alittle research. What do you need to know to set up your desktoponce you arrive? Often, the most straightforward way to gain thisinformation is to reach out to IT and ask.

To avoid becoming overly stressed, you should expect a slightlearning curve when you arrive. After all, this is your first time ina new space. You may need some training on how to book aconference room, share your presentation on the big screenduring team meetings, and dock your laptop into your workstation. Give yourself some grace your first day or two back in theoffice as you figure out these logistics.Pro tip:Some offices require employees to have a special ID or passcode togain access to the parking lot or building. If your company hasn’talready provided you with this information, reach out to yourmanager to find out the protocol, as well as what steps you shouldtake to get what you need. This will help you avoid the stress ofbeing locked out on your first day back — which is never fun.Pay attention to the ofﬁce culture.Even if you’ve been in your position for a while, you may need todo some relearning to fully understand the office culture, whichmay look different in person than online.For instance, traditional, in-person environments can be lessflexible than remote ones. Your boss may not have noticed if yousigned in a few minutes late when you worked remotely, but beingat your desk on time may actually be important to them. Now thatyou’re physically visible, punctuality can be a sign that you’re acommitted and responsible team member. Or perhaps when youworked remotely it was okay to check out early and grab coffeewith a friend, and then put in some extra time later that night.Now that you’re in person, leaving early could raise someeyebrows.

To avoid any mishaps, it’s best to check in with your boss aroundhow flexible or stringent the in-office culture is at yourorganization. The amount of face time you have in the office maynot be a big deal to one manager and may be a huge deal toanother. If your boss says it’s important to be at your desk by 8:30am, take their word for it.Other areas to pay attention to include:

Team and organizational meetings. Is it important to be in theroom a few minutes early? Should you always book aconference room or meet in more informal spaces? Will youneed a pad of paper, tablet, or computer to take notes?

Break times. How long do lunch breaks typically last? Howmany breaks do people take throughout the day? Do you needto let your manager or team members know when you’restepping out for an appointment? Is it okay to run quick errandsif they don’t disrupt your schedule?

Dress code. Is it more formal or casual? Are there certainmeetings, such as ones with external clients, where it’simportant to dress up? What footwear do you need to movearound comfortably?

Socialization. Should you be asking people about their weekendon Monday mornings? Is it expected that you’ll go out to lunchwith your colleagues or join them for happy hour? Do peoplecelebrate birthdays in the oﬃce, and if so, is a card or anotheracknowledgement the norm?Pay attention to how your colleagues and peers behave in theseareas. If you need a little guidance, the easiest thing you can do isask a trusted peer.

Pro tip:When it comes to taking breaks, you don’t need to be paranoidand track how many times you go to the bathroom. But it isimportant to be aware that how you show up in the office canhave an impact on others’ perception of you. In someenvironments, being punctual and showing commitment to thework can give others a more favorable impression of you, whichcan lead to more growth opportunities down the line.Embrace the opportunity.You may have a few butterflies in your stomach when thinkingabout all the details involved in returning to the office, butremember that this is also an amazing opportunity for yourcareer. With much less effort, you can connect with yourcolleagues. You’ll be able to drop by their desks and say “hi,” chatwhile refilling your coffee in the kitchen, and even invite peopleout for an in-person lunch. You can network with people in otherdepartments simply by walking down the hall, and ask quickquestions without having to schedule a formal meeting.

One study found that 53% of 18- to 29-year-olds said it’s beendifficult for them to be motivated to do their work when they’renot in-person with their colleagues. So, if you’ve felt a bitdisengaged or disconnected lately, perhaps you’ll discover arenewed sense of motivation when you’re surrounded bycoworkers and community.Pro tip:Use in-person work to your advantage to build momentum onnew or difficult projects. If you’re feeling stuck, overwhelmed orunsure where to start, drop by a colleague’s desk, or schedule abrainstorming session. Talking about things in the same room canhelp you gain clarity and confidence you need to get started.
