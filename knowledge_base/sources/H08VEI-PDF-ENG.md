Changes from the C-suite often land as abstract ideas that feel

disconnected from (or irrelevant to) the reality on the ground. It’s up

to team leaders to help people see what it means for them. Otherwise,

it’s just another big announcement that doesn’t stick.

So, what are the best ways to talk to your team about a strategic change?

How can you frame the initiative in concrete terms? And what should

you do if there’s skepticism that points to problems with the change?

# What the Experts Say

Being the messenger of change is often challenging. How hard this

communication gets comes down to how much or how little resistance

you face, according to Shana Carroll, a professor and co-director of the

## Leadership Development and Communications Program at the Kellogg

School of Management at Northwestern University. “It depends on

your team’s attitude,” she says “Can your team see how this change is

positive? Or will they struggle with it, push back, or fail to see how it

aﬀects them?”

That disconnect is common, notes Justin Willett, research director for

## the Novak Leadership Institute at the University of Missouri, whose

work focuses on leadership communication and workplace culture.

Sure, you understand why the new policy or change matters to the

business—you’re privy to the boardroom conversations, he says. But you

can’t assume everyone else does, too. “Frontline employees might think,

‘This doesn’t apply to me.’ That’s why you need to help them connect

the dots and make sure people know why what you’re saying is relevant

to their work, not just the company’s goals.” Here are a few ways to do

# that.

Read the room.

Before you introduce a change, Willett advises stepping back to consider

how it’s likely to be received. Employees aren’t all starting from the

same place after all. They bring diﬀerent levels of understanding, skills,

and perspectives to the big picture. “You probably already have a good

read on your people,” he says. “Think about where they’re at: what they

connect with, what gets them jazzed up, and where they want to grow.”

Carroll suggests identifying what she calls “network nodes—the super

connectors in your organization who interact with a wide range of

people.” Tap them as a sounding board to anticipate how people might

react. “Ask them: What concerns do you have? What will it take to put

this into practice? And what should we emphasize?” Use their input to

tailor your approach.

# Focus on frontline managers.

Frontline managers are key to how messages get communicated and

how teams respond, so Carroll recommends prioritizing them. They

work directly with employees and have a clearer view of what’s actually

happening, she says. “Frontline managers have an outsized inﬂuence

on whether people stay motivated and see how their work matters,” she

adds. “Leaders need to help them see that communication is a key part

of their job, and give them the skills and tools to do it well.”

## That support matters because in times of change, frontline managers

are often the ones employees turn to, says Willett. “That relationship is

where trust is built. If it’s solid, people feel heard and they’re more likely

to open up and say, ‘I’m worried about these new metrics,’ or whatever’s

on their mind.”

Think like a translator.

Along with developing your frontline managers’ communication skills,

you need to help employees at every level understand the reason behind

the change. “People’s responses tend to fall on a continuum,” says

Carroll. “A small percentage are excited and see the vision, some will

dig in and resist, and most are somewhere in between.”

To reach that middle group, a compelling case is needed. Think like a

translator, says Willett. As a senior leader, “you know more about how

the decision was made and what the alternatives were,” he says. “You

don’t need to tell people everything, but they do need to know what’s

## pertinent to their jobs and the business.” Explain what the change

means in practice, he says: “Walk through tasks and timelines. Say:

‘Here’s how this may aﬀect your day-to-day.’”

Make it personal.

Next, you need to help people answer the question: What’s in it for

me? This is where you put your translation skills to work, according

to Willett. Rather than talking about what’s good for the company,

focus on personal opportunities and connect the change to individual

goals. Consider what motivates diﬀerent team members—whether it’s

learning opportunities, career advancement, or new responsibilities.

Then show them what the strategic shift means for them personally.

“You could say: ‘You’ll have the opportunity to build new skills, which

can help you get promoted.’ Or, ‘You’ll help colleagues get up to speed,

which gives you a bigger role.’”

Carroll recommends backing this up with anecdotes and stories that

show you appreciate how the change aﬀects diﬀerent teams and people.

“It helps them feel seen and understood.”

# Have compassion.

People crave stability. “And when you introduce change, you’re

inevitably putting people into a state of uncertainty and turmoil,” says

Carroll. “That’s not necessarily bad, but as a leader, you need to help

them navigate it with empathy and compassion.”

That means noticing their emotions and worries. “People are

wondering: ‘What else is going to change? What else don’t I know?’” You

might be tempted to rush them toward acceptance, but they often need

to sit with their discomfort. “Don’t waste time trying to win everyone

over one by one,” she says. “Let them feel what they’re feeling while

consistently oﬀering a vision that’s both optimistic and realistic.” People

can get on board with change even if they don’t like it, as long as you

show them respect, she adds.

# Point out progress.

If some workers are having trouble grasping what the strategic change

means for their day-to-day work, Willett recommends using real-life

examples to bring the vision to life. Seek out people in your organization

who are already on board and making the change work. Showcase their

achievements and demonstrate how the new approach beneﬁts them

# and the team.

Concrete case studies help make the strategy feel tangible and relevant.

“There are going to be people who are harder to persuade, and you have

to do what you can to show them the way,” he says. “‘Just do it’ isn’t

going to help.” And it will likely backﬁre. Success stories can help people

come around and see progress that can be made.

# Push real concerns upward.

You might hear pushback or comments like, “This is just a fad” or “We

tried this before and it didn’t work.” Some of that resistance may be

noise, but legitimate concerns are worth paying attention to, according

to Willett. “If you uncover real issues, you need to get that information

back up the ladder so that it reaches the people making the decisions.”

The problem isn’t always the change itself, but how leaders are going

about it. And there might be a better way to implement it, he says. In

some cases, certain processes may need carve-outs or exceptions. “It

might be something the CEO overlooked,” he says. “It’s important to get

# that signal back up the chain.”

# Be patient.

Change requires a mental shift and it takes time to rewire old patterns.

Be patient, says Carroll. “Leaders have had the conversations for months

and done the analysis. Employees are hearing about it for the ﬁrst time

and only starting to wrap their heads around it.”

Meet your people where they are. “Acknowledge that uncertainty is

normal and make them feel safe,” says Willett. “You might not be able

to anticipate every question,” he adds, “but you need to be prepared to

talk about what they’re worried about or afraid of.” Your core message is

simple: ‘We’re doing this new change, we’re going to make mistakes, and

we’re going to ﬁgure it out together.’”

# Principles to Remember

# Do

- Tap your “network nodes”—the super connectors who interact with

everyone—as a sounding board to anticipate reactions and tailor your

# approach.

- Make it practical: explain how the change aﬀects people’s speciﬁc

# tasks, timelines, and day-to-day work.

- Tailor your message to individual motivations and focus on

## opportunities like learning, or career advancement, rather than

# generic company beneﬁts.

# Don’t

- Overlook frontline managers—they’re key to how teams respond.

# Invest in their communication skills.

- Assume that all negative feedback is just griping; sometimes it’s

pointing to real problems with the change or its implementation.

- Dismiss people’s fears. Instead, acknowledge that uncertainty is

normal and be ready to address people’s concerns with care and

# transparency.
