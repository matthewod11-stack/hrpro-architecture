CEOs are routinely told to “link their strategic plan to their budgets.”

Yet over many years, I’ve observed an alarming disconnect between the

two. Aligning strategy and budgets is touted as a hallmark of eﬀective

management. And, in theory, it is. You test a strategic idea by analysing

its impact. Change suppliers – what happens to revenues and costs?

Upskill employees – what happens to the bottom line?

However, in practice, this neat coupling is hard to achieve. Why?

Because strategic plans and budgets are built on incompatible

frameworks. They don’t speak the same language. Budgets are

concerned with ﬁnancial projections and cost control and are structured

around categories of income and expenses. Whereas strategic plans

aren’t and, in practice, can be structured around anything the plan’s

creator chooses – such as market opportunities, value propositions, and

# company capabilities.

The result? Crossed wires, muddled priorities, and leaders ﬂying

blind when making strategic decisions. This misalignment creates

confusion, weakens execution, and fuels internal conﬂict. A strategy

team expecting funding for long-term digital initiatives might come

up against a ﬁnance team expecting measurable returns this year;

middle managers might not not know whose directives to follow –

## cost containment demands from ﬁnance or innovation demands from

strategy; more generally, executives may lack the visibility they need

into the trade-oﬀs they have to make.

Here I suggest a simple hack to make sure your strategic plan and

budget act in concert, empowering you to truly assess the ﬁnancial

impact of strategic decisions. It involves four steps.

# Step 1: Review How You Address Strategy

Your strategy is the absolute foundation for all your planning. If you

don’t get this right, anything you build on top of it, such as your budget,

is doomed to collapse. Your budget must be built on your strategy

framework, i.e., organized around the same concepts.

But what if your strategic plan is not strategic? This occurs if,

for example, your strategic plan is structured around your internal

departments, e.g., production, ﬁnance, HR, etc. This quickly morphs

into a detailed to-do list rather than a series of statements about the

organization’s positioning. If that’s the case, it simply won’t succeed.

So, before setting oﬀ to design a budget or any further steps, you must

revise your strategic plan to structure it around the key stakeholders on

which your company depends.

To identify which are key, ask yourself whether the stakeholder has

## a fundamental impact on your organization’s performance. Can you

exist without or easily replace the stakeholder? Do you clearly know

what you want from the stakeholder? Do you want the relationship with

that stakeholder? In the case of a business, your key stakeholders are

most likely to include some or all of these ﬁve: customers, suppliers,

employees, shareholders, and the community. These are the groups that

must form your plan structure.

As part of your review, quantify what you want from each of these

stakeholders, and what they want from you. You can follow some steps

to do that. For example, you want revenue from customers, and they

want a range of things from you including quality products, customer

service, and a competitive price–each of which incurs an expense. So,

one metric that should appear in your strategic plan, and for which you

should have targets over time, is revenue. With employees, you may

seek high retention, engagement, or productivity. With suppliers, you

might target improved terms or greater reliability.

By structuring your strategic plan around stakeholder-based results,

you’re laying a foundation that can be linked directly to ﬁnancial

performance. You’re also building clarity: everyone in your organization

can see whom you’re trying to inﬂuence and how.

The next step is to undertake an equivalent exercise with your

## operational plans, in particular your budget.

# Step 2: Visit Your Operational Budget

Typically, operational budgets will be categorized into “accounts” with

each line item in your budget being an income or expense category.

I have one in front of me, and it shows the following line items for

expenses – “materials and supplies; indirect labor; employee beneﬁts;

## utilities; advertising; insurance” and so on.

A useful for exercise for the CEO’s strategy team is to take a closer look

at these expense categories. They will ﬁnd that each one belongs with

a key stakeholder, e.g., “materials and supplies” belong with suppliers,

## “indirect labor” and “employee beneﬁts” belong with employees, and so

# on.

So, take note of this important insight : your budget has stakeholder

relationships buried in it; you just need to dig them up, and the exercise

will help you learn more about how your strategy and your stakeholders

are connected, which brings me to the next step.

## Step 3. Restructure Your Budget for a Strategic Discussion

Your budget makes no sense strategically if you leave it in its original

state . Put your new stakeholder-based strategic plan next to your

expense-category-based budget and they’re like chalk and cheese.

But now I want you to recategorize your budget revenue and expenses

according to your stakeholder categories. Try doing this with your

strategy team on a large screen that all can see to gain consensus. Start

by putting revenue under customers, that was easy! Now categorize

## the various budget expenses under the other key stakeholders as

demonstrated above.

Don’t get bogged down by exceptions. Some expenses may straddle

categories or defy easy classiﬁcation, e.g., “insurance.” Does that belong

with employees, customers, or some other stakeholder? If the answer is

unclear then maybe it’s time to break the “insurance” category down for

discussion purposes. Does it relate to accident insurance for employees?

Or is it pertaining to the company’s liability insurance for product

performance, in which case, it belongs with customers? This discussion

will not only clarify issues it may have the reverse eﬀect of redesigning

and clarifying budget expense categories.

I need to stress that this recategorization is only for this exercise. I’m

not suggesting that you tell the accounting department to change their

system. If it works for them, let it be.

## Step 4. Bring Your Strategic Plan and Budget Together

Now comes the payoﬀ. You have a strategic plan and a budget that are

built on the same stakeholder architecture. This means you can now do

what many executives struggle with: evaluate the ﬁnancial impact of a

## strategic decision or the strategic implications of a ﬁnancial one.

For example, suppose your strategic plan calls for reducing prices to

drive market share. That change will show up as a forecast impact on

customer-related revenue demonstrated in a spreadsheet which will

automatically calculate the bottom-line. Or you may aim to deepen

supplier relationships, expecting more favourable terms or faster

delivery. That’s likely to aﬀect your supplier-related expense lines.

the implications on employee costs and model the trade-oﬀs against

expected improvements in retention or performance.

This approach not only demystiﬁes the connection between a strategic

plan and its budget, it also changes the tenor of executive deliberations.

I’ve found the process brings all parts of the executive team together.

## For example, in many organizations, accounting and ﬁnance

professionals see strategy as a bit “academic” so they become

disengaged. Their grounding is in budgets, forecasts, and variances.

They also see functions like HR as a bit “soft,” unable to understand the

ﬁnancial impact of their decisions. On the other hand, HR or operations

may view budgeting exercises as narrowly ﬁnancial, disconnected from

managing talent, morale, or service quality, and unable to see the

## impact of these factors on quantiﬁable expenses, such as poor retention

# rates.

Structuring both your strategic plan and budget around stakeholders

in the way described here gives all parties a shared frame of reference,

ensuring that everyone’s voice matters. When decisions are made about

hiring, supplier contracts, product pricing or community investment,

for example, each function can weigh in on both the strategic intent and

# the ﬁnancial consequence.

. . .

For too long, strategic planning has lived in one universe and budgeting

in another. The result is a gap which is often ﬁlled by guesswork,

intuition, or after-the-fact reconciliation. It’s time for a reframe. By

structuring both your strategic plan and your budget around the same

set of key stakeholder categories, you create a powerful feedback

loop. Strategy becomes actionable, budgets become meaningful. And

executives stop talking past each other. This approach brings strategy

down from the clouds and ties it directly to your organization’s ﬁnancial

engine. Strategy changes from being “pie in the sky” and becomes a

living, breathing process that guides real-world choices.
