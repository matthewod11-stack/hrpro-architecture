If you’re like most managers, you probably hate giving constructive

feedback to your team. It’s awkward, it’s uncomfortable, and it often

doesn’t work. You may question whether it’s worth the trouble to tell

an employee that what they’re doing is wrong. Is it worth the risk of a

long-drawn out conversation when there are more pressing things to do?

Is it worth the risk of hurting a team member’s feelings or opening the

door for potential conﬂict? Perhaps you answer “no” and deprive your

employees of the constructive critiques that aid in their development —

and that they deeply crave.

For years, I’ve taught feedback in my courses, coached executives

on how to give feedback eﬀectively, and run countless feedback

workshops. What I’ve found is that managers fully understand most

of the reasons why feedback matters. Managers have long been told

how feedback is critical to organizational success. They attend training

after training to learn how to give eﬀective feedback in order to manage

underperformers and ensure that employees are on the right track with

their work. Managers also learn that feedback is a necessary ingredient

for a company culture built on trust, accountability, and compassion.

But what’s often missing from the conversation about the importance of

feedback is the real reason why it matters: Feedback is a critical tool for

helping employees ﬁnd deeper meaning in their day-to-day work.

Employees crave meaning. Once basic job needs are met (e.g., fair

salary, safe working conditions), meaning is what employees most

desire in their job. This desire is especially important for Gen Z.

Nearly 75% of Gen Z workers say that a sense of purpose in their

jobs is more important than pay, according to research by the job site,

Monster. And meaning matters: studies show that employees who have

more fulﬁllment and meaning in their day-to-day work have higher

## productivity, greater retention, and overall greater job satisfaction.

The feedback that you give your team members has a direct impact on

day-to-day meaning. Eﬀective feedback can help imbue even the most

## mundane tasks with a deeper sense of purpose.

## HBR / Digital Article / Why Feedback Can Make Work More Meaningful

Here are three reasons why feedback can create more meaningful work,

and how you as a manager can make sure your feedback conversations

are designed for maximum meaning.

## 3 Reasons Why Feedback Creates More Meaningful Work

- 1. Feedback Helps with Mastery

Feedback — when done well — identiﬁes behaviors that an employee

can change. Feedback allows an employee to make adjustments to get

better or perfect a skill. Mastery, and the process of gaining mastery

and overcoming challenges, is a critical ingredient to meaningful work.

From a young age, humans crave mastery. Think about the two-year-old

who repeatedly tries to put two Legos together — and the sheer delight

that happens when they ﬁnally “click.” That delight can happen in the

workplace as well. A manager’s feedback aids in the pursuit of mastery

by letting the employee know what they can do to continue to improve.

How can you ensure your feedback encourages mastery? First, don’t

be afraid of assigning challenging tasks and giving feedback along the

way. Let your employee know upfront that the work might be harder

than usual, but that you’ll be providing support as they navigate it.

Next, and most importantly, refrain from taking over a task or project

when an employee is struggling. In the moment, it might feel like the

“nice” thing to do is to take over the reins, but by doing so, you’re

depriving your employee of both the joy of overcoming a challenge and

the opportunity for more meaningful work. Last, when giving feedback,

identify opportunities for your employee to apply what she learned in

tackling one challenging task to another context.

- 2. Feedback Highlights an Employee’s Impact

Well-structured feedback starts with an observation of a behavior and

then points out the impact that behavior has on an individual, a team, a

project, or an organization. This impact helps the employee understand

why their work matters, and by extension why they matter at work.

Adam Grant, an organizational psychologist, conducted a study that

showed that when call center employees better understood the impact

their work had on individuals, not only were they more productive, they

also found more satisfaction and meaning in their work.

But, it’s not just highlighting how individuals might beneﬁt from your

work that creates meaning: when an employee understands how their

work is used elsewhere in the organization, the employee ﬁnds more

## satisfaction and meaning in their day-to-day tasks.

Think about a junior employee spending all night putting together a

ﬁnancial model, only to have his boss say: “Good job” when the model’s

received. Now think about that same employee receiving an email

saying:

Thank you for the ﬁnancial model. The model, which was well-

organized, had a big impact on the meeting I had with a potential

investor. It allowed the investor to immediately understand our

forecasts and ask thoughtful questions. Partly because of this, the

investor was able to quickly decide to move forward with the

# investment.

Through this second email, the employee learned both how his

organizational skills impacted the investor, and learned about the end

results of his work — the investment was made.

To ensure that you’re always highlighting the impact in your feedback

conversations, start your feedback — both constructive and positive —

# in the following way:

- What’s the observable behavior that can be changed, adapted, or

reinforced?

- What’s the impact of that behavior? Why does this behavior matter to

## you, the organization, the team, or the client?

- 3. Feedback Helps Employees Feel Seen

According to a 2021 Grant Thornton study, 45% of workers don’t feel

that their needs are understood by their employers. Feedback lets the

employee know that they, and their work, are noticed. Even what might

be considered “negative” feedback is an opportunity for the manager to

connect and better understand the why behind someone’s behavior. A

manager might say, “I noticed that the deliverable you’ve been working

on wasn’t sent on time. Is everything okay?” Perhaps the employee

responds with their inability to prioritize tasks at that moment. Or a

lack of understanding of what the deliverable should look like. Either

way, the feedback enables the employee to be understood and seen by

# their manager.

Furthermore, a feedback conversation that ends with suggestions for

improvement signals, “I care enough about you to have thought about

what you can do to improve, grow, and develop.” It’s far more powerful

than empty praise. Psychoanalyst Stephen Grosz writes,“But isn’t this

attentiveness — the feeling that someone is trying to think about us —

something we want more than praise?” A critical ingredient to meaning

at work is the feeling of connection to others, and that you matter to

others. Feedback enables that.

You can make sure your feedback helps an employee feel seen in a

few simple ways. First, approach feedback as a conversation. Pause,

ask questions, and be curious about why your employee did something

a certain way. Second, always end a feedback conversation with

actionable ways an employee can improve to make sure the employee

knows you care about her development and growth. Make sure you take

time to answer: What are the actions the recipient of the feedback can

take to adjust, change, or reinforce a behavior?

. . .

Nearly 80% of workers would rather have a manager who helped them

ﬁnd meaning in their work than a 20% increase in pay, according

to research by Shawn Achor. But you might struggle as a manager

to understand how you can help your employees ﬁnd more meaning

in their day-to-day work. Giving feedback can help create more

## meaningful work for your employees through mastery, impact, and

# connection.
