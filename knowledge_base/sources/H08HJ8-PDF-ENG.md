John*, a talented executive at a fast-growing tech company, sat across

from Luis in a coaching session, complaining about his manager. “He

doesn’t understand our projects, has no technical expertise or strategic

vision, and he seems more like a roadblock than a leader,” he said, his

frustration palpable. John was convinced his manager was out of touch

and not adding value.

## HBR / Digital Article / When Your Manager Is Ineffective — and You Feel Stuck

John’s disdain wasn’t just a personal dislike; it was a lack of respect

that aﬀected his motivation and the team’s dynamics. This situation

is common. In our coaching practices, we’ve met professionals in

similar predicaments who struggle to like, respect, or ﬁnd value in

their managers. Like John, they might perceive incompetence or

ineﬀectiveness. Sometimes they feel threatened by the manager’s role

or authority. Other times there’s a cultural or value misalignment.

These feelings can come with a serious cost. When you dismiss,

downplay, or disrespect your manager, you are often the one who pays

the price in terms of credibility, reputation, and productivity, as Shari*,

a former client of Sarah’s, experienced. After she began questioning

the competence of her new manager, Shari actively disengaged by

distancing herself, sharing minimal details about her team’s work, and

multitasking during meetings. Where Shari had been seen as a rising

star under her previous manager, leadership started to question her

contribution and whether she was someone who could help lead the

# organization into the future.

# Strategies to Navigate the Challenge

If you ﬁnd yourself in a comparable situation to Shari or John, we advise

taking proactive steps to shift the dynamic. You may not have control

over who you report to, but you can control the beliefs, assumptions,

and narratives you create about the situation, as well as the impact of

# your behavior on those around you.

Reﬂect on what’s really bothering you.

People sometimes erroneously assume that other people (e.g. their

manager) or situations (e.g. the reporting structure) need to change for

them to be productive, engaged, and collaborative. This is a falsehood

that puts you in a victim mindset. You can still do good work whether or

not you’re enamored with your direct manager.

If you’re frustrated with or losing respect for your manager, our ﬁrst

recommendation is to pause and reﬂect. Get clear on what’s really

bothering you. Look deeper than “They don’t add any value.” Ask

# yourself:

- Is this a task issue (I don’t agree with how they do things) or a

personality issue (I don’t like this person’s style)?

- Is my manager truly incompetent or just diﬀerent than what I expected

# in a leader?

- In what ways, if any, do I feel threatened, unsupported, or overlooked?

Answer honestly — even if your insights about yourself feel

unﬂattering. With clarity around the root cause, you are better

positioned to identify next steps.

Own your part.

It’s rare that situations are fully one-sided. Emotionally mature leaders

possess the ability to take ownership and responsibility for the part

they play in a dynamic. For example, if they notice that they react

## defensively during meetings with their manager, an emotionally mature

leader will recognize that this behavior has consequences for the

# relationship.

We invite clients to look at how they may be contributing to the

situation by asking the following:

- What actions have I taken that have compounded the challenges with

# my manager?

- What is my responsibility in this situation?

- What is my resistance to my leader costing me?

# Connect to your values.

Our personal values create guardrails for how we show up in the

workplace. They support our decision-making, guide our careers, and

help others understand what we stand for.

Sometimes values conﬂicts are at the core of challenging

## relationships. For instance, imagine you value transparency and

open communication, but your manager frequently neglects to share

information or makes decisions without consulting the team. This can

## feel like a signiﬁcant misalignment with your values.

If you think a values conﬂict is at the root of your issues with your

manager, you can identify speciﬁc areas that feel most challenging and

take appropriate actions. Ask yourself:

- What are my core values?

- Where are my values not being honored?

- How can I align my actions to my values in this situation?

When John reﬂected on his relationship with his manager, he realized

that his own insecurities and expectations were at the root of his

frustrations. “When I took ownership of my responses and aligned my

actions with my values, I was able to see my manager’s value rather than

just looking for his shortcomings,” he said. “This shift has improved

our working relationship and helped me develop more resilience and

# adaptability.”

Reframe the story you’re telling yourself.

You may not agree with the reporting hierarchy. You can, however,

change your perspective and internal narrative.

Look for places where the diﬀerences with your manager are

complimentary or identify ways in which you are uniquely qualiﬁed to

support your leader. For instance, can you help ease their transition

if they’re new by teaching them about the industry, navigating

the organizational culture, or sharing insight into team dynamics.

Questions to consider are:

- In what ways do my skills diﬀer from my manager’s, and how can I

leverage those diﬀerences to create a more cohesive team?

- What challenges is my manager facing, and how can my experience

help them overcome?

- In what areas can I proactively oﬀer support where my manager might

not be fully acclimated or skilled?

When you ﬁnd common ground with your manager, you increase

productivity and improve your relationship, as well as decrease your

stress level. Identify what your manager is contributing that is unique to

# the team.

Open a dialogue with your manager.

When coming from a place of feeling that your manager doesn’t add

value, you may not be inclined to bring your concerns to light. There

is beneﬁt, however, to discussing the nature of the relationship. Most

notably, you have an opportunity to advocate for what’s important to

## you in the relationship and ﬁnd common ground.

Rather than creating an internal story about the relationship, engage

in discussion about your concerns, how you prefer to work, your

motivators, and anything else that contributes to your engagement.

When you control the narrative, you can inﬂuence the outcome.

For example, you could open the conversation with:

I’ve noticed that there are times when we are not on the same page,

and I’d like to ﬁnd ways to work better together. Would you be open to

a conversation to ensure we’re meeting each other’s needs?

If your manager agrees to the conversation, here are some questions you

can start with:

- How can we work together?

- In what areas are we in agreement?

- What are our individual deal breakers in this relationship?

# Be part of the solution.

Whether your leader is new and inherited the team, or has been in the

role for some time, they assess each member not only on skills, but

attitude as well. Look beyond your day-to-day frustrations and think

## more broadly about how your behavior contributes to your leadership

brand and the contribution you want to make. This will help you

increase your inﬂuence, promote a positive environment, and create

# business value.

Questions to help you shift to a more proactive stance are:

- What am I contributing that is additive to the team right now?

- What impact are my actions having on the rest of the team or my

# brand?

- How can I enhance the collective success of the team and/or my

# manager?

When we started writing this article we talked with Shari, who shared a

key insight that helped shift her mindset. “I was so focused on what my

new manager wasn’t doing, that I started to disengage from my team,”

she said. “Eventually I realized that by withdrawing, I was exacerbating

the problem I was complaining about. When I shifted my focus to how

I could help him, things became much smoother. Admittedly, this was

easier some days than others, but the shift in thinking improved my

## wellbeing, team interactions, and my relationship with my manager.”

If you still believe your manager is the core issue after having an honest

conversation with yourself and critical discussions with your manager,

consider taking the following actions.

- Seek support: Ask trusted colleagues and mentors for advice, seek

help from a coach, or connect with HR so you can approach the

## situation with a solutions-oriented focus.

- Evaluate your options: If the situation does not improve, it might

be time to have a critical conversation with yourself and consider

whether remaining in your current job is beneﬁcial for your career and

wellbeing. Perhaps moving on might be the best course of action.

. . .

Navigating a relationship with a manager you perceive as ineﬀective

or unqualiﬁed can be daunting, but it can also be a catalyst for

growth. Rather than allowing frustration to erode your engagement and

productivity, shift your focus to what you can control: your mindset,

# your actions, and your impact.

By choosing to collaborate rather than resist, you can preserve your

## credibility, relationships, and future opportunities in the process. True

leadership doesn’t include having the perfect manager — it’s about how

you respond when things aren’t going to plan. Facing challenges head-

on and using them as opportunities for growth will increase your ability

to navigate and even thrive in less-than-ideal circumstances.
