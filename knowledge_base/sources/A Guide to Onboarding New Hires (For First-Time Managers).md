## A Guide to Onboarding New Hires (For First-Time Managers)

Onboarding is the crucial process through which new employeesacquire the knowledge, skills, and behaviors needed to integrateinto an organization. It begins with administrative tasks (such aspaperwork) and first-day orientation, typically handled by HR.Then, there’s role-specific training (such as shadowing anotheremployee) and integration with the team (such as formal teamintroductions and informal social gatherings). This part ofonboarding, which is typically handled by the new employee’smanager, can help them build relationships, understand teamdynamics, and feel a part of the organization.If you’re new to managing people, taking on a new employee’sonboarding can be challenging. After all, you may still be figuringout your own role. But there are ways you can help your newemployees have a positive onboarding experience that will setthem up for long-term success on your team.Why (Good) Onboarding MattersA poor onboarding experience can leave employees feelinguncomfortable, confused, and dejected. A recent

survey byPaychex found that 52% of new hires feel undertrained afteronboarding, with employees of small companies (66%) andremote workers (63%) suffering the most. This, of course, impactsproductivity and retention. According to one

report, 51% ofemployees say they’d go “above and beyond” in their work if theyhad a good onboarding experience. A poor onboardingexperience, on the other hand, could make your employees lessengaged at work.

Reports show that disengaged employees costbusinesses the equivalent of 18% of their salary. And withdisengagement comes quitting — a staggering

employees plan to leave their job soon, with that numberskyrocketing to 80% for those feeling undertrained due to pooronboarding. On the flip side, only 7% of well-trained employeesplan to leave soon.Despite all of the evidence that good onboarding matters, mostmanagers and organizations don’t get it right. A recent

surveyfound that only 52% of new hires feel satisfied with theironboarding experience, with 32% finding it confusing and 22%disorganized. Remote workers fare worse, with 36% of themfinding the process baffling.

Addressing these gaps is vital for first-time managers to retaintheir teammates and maintain productivity.How to Optimize Your Onboarding ProcessManagers don’t always have control over every aspect of anemployee’s onboarding.
