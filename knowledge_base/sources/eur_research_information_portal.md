# Introduction

Following an explosion of research on inclusion and inclusive climates in an organizational context has been a growing interest in inclusive leadership. Questions about how diversity and inclusion differ, and whether inclusion is a necessary precondition for retaining an increasingly diverse workforce and leveraging its positive performance potential, are no longer of central focus. The next frontier of research has to do with how to facilitate employees’ inclusion experiences and cultivate inclusive climates. Of course, organiza- tional practices matter,but when it comes to inclusion, people’s more local and interpersonal experiences make all the difference—and herein lies the es- sential role of leaders, at every level of the organization. While senior leaders espouse the organization’s ideals, set strategy, and are responsible for de- signing policies and practices that make it more likely that employees perceive the organization as being committed to inclusion, it is lower-level leaders who are responsible for translating those espousals and policies into action (Mor Barak et al., pp. 798–839; Nishii, Khattab, Shemla & Paluch, 2018). It is up to them to implement organizational strategies andpractices in ways that actually promote everyday experiences of inclusion for employees (Nishii & Leroy, 2021). Hence, at every level, leaders are foundational to employees’ expe- riences of inclusion.

In almost every fast-growing literature, the need for construct cleanup arises as research splinters in ways that make it difﬁcult to understand whether different conceptualizations and measurement tools are meaningfully different or are instead merely different labels for essentially the same underlying construct. And when they do differ, questions about how they differ and whether they differ in practically meaningful ways soon follow. When a lit- erature becomes fractured, it becomes much more difﬁcult to understand how existing research ﬁts together and what we have collectively learned as a ﬁeld. One of our goals in this special issue was to avoid perpetuating this problem,

which is exacerbated when well-known scholars speak past each other. We sought instead to be mindful of how our perspectives on inclusive leadership ﬁt together to bring shape to a whole that, while admittedly complex, makes sense.

Despite the tendency to conceptualize leadership in terms of the set of traits, styles, or behaviors that yield desired outcomes, what emerged is a shared recognition among us that inclusive leadership is best thought of as a process (McGregor, 1944) that unfolds at multiple stages and levels of analysis (summarized in Figure 1). What we mean by this is that inclusive leadership represents more than a set of surface-level behaviors that can be learned through leadership training. Rather, it involves a dynamic and re- lational process (DeRue, 2011) in which leaders leverage the knowledge and analytical skills they have acquired related to diversity dynamics to inform the speciﬁc approaches needed of them to satisfy the needs of their followers (Morgeson, DeRue, & Karam, 2010) and promote inclusive collective-level interactions within a diverse work context (i.e., what we refer to as moderation of ﬁrst-stage relationships). It also involves “cognitive bootstrapping” (Lord & Hall, 2005), or an iterative, meta-cognitive process through which leaders reﬂect upon the outcomes of their engagement with followers (Petriglieri, Wood, & Petriglieri, 2011) to hone their responses to better address unfolding dynamics (i.e., what we refer to as moderation of second-stage relationships).

# Editorial

Interestingly, much of the prior literature on inclusive leadership is not explicitly concerned with diversity per se, though the authors of this special issue believe it ought to be (cf., Roberson & Perry pp. 755–778; Shore & Chung pp. 723–754; van Knippenberg & van Ginkel pp. 779–797). By this, we mean that it has not explicitly acknowledged that the leader behaviors required to facilitate follower experiences of inclusion may vary as a function of how followers’ diverse social identities differentially shape their experi- ences of (dis-)similarity, status dynamics, and baseline psychological safety (Chrobot-Mason, Ruderman & Nishii, 2013), nor that at the workgroup-level, leadership behaviors need to be adapted to the particular needs faced by a workgroup based on its compositional diversity and associated diversity dynamics (Holvino, Ferdman & Merrill-Sands, 2004; Homan, Gündemir, Buengeler & van Kleef, 2020; van Knippenberg & van Ginkel, pp. 779–797). We argue, however, that it is critical that scholars take into account the speciﬁc diversity dynamics that may be at play rather than espouse elements of leadership that are generic, however important they may be. It is myopic to expect that the same leadership behaviors will have the same impact across individuals and workgroups. It is more realistic to think of inclusive leadership as an adaptive process through which leaders ﬂexibly enact the person- and task-focused leadership behaviors that are needed in a particular context of diversity (cf. Homan et al., 2020).

In what follows, we describe our multi-stage, multi-level model of in- clusive leadership as moderating ﬁrst- and second-stage relationships between inputs, intrapersonal and interpersonal processes, and (proximal) outcomes at the individual, workgroup, and organizational-levels of analysis. We focus on inclusive leadership as a moderating process because there is little consistent evidence of a direct effect of individuals’ social identities or workgroup diversity on outcomes. In all cases, key moderating factors are at play (Joshi & Roh, 2009; Williams & O’Reilly, 1998; van Knippenberg, Nishii & Dwertmann, 2020), with leadership being among the most important (DiTomaso & Hooijberg, 1996; Gelfan, Nishii, Raver & Schneider, 2005; Nishii & Mayer, 2009; Nishii & Leroy, 2021). Of course, inclusive leadership involves interacting mechanisms at each level of analysis as well as across levels given the nesting of individuals (and their dyadic relationships with leaders) within workgroups (Mannix & Neale, 2005), and workgroups within organizations (Pelled, Ledrod & Mohrman, 1999). Our intention is not to offer a model of inclusive leadership that is complete, but rather one that offers valuable organizing principles for future research.

## Inclusive Leadership at the Individual-Level

Deﬁning Inclusion Inclusive leadership can be deﬁned as leadership processes that promote experiences of inclusion among followers. Although we agree with others that leadership should not be deﬁned by its outcomes (van Knippenberg & Sitkin, 2013), we nevertheless begin by exploring the deﬁnition of inclusion itself given its clear relevance for inclusive leadership. Common descriptions of inclusion refer to ensuring that everyone—regardless of their backgrounds— can bring their full selves to work, feel they belong, and are valued for what they have to offer (e.g., Ferdman, 2014; Ferdman & Davidson, 2004; Holvino et al., 2004). In their seminal paper, Shore and her colleagues (Shore, Randel, Chung, Dean, Ehrhart & Singh, 2011) drew from optimal distinctiveness theory to offer a framework for deﬁning the psychological experience of inclusion at the individual-level of analysis. According to them, people have a fundamental need to experience a sense of belonging while also maintaining, and being valued for, what makes them unique or distinctive (Brewer, 1991). These two dimensions of inclusion are assumed to be in tension to the extent that too much of one can come at the cost of the other. While the psychological state of inclusion is itself an important end goal, this operationalization is somewhat abstracted from the work context and, as such, what it means for leaders may remain fuzzy. We contend that when it comes to understanding inclusive leadership, there is a lot to be gained by conceptualizing inclusion as it relates to engaging meaningfully and strategically in goal-directed behavior at work (Locke & Latham, 1990; Wood & Bandura, 1989).

There are two theories that offer a useful lens for broadening the con- ceptualization of inclusion beyond belonging and uniqueness in a way that ﬁrmly roots it in people’s experiences at work and directly links it with work- related outcomes of interest. The ﬁrst is self-determination theory (SDT; Deci & Ryan, 2000), which is primarily concerned with understanding what drives intrinsic motivation to “seek out novelty and challenges, to extend and ex- ercise one’s capacities, to explore, and to learn” (p. 70) in pursuit of orga- nizational goals. The rich theoretical and philosophical underpinnings of SDT are focused on the conditions that enable individuals to feel like they can be and express themselves authentically, where being authentic involves in- tegration into one’s socio-relational surroundings (Ryan, 1995). SDTassumes that for people to feel autonomously motivated in their pursuit of organi- zational goals, three central needs must be satisﬁed simultaneously: belonging or relatedness (i.e., a sense of relational security), autonomy (i.e., internal locus of control over the expression of one’s thoughts and behaviors), and

# Editorial

competence (i.e., felt mastery over tasks that help bring about desired out- comes). The satisfaction of these needs helps individuals to integrate into their larger social environment and thereby experience inclusion, while the frus- tration of these needs by others deprives individuals from experiencing authenticity.

It’s important to note that the SDT perspective on need satisfaction and inclusion differs from other similar accounts (e.g., Shore et al., 2011). First, according to SDT, there is no tension between the three needs; instead, this perspective would argue that to feel belonging, one needs others to support their uniqueness (Leroy et al., pp. 798–839). Second, SDT argues that for people to be able to be authentic and autonomously motivated at work, there are three (rather than two) psychological needs that must besatisﬁed. The need for competence (van den Broeck, Ferris, Chang & Rosen, 2016; van den Broeck et al., 2008) is an especially useful addition to prior work (Shore et al., 2011) for understanding inclusion in the context of achieving organizational- related goals.

Considering the need for competence together with belonging and au- tonomy helps clarify the conditions under which someone is likely to ex- perience inclusion at work. Decades of research has established that people are prone to social categorization processes that result in superﬁcial, stereotype- based views of others. Unfortunately, for members of historically margin- alized and/or role incongruent social identities, this often means that others’ perceptions of them are colored by assumptions of incompetence (Cuddy et al., 2009; Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman, 2001). Even if on the surface their distinctiveness is visible, negative “othering” frustrates the basic need for competence, thereby impacting experiences of inclusion. In other words, being unique is risky for members of lower-statusgroups because assumptions of lower competence accompany their distinctiveness (Fiske, 2012), thereby triggering a desire to be less visible (Clair, Beatty & MacLean, 2005; Hewlin, 2009). In comparison, when status characteristics and associated assumptions of (in-)competence are invalidated in a particular context and workgroup members develop more personalized understandings of each other, members of historically marginalized groups are likely to be seen in more complex ways that align with how they see themselves (Nishii, 2013). The fulﬁllment of the basic need for competence transforms what is often negative othering— speciﬁcally, experiences of hypervisibility in which one’s differences are seen as deviant and competence is heavily scrutinized, and/or invisibility, the feeling of being chronically unseen, unappreciated, and unheard (Buchanan & Settles, 2019; McCluney & Rabelo, 2019; Settles, Buchanan & Dotson, 2019)—into positive visibility, which facilitates felt inclusion.

The second framework that helps enrich our understanding of inclusion, or what it means to bring one’s full self to work, is Kahn’s (1990) classic model of personal engagement at work and, by extension, the accumulated literature on authenticity in the workplace (Cha et al., 2019). People fully invest their cognitive, emotional, and behavioral energy into their work when they ex- perience the psychological meaningfulness, safety, and availability needed to do so. Psychological meaningfulness involves being able to contribute meaningfully and feel worthwhile at work and therefore having a reason to engage, and as such overlaps with the basic needs for competence, belonging, and autonomy. Whether people experience psychological safety to engage fully in their work depends on the social systems and work relationships in which they are embedded. When individuals feel vulnerable or unsupported lack of belonging) or experience identity threat based on others’ (i.e., stereotype-based assumptions of their incompetence, they are unable to ex- press their preferred self in their role performances because they are instead consumed with protecting themselves. Psychological availability refers to having the capacity to engage oneself fully at work unencumbered by the emotional labor associated with covering to downplay their stigmatized identity(s) (Hewlin, 2009; Roberts, 2005).

When individuals are empowered to contribute knowing that their col- leagues will see and value their competence and be interested not just in their perspectives but also what informs them (e.g., one’s social identities, past experiences), they experience both inclusion and engagement because their combined needs for autonomy, belonging, and competence are satisﬁed. When people are engaged, they bring their true thoughts and underlying identities to bear on their work (Kahn, 1990). However, when basic needs are frustrated, people defend or hide their true identities, creative thoughts, and capacities when fulﬁlling their work obligations. This is why felt inclusion at the individual-level is an essential precondition for leveraging the positive performance beneﬁts of diversity at the collective-level.

What is important is that conceptualizations of inclusion focus not only on social inclusion (i.e., belonging without having to minimize what makes one different or unique) but also on informational or task-related inclusion. In social network parlance, it is not just the “expressive” friendship ties one experiences at work, but also the “instrumental” ties—particularly the in-ties (i.e., the extent to which others turn to you as a key source of work-related advice)—thatmatter for experiences of inclusionat work(Nishii & McAlpine, 2018). Consistent with this notion, Mor Barak (2005, 2015; Mor Barak & Cherin, 1998) deﬁnes inclusion as the extent to which group members have access to information and resources and feel part of, and are invited to actively contribute to, formal and informal decision-making processes.

# Editorial

Extending this broadened deﬁnition of inclusion to the study of inclusive leadership, it is useful to remember that there are factors both in- and outside of a leader’s control that inﬂuence the extent to which followers’ needs for uniqueness, belonging, and competence are satisﬁed. Current events within the broader society, the larger organizational context, and a history of needs frustration are examples of factors outside a leader’s control. However, leaders do have control over their interactions with followers. Thus, the focus of inclusive leadership at the individual-level involves leader behaviors that enable each individual follower to experience inclusion (Randel, et al., 2018)—that is, to experience the psychological states of belonging, auton- omy, andcompetence (Figure 1,link 1a)—sothat they can perform at their best (Figure 1, link 1b). Importantly, in the context of diversity, this necessitates being aware of and proactively dismantling the barriers that systematically thwart the fulﬁllment of these needs for members of marginalized social identities. Leaders must also attend to social comparative processes—or how followers perceive their experiences relative to their workgroup peers (Figure 1, link 1c).

# Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of First-Stage Relationships (Figure 1, link 1a)

At the individual-level, the focus of inclusive leadership is the vertical re- lationship between the leader and individual followers, in particular leaders’ proactive behaviors to facilitate followers’ experiences of belonging, uniqueness, autonomy, and competence. Randel and her colleagues (Randel et al., 2018) highlight leader behaviors aimed at making workgroup members feel equitably treated, supported, and valued and providing opportunities to participate in decision-making. These correspond with the primary di- mensions of inclusive climates as environments characterized by: perceived fairness in the implementation of practices and access to valued resources (such that arbitrary status differences are delegitimized); a cultural integration of differences made possible through investments in developing personalized understandings of one another, and inclusive decision-making practices that facilitate the expression and integration of heterogeneous perspectives (Nishii, 2013). Related to the last dimension, Carmeli and colleagues (2010) focus on leaders’ readiness for consultation and encouragement of ideas for how to improve work processes, with the expectation that these behaviors help model norms of accessibility and openness.

Similarly, Roberson and Perry (pp. 755–778) describe leader behaviors to reduce status differences, cultivate a sense of shared identity among

# 689

workgroup members, and elicit member participation in decision-making processes as core to inclusive leadership. Their qualitative study of leaders’ own descriptions of inclusive leadership behaviors surfaced these themes, which also overlap with those described by Shore and Chung (pp. 723–754), who argue that leaders impact follower inclusion by purposefully enabling psychological safety, psychological empowerment, and workgroup identiﬁ- cation. Their focus on these three mechanisms aligns nicely with the expanded conceptualization of the psychological states underlying inclusion: (a) psy- chological safety is necessary for the expression of one’s unique perspectives and identities; (b) psychological empowerment enables individuals to apply their unique strengths and competencies to perform their work; and (c) workgroup identiﬁcation is foundational for belonging, albeit a cross-level mechanism. The question is how leaders enable these experiences, particu- larly within the context of diversity in which followers’ access to these experiences vary as a function of the status associated with their social identities (Chrobot-Mason et al., 2013).

We believe that a common misconception may be that inclusive leadership involves leader neutrality, or efforts to be fair by treating all followers the same; however, a generic approach fails to recognize how workgroup members’ social positions impact their experiences and can therefore per- petuate exclusion for some. This is because neutrality allows the status quo that is deﬁned by dominant narratives and assumptions to prevail. Dominant groups represent the norm around which operant assumptions are built; they also have access to greater social power, opportunities, and choices, and shape the institutional structures and cultural practices that reinforce identity-based role expectations (McCluney & Rabelo, 2019; Mohr & Purdie-Vaughns, 2015). Those who contradict them are sanctioned while those who con- form are more readily accepted. By being neutral, leaders perpetuate unequal societal structures that demand assimilation among those with non-dominant identities.

Thus, leader efforts to encourage followers to bring their authentic selves to work and contribute to decision-making (Avolio & Gardner, 2005; Leroy, Anseel, Gardner & Sels, 2015; Mor Barak & Daya, 2014), despite in principle being the right thing to do, can in effect perpetuate existing inequalities. Even if others acknowledge visible social identity differences (high uniqueness), when those social categorizations trigger superﬁcial stereotype-based as- sumptions that get in the way of more personalized connections (low be- longing) and having one’s perspectives and competencies validated (low competence and autonomy), experiences of inclusion are much less likely. In contrast, in organizational environments in which status characteristics are invalidated and people are seen in ways that are consistent with how they see

# Editorial

themselves and are not assumed to be less competent just because of their surface-level characteristics (i.e., inclusive climates, Nishii, 2013), members of historically marginalized groups are more likely to experience high au- tonomy as well as high belonging and competence—in other words, inclusion. What this means for inclusive leadership is that leaders must take the extra step of interrupting these cycles by challenging assumptions about what is normal and good and therefore who is considered role congruent and more competent, questioning role expectations that are otherwise accepted at face value and unlearning overly simplistic stereotypes about members of his- torically marginalized identity groups about whom much less tends to be understood. Leaders delegitimize arbitrary status differences (Ridgeway, 1991) and in so doing facilitate experiences of inclusion for individuals with stigmatized identities (cf. Roberson & Perry, pp. 755–778) by de- liberately doing the following: (1) investing in developing high-quality, personalized relationships with followers; (2) counteracting simplistic ster- eotypes; and (3) authorizing voice. We discuss each in turn.

Investing in Developing High-Quality, Trusting Relationships with Followers. When a leader develops a high-quality exchange relationship (LMX) with a follower that is characterized by mutual respect and trust, they signal their acceptance of, and confer high status to, the employee (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995; Liden, Erdogan, Wayne & Sparrowe, 2006). As a valued insider, they experience greater empowerment and psychological safety to voice their perspectives and engage in interpersonal risk-taking (Gomez & Rosen, 2001; Schyns, Paul, Mohr & Blank, 2005). Their trust-based relationship also affords followers greater discretion in the way they do their jobs (McClane, 1991). Furthermore, employees in high LMX relationships with their leader are more likely to believe that they are supported to apply their unique strengths and talents in the way they approach their work (Dienesch & Liden, 1986); as a result, they have the opportunity to enjoy higher levels of engagement and well-being and perform at their personal best (Keenan & Mostert, 2013; van Woerkom, Bakker & Nishii, 2016; Wood et al., 2011). Finally, since workgroup leaders are seen as important representatives of the workgroup, being treated as an insider by the leader contributes to an individual’s identiﬁcation with the workgroup (Tyler & Lind, 1992). Therefore, an important component of inclusive leadership is to invest in developing high-quality, one-on-one re- lationships with workgroup members (Roberson & Perry, pp. 755–778).

Particularly important in the context of diverse groups is the fact that when a leader develops a high-quality, trust-based relationship with a follower, they provide “safe passages” (DiTomaso & Hooijberg, 1996, p. 170) for that employee by triggering workgroup members to comply with leader-

# 691

# 692

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

established norms about their value, thereby enhancing others’ perceptions of the employee as a member of the ingroup (Elsass & Graves, 1997; Nishii & Mayer, 2009; Scandura, 1999). Trust-based relationships are built through mutual active listening, a process that enables the leader to develop a per- sonalized understanding of the follower that (a) reduces the leader’s reliance on stereotypic assumptions about the follower (Ensari & Miller, 2006), thereby minimizing identity threat (van Dijk, Meyer, van Engen & Loyd, 2017) and validating the follower’s distinctiveness (McCormick, 1999); (b) reveals their unique strengths (van Woerkom et al., 2016); and (c) bestows ingroup status. By establishing high-quality relationships with followers with historically marginalized identities, leaders challenge existing assumptions about the relationship between social identities and competence, and in so doing delegitimize arbitrary status hierarchies and improve followers’ ex- periences of inclusion vis-`a-vis the leader as well as workgroup members (Nishii & Mayer, 2009). This indirect inﬂuence of the leader on followers’ experiences of inclusion manifests through the quality of the horizontal re- lationships among workgroup members: interpersonal treatment by work- group members that mirrors the high-quality, trust-based leader-follower relationship tends to be characterized by social and informational inclusion (Mor Barak, 2017), and the absence of micro-aggressions (Sue, 2010).

Counteracting Simplistic Stereotypes. In the absence of leader intervention, individuals who belong to higher-status social identity groups and/or reﬂect the cultural default and therefore are perceived as being high in both com- petence and warmth, are facilitated by others (Cuddy, Fiske & Glick, 2007; 2011). In contrast, individuals who belong to identity groups that are seen as comparatively lower in competence and/or warmth are harmed—they are treated in ways that reinforce negative stereotypes, for example, by being avoided, distrusted, given little room to contribute, and even treated with hostility. However, when individuals are motivated to attend to a target’s attributes in a more nuanced way they notice and accept stereotype- disconﬁrming information, allowing initial stereotype-based attributions and corresponding behaviors to fade (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990). By learning individuating information about followers—for example, about their unique strengths, competencies, and views—and making it visible to other work- group members such that they rely on this information instead of superﬁcial assumptions, leaders can interrupt stereotype-based interaction patterns (van Dijk et al., 2017). In so doing, leaders play an important role in ﬂipping negative othering (wherein social categorization processes perpetuate hy- pervisibility and invisibility; McCluney & Rabelo, 2019) to positive visibility. requires being aware of one’s own stereotype-based Doing this well

assumptions about workgroup members’ competencies (Cuddy, Wilmuth & Carney, 2012; Eagly & Karau, 2002) and interrupting stereotype-conﬁrming cognitive biases (Fiske & Neuberg, 1990) such as conﬁrmation (Nickerson, 1998), likability (Heilman, 2001; Heilman & Wallen, 2010), and attribution (Hewstone, 1990; Pettigrew, 1979) biases.

A critical function of inclusive leaders is thus to actively counteract stereotype-based status dynamics that have a silencing effect on minoritized workgroup members who would otherwise face pressures to conform to the dominant majority. Members of historically marginalized groups are more likely to voice their opinions and be taken seriously when they have ascribed status—or are perceived to have expertise (Thomas-Hunt, Ogden & Neale, 2003). By publicly acknowledging the expertise of minority members, leaders help reduce perceived risks to voicing. Research that shows that disagreement expressed by two members is less likely to be discounted than that expressed by a single member (Larson, Sargis & Bauman, 2004; Mugny & Papastamou, 1980) provides further support of the important role leaders play in promoting psychological safety and voice among minority members by validating their dissenting perspectives.

Authorizing voice. Workgroup members who experience the psychological safety to voice their perspectives and feel that the perspectives that they voice are valued, inform decision-making, and shape workgroup norms are more likely to experience inclusion (Pelled et al., 1999). Leaders are in a position to authorize voice (i.e., who has voice), and the way they respond inﬂuences the perceived legitimacy of voiced perspectives (Detert & Burris, 2007). Among the earliest operationalizations of inclusive leadership, offered by Nembhard and Edmondson (2006), was centered around the importance of providing voice; they deﬁned inclusive leadership as leader actions to empower em- ployees by including them in decision-making, regardless of background.

However, leaders must understand that behaviors that promote psycho- logical safety for members of the dominant majority may be insufﬁcient for individuals who experience barriers to psychological safety and voice based on the hypervisibility and/or invisibility of their stigmatized identity(s). Members of majority groups beneﬁt from positive stereotypes of competence (Cuddy et al., 2007, 2009bib_Cuddy_et_al_2009bib_Cuddy_et_al_2007; Fiske, 2012), views and values that are more likely to align with the dominant narratives of the organization (Rosette, Leonardelli & Phillips, 2008), and ways of being and doing that effortlessly reﬂect the norm. Therefore, the mere suggestion by leaders that their input is welcome (Carmeli, Reiter-Palmon & Ziv, 2010; Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006; Roberson & Perry, pp. 755–778) may be enough for them to experience inclusion, whereas the same is less

likely to be true for members of historically marginalized identity groups who have internalized the risks associated with being subjected to negative stereotypes about their competence and perceived as deviant from role ex- pectations (Cha et al., 2019; Eagly & Karau, 2002; Heilman, 2012). This is evident in research which has found that the relationship between diversity climate and psychological safety is stronger for minorities (Singh, Winkel & Selvarajan, 2013), suggesting that it is easier for majority group members to experience psychological safety because organizational life is built around dominant narratives.

To counteract this pattern, leaders need to actively invite input from minoritized workgroup members, and more importantly, role model listening to and afﬁrming rather than dismissing voiced perspectives. Furthermore, when leaders invest in direct dialogue with followers about their ideas, in- cluding to understand the identity-related experiences that have shaped those insights, they enable felt identify freedom (i.e., that their uniqueness is valued; Chrobot-Mason & Aramovitch, 2013). The more followers see themselves in work-related decision-making, the greater their sense of psychological em- powerment and likelihood they will identify with the workgroup.

# Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of Second-Stage Relationships (Figure 1, link 1b)

The moderating role of inclusive leadership in the second stage of individual- level relationships in Figure 1 is meant to capture the fact that effective inclusive leadership necessitates continual observation and monitoring of follower experiences, followed by iteration. Assessing followers’ experiences involves soliciting direct feedback as well as careful observation of work- group dynamics and interpersonal behaviors that might indicate that some workgroup members may not be experiencing full inclusion as hoped. Leaders need to be especially attuned to evidence that workgroup members may be experiencing micro-aggressions or other forms of negative othering. This necessitates a capacity to empathize, or to read and respond to affective cues (Sternberg, 1985). Within the context of diverse groups, it involves listening carefully for verbal and nonverbal evidence that might indicate that in- dividuals’ experiences of a situation and/or reactions to policies and practices vary based on their social identities (Nishii et al., 2018; Mor Barak et al., pp. 840–871) and engage in the perspective taking needed to understand why. Ultimately, the goal is for leaders to utilize their observations and inter- pretations to reﬁne and expand their understanding of social identities and their embeddedness in social structures, as well as strategies for responding to

# Editorial

diversity dynamics, so that they can adapt their behaviors to promote better inclusion outcomes for their followers. In other words, effective inclusive leadership involves meta-cognition, or thinking about how to adjust and expand one’s behavioral strategies as needed by a particular situation.

## Cross-level: Social Comparisons Within the Workgroup (Figure 1, link 1c)

Theories of social comparison (Adams, 1963; Festinger, 1954) suggest that individuals are sensitive to cues from their social environment about the degree to which they—relative to others—are treated fairly and as an insider. When a leader treats only some followers as ingroup members, outgroup members feel unfairly treated (Scandura, 1999) and dissatisﬁed (McClane, 1991). In diverse groups, differentiated leader treatment is particularly dangerous when it ritualizes status hierarchies that are imported from the broader societal context (Ridgeway & Correll, 2006). In contrast, when they leaders develop similarly high-quality relationships with followers, neutralize status differentials and make it more likely for group members to accept each other as equals. Furthermore, researchby Nishii andMayer (2009) suggests that people compare how they are treated by their leader to how coworkers are treated overall. When individuals perceive that they are treated comparatively worse than their peers, their self-esteem and morale suffer because they are more likely to make self-attributions for the differential treatment. If many other coworkers also appear to have low-quality rela- tionships with the leader, it can more easily be attributed to poor leadership and therefore its impact is less detrimental. Overall, because diverse groups are predisposed to experience negative power dynamics, members are more sensitive to leader differentiation than is the case in homogeneous groups.

## Inclusive Leadership at the Workgroup-Level

Much of the past research on inclusive leadership (albeit still limited) has focused on leader interactions with their followers, for example, behaviors that foster psychological safety and invite active contributions (i.e., vertical interactions), and much less on the important role that leaders play in shaping coworker interactions (i.e., horizontal interactions). How a leader interacts with, validates, and empowers individual followers (and the pattern across them) has important bottom-up implications for workgroup functioning, but shaping aggregate individual experiences is not the same as engaging in team leadership. Team leadership refers to the inﬂuence of leaders on workgroup

processes and performance. Surprisingly, many theories of inclusive lead- ership do not focus at all on the workgroup-level of analysis (e.g., Carmeli, et al., 2010) even though diversity itself is a unit-level construct. In many cases, the individual- versus workgroup-level referents of inclusive leadership are confounded.

Team leadership theories are rooted in the functional leadership perspective according to which the responsibility of workgroup leaders is to set groups up with what they need for successful collective functioning (DeChurch & Marks, 2006; Hackman & Wageman, 2005; Lord, Wang, Phillips & Lount, 2017). More speciﬁcally, team leadership involves attention to a group’s task- and person-oriented needs during the two dominant phases of team activity: transition and action (Marks, Mathieu & Zaccaro, 2001). The transition phase (Figure 1, link 2a) involves planning for the action phase by establishing workgroup norms, developing a shared understanding of workgroup goals, structuring roles and responsibilities, and sensemaking about critical events and workgroup experiences (Morgeson, 2010). During the action phase (Figure 1, link 2b), leader attention focuses on monitoring the workgroup’s performance and challenging the workgroup to engage in re- ﬂection to continuously improve team self-management (Morgeson et al., 2010).

However, as we arguedbefore,any theoryof inclusiveleadership shouldbe concerned speciﬁcally with diversity, including at the workgroup-level of analysis, though this has by and large not been the case (cf. van Knippenberg & van Ginkel, pp. 779–797). We know from decades of research on diversity that workgroup diversity is associated with both negative interpersonal dy- namics based on social categorization processes and stereotyping as well as superior performance when workgroups are able to successfully leverage the beneﬁts of informational diversity (Dwertmann, Nishii & van Knippenberg, 2016; van Knippenberg & Schippers, 2007; van Knippenberg & van Ginkel, pp. 779–797). When workgroup members respond negatively to diverse others, they disrupt information elaboration processes (van Knippenberg, Haslam & Platow, 2007).

What this implies is that inclusive leadership at the workgroup-level in- volves behaviors that mitigate negative group processes as well as those that catalyze positive ones, with the relative importance of each being informed by the circumstances faced by a diverse workgroup (Homan et al., 2020). In fact, research on workgroup diversity suggests that models of inclusive leadership that focus on one or the other but not both—for example, treatments of in- clusive leadership that focus primarily on efforts to welcome diverse voices in decision-making (e.g., Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006) without taking into account how negative diversity dynamics can get in the way—are therefore

incomplete. Similarly, theories of inclusive leadership that focus primarily on preventing negative interactions such as bias and discrimination are also incomplete in that preventing intergroup tensions alone is insufﬁcient for promoting positive outcomes because workgroups will only engage in the elaboration and integration of diverse information if they are motivated to do so (van Knippenberg & van Ginkel, pp. 779–797).

Thus, inclusive team leadership has to do with how leaders: (a) proactively shape their workgroup’s understanding of their diversity and establish shared mental maps, norms, and social connections that enable them to effectively leverage their diversity for knowledge creation while also minimizing in- tergroup tensions (Figure 1, link 2a) and (b) react to group processes once they have been activated (Figure 1, link 2b). We describe each in turn below.

Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of First-Stage Relationships at the Workgroup-Level (Figure 1, link 2a)

Research on diversity has established that demographic dissimilarity is often associated with lower-levels of social integration and psychological attach- ment (O’Reilly, Caldwell & Barnett, 1989; Tsui, Egan & O’Reilly, 1992). The more workgroup members identify with their workgroup as a whole, the less likely it is for subgroup identiﬁcation to negatively impact group processes (Huo, 2003). There are two broad categories of inclusive leadership behaviors needed to counteract these tendencies whilst also motivating the workgroup to interact in ways that enable them to leverage workgroup diversity for syn- ergistic performance outcomes. The ﬁrst broad category is more task-focused and involves developing shared cognition about the what and how of the group’s work, and the second, more person-focused category involves pro- moting strong social connections (particularly across difference).

Often, teams jump right into taskwork without taking time to develop a shared understanding of how they will manage their teamwork, where the latter has to do with how group members work together (e.g., decision- making, conﬂict resolution, coordinating action, roles and responsibilities; Marks et al., 2001). The latter is essential, however, for helping group members develop transactive memory and internalize shared mental models for group functioning, which in turn facilitate collective identity and provide a basis for group cohesion, collaboration, and superior performance (Kozlowski & Bell, 2013; Salas & Fiore, 2004; Sivunen, 2006). This is especially true in diverse groups.

Advocating for Diversity Mindsets. Within the context of diverse groups, a core function of inclusive leadership is to help workgroups leverage their cognitive and experiential diversity to achieve synergistic performance outcomes. For this, workgroup members need to develop shared cognition about their group’s diversity and how to engage effectively with it; just because a group has diverse resources at its disposal does not mean that they will optimize it. To the extent that the workgroup context is experienced as intolerant of divergentperspectives, individuals may be unwilling to incur the psychosocial risks of voicing. As a general rule, humans tend to prefer cognitive con- sistency or congruence over incongruity, and this preference makes people more likely to focus on commonly held information at the expense of sharing unique information (Stasser & Stewart, 1992; Wittenbaum et al., 1999), and even avoid communicating with people who hold differing opinions alto- gether (Rosenbaum, 1986). Leaders play a critical role in advocating for diversity mindsets to motivate group members to resist the natural tendency to prefer similarity and push away distinctiveness and instead maintain an open mind when interacting with others (Roberson & Perry, pp. 755–778).

They do this by advocating for diversity mindsets, or the understanding that the constructive exchange and elaboration of diverse perspectives is essential for synergistic outcomes (van Knippenberg & van Ginkel, pp. 779– 797). Shared diversity mindsets make it less likely for social categorization processes to inhibit the elaboration of diverse task-relevant information be- cause they provide the motivation needed to engage in accurate impression formation instead of relying on simplistic and inaccurate stereotypes. Fur- thermore, by cultivating the expectation that group members strive to learn from each other, leaders make it more likely that they will challenge their assumptions, respond more openly to discrepant views, and expand their capacity to generate better decisions and solutions. This is what Leroy and his colleagues (Leroy et al., pp. 798–839) found: in the absence of leader ad- vocacy for diversity mindsets, attempts to leverage the beneﬁts of diversity in decision-making are less effective, and in some cases, negatively associated with team creativity because of members’ lower inclusion in their teams.

Advocacy for diversity mindsets involves sharing the leader’s own un- derstanding of how the group’s diversity is important for its work (Leroy et al., pp. 798–839; van Knippenberg & van Ginkel, pp. 779–797). Similarly, Nishii and Leroy (2021) argue that an important ﬁrst step to engineering an inclusive workgroup climate is to connect rather generic organizational messages about inclusion with more tangible task-related goals; that is, to articulate what inclusion means, what it looks like, and how it relates to the achievement of the group’s goals and day-to-day activities. Leaders strengthen the sharedness of diversity mindsets by guiding their groups through information elaboration

experiences; they do so by actively inviting diverse input and participating in its integration and by role modeling it themselves (Nishii & Leroy, 2021). Leader instruction and role modeling, followed by ongoing coaching and reinforcement, helps ensure that group members understand how to enact diversity mindsets effectively.

Using a social networks approach, Nishii and her colleagues (Nishii & McAlpine, 2018) found that higher levels of information elaboration in in- clusive climates are explained by the fact that workgroup members have proportionately more instrumental ties with racially dissimilar coworkers (i.e., it is more likely for people to recognize and leverage the competence of racial outgroup members than in less inclusive climates). In their study, they asked employees to self-report the quality of each of their workgroup relationships, measured in terms of the extent to which they feel they can be their true selves, can safely disagree with the other person, and the degree to which the re- lationship is based on trust. Interestingly, their data suggest that while the quality of instrumental ties with racially dissimilar others is sensitive to the inclusiveness of the workgroup climate, the quality of friendship ties with dissimilar others, and the quality of both instrumental and friendship ties with similar others, are not. Moreover, their data suggest that the inclusiveness of the climate has a larger impact on the extent to which white employees—as compared to racial minorities—report racially dissimilar coworkers as competent sources of key work-related insights. What this suggests is that when inclusive leaders advocate for diversity mindsets as part of their climate engineering behaviors, they positively impact workgroup processes by making it more likely for minority workgroup members to be included in information networks that are instrumental to the group’s work.

Developing Team Charters. A common theme across conceptualizations of inclusive leadership (e.g., Carmeli et al., 2010; Nembhard & Edmondson, 2006; Randel et al., 2018; Roberson & Perry, pp. 755–778; Shore & Chung, pp. 723–754) is the importance of leader actions to promote the participation of all members in decision-making; that is,to distribute decision-makingvoice across workgroup members. Inclusive leadership behaviors at the individual- level (described above) serve as important building blocks for facilitating the participation of all group members in group information elaboration by au- thorizing voice broadly and validating the distinctiveness of group members. Nevertheless, in the absence of structures to guide effective teamwork, groups are more likely to experience conﬂict and other dysfunctional interpersonal processes—this is true of all teams (Mathieu & Rapp, 2009), but even more so of diverse teams (Homan et al., 2020).

# 699

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

Leaving teamwork up to chance allows dominance dynamics and mis- understandings to limit the openness with which group members share their task-related ideas and coordinate their activities. Groups that proactively plan how they will attain their chosen objectives by developing a team charter enjoy greater success (Mathieu & Rapp, 2009). Thus, an important function of inclusive leadership is to reinforce their advocacy of diversity mindsets by guiding group members through a structured team chartering exercise early in the group’s lifecycle. Chartering involves identifying group members’ strengths and work style preferences and incorporating that information to come to agreement about members’ roles and responsibilities and how the team will surface diverse perspectives, resolve disagreements, and make decisions. Identifying the competencies and unique strengths of individual members helps optimize the potential outcomes of diversity mindsets by making the group’s diversity visible (Leroy et al., pp. 798–839). This in turn helps prepare workgroup members for disagreement, thereby making them more open to engaging in information elaboration (Loyd, Wang, Phillips, & Lount, 2013). Moreover, to the extent that they perceive that they are united by shared goals, workgroup members tend to be more open to individuating information (Gonzalez & Brown, 2006).

the importance of de- include agreement about correlating individual-level cognitive biases by soliciting independent input prior to a group discussion. Doing so helps the group to identify more al- ternative perspectives about an issue compared to open group discussion in which the ideas that are considered can become anchored in ideas that are shared early or byhigher-status group members. Other examples of interaction rules that can be established through chartering to improve communication in diverse workgroups include consistently making time for nonwork con- versations, listening with empathy, and rephrasing what one hears from other to conﬁrm understanding. Research by Earley and group members Mosakowski (2000) found that diverse workgroups that develop such norms to govern interpersonal interactions report higher workgroup identi- ﬁcation and efﬁcacy.

# An example might

Chartering also involves role clariﬁcation or understanding about who is responsible for which aspects of the group’s work. Here, inclusive leadership necessitates careful attention to fairness in the allocation of roles and access to opportunities (Nishii, 2013) and ﬁt between members’ strengths and the roles and tasks for which they are responsible. It also represents an opportunity for leaders to be purposeful about arranging interlocking roles and responsibilities to increase interdependence among group members to motivate personalized person-perception (Rudman, 1998). Finally, chartering allows leaders to facilitate a discussion about the situational contingencies that might alter

decision-making processes. Doing so guards against the possibility that members will misinterpret instances in which they have less inﬂuence in decision-making as evidence of a lack of inclusion because they can ap- propriately attribute different leader-initiated interaction patterns to strategic rather than personal reasons.

Co-Creating Superordinate Workgroup Identities. Workgroup diversity is more likely to be positively linked to learning and creative performance when workgroup identiﬁcation is high (Chatman, Polzer, Barsade & Neale, 1998; van der Vegt & Bunderson, 2005), or when workgroup members enjoy feeling distinctive yet connected by a shared identity. This is because when a su- perordinate workgroup identity is salient, members are more likely to see past initial social category-based judgments of each other and engage in greater cooperation (van Dijk et al., 2017). Unfortunately, whereas shared identities and pre-existing commonalities make it easy for a uniﬁed and shared workgroup culture to emerge in homogenous groups, this is not true in diverse groups wherein social categorization processes create subgroups, status hi- erarchies are easily perpetuated, and members have different expectations about how members should act and interact. In diverse groups it is often more challenging for members of historically marginalized groups to identify fully with the workgroup and/or organization, and therefore to experience be- longing. This is especially true when sanctioned mores and dominant nar- ratives reﬂect monolithic cultural ideals that do not accurately reﬂect their personally endorsed values and lived experiences, thereby making it difﬁcult to identify with them without causing internal conﬂict (Ryan, Connell & Deci, 1995).

Leaders have an important role to play in guiding the purposeful de- velopment of a hybrid or multicultural superordinate identity, or an emergent set of shared workgroup-speciﬁc norms and values that members develop and enact through their interactions (Earley & Mosakowski, 2000). The way that leaders attend and respond to critical incidents, and speciﬁcally how they engage in sensemaking with group members matters enormously for the group values that are reinforced (Morgeson et al., 2010). To the extent that leaders intentionally share in meaning-making with their followers, hybrid or mul- ticultural superordinate identities are more likely to emerge. Because hybrid cultures are co-produced by workgroup members, individuals with histori- cally marginalized identities experience higher superordinate identiﬁcation than in workgroups with monolithic cultures (Cox, 1993). Indeed, experi- encing holistic belonging requires that the identity of the group—including its norms and values—be deﬁned in such a way that a person can see themselves in it (Turner, 1985).

Successfully cultivating a multicultural superordinate identity with which all group members can identify is complicated by the fact that neutrality on the part of leaders allows power and privilege dynamics (which are silencing for minoritized individuals) to be maintained. Instead, inclusive leaders actively interrupt these dynamics by creating opportunities: (a) to question and unpack dominant narratives so that people (including themselves) are able to un- derstand the origins of these narratives and (b) for people to share coun- is normal or best ternarratives that challenge assumptions about what (Routenberg, Thompson & Waterberg, 2013). Leaders who create “holding environments” in which counternarratives can be voiced and explored provide the opportunity for truly multicultural meanings to emerge (Petriglieri & Petriglieri, 2010). By presenting and inviting counternarratives, leaders offer safety and validation forgroup members whose experiences are reﬂected more in the counternarratives than dominant, taken for granted narratives. Effective leader strategies include asking someone who voices a dominant narrative where they may have learned this perspective, inviting observations and reactions from others, then challenging group members to offer alternative perspectives and possible explanations for why people might hold them (Routenberg, et al., 2013). Leaders can also push group members to reﬂect on the patterns evident in what has or has not been discussed, and in so doing make it normative for group members to search for untold stories and question traditionally unquestioned assumptions about how things are done, by whom, and why. By not just being willing to invite divergent perspectives but actively making it their priority to create space for group members to collectively listen and reﬂect, leaders create the safety needed for diverse voices to shape the group’s shared understanding of themselves.

Investing in Developing Cross-Boundary Connections and Understanding. Among the earlier studies on workgroup diversity to demonstrate the value of investing indevelopingsocialconnectionsacrossdiverseworkgroupmemberswerethose by Harrison and colleagues (Harrison, Price & Bell, 1998; Harrison, Price, Gavin & Florey, 2002), who showed that the negative relationship between surface-level, demographic diversity, and outcomes such as group cohesion and performance weakens over time. Social integration is essential for helping workgroups bridge the diversity among them without negating the distinc- tiveness of individual workgroup members and the value inherent therein (Brewer, 1991). As strong relational ties are cultivated across difference, group members develop more complex and personalizedcategorizations of coworkers that weaken potential faultlines (Lau & Murnighan, 1998) and make them more attuned to, and accepting of, one another’s distinctiveness (Larkey, 1996). Importantly, in workgroups characterized by weak social ties, people are less

willing and motivated to voice discrepant perspectives for fear of triggering conﬂict or even ostracism (Dutton & Heaphy, 2003; Gruenfeld, Mannix, Williams & Neale, 1996). In contrast, research suggests that information is absorbed more completely (Wenger, 2000) and people are better able to open up to diverse viewpoints (Carmeli, Brueller & Dutton, 2009) in the safety of positive relationships (Spreitzer et al., 2005).

Thus, a group’s social capital represents a crucial emergence-enabling state that determines whether individual-level perspectives, expertise, and unique strengths result in value-creating synergies rather than conﬂict. More speciﬁcally, as described by Ray, Nyberg and Maltarich (in press), the denser the network ties in a group, the less likely it is for information to remain siloed in subgroups, and the easier it is for members to synchronize their behaviors and enforce norms through regular communication. Furthermore, the more existing social ties are characterizedby likingandgoodwill (i.e.,relational social capital),thegreaterthe willingness of group members to help each other and work productively through conﬂict. Finally, a group’s cognitive social capital, or the extent to which systems of meaning are shared, has a positive impact on how effectively members communicate and understand each other and coordinate their behaviors. Not surprisingly, social capital characteristics are even more important for synergistic performance outcomes to emerge in diverse groups (Ray et al., in press).

A critical function of inclusive leadership for optimizing the group’s ability to avoid conﬂict and engage in information elaboration is therefore to pri- oritize building strong, personalized relationships within the workgroup (Mor Barak, 2017; Nishii, 2013). Because processing individuating information requires more cognitive resources than relying on efﬁcient, stereotype-based thinking, it is important for leaders to proactively provide the time and space needed for workgroup members to discover individuating information about each other. As Roberson and Perry (pp. 755–778) found, leaders do this in part by highlighting what is shared or similar among workgroup members and cultivating regular team interactions.

# Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of Second-Stage Relationships (Figure 1, link 2b)

Inclusive leadership requires leaders to adapt their behaviors based on ob- servations of emergent diversity dynamics (cf. Homan et al., 2020). This involves internal reﬂection or meta-cognition on the part of the leader about their effectiveness in cultivating inclusive climates (Nishii & Leroy, 2021) as well as their efforts to spur members to engage in team reﬂexivity. Related to information elaboration, van Knippenberg and van Ginkel (pp. 779–797)

# 703

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

argue that stimulating team reﬂexivity about their information elaboration experiences—as a means of strengthening the team’s understanding of how to improve their interaction processes to better leverage their diverse in- formational resources—is an essential element of inclusive leadership.

To the extent leaders observe negative interaction dynamics related to workgroup diversity, a critical function of inclusive leadership is to motivate workgroup members to change their behaviors by helping them to discover the role that they play in exacerbating the problems they wish to avoid (Stroh, 2015). This might involve helping them to see the unintended negative consequences of their behaviors, how they co-create the workgroup expe- rience, and that they need to work together to adjust norms to overcome undesired patterns to achieve shared goals.

## Inclusive Leadership at the Organizational-level

At the organizational-level, inclusion has to do with how the demographic composition of an organization’s workforce is reﬂected in its core decision- making and social networks (Mor Barak, 2017) and distribution of power, resources, and opportunities such that it is able to fully optimize the potential inherent in its diverse human capital resources. There are a range of orga- nizational outcomes of scholarly and practical interest. Favorable outcomes derived from synergistic interactions include innovation and competitive advantage (van Knippenberg et al. 2020), legitimacy to key stakeholders (Perry-Smith & Blum, 2000), and associated shareholder returns (Arthur, 2003). In addition, organizations that are successful at promoting inclusion also enjoy reputational advantages (i.e., being seen as an employer of choice), are more successful at retaining and advancing their diverse talent (i.e., managerial diversity), and are less likely to be charged with legal discrimi- nation suits (Nishii et al., 2018).

As is true at the workgroup-level of analysis, the relationship between an organization’s diversity and these outcomes is dependent on important moderating factors, many of which are controlled by leaders—for example, the inclusiveness of the climate. It is up to senior leaders to communicate the organization’s inclusion strategy and vision through their public espousals and, more importantly, through the structures, policies, and processes they put in place to enact that strategy (Hambrick & Mason, 1984). Lower-level leaders are in turn responsible for connecting the organization’s inclusion strategies to their everyday work—in particular how they manage their teams and in- dividual followers. Interestingly, as Mor Barak and her colleagues (pp. 840– 871) point out, there is very little research on inclusive leadership at the organizational-level.

# Editorial

Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of First-Stage Relationships at the Organizational-Level (Figure 1, link 3a) While espousal of an organization’s commitment to inclusion is easy, leading in ways that ensures that this commitment is enacted in visible, reliable, and consistent ways is not (Simons, Leroy & Nishii, pp. 798–839). Senior leaders who create meaningful inclusive policies and hold managers throughout the organization accountable for implementing them will more successfully foster inclusive leadership among workgroup leaders and reduce perceived de- coupling between the organization’s espoused and enacted inclusion strategy (Mor Barak et al., pp. 840–871).

Articulating and Designing the Organization’s Inclusion Strategy. Senior leaders are responsible for guiding their organization’s diversity and inclusion strategy and designing policies and practices that support that strategy (Boal & Hooijberg, 2000; Mor Barak et al., pp. 840–871). Doing so effectively is predicated onthe understanding thattraditional diversity management policies and practices (i.e., equal employment opportunity) are themselves necessary but insufﬁcient for promoting the synergistic outcomes associated with in- clusion (van Knippenberg et al. 2020), as most diversity practices are not focused on transforming the socio-relational context that shape’s people’s experiences at work(Nishii, 2013; Nishii et al. 2018).Unfortunately,however, while the ubiquity of means-end decoupling—that is, when policies are decoupled from what is needed to achieve desired goals (or ends; Bromley & Powell, 2012)—has been noted by others (Green & Kalev, 2008; Nishii et al. 2018; van Knippenberg et al. 2020), there is little research that speaks to the organizational policies and practices that would be best for stimulating the development of quality cross-boundary relationships and the open exchange and integration of divergent ideas.

The core elements of inclusive leadership described at the individual- and workgroup-levels of analysis offer insights about ways to expand the set of organizational practices that are adopted by organizational leaders into the policies and practices that would be valuable to adopt as part of their inclusion strategy. In order to foster the development of inclusive climates throughout the organization, senior leaders need to provide managers with the tools and the motivation to engineer inclusive climates (Nishii & Leroy, 2021) through a combination of carefully designed training, evaluation, and reward struc- tures. To further promote synergistic interaction processes, the organization’s selection, training, and evaluation processes should focus on the competencies that are required for value creation, such as the ability to coordinate and leverage the unique strengths and competencies of employees through

# 705

# 706

effective teamwork, conﬂict resolution and information elaboration (van Knippenberg et al. 2020). These should be coupled with protocols for pro- cess accountability that hold groups accountable for how they arrive at de- cisions; such protocols make it more likely for groups to share voice and exert the effort needed to explore and integrate diverse cognitive perspectives (Lerner & Tetlock, 1999; Scholten, van Knippenberg, Nijstad & De Dreu, 2007).

teams and rotational programs should be utilized to provide opportunities for cross-boundary interactions and outcome dependence (Kalev, 2009). Employee/business resource groups may also be valuable to the extent that they are explicitly designed to offer opportunities for meaningful interactions and outcome dependence among employees across roles, levels, and other organizational boundaries. Given what is known about how employee reactions to policies are inﬂuenced by how their adoption is rationalized (Nishii et al. 2018), it is important for senior leaders to draw a clear line of sight to the organization’s inclusion strategy and collective well-being. Finally, by adopting bundles of aligned inclusion-focused practices rather than standalone practices, senior leaders enhance their perceived credibility and authenticity and reinforce the message that the organization is serious about its commitment to inclusion (Nishii et al. 2018).

## Furthermore, structures such as cross-functional

Formalizing Accountability. In addition to taking actions to avoid means-end decoupling, another critical function of inclusive senior leadership is to minimize policy-practice decoupling (Mor Barak et al., pp. 840–871) by strengthening felt motivational signiﬁcance for implementation among leaders throughout levels of the organization. Motivational signiﬁcance de- pends on whether practice implementers perceive the espoused policies to be well suited for the attainment of shared goals and how vigilantly the im- plementation of those policies is monitored (Nishii et al. 2018). The more formalized the practices and the greater the accountability for practice im- plementation, the more likely it is for managers to enact practices as intended, thereby sending less ambiguous messages about what the practices mean for employees (Nishii et al., 2018; Nishii & Leroy, 2021). Espousals of an or- ganization’s commitment to inclusion and broad adoption of inclusion- focused practices could in fact backﬁre in the absence of accountability if the belief that they are indeed inclusive frees managers up to behave on the contrary (Castilla & Benard, 2010).

Mor Barak and her colleagues (pp. 840–871) offer an analysis of how policy-practice decoupling can occur both within the senior-leadership level of organizations, as well as between levels involving leader espousals and

# Editorial

enactments at lower-levels of the organization. The more senior leaders’ own actions are aligned with their espousals, the less likely it is that practice implementation by lower-level leaders will be decoupled. Through their own role modeling, senior leaders help to reduce ambiguity about, and increase internalization of (Wood& Bandura, 1989), the inclusiveleadership behaviors that are expected of lower-level leaders. Finally, senior leaders facilitate effective practice implementation by articulating the informal leadership behaviors that are needed to support practices (Nishii et al. 2018). For ex- ample, LGBTQIA-friendly policies tend to be more impactful when leader behaviors reinforce their underlying intent, for example, by ensuring that employees feel that their same-sex partners are wholly welcomed at company social events (Ragins & Cornwell, 2001).

As Mor Barak and her colleagues (pp. 840–871) warn, it is important for leaders to keep in mind that perceived decoupling is more likely among individuals with marginalized identities, who will be more critical of im- plemented inclusion practices. The consequences associated with such per- ceptions of decoupling are evident in research that shows that climate as perceived by minority employees is a critical determinant of diversity’s positive performance effects—when only majority group members perceive the environment to be inclusive, diversity is negatively associated with performance (Ely, Padavic & Thomas, 2012).

Inclusive Leadership as a Moderator of Second-Stage Relationships at the Organizational-Level (Figure 1, link 3b)

In order to understand which practices are more effective at achieving in- clusion goals and in what combination, senior leaders need to carefully monitor relevant data. Accountability structures not only help ensure that lower-level leaders are motivated to implement practices as expected (de- scribed above); they also provide mechanisms for revealing implementation failures and/or demographic disparities in employees’ experiences and out- comes. Probing evidence about the differential impact of practices in the organization can reveal valuable insights about what accounts for these differences so that superior leadership and practice implementation behaviors can be reinforced and replicated, and senior leaders can understand how to adapt the way they articulate the organization’s inclusion strategy, role model it, and reinforce desired behaviors to yield desired outcomes (Nishii & Paluch, 2018).

Probing available input also provides opportunities for leaders to explore and understand employee narratives that may run counter to assumed,

# 707

# 708

# Group & Organization Management 47(4)

dominant ones. For example, a dominant narrative may be that the organ- ization’s commitment to the full inclusion of women and parents is evidenced in its adoption of a range of work–life beneﬁts. A careful look at the data might reveal the unexpectedﬁnding thatthe availability of work–life beneﬁts is more strongly associated with positive employee attitudes than their actual utili- zation (Butts, Casper & Yang, 2012). Efforts to understand this may reveal an important counternarrative about how the low proportion of women in the organization makes gender role stereotyping more likely, thereby increasing perceived identity threat and a reluctance to utilize work–life beneﬁts for fear of harming one’s career prospects. Further probing might conﬁrm that work– life beneﬁts exacerbate work–life conﬂict for women (but not men) and their performance, pay, and advancement (Briscoe & adversely affect Kellogg, 2011; Hammer, Neal, Brockwood, & Colton, 2005) except in pockets of the organization where leaders consistently engage in family- supportive supervisor behaviors (Kossek, Pichler, Bodner, & Hammer, 2011).

# Discussion

In this article, we have articulated a multi-level model of inclusive leadership in an organizational context. Our theoretical model, which is summarized in Figure 1, is intended to help guide future research as well as practice. We advocated for the intimate interconnection between inclusive leadership and the type of diversity that leaders face. As we have described, inclusive leadership is a process that unfolds at multiple levels of analysis (individual, workgroup, and organizational) and entails a complex set of proactive (ﬁrst- stage moderation) and reactive (second-stage moderation) leadership func- tions. Its complexity begs the question of whether and how inclusive lead- ership can be developed in organizations.

# Inclusive Leadership Development

Our analysis suggests that developing inclusive leadership is likely to require much more than observational learning and the acquisition of disembodied skills that can be similarly deployed across situations. The quick ﬁxes that organizations seek may be unrealistic because teaching people to behave in certain ways across superﬁcially similar situations only gets them so far. The generic strategies learned through training need to be ﬁne-tuned to address the speciﬁc challenges and opportunities presented across the diversity of sit- uations leaders face. This is why we purposefully embedded inclusive leadership as a moderator of second-stage relationships at all levels of analysis: to make explicit the importance of monitoring and adjusting one’s

inclusive leadership strategies in response to the momentary requirements that vary across situations.

Developing as an inclusive leader thus ﬁrst involves acquiring knowledge and awareness of oneself, others’social identities, and strategies for managing diversity dynamics. However, this is less about rote informational leaning and more about conscious sensemaking, deep reﬂection, and transformational learning (Petriglieri et al., 2011). The learning process must be accompanied by leaders’ reﬂective exploration of their own experiences of self in relation to others, underlying assumptions, and narratives, with an openness to revising them in response to what Piaget referred to as “disequilibrium” (1971, 1975). Disequilibrium refers to the state that is experienced when individuals confront views or ideas that do not easily ﬁt within their existing un- derstanding of themselves and the world; when leaders push themselves to reexamine their views and ways of making sense of the world in an effort to reconcile the discrepancy, they accelerate their own development (Nemeth, 1986) and therefore their facility at cultivating multicultural environments with which individuals from diverse social backgrounds can identify.

All individuals have personal experiences of inclusionandexclusion which can be leveraged as a source of motivation to evolve their cognitive, affective, and behavioral responses to complex social processes so that they can more effectively facilitate experiences of inclusion for others. When individuals explore the ways in which they themselves have been marginalized, it expands their capacity to engage with the experiences of marginalized others. It is difﬁcult for a leader to become invested in building inclusion if they do not understand the costs of exclusion (or lack of inclusion). Leaders need to be motivated to voluntarily put themselves in developmental situations and to draw on their personal material—experiences, identities, values, etc.—as a resource for exercising leadership.

Over time, as leaders practice applying their inclusive leadership strategies and engage in self-reﬂection about their effectiveness across situations, they develop a more sophisticated ability to regulate their behavior to respond to every-changing diversity dynamics. The more a leader internalizes the in- clusive leader role into their self-identity, the more consistently they will pursue the iterative learning required to achieve this goal (Lord & Hall, 2005)

## The Multi-Level Practice of Inclusive Leadership

We have argued that inclusive leadership involves a multi-level process that requires careful attention to the alignment of espoused and enacted inclusive leadership both within and across those levels (Nishii et al. 2018; Mor Barak et al. pp. 840–871; Simons et al. 2021). In Table 1, we offer concrete examples

# Editorial

of how espousals and enactments could play out at higher and lower-levels of thereby inﬂuencing employee perceptions about whether the leadership, organization’s espoused commitment to inclusion is merely symbolic rather than substantive, and ultimately shaping their inclusion experiences. In recognition of the fact that eliminating discrimination is a precondition for inclusion experiences, we refer to DEI practices more generally in the table.

Conclusion The articles that follow in this special issue reﬂect different elements of our multi-level framework. The article by Shore and Chung (pp. 723–754) is primarily focused on inclusive leadership at the individual-level, un- derstanding that the satisfaction of the fundamental needs underlying in- clusion is determined both by employees’ interactions with the leader as well as with coworkers. Thus, inclusive leadership is inherently cross-level. Similarly, Roberson and Perry (pp. 755–778) discovered in their work that leaders themselves describe inclusive leadership in ways that make it difﬁcult to disentangle individual- and workgroup-focused behaviors and functions. In comparison, the articles by van Knippenberg and van Ginkel (pp. 779–797) and by Leroy and his colleagues (pp. 798–839) focus speciﬁcally on inclusive leadership at the team or workgroup-level of analysis—that is, on leader efforts to shape workgroup processes and outcomes. Finally, Mor Barak and her colleagues links organizational-level (i.e., senior leadership) inclusive leadership with en- actments of inclusive leadership throughout lower-levels of the organization where it impacts employees’ everyday experiences in more tangible ways. We encourage future research to be explicit about the aspects of inclusive leadership on which they are focused and to appropriately align their research designs and measures accordingly.
