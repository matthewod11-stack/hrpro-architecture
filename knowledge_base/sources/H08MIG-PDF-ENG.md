One of the less appealing aspects of a manager’s job is addressing

employee misconduct. In our research, we deﬁne this as behavior that

## breaches moral standards, such as cheating and discriminating against

others, or technical performance standards, such as violating safety

protocols or coming in late. Often, organizations have protocols that

managers are supposed to follow in these cases; company policy might

state that the employee should be suspended or even ﬁred. Standard

punitive procedures uphold rules, signal how employees should behave

(and how they should not behave), and deter bad behavior.

Still, eﬀectively doling out punishment can be challenging and

emotionally fraught. So, instead of enforcing rules about punishment,

managers sometimes choose instead to be lenient, lightening the

punishment or letting the misconduct slide altogether, particularly for

# small slights.

Yet while being lenient may seem like the easy or empathetic thing to

do, our research suggests that leniency can yield mixed consequences

for managers and employees, and should be used with caution and

care. Despite natural inclinations to act with empathy or use a laid-back

approach, managers should recognize that being lenient may lead to

unintended consequences and raise concerns about bias and injustice.

Over the past decade, we have studied lenient reactions to misconduct

## with our colleagues, Shubha Sharma at the University of Tulsa, Mike

Baer at Arizona State University, Bob Bies at Georgetown University,

and Natalie Croitoru at University of North Carolina. Our ﬁrst study

examined the consequences of being lenient for managers themselves,

and our most recent study examined the consequences of leniency

from the perspective of other employees observing the situation. Across

our studies, we examined leniency with various forms of misconduct,

ranging from task-oriented problematic behavior, such as absenteeism,

clocking in late, or failing to meet expectations on deliverables, to

ethical transgressions, such as showing up to work intoxicated, inciting

violence, or lying to and cheating customers and colleagues.

Our ﬁndings make one thing is clear: leniency evokes strong and

complex reactions for managers and onlooking employees. These

reactions vary from positive to negative. We identiﬁed three important

factors about being lenient that managers should consider next time

they have to address misconduct.

# Managers’ Emotions are Sharp and Mixed

In any misconduct situation, emotions are likely ﬂaring — for the

manager, the employee, those aﬀected, and observing employees.

For managers, we found that being lenient with employees for their

misconduct makes them feel a mix of both positive and negative

emotions. On the one hand, leniency makes managers feel pride for

helping the employee — and this prideful experience fuels managers’

energy at work. On the other hand, leniency makes managers feel guilt

for breaking from organizational rules and potentially not addressing

the harm, and this experience of guilt drains managers’ energy at work.

Our ﬁndings suggest that being lenient is an emotionally conﬂicting

experience for managers, with leniency evoking both positive (pride)

and negative (guilt) emotions, whether the misconduct was isolated and

did not directly harm another person, whether it only indirectly harmed

others, or whether it directly harmed others.

Yet, the experience becomes more positive if managers have personally

forgiven the oﬀender, meaning they chose to release negative

feelings about the incident and move past it. Perhaps an employee

purposefully misrepresented information during a client presentation,

and the manager followed up and talked through the situation

with the employee, informing them of the negative consequences

of misinformation. If the manager lets go of the negative emotions

associated with the situation and forgives the oﬀender — if, say, the

misrepresentation had a smaller impact on the project than expected

— the manager tends to not feel guilt, but instead is fueled with pride,

which makes leniency in this case a net positive. In this way, they are no

longer guided by guilt and instead focus on the value of the grace they

showed the employee. If they haven’t forgiven the employee, however,

managers stew on the problems of the situation, which feeds their guilt

and leaves them exhausted by it.

# Employees are Watching

Managers might think that their handling of a situation is between them

and the oﬀender. Misconduct, however, creates ripples in the workplace

that sparks a lot of interest from other employees — even if they were

not directly aﬀected by that employee’s actions. These onlookers closely

monitor managers’ responses to misconduct.

Perceptions about misconduct can vary; the same behavior (such as a

habitually showing up late) might be viewed as a serious problem by

some and not much of an issue by others. However, all variations of

misconduct seem to raise eyebrows. Employees are keenly interested in

how managers respond to misconduct because the manager’s actions

signal critical information about how things work.

Employees expect leaders to punish oﬀenders, even for the minor

wrongs, because it holds oﬀenders accountable, reduces future

misconduct, and protects observers. For these reasons, lenient

managers are generally seen as unfair and irresponsible. Our studies,

which controlled for severity, demonstrated that observing employees

expect misconduct to be punished. Leniency suggests the oﬀender is

getting away with something and that those aﬀected by the misconduct

have been disregarded. Observing employees perceived leniency in

enforcing rules of accountability as unfair, which motivated them to

punish the manager. They expressed their disapproval by withdrawing

support, ignoring the manager’s requests, and engaging in retaliatory

## behaviors such as rudeness and incivility toward the lenient manager.

# Details Matter

How observing employees respond to the manager’s leniency also

depends on situational details. The potentially problematic nature of

leniency — of it breaking with standards of punishment — seems to

make onlooking employees consider the context and wonder why the

manager might decide to be lenient.

We found that for a scenario of moderate severity, observers could

suspend their disdain for leniency if they believed the oﬀender was

personally suﬀering and deserved compassion. Picture a coworker that

is habitually late to work and fudges their time sheet but is also is

caring for an ailing spouse, or is struggling to feed their child, or has

been dealing with the clean-up after a natural disaster. Or, as came up

in our research, picture a colleague who comes to work inebriated and

is unable to do their job (such as work mechanical equipment safely),

but who also just learned that their spouse was diagnosed with Stage 4

# cancer.

When the oﬀender is personally in a crisis — and particularly one that

is outside of their control — other employees think being lenient is

the right, compassionate thing to do. Their compassion guides them

to feel that the manager’s leniency is more appropriate, which lessens

their desire to punish the manager for it. However, if observers do not

believe oﬀenders are deserving of compassion, their contempt bolsters

the unfairness of the leniency, fueling their need to punish the manager

for being lenient.

## When Should Managers Take a Lenient Approach?

To help managers more eﬀectively navigate the pervasive and complex

nature of employee misconduct — when to be lenient and when not to

be — we suggest a few steps to ensure managers maximize the beneﬁts

of leniency and avoid the negatives. Crucially, managers should start by

analyzing various factors associated with the event before acting.

- 1. Anticipate the presence of big emotions.

Misconduct events are emotional — for managers, the oﬀender, and

other employees. Managers should be ready to understand their

own and others’ emotions. Oﬀenders may feel self-focused negative

## emotions, such as fear, shame, and guilt (although sometimes the threat

to self-preservation can activate anger as a defensive way of coping).

When given leniency, though, these employees likely feel gratitude for

their manager’s kindness.

For managers, our research suggests that anticipating the pride and

guilt they may experience as a consequence of their leniency is critical

because each have a strong and unique impact on their engagement

## at work. The key distinction between more positive or more negative

reactions for managers is whether forgiving the oﬀender is plausible.

Managers should ask themselves: “Can — and should — I truly forgive

the oﬀender for this misconduct?” Asking this is important because

evaluations about the situation may be prone to bias and idiosyncrasies,

such as favoring forgiveness with friends or those who are similar to

us. Allowing bias and favoritism to enter into the decision enhances

the risk of perpetuating inconsistencies and, then, promoting very

strong negative reactions from observing employees. Take a step back

and consider the consequences of how you respond to others in the

# organization.

Of course, it may still be diﬃcult to anticipate reactions, especially if

relationships within the workplace are already fragile. In such cases, it

is wise to prioritize consistency to accountability rules and adhering to

organizational protocols rather than opting for leniency.

- 2. Assess the individual’s needs.

Managers should also consider whether granting leniency would be

a compassionate act for the oﬀender. Observing employees vigilantly

watch to see how managers react to their coworkers’ misconduct and

if they believe there is little reason for compassion, their contempt for

the manager’s leniency will be fueled, as will their desires to retaliate

# against the manager.

Managers should, therefore, consider whether the oﬀender is in a

tough situation and might genuinely deserve some grace via leniency.

Examples from our study include ﬁnancial hardships, family health

concerns, bereavement, and major life events, like becoming a parent

or going through a divorce. It is this human perspective that seems to

make the greatest diﬀerence, legitimizing the merits of leniency in the

# eyes of other employees.

Of course, managers may be aware of personal situations that other

employees are not privy to, creating a potential gap in understanding

what the manager and other employees perceive as a need for

compassion. Indeed, managers are often privy to personal information

about their employees that others are largely unaware of, so it’s

necessary to pause and consider how much others may know of the

# context.

- 3. Take a look from others’ perspectives.

Although some managers may believe others are unaware of

misconduct events, they’d be surprised by how much other employees

see and know. Managers should recognize that their actions matter to

other employees outside of the misconduct event. To understand how

your decision to address misconduct might impact other employees,

managers need to evaluate the situation from their perspectives.

Will your decision to be lenient display bias, favoritism, and unjust

application of the rules? Or will it demonstrate your sense of humanity

and compassion? That is, will other employees understand the merits

of being lenient or the need to be compassionate toward the oﬀender?

And do other employees understand any personal issues behind the

misconduct that might inspire compassion?

How others see your decisions meaningfully inﬂuences how they will

act. Because our research suggests that leniency can evoke strong

reactions — and even contempt — from observing employees (unless

there is a clear and compelling reason for compassion), suspend your

own perspective as a manager to consider the impact of your response

## on the larger workgroup and the organization.

. . .

At its core, handling misconduct is a “people problem” involving

complicated feelings and relationships. Leniency can be a powerful

response if managers consider the whole picture — what was the

misconduct, how does it inﬂuence myself and others, are there personal

issues to consider, and what are the consequences for the broader

group? We suggest leniency should come with a warning label: Use with

care and when compassion and forgiveness are present.
