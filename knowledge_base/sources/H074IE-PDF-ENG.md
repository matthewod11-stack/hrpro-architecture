Expecting a Bad Performance Review? Here’s How to Prepare.

Dan, a client I coached through a career transition, started working

with me after being laid off. Prior to being let go, Dan’s company

had put him on a performance improvement plan, or “PIP,” as it’s

euphemistically called in HR. Although he was aware that he had areas

to work on, Dan thought his job was safe and that he’d have a longer

timeframe to better his performance. He thus found himself totally

blindsided when he was fired.

## Unfortunately, while disappointing, Dan’s situation isn’t uncommon.

Organizations frequently use a PIP with the intention of gathering

enough evidence about an employee’s underperformance to justify

firing them, rather than to truly help them improve. Since employees

often remain in the dark about this motive and believe that the tool

is put in place by their employer to help them grow, many like Dan

may realize too late that they’re on the chopping block. However, by

preemptively taking action if you expect to receive a bad performance

review, you may be able to steer a different course for yourself and avoid

a foregone conclusion — or at least feel better about the outcome.

Here are some steps to take before and after your review if you know

your performance has been subpar.

Reflect on your assumptions.

Before jumping to conclusions about how your manager may evaluate

you, take some time to check your assumptions in the weeks prior to

your review, when there’s still time to turn things around. One of my

coaching clients, a VP of product development, was unsure how the

CEO and CFO perceived her performance. Instead of worrying about it

or making assumptions, she set up a time with each of them and simply

asked:

- What have I done in the last six months that has contributed the most

# to the company?

- What could I have done more of?

- What should I have done less of?

In addition to asking for feedback, you can also ask yourself the

following questions, recommended by executive coach and workplace

- Why do I think I will get a poor review, and why now?

- What specific results did I commit to that I didn’t deliver?

- How does my current performance compare to the past?

- Did I have an interaction with a client or coworker that did not go as I

planned? What happened? Why?

These questions and your answers will enable you to focus on the

specific work you need to do to improve rather than on an amorphous

goal. For example, did you commit to meeting X goal by Y date and

failed to do so? If so, is it possible to address this shortfall now and make

amends, showing your boss that you’re capable of graciously correcting

an error in a timely manner? By asking yourself Littlefield’s questions,

you may also discover that you’ve erroneously assumed that there’s a

problem when in fact, there’s no tangible justification for your fears.

If you found that your assumptions were off base, it may be that your

self-awareness needs a tune-up.

# Gain perspective.

If you sense your teammates are frustrated with you, don’t avoid the

issue or guess — ask them before it’s too late! Addressing the situation

prior to your review can remove this red flag from your record. This

situation happened to one of my coaching clients, who was frequently

late on deliverables and failed to alert her team. Worse yet, she tended

to blame her delays on external circumstances, such as not receiving the

information she needed on time instead of searching it out.

If you’re not sure how your team perceives your contributions,

executive and team coach Jennifer Porter suggests asking your

- What am I doing as part of the team that is helpful?

- What am I doing that is not helpful?

- If you could change one part of how I interact with the team, what

would it be?

Once you receive their answers, take steps to rectify any areas that your

team flagged. Better to take it upon yourself to do better than to hear

# about it from your boss in a PIP.

# Invite your manager for a conversation.

Rather than waiting for a formal performance review, Fortune 50

executive coach Nihar Chhaya suggests reaching out to your manager

to discuss your development prior to your review, asking for 20 to

30 minutes so no one feels rushed. This is particularly important if

you’ve made a big mistake, adds C-suite coach Amii Barnard-Bahn, who

advises acting fast. “Being direct and willing to discuss your mishap

serves a few purposes,” says Chhaya. “It gives you the chance to show

you care about your career and performance and aren’t just complacent

or deferring ownership and responsibility to others.”

If you have a manager who isn’t straightforward at delivering difficult

feedback, your invitation to talk about it precludes them from delaying

or being unclear with you about their assessment. Sometimes, as much

as you don’t want to invite criticism, making it easier for managers to

deliver it can ultimately put you in higher standing with them, letting

them see that you’re proactive and care about your career. Capture

your key accomplishments and send them ahead to your boss to jog

their memory and avoid recency bias, suggests executive coach Rebecca

Own your mistakes.

In contrast to being blindsided after the fact by negative feedback,

taking control of your situation by admitting errors and planning how

you will improve your areas of risk is likely to result in respect from your

manager and team. Accepting and owning any missteps or weaknesses

can help you and your manager shift from looking backward to looking

ahead. Barnard-Bahn suggests using the following language with your

manager in owning a mistake, tailoring it to your situation: “In case

you’re not aware, I had a negative encounter with one of our major

clients, and I want to own up to it and tell you what I plan to do about

it.”

Once you’ve fessed up to your boss about the dropped ball, create a

detailed action plan that may involve creating a timeline, reprioritizing

your tasks, learning new skills, and/or reexamining how you come

across to colleagues. Share your development plan with your manager

and ask for the support you need to improve, such as removing

## organizational constraints, counsels Zucker.

# Follow up.

Once you’ve committed to your action plan and gained buy-in for

it, set a date with your manager for a follow-up meeting in three

months to make sure you’re making the needed improvements. Chhaya

emphasizes that the clearer you are on what went wrong, your

responsibility in the matter, and what you will do to improve in the

future, the easier it will be to take the feedback with grace and ease. It

will also help you potentially transform a pending negative review into a

# positive one down the road.

Demonstrate that you care about doing better

According to Barnard-Bahn, “showing that you care” is a top reason

separating employees are retained after messing up. “Backbone

combined with humility are the qualities leaders look for in their direct

reports,” she says — you need the backbone to withstand the criticism

you’re likely to endure after a failure and the humility to admit you

made a mistake.

At the end of the day, it’s important to look at the big

picture. Sometimes lagging performance isn’t a result of a blind spot

but an indication that you’re in the wrong position. If you still receive

a negative review despite your best efforts to be proactive, it may help

you realize that your skills, strengths, and interests don’t align with the

needs of your current role. Use the setback as a springboard for change

— and take this chance to re-evaluate your career.
