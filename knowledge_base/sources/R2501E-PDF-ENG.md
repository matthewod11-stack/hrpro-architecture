Leaders Shouldn’t Try to Do It All Many important tasks can be done by other people. Focus on what you can do a lot better than anyone else. by A.G. Lafley and Roger L. Martin

Unlike a company, which can expand capacity to meet increasing

demand, a leader is constrained by nature: As they say, there are

only so many hours in a day. Many people think they can increase

their productivity by working harder. But that, in due course, is a

losing game. They tire, their overall output falls, and they risk burning

themselves out and choosing to exit.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Leaders Shouldn’t Try to Do It All

The two of us frequently ﬁnd ourselves sitting across the table from

overwhelmed leaders who are trying to improve or turn around a

company or the piece of it they head. They all face a long—and

## typically lengthening—list of important items on their to-do lists. They

all understand that the job of a leader involves intense work, but for

many of them the current state feels like too much—and is getting

# worse.

In this article we will explain how leaders can change that. We’ll begin

with the perhaps surprising but powerful theory that guides how we two

manage our own time.

# The Theory of Comparative Advantage

Our remedy for the overwhelmed leader comes from an unlikely

## source: the 19th-century political economist David Ricardo. Business

leaders most commonly allocate their time by lining up potential tasks

according to absolute importance to the organization’s strategy and

taking on the most crucial ones until they run out of time. Then

they leave the rest to subordinates. Instead they should be guided by

Ricardo’s 1817 theory of comparative advantage, still seen as the seminal

theory in international trade, which asserts that a nation should export

those goods (or services) for which it has a comparative advantage over

its trading partners. In his classic example, Portugal exports wine to

England because sunny weather gives it a comparative advantage in

growing grapes. (But it doesn’t export wine to Italy because it has no

## comparative advantage over Italy on that front.) Meanwhile, England

exports wool to Portugal because its weather is perfect for raising sheep.

A similar logic holds here. Leaders shouldn’t spend their scarce time on

activities simply because they are very important. They should do only

the things that nobody else in the organization can do nearly as well—if

at all. And they should spend as much of their time as possible on them.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Leaders Shouldn’t Try to Do It All

That is our deﬁnition of leading to win. It was an essential part of the

strategic logic that guided us in turning around the organizations we

led. When A.G. was appointed CEO of Procter & Gamble, in June 2000,

P&G was a company in crisis. It had had two consecutive quarterly

earnings misses, and its stock price had halved since the beginning of

the year. A.G. led a turnaround during his 2000–2009 tenure, and the

board asked him to come back and do it again from 2013 to 2015. His

transformation of P&G made him one of the most successful CEOs of his

# generation.

Roger faced a similarly daunting task in 1998, when he became the

## dean of the Rotman School of Management at the University of Toronto.

Rotman was hemorrhaging both cash and professors and was derisively

referred to as the “Faculty of Mismanagement.” During his tenure he

transformed Rotman from an underperforming and largely irrelevant

business school to a global leader. In 2013 he was recognized by

Poets&Quants as Dean of the Year and described in the citation as “one

of a handful of the most successful business school deans in the past

# quarter century.”

We suggest that overwhelmed leaders follow a four-step process: The first two steps involve getting tasks off their calendars; the second two, putting tasks on.

As we will demonstrate, both of us combined making choices about

where to play and how to win with a relentless focus on the tasks that

beneﬁted from our comparative advantages. The concept of leading to

win shapes the advice we now give the many leaders we advise.

For A.G. those include Trina Spear, a cofounder and the CEO of FIGS,

a designer scrubs and medical apparel company that grew to more

than $500 million in sales within a decade and went public in 2021.

A.G. serves on the board of FIGS and provides advice to Spear in that

capacity. In addition, at her request, he coaches and mentors her on

speciﬁc issues she’s wrestling with.

For Roger they include Jørgen Vig Knudstorp, the highly successful

CEO of the Lego Group from 2004 through 2016, who saved the

company from imminent bankruptcy and made it the biggest, most

proﬁtable, and most respected toy company in the world, with sales that

have grown by a multiple of 10. In 2017 Knudstorp became executive

chairman, coheading Lego Brand Group with the fourth-generation

owner, Thomas Kristiansen, to coordinate the various Lego branded

assets, including the core business, Lego Foundation, Lego Digital, Lego

Education, the giant Lego House project in the company’s hometown,

and Legoland Parks (which were owned and operated by Merlin

# Entertainments).

We suggest that overwhelmed leaders follow a four-step process in

making choices. The ﬁrst two steps involve getting tasks oﬀ their

calendars; the second two, putting tasks on.

- 1. Remove all tasks for which you lack any absolute advantage.

When Roger arrived at the Rotman School, he was informed that the

dean’s most important job was to hire tenure-stream faculty members

and that he, like his predecessors, should be heavily involved in every

aspect of the hiring process. That’s an example of what we often see as

a should do. Leaders are told they should do something in part because

that’s how it has always been done.

But Roger knew he faced a big transformational task and couldn’t

spend his time the way his predecessors had. They had devoted

approximately 50 days a year to faculty selection and recruiting

activities. Furthermore, he realized that he would be no better at it

than his associate dean, Peter Pauly, who was a stellar academic with

a great eye for young talent and superb skills in faculty hiring. But

to put Pauly in charge, Roger needed to do two things: He had to persuade the provost—the university’s chief academic oﬃcer and the

boss of all the deans—to allow Pauly to take over that job. And he had

to achieve a meeting of the minds with Pauly on how to carry out the

task—which would involve some small but important diﬀerences from

# past practices.

A.G. came to a similar realization when he returned for his second stint

as CEO of P&G. He had engineered a remarkable turnaround during

his ﬁrst stint, but the momentum had been lost under his successor,

and it was clear that he needed to reassure investors that the company

could regain it. Managing relationships with key investors was typically

regarded at P&G and elsewhere as the CEO’s job. But A.G. could see

that his CFO, Jon Moeller, with whom he had worked closely during

his entire ﬁrst term as CEO, would be just as good at interacting

with investors and analysts at quarterly earnings releases. As a result,

Moeller gained invaluable experience that served him well when he

became P&G’s CEO, in 2021—and A.G. was saved many should do days.

A.G. has passed that lesson on to Spear. The culture at FIGS is a powerful

driver—in terms of both shared values and a passion for the mission of

serving healthcare professionals at the highest level. In the early days of

the company Spear instilled this culture through a variety of thoughtful

structures, including a weekly all-hands called Tuesday Talk, which

she led. But as the years went by and the FIGS culture ﬂourished, A.G.

encouraged her to allow others to lead Tuesday Talk. He knew that some

company leaders were excellent at creating substantive and dynamic

presentations to motivate the broader team, and that her voice was best

saved for particularly important messages.

Similarly, when Roger sat down with Knudstorp to reconﬁgure his time,

a number of tasks for which the CEO had zero advantage fell oﬀ the list

—mainly chairing or attending board meetings of the numerous entities

## in the Lego empire, an important but time-consuming task that many

other executives in the company could perform as well or sometimes

# better than the CEO could.

- 2. Delegate tasks for which you have little comparative advantage.

Having reassigned tasks for which they have no advantage at all

over other people, leaders should consider shedding those for which

they have only a modest advantage in favor of those for which their

advantage is distinctive.

For A.G. one such category was brand reviews, including creative

reviews of advertising strategies and copy. Though it was customary for

P&G CEOs to sit in on them (and even though he was highly respected

across the company for his branding skills and insights), he cut them

out entirely. He believed that his advantage in that realm was modest,

and he preferred to trust his business leaders and not add a duplicative

layer of review. That turned out to be a case of addition by subtraction:

His business leaders felt more empowered and trusted and ended up

performing better than before.

He used the same logic on external representation. Though the

expectation was that the CEO would represent P&G at many outside

events, A.G. trusted his country presidents and functional leaders

and experts to step in for almost all of them. For example, the

heads of government relations handled the vast majority of events in

Washington, Brussels, and Beijing. The president of P&G North America

served on the boards of the two key U.S. industry associations. A.G.

attended the Business Council and Business Roundtable on a very

## selective basis. And with one exception during his time as CEO—when

it was held in New York following 9/11—he took a pass on the World

Economic Forum’s annual meeting.

In Roger’s case ﬁnancial management fell into this category. It had

been a big time sink for his predecessors, who spent about 50 days

a year on it. Roger had relevant skills and experience in this domain

and strong views on how it needed to be transformed, but he inherited a terriﬁc chief administrative oﬃcer, Mary-Ellen Yeomans, who was

under-utilized in her role. He worked with her to reduce his time on all

things ﬁnancial to ﬁve days a year. At ﬁrst Yeomans was stunned, taking

his initiative as a signal that her work was a low priority for him. He

explained that she was superbly equipped to lead an eﬀort to achieve

a fundamentally diﬀerent funding model for the faculty—so it was of

central importance. He overinvested time during his ﬁrst six months as

dean to support her and make sure that she was heading in the right

direction. But for the remainder of his tenure he never exceeded that

# ﬁve-day goal.

## At Lego, Jørgen Knudstorp understood that

## senior-level succession planning across the

Kristiansen family assets was a critical task

in which he played a key role. But although

he was excellent at it, he knew that ﬁrst-

rate resources were available from outside.

So he engineered the hiring of an

# outstanding group head of human

resources. He did the same for the

technology function by hiring an external CIO and dramatically

reducing his own time commitment to both areas. Perhaps most

important, when he saw that he and Lego Group were both ready for his

transition to a new role, he led in the hiring of the next CEO, who has

very successfully built on Knudstorp’s legacy.

On A.G.’s advice, Trina Spear did much the same. FIGS has grown a

loyal following through its ambassador program, which now numbers

hundreds of healthcare professionals who help the company reach

## millions more around the world in an intimate, authentic, and

personalized way. Spear used to spend countless hours identifying the

ideal candidates to serve as ambassadors. She still plays an important

role in the program, but she has created a ﬁrst-class team that

now has responsibility for identifying the most inspiring healthcare

professionals in the world and engaging them on a regular basis to

create the best experience for them and to drive the best results for the

company. Spear estimates that she has saved from 20 to 25 days a year

by turning the program over to talented subordinates.

- 3. Take on tasks for which you have a strong comparative advantage.

## The payoﬀ for all the hard and sometimes controversial choices to

remove tasks from leaders’ calendars is the freedom to add tasks for

which leaders have a signiﬁcant comparative advantage and that can

make a decisive diﬀerence in the organization’s performance. The

challenge is to aggressively reinvest the time gained and to do the tasks

diﬀerently in order to improve the leader’s comparative advantage.

Roger knew that he needed to spend time on fundraising, but to succeed

he would have to diverge from the traditional approach—making a list

of rich alumni and spending lots of time meeting with them to ask for

money—which was the only one his fundraisers knew. He didn’t believe

## HBR / Magazine Article / Leaders Shouldn’t Try to Do It All

that was an even marginally eﬀective way to fundraise, especially for a

school that had a poor reputation and had done a terrible job of keeping

in touch with its alumni. He felt that he needed to improve Rotman’s

worthiness and get people of means (whether alumni or not) involved

in the school in ways they would both enjoy and value; in due course

they would want to help ﬁnancially. Much of his eﬀort consisted of

publishing articles and books that brought insights from academic work

in management to managers and executives and disseminating those

insights on the conference and lecture circuits. While serving as dean,

he published nine books, 14 Harvard Business Review articles, and more

than 400 other articles, and delivered 25 to 50 conference presentations

a year. As an academic, a former consultant, and a capable writer, he

had a big comparative advantage in this domain. People of means with

intellectual interests in business education were motivated to work with

# him.

The approach succeeded, much to the surprise of the traditional

fundraisers, and Rotman raised close to $250 million in Roger’s 15

years as dean. Observers often asked Roger how much time he spent

on fundraising. He would respond that there were two truthful answers:

One was “100%,” because he spent all his time making Rotman worthy

of funding. The other was “5%,” because he spent only a couple of hours

# a week meeting with potential donors.

A.G. knew that P&G had to amp up its innovation and return to being

## truly consumer-centric. In innovation his comparative advantage lay in

understanding the entire process by which consumer insights translate

into successful commercial oﬀerings. He insisted on interacting

personally with consumers and product innovators to observe

consumers’ actual experience of a product and to provide advice

on designing, communicating, and commercializing innovations. He

recognized the need to source more outside invention to increase

the output of P&G’s formidable commercialization engine, and he led

## the shift to the now-famous and much-imitated Connect + Develop

# approach to innovation.

A.G.’s campaign for the primacy of the consumer helped the

organization focus on winning both the ﬁrst “moment of truth” (the

decision to pick the product oﬀ a physical or virtual shelf) and

the second (when using the product). He modeled the behavior he

wished to see from all P&G leaders by personally visiting consumers

wherever he traveled—including a visit to women washing clothes in

a river in western China, which became legendary at the company. He

championed a broader focus on the overall consumer experience at the

# most important touchpoints.

Leaders will never have time on their hands. All the good ones will always be exceedingly busy, and more demands on their time are continually lurking.

At FIGS a critical and central aspect of the brand is storytelling—

combining the innovative products the company is known for (it

revolutionized scrubs and built an entire lifestyle brand around

healthcare professionals) with compelling stories about Awesome

Humans (healthcare professionals) to drive excitement. Although

she has a world-class marketing and brand team, Spear personally

## dedicates large amounts of time to FIGS marketing campaigns and even

drafts copy for them. After more than 10 years of serving healthcare

professionals and talking to them on a daily basis, she has a heightened

## understanding of the kinds of stories and language that resonate with

# them.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Leaders Shouldn’t Try to Do It All

Knudstorp’s strong comparative advantage was in moving from an

existing situation to a dramatically more promising path, as he had

done at the Lego Group in the early 2000s. Merlin Entertainments

had acquired the assets and licensing rights for Legoland themed

attractions in 2005 and had expanded the original four theme parks into

a portfolio of 12 resorts and 30 indoor Discovery Centers, which draw

more than 30 million visitors annually. Knudstorp saw those attractions

as a key opportunity to build a community of adult users as well

as families with children. He engaged in explorative discussions with

Merlin’s management and shareholders to reach mutually beneﬁcial

strategies that rested on thorough research. The result was a multiyear

inﬂuencing, strategizing, and investment approach that included taking

Merlin private. Knudstorp estimates that the eﬀort required about 30%

# of his time for about three years.

- 4. Make sure you have enough time for the tasks that only you can do.

Sometimes the leader is literally the only member of the organization

who can accomplish certain tasks. For A.G. one such task was building

## strategic partnerships with customers, suppliers (both corporate and

entrepreneurial), and potential innovation allies of all kinds, including

## competitors. In one example, the company’s suppliers Novozymes and

BASF contributed game-changing innovations, in enzymes and soil-

## release polymers respectively, to P&G’s biggest business, fabric care.

A.G. led the eﬀort to establish joint value creation with P&G’s retail

partners, beginning with Walmart. He also partnered with competitors

## for their mutual beneﬁt and the beneﬁt of consumers. Rather than

## engage in destructive competition with Clorox, for example, he

championed a joint venture that combined P&G-developed technologies

## in trash bags (ForceFlex) and plastic wrap (Press’n Seal) with Clorox’s

established leadership brand, Glad.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Leaders Shouldn’t Try to Do It All

Another such task, arguably less obvious, was building the future

P&G leadership team. Perhaps A.G.’s biggest expenditure of freed-up

hours was on meeting one-on-one each quarter with the heads of each

business, every region, and all the functions. That meant more than

30 meetings of 30 to 60 minutes’ length each quarter, either in person

or via videoconference. Signiﬁcantly, the agenda was set by the leader

rather than by A.G. Those meetings helped him motivate his leadership

team members and gain insight into their development needs and

personal interests as well as their strategic take on their businesses.

Nobody else could have done that.

Before he retired from P&G the second time, A.G. carved out eight full

days to teach a specially designed course on leadership and strategy

with Roger. The course was based on his 36 years of leadership

experience and their joint experience in putting strategy choices based

on their 2013 book Playing to Win into practice at P&G and other

## companies. Twenty-six of the most promising senior executives of the

company participated, including both successor CEOs, David Taylor

## and Jon Moeller; the current CEOs of most of P&G’s business units;

and the heads of many of its functions. Virtually any other CEO would

have viewed putting the program together and teaching each subject

as requiring an impossibly large allocation of scarce time. For A.G.,

investment in this endeavor was essential for P&G’s future prosperity,

and he was uniquely qualiﬁed to make it.

A crucial task for Roger was building Rotman’s intellectual proﬁle

outside the academy. He didn’t have a comparative advantage, or even

parity, in building its intellectual proﬁle inside—that is, by publishing

in refereed academic journals. But with the time he reclaimed from

activities that others could be doing better or that he shouldn’t have

been doing at all, he was able to write all those popular books and

articles while building a world-class faculty.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Leaders Shouldn’t Try to Do It All

Like A.G., Roger also invested in future leadership. To motivate

individual professors and give them a clearer view of how they could

best contribute to Rotman’s success, he met with them individually

once a year—something not done by previous Rotman deans (or by

any other University of Toronto dean). At ﬁrst that took two weeks a

year, when Rotman had 36 full-time, tenure-stream professors. But by

the end of his time there, Roger needed eight weeks a year to meet

with 120 of them and the 50 adjunct professors who clamored to meet

as well. Nevertheless, he and his professors felt that it was one of the

most valuable uses of his time as dean—during which turnover among

professors and faculty grievances were at historical lows. No one else

could have accomplished that task.

For Knudstorp, the key task in this category was extending and

enlarging the Lego brand vision, which entailed stepping back from

## the iconic brick-building system to the ﬁrst principles behind it and

exploring multiple new avenues through education, entertainment,

digital play, and location-based experiences. That resulted in

investments to explore new business opportunities and potential brand

## extensions, from large partnerships—for example, with Epic Games—to

embryonic ideas centered on a founder with a small operational team.

For Spear, the task in this category was creating a narrative for the

company’s external stakeholders—the healthcare professionals that

## FIGS serves, along with its suppliers, shareholders, and other key

partners. The healthcare apparel industry had been much the same

for 100 years, consisting of commoditized products, an out-of-date

## wholesale business model, a total lack of brands, and no community.

FIGS changed all that. Through technically advanced materials that had

previously been used only for athletes, a direct-to-consumer business

model, and a ﬁrst-of-its-kind community that FIGS built from scratch, it

became the brand for healthcare professionals. No one can convey that

story better than Spear can, because she lived it, she understands it best,

and her passion for it is unmatched.

. . .

Leaders will never have time on their hands. All the good ones will

always be exceedingly busy, and more demands on their time are

continually lurking. But there’s no need for them to feel overwhelmed.

Those who use the principle of comparative advantage to move some

tasks oﬀ their calendars so that they can take on truly critical ones

will give their organizations the best chance of achieving competitive

advantage—and will prosper themselves.
