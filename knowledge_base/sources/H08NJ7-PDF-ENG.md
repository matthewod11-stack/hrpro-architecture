Google’s Project Oxygen—a multi-year research initiative—analyzed

data from thousands of employees to identify the qualities of highly

## eﬀective managers. Over the years, strong coaching skills consistently

ranked at the top. The ﬁndings echo other literature showing that

exceptional leaders often elevate others through coaching. One study

found that when employees are coached well, they tackle challenges

more assertively and also solve problems creatively. Other research

shows that eﬀective coaching improves an employees’ capacity to view

their strengths, improves morale, and helps them accomplish goals.

Despite its importance, however, coaching doesn’t come naturally to

many leaders. Research indicates that leaders often believe they’re

coaching when they’re actually just giving instructions. Based on

research for my book, Coaching: The Secret Code to Uncommon

Leadership, and reﬂecting on my experience as an executive coach,

I’ve found that the cause is usually straightforward: a lack of training.

I also found that many newly promoted leaders fear coaching because

they feel they need to have all the answers for their coachees, but in

fact the most eﬀective ones excel at helping coachees ﬁnd the answers

# themselves.

The good news is that coaching is a learnable skill, and like a muscle it’s

a skill that can grow stronger and more intuitive with practice. So how

do you learn to coach others, decide the best way to do it, and get better

# at it?

# What Is Coaching, Really?

The term “coach” originated in the 15th century in the village of Kocs in

Hungary. It was used to describe a type of carriage that brought people

to their destinations. In the 1800s, it became a metaphor for a person

who helps another accomplish a goal, and was used by students for

their Oxford tutors who would help them prepare for examinations—a

deﬁnition that remains relevant today.

According to Herminia Ibarra and Anne Scoular, in coaching, you ask

questions instead of just providing answers, support employees instead

of judging their actions, and facilitate development instead of dictating

what needs to get done.

In my book, I deﬁne coaching as a process whereby a leader aims

to maximize the performance and potential of others through non-

directive and self-enabling actions. In an eﬀective coaching relationship, both actions are used in tandem to guide people toward self-suﬃciency

# and personal growth.

# Different Coaching Styles

As an executive coach, I’m often asked if there is one “right way”

to coach. The answer is no; your coaching style will depend on

## your experience and expertise, the situation or task at hand, and the

experience level of the person you’re coaching.

For new and seasoned managers alike, this can feel tedious, and frankly,

a lot to ﬁgure out—which is why I designed a framework to help

managers navigate their coaching journey. The framework, which I

simply call Coaching Styles, draws upon the research I conducted for

my book, including interviews with over 100 leaders across various age

## groups, industries, ﬁelds of work, and experience levels; a study of other

coaching frameworks like the coaching spectrum by Miles Downey; and

## a deep review of academic literature on the subject.

The framework is based on the concepts of “push” and “pull” that

are widely used in the ﬁeld of sports to develop an athlete’s skills and

performance. The push coaching method refers to an approach where

the coach provides clear instructions, guidance, and feedback. This

style is more hands-on and involves telling athletes what to do and how

to do it. Pull coaching adopts a facilitative approach, aiming to guide

and support rather than provide direct instruction. This style relies on

asking open-ended questions to encourage self-reﬂection so athletes

can discover solutions on their own.

The Coaching Styles framework is a 2×2 matrix with the “pull” factor

on the y-axis and the “push factor” on the x-axis. Each quadrant is

characterized by diﬀerent levels of pull and push. The higher the pull,

the more preparation the coaching style requires.

## HBR / Digital Article / 4 Styles of Coaching—and When to Use Them

## Picking a Style That Is Right for You (and Your Employees)

Use this guide to identify the most eﬀective coaching style for

your speciﬁc situation. With practice, you may even feel comfortable

switching between styles.

# Telling (high push + low pull)

At the bottom-right quadrant is the Telling (or instructive) coaching

style. For most managers, this is their default mode. In this style, the

leader typically draws on their experience with the aim of passing on

their knowledge and helping the employee achieve their goals. Since it’s

“directive” in nature, coaching an employee using this style takes a lot

## less preparation than some of the other coaching styles.

The Telling style is best used when you’re coaching an employee

whose job is standardized and includes repetitive tasks (for example,

a call center associate or an assembly line manager). It is also suitable

for when the task or individual requires more oversight, like a new

data entry executive or a recently hired social media associate. This

Telling style can also be beneﬁcial in situations that require urgent

or immediate action. However, you should use it sparingly and with

caution. A directive style can stiﬂe creativity and demotivate your

employees, as it can make them feel that they lack the autonomy

to learn and grow. When you overuse this style, you could also be

perceived as micromanaging your employees.

# Hands-off (low push + low pull)

At the bottom-left quadrant lies the Hands-oﬀ coaching style. Here,

the coach acts as an advisor and gives the coachee a great amount of

autonomy and decision-making freedom. The coachee is provided with

the tools and resources they would need to succeed at something and

oﬀered support when they need it.

## HBR / Digital Article / 4 Styles of Coaching—and When to Use Them

Use the hands-oﬀ style when your team members are experienced and

competent at carrying out their tasks or a project at hand. Sometimes,

this can mean an employee with a lot of experience, or an employee who

has mastered the task. It requires you to put some checks and balances

in place—like regular catch-ups to ensure everything is on track—while

being comfortable letting people work with little or no supervision.

For example, say a senior product manager comes to you and says, “Our

new project requires us to do a couple focus group discussions. I did

these for the product launch for [brand]. I think we’re okay.” As a hands-

oﬀ coach, you could say, “Great. I trust you to deliver this. Maybe you

could share a broad plan with me, and keep me posted on milestones? If

you need any support on, say, internal budgets or approvals, I’m happy

to intervene.”

# Asking/listening (high pull + low push)

At the top left is the Asking/listening style, which aligns closely with

the most traditional deﬁnition of coaching. This style involves listening

actively and asking compelling, open-ended questions to guide the

coachee’s thinking. For example, you could ask, “What do you think is

the best way to approach this challenge?” or “You mentioned the client

feedback on this project is not great. What in your mind seems to be the

core of the problem?” This helps the coachee self-reﬂect, think deeply,

and own their decision-making instead of being told what to do.

The Asking/listening style requires a lot of preparation; you need to be

up to speed on what is happening with your coachee in order to ask the

right questions. As a result, it can be tempting to shy away from it and resort to the Telling style instead. But while it may feel diﬃcult to hold

back from simply giving advice or sharing a solution at ﬁrst, this style

does get easier with practice.

This style is great for coaching new leaders or those on the path

to leadership, as it helps build and enhance their critical thinking,

accountability, and problem-solving skills. Learning how to think

independently and make decisions helps in maximizing their potential.

# Collaborating (high pull + high push)

At the top right quadrant lies the Collaborating (or guided) coaching

style, which embodies high pull and high push and represents the sweet

spot in coaching. Ask a coaching expert and they will probably tell you

this should be the place most managers strive to be at.

Think of this style as a cross between traditional coaching (asking open-

ended questions) and mentoring (providing counseling and prescriptive

advice) and jointly coming up with a way forward. This approach, too,

requires a fair bit of preparation.

This style is most suited in situations that warrant a combination of

guiding and advising, irrespective of your report’s experience level.

Say your associate manager is working on a career development plan

and aspires to move from supply chain to general management. Here,

instead of simply telling them whether this would be good for their

career or not, you’ll want to pursue a more collaborative approach. You

might start the conversation by asking open-ended questions to aid

reﬂection, such as, “What skills do you think you need to develop to

be able to make the switch to general management?” or “Why do you

think you should develop more competencies in AI in addition to supply

# chain?”

Then, you can move to advising them: “Given your passion for building

new businesses (and desire to move into general management), have

you considered applying for the deputy country head role in Bangladesh since we have just opened a new oﬃce there? I saw the job description

and I think it aligns well with your skills. What do you think about that?”

This approach fosters self-awareness, provides the right experience-

based guidance, and empowers the employee to make the eventual

decision-making after taking all factors into consideration.

. . .

The essence of eﬀective coaching lies in the ability to discern when

to employ diﬀerent styles and approaches. It’s a dynamic process that

evolves with experience and practice. As you continue to hone your

coaching skills, you’ll naturally develop the intuition to adapt your

## methods to the unique needs of your coachees. Exceptional leaders

master the art of seamlessly blending various coaching styles. They

know when to take charge, when to oﬀer guidance, and when to step

back and empower others to lead. This journey is about continuous

growth, both for you as a coach and for those you guide.
