Designing an accessible, inclusive interview process for disabled

people and people with diﬀerent learning styles both widens the talent

pool and creates a more equitable workplace.

For hiring managers, this requires a thoughtful and conscientious

approach. Where do you begin? What actions can you take to

accommodate candidates’ needs? How do you maintain consistent

evaluation criteria? And how can you set up an environment where all

candidates have opportunities to demonstrate their strengths?

# What the Experts Say

A record share of disabled people were employed in the U.S. last

year, according to a report from the Bureau of Labor Statistics. This

is progress but more can be done, according to Katie Bach, a former

nonresident senior fellow at the Brookings Institution who has spent

most of her career focused on job creation, access, and quality.

It starts with creating a level playing ﬁeld in job interviews. “Oﬀering

accommodations to candidates is table stakes,” she says. “What I see as

the next step is not just asking individuals if they need accommodation,

but helping candidates think through what kinds of accommodations

might be possible.”

Reimagining old, out-moded interview tactics is also key, says Ludmila

## Praslova, professor of organizational psychology at Vanguard University

and the author of The Canary Code: A Guide to Neurodiversity, Dignity,

and Intersectional Belonging at Work. “We’ve been using the same

methods for years without considering what’s truly needed for a speciﬁc

job and how to identify the right candidate,” she says. After all, the

goal of job interviews is to uncover a candidate’s potential and “assess

whether that individual has the necessary skills for the role; everything

else creates unnecessary barriers.”

Here are some strategies for making your job interviews fairer and more

# inclusive.

Increase your understanding of disability. First things ﬁrst: You need

to break free from your preconceived ideas about disability, says Bach.

“Many of us hold a certain image of what disability looks like and

assume that we haven’t worked with many disabled people,” she says.

But statistically speaking, this belief is unlikely to reﬂect reality.

Roughly one in four Americans live with a disability, according to

the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and studies suggest

that about 9% of Americans have a learning diﬀerence. Many of these

diﬀerences and disabilities are hidden or invisible.

Meanwhile, 61% of disabled workers have experienced bias,

mistreatment, and bullying on the job, research shows. “Once you

broaden your understanding of disability and its implications,” says

Bach, “you realize it’s far more prevalent and complex than you

thought.”

Which is all to say that when it comes to designing more inclusive,

accessible job interviews, “sometimes you need to open yourself up

## to less comfortable forms of understanding,” notes Praslova. “That

means listening without judgment and not making assumptions about

someone faking or being lazy or high maintenance.”

Recognize that people may need accommodations and that strict

conformity to traditional interview methods can perpetuate bias.

Empathy is important — but even empathy has its limitations, Praslova

says: “It’s not about you, it’s about the other person. And their reality

might be very diﬀerent from yours.”

Look critically at your current practices. Next, examine your current

interview practices and techniques and identify unnecessary hurdles

that don’t reﬂect actual job requirements.

“Sometimes interviews are designed to trick people, make them

emotional, and throw them oﬀ balance to see how they perform under

pressure,” says Praslova. But these tactics could disproportionately

## disadvantage candidates with social anxiety or neurodivergent

thinking, and thus face greater challenges in these situations. “You’re

not interviewing for the Secret Service,” she says.

Bach agrees. The interview doesn’t have to perfectly mimic the

conditions of the job, but you might want to examine any

“physically and psychologically demanding practices” and perhaps

make adjustments, she says. (More on this later.) Do interviews need

to be all-day marathons? Must they include 90-minute-long on-the-ﬂy

case studies? Do they even need to be in person? “If it’s not part of

the job, you need to ask yourself: Are we creating an environment that

anyone can thrive in? Or are we making it artiﬁcially hard?”

Ask candidates what they need. Unfortunately, there isn’t a one-size-

ﬁts-all solution for making interviews more inclusive, says Bach. “Even

people with the same disability can have diﬀerent symptoms and

severities,” which is why you need to work with individual candidates to

determine what they might need.

Bach suggests creating “a menu of possible accommodations” that

includes examples of what’s been done in the past. This might include

providing extra time for completing tasks or responding to interview

questions, presenting questions in diﬀerent formats to address diﬀerent

learning styles, or conducting remote interviews for candidates who

may have mobility challenges.

Praslova recommends sharing this menu of options with all candidates

and encouraging them to request additional support if needed. “Make it

clear that it’s safe to ask for things and it won’t be held against them,”

she says, noting research that suggests disclosing a disability at work

is often a fraught experience. Praslova champions the platinum rule —

an evolved version of the golden rule: “Treat others as they want to be

treated,” she says. “It’s not what you want, it’s what the other person

wants.”

Build in ﬂexibility and humanity. In addition to oﬀering speciﬁc

accommodations, Praslova suggests building in ﬂexibility, convenience,

and humanity into your interviews. “If you create environments that

are good for candidates, they’ll be good for everyone,” she says. For

example, she recommends conducting interviews in quiet, private

spaces to reduce distractions and sensory overload; limiting the number

of interviews a candidate must attend in one day; and providing

# personalized support.

“If you’re inviting people to a physical site, meet them at the door and

guide them to the interview,” she says. “If it’s a virtual interview, don’t

assume they know how to use Zoom. Even when things feel obvious to

you, try to put yourself in the candidate’s shoes.”

Praslova also recommends providing all candidates with interview

questions in advance. Not only does this allow them time to prepare

thoughtful responses, it also removes some of the psychological

stress associated with interviews. Otherwise, she says, you may

unintentionally place a higher value on their conﬁdence, rather than

their skills and abilities. “When you’re measuring people’s quickness on

their feet, sometimes what you’re getting is their overconﬁdence.”

Use structured interviews. While open-ended, more casual interviews

have their appeal, research shows that structured interviews — which

involve a set number of predetermined questions — are less biased and

tend to oﬀer a more accurate assessment of a candidate’s suitability for

a role. “A lot of interviews basically come down to some variation of the

airport test: Does this person vibe with me?” says Praslova. Structured

interviews, on the other hand, “have checklists and processes that

# scaﬀold hiring managers into fairness.”

Bach recommends asking all candidates to share speciﬁc professional

experiences with questions that begin: Tell me about a time when.

To ensure fairness and objectivity, evaluate candidates solely on these

established criteria and support your assessment with solid evidence.

Don’t let factors like what the candidate is wearing, how nervous they

appear, or how easily they engage in small talk inﬂuence the interview,

she adds. “Know what you’re assessing and only assess that,” she says.

“Candidates want you to focus on their strengths and abilities and what

they can do.”

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Broaden your outlook when designing your interview process and

recognize that the experiences of others may vastly diﬀer from your

# own.

- Create a menu of possible accommodations and work with candidates

to identify their speciﬁc needs for additional support.

- Prioritize structured interviews and focus on objective criteria to

minimize bias and assess candidates fairly based on their suitability

# for the role.

# Don’t:

- Blindly adhere to traditional interviewing methods without reﬂection;

instead, examine your processes and identify unnecessary hurdles

that aren’t related to the job.

- Rely solely on candidates’ quick thinking and conﬁdence during

interviews; provide questions in advance to allow for thoughtful

## responses about their skills and abilities.
