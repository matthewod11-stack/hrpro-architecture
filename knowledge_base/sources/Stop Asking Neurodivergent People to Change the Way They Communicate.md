## Stop Asking Neurodivergent People toChange the Way They Communicate

find scouring the internet— how to nail a job interview, how to be a better listener, how tohave a difficult conversation with your boss — is not inclusive ofneurodivergent (ND) people. More often than not, it puts the onuson ND individuals to adapt and conform to neurotypical (NT)expectations of communication, which can be harmful andcounterproductive to the community.

with one or more ND diagnoses in my circle include a now highlysought-after autistic business analyst, a dyslexic scientist in thenuclear industry, computer programmers and techies, and manyartists, musicians, and other creatives. But they still remain theexception.

The expectation that ND people must jump through mentally andphysically demanding hoops to communicate “correctly” if theywant to succeed in the workplace (or even be allowed a spot in theworkplace at all) assumes that the way NTs communicate is theonly “normal” or “correct” way. It’s an outdated assumption thatsignals to ND people that their natural style is a deficit tocompensate for, and it inevitably leads to misunderstandings.When this happens,

barriers to full inclusion are upheld.As an autistic person with ADHD, I’ve experienced thedevastating consequences of being misinterpreted and wronglyjudged. I spent more than a decade struggling (and often failing)to hold the jobs I needed to stay out of poverty and maintain thehealth insurance necessary to get the care that could help meremain employed.The research-backed view, emergingin recent years, is that NTs and NDsare merely speaking different, butequally valid, social languages.When I finally landed my first official job as an editor, I thought,“This is it!” I was so excited to be working in downtown Chicagoon the 44th floor of a building next to the Sears Tower.

flew me to their Dallas office for a week to meet more of the team.I’d never worked anywhere where they’d pay for me to travel.Unfortunately, one of my more challenging ND traits is auditoryprocessing disorder, and trying to function as an editor in a busyoffice with an open floor plan was quite difficult. For the first timein my life, I resorted to talking to my doctor about documentingmy need for accommodation, as required by the employer toreceive any consideration. I was begrudgingly moved into anoffice with a door I could close, but offices were typically reservedfor management. Though I was much more capable of producinghigh-quality work in the quiet environment, the writing was onthe wall.Long story short, I was fired within four months when my doctordidn’t submit additional documentation on time to prove myneed for accommodation. My mental health deteriorated. Havinginternalized the repeated message that I was incapable and hadno value to employers, I would go on to spend the next few yearssubsisting on a meager Social Security Disability income. Thecircumstances caused me to question whether life was even worthliving.

I wish I could say that the workforce knows better now. I wish Ididn’t have to see my two ND children, now adults, facing thesame uphill battle I did.Though it’s estimated that 15 to 20% of the world’s population

exhibits some form of neurodivergence, the arbitrary biasesagainst those with minority neurotypes continues to excludemany intelligent, hardworking ND people from obtaining andprogressing in meaningful and profitable careers. It’s estimatedthat as many as

with unemployment in the United States. Over the next 10 years,the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention estimates that asmany as

1.1 million autistic kids will turn 18 and (hopefully) beentering the workforce.For this next generation, I dream of a world where our peers,managers, and leaders have at least a basic awareness of howsome brains and bodies operate a little differently, and moreimportantly, that this is normalized.

# The

research-backed view, emerging in recent years, is that NTsand NDs are merely speaking different, but equally valid, sociallanguages. As such, it’s on NT people, as much as it is ND people,to bridge the communication gap.Before diving in to suggestions for ways NTs can be bettercommunication partners, however, it’s important to understandthat

many conditions fall under the neurodivergence umbrella.Across these conditions, and between individuals, there’s a vastamount of difference in how we think, communicate, and behave.Our levels of intelligence vary, and we are just as diverse in ourinterests and abilities as anyone else.It is incumbent on those of us in theknow to reframe conversations onneurodiversity in the workplace soNDs are no longer excluded from thetable.While not everyone needs to become an expert on everythingthere is to know about autism, ADHD, and other

neurodifferences, there are a few behaviors NT people can act onimmediately to move towards a shared understanding with theNDs in their lives.

# In her article, “

## Different Listeners Listen Differently: Crossing the

Neuro-cultural Divide,” Beth Radulski, an autistic academic andresearcher, advises allies not to assume that someone isn’t payingattention to what you’re saying simply because they aren’t tickingoff all the boxes on your NT social cues checklist. Instead, gaugethe outcome of the conversation for both of you. Was there sharedunderstanding? Were mutual goals clarified? If unsure, ask orsend an email to follow up.“Most people would say they’d rather be genuinely listened to,than have someone pretend to listen,” Radulski reminds us.Rather than ask “how can I teach [the ND person] to listen? …thequestion is: what makes YOU feel heard — and how does thisrelate to your understanding of neurotypical social cues?”

Before attributing any “negative” trait you observe to a person’scharacter, give them the benefit of the doubt. What you mayperceive as a bad attitude because “He always has such an angrylook on his face!” may be a wildly inaccurate accusation aboutyour autistic coworker. Likewise, a coworker who constantlyinterrupts you in meetings (“How rude!”) could actually bemanaging ADHD (and may or may not be aware of it).Radulski advises, “The key here is to try to develop anunderstanding of non-neurotypical social cues, so that you canconsciously notice and cross-reference this with your feelings of

being un-heard, misunderstood, or disconnected, in situationswhere that may not necessarily be the case…. For many [NDpeople], ‘listening’ means rocking, flapping, or fidgeting to focus.It means allowing the gaze to fall naturally rather than focusingon interpreting eye contact.”When behaviors, like frequent interrupting, impact othersnegatively, intervention may be appropriate. Ideally, a skilled,ND-aware person will address the bothersome conduct. Situationslike this should be handled with sensitivity and address thebehavior itself and its effect on others without passing judgementor assigning motivation to the individual.

This is one of those areas where there’s a lot of variability betweenwhat works best for one person versus another, but as a generalrule, you can’t go wrong with

keeping your language free of

euphemisms, sarcasm, and vagueness. I’ll never forget the timemy mother asked my (then undiagnosed) autistic boyfriend whowas living with us, “Do you want to take out the trash?” and to herhorror, he simply answered, “No,” and went back to what he wasdoing. He was completely bewildered by the anger that followed.He had answered her seemingly direct question with an honestanswer, oblivious to the linguistic politeness she was employingout of habit.For many ND people, it’s also helpful to be addressed by ournames and for the speaker to pause occasionally to give us time toconsider their message and respond. It’s especially important tobe mindful of the environment, as background noise and othersensory input can make it more difficult for us to process what isbeing said.

Your ND coworker’s state of being is highly variable. They mayhave seemed just fine in that 9 am meeting, but don’t be surprisedif their energy seems very different later that same day. Many ofus are

susceptible to becoming overwhelmed or fatigued by all of

the sensory input we’re exposed to. The amount of sensory inputwe can tolerate varies from day to day, too, as it depends onnumerous factors — from how much quality sleep we got thenight before to how comfortable our new shoes are today. Formore on this, I highly recommend reading about the

# Fork Theory.

Let me just say that this particular advice comes with a caveat,and I’ll get to that. But if you’re unsure of what an ND coworker orother ND individual in your life might want or need, ask!One of the most important questions I suggest asking is, “How doyou prefer to be communicated with?” Many of us struggle forvarious reasons with verbal instructions. This has been a source ofa lot of miscommunication and workplace misery for ND peoplelike me. When verbal communication is unavoidable, and it oftenis, following up with an email recap of a conversation or meeting,with action items highlighted, can be a lifeline. And if you’re in aposition to follow through, consider asking, “How can I bestsupport you?” — and mean it.The Caveat: Only a tiny fraction of ND workers feel safedisclosing their neurodivergence at work. According to a

2017

report, “among college-educated employees in white-collar workenvironments, 30% of those employees worked with some form ofdisability,” but only 3.2% chose to disclose their disabilities totheir employers. That includes all disabilities, not just theinvisible ones that fall under the ND umbrella (and not all NDpeople consider themselves disabled). Furthermore, a UK study in

2020 found that

50% of hiring managers in the UK say they won’tconsider neurodivergent talent when making hiring decisions.An uncountable number of us, whether we’ve disclosed or not,have had such traumatic experiences at work that decidingwhether or not to say anything to our bosses puts us in anincredibly frightening position. As a consequence, it’s safe toassume that you may have more ND coworkers than you’re awareof. With this knowledge, you can give everyone a little more grace.

One day, it’s likely people will look back on the last few decadeswith a fair amount of shame about how ND people have beendenigrated and forced to conform to exist in an NT’s world in thesame way that in the modern day most of us feel shock that asrecently as the 1960s (and beyond, in some cultures)

left-handedkids were forced to write with their right hand or face physicalpunishment.The corporate world bears some responsibility to help the largelyNT members of their workforce bridge the communication gap.We have an opportunity, and a duty, to radically alter theworkplace and remove the barriers to full participation. It isincumbent on those of us in the know to reframe conversations onneurodiversity in the workplace so NDs are no longer excludedfrom the table. When businesses truly welcome ND workers, notonly will those workers’ lives be dramatically improved, thebusiness itself, and society as a whole, will benefit.
