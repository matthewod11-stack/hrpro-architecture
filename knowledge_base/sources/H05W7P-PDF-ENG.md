The #MeToo and Black Lives Matter movements each took the

working world by storm, bringing to the forefront issues of workplace

## sexual assault, sexual and racial harassment, and discrimination. But

while heightened awareness is making workplace conversations about

## sexism, racism, and other injustices more common, these interpersonal

conversations alone will not remove the systemic challenges keeping

inequity in place. One of the alarming symptoms of these challenges is

the low rate at which employees report incidents of assault, harassment,

and discrimination. Too many people don’t feel safe at work, and,

fearing repercussions, aren’t willing or able to speak up about it. This

vicious cycle keeps systemic inequity deeply entrenched within many

# workplaces.

Despite the high rates of sexual assault and harassment — aﬀecting up

to 90% of women in some industries — and pervasive discrimination

based on race, gender, age, and sexuality — experienced or witnessed

by 61% of U.S. employees — reporting rates remain extremely low. A

report by the EEOC found that only 30% of employees experiencing

## harassment on the basis of gender, race, national origin, disability and

other protected classes make internal complaints, and less than 15% ﬁle

formal legal charges. A meta-analysis similarly found that fewer than

one-third of workers even informally talked with a supervisor about

the sexual harassment they experienced, and less than 25% ﬁled formal

# reports with their employers.

These studies consistently found that the primary reason for low

reporting rates is retaliation, where employers or individuals respond

## to reports of discrimination or mistreatment by further punishing or

marginalizing the victim. Retaliation is astonishingly common: 68%

## of sexual harassment allegations and 42% of LGBTQ+ discrimination

allegations made to the EEOC also include charges of employer

## retaliation. (Because the EEOC considers charges of retaliation a

separate “issue” from charges of discrimination on the basis of race, sex,

national origin, and other protected classes, reliable data showing both

retaliation and these other forms of discrimination together is sparse.)

There are several additional factors that drive low reporting rates.

One is the likelihood that victims receive any beneﬁt from reporting

in the ﬁrst place. While companies encourage victims to go through

internal reporting channels, these are often legalistic grievance

procedures meant to reduce the risk of a lawsuit against the company.

Forced arbitration, a policy adopted by many companies, requires

that employees go through mandatory arbitration to resolve disputes

and waive their right to sue. And even if they do, reporting to the

## EEOC rarely results in beneﬁt to victims, with only 1% of federal

discrimination, harassment, or retaliation claims succeeding in U.S.

# courts.

Another is the inﬂexibility of options available to victims. When MIT

made an informal, conﬁdential process available to employees in the

1980s, they found that 90% of those ﬁling sexual harassment complaints

preferred that route to the more formal one. Even 40 years later, many

employers still lack these types of processes, discount informal reports

of harassment or discrimination, or oﬀer few choices for victims looking

# for resolution.

The lack of anonymity oﬀered by most reporting processes is also an

issue. Research has consistently demonstrated that oﬀering anonymous

reporting channels increases reporting rates by making it easier for

people to report and protecting victims against retaliation. While

many companies have some form of anonymous reporting channel,

resolution typically requires that employees come forward and expose

## their identities and themselves to potential retaliation as a result.

Toxic company cultures play a ﬁnal role in low rates of reporting, with

53% of employees in one study citing hostile work environment as a

reason for not reporting. If victims feel that not only is it unlikely

that their report will result in a harasser being found responsible, but

that their company would also then disregard the ﬁnding or shield the

harasser from consequences, there is very little chance they’ll choose to

# report in the ﬁrst place.

Opaque, legalistic, and inaccessible reporting practices designed to

prioritize lowering company risk rather than focusing on resolution

and recourse for victims are a major part of the problem. In fact,

companies that promote a fairer, ﬂexible, and transparent process for

victims may be better equipped to both address deep-seated problems

in their workplaces and lower the likelihood that they will be the targets

## of highly visible discrimination or harassment lawsuits.

If you want to increase reporting rates at your company — and thereby

make your workplace a more equitable, inclusive, and safe place to work

— here are four practices that you can adopt to rebuild employee trust

# in reporting.

## Demonstrate commitment to accountability from the top.

To build buy-in for any new reporting processes or tools, company

leaders must build trust through their words and actions from the start.

You can do this by not only making a public commitment to doing

better, but by establishing and publicizing metrics to hold yourselves

and the company accountable. If your eﬀorts to develop a better process

are driven even partially by a mishandling of a discrimination or

harassment incident, you should focus on re-earning trust that has been

lost. Strongly consider reaching out to any remaining employees who

were aﬀected, apologizing for harm done, and oﬀering recourse to the

# extent possible.

Invest in neutral resources to support victims of harassment and discrimination.

One option is bringing in external resources through a private therapist

or Employee Assistance Program (EAP). By giving employees explicit

permission to access these services and making it clear that these

providers are independent from the company reporting structure,

you can provide employees with conﬁdential support, counseling,

and advice. While these resources can be expensive, workplace

mental health interventions have been shown to have a high return

on investment and similar approaches could provide much-needed

support to employees facing harassment and discrimination.

Establish an ombuds ofﬁce.

An ombuds is an oﬀ-the-record resource currently used by at least 13%

of US companies to provide information and guidance to employees considering reporting. Because they are not an oﬃcial reporting

channel, ombuds can talk candidly to employees about fears and

concerns and walk them through the options available to them,

including but not limited to making a formal report. Importantly,

ombuds serve as an alternative to legalistic hearing processes and allow

employees some degree of ﬂexibility in communicating their complaint

to the individual(s) accused.

Create anonymous formal reporting channels that both protect reporters and inform organizational change.

A large range of anonymous reporting tools are available to companies,

including hotlines, chatbots, website forms, and phone apps. One

company in the food industry with a few thousand employees partnered

with a third-party platform for their anonymous reporting and found

that after 6 months reporting rates had increased by 30%. Faith in

the new anonymous channel led employees to come forward earlier

with issues that previously may not have been reported for months,

if ever, allowing the organization to address problems before they

developed into major incidents. While each tool has its own strengths

and companies should design their solutions to best ﬁt their own needs,

eﬀective solutions (whether fully internal, through an external platform,

or a mix of the two) should be:

- Convenient, allowing employees to quickly make and submit reports

with the desired level of detail, including witnesses if relevant.

- Transparent, allowing employees to see where a report is going and

its status: whether received, reviewed, acted on, or resolved.

- Flexible, allowing employees to indicate the desired resolution to their

report, ranging from the ending of unwanted behavior to education for

a business unit to termination of the accused employee(s).

- Responsive, allowing employees to anonymously interact with an

individual(s) who has their interests in mind throughout the resolution

# process.

- Independent, allowing employees to report without fear of retaliation

or repercussions through a neutral process that preserves anonymity.

- Actionable, allowing employers to respond to reports without

compromising the anonymity of reporters. One way to achieve this is

by tracking and aggregating details from submitted reports and acting

on patterns within that aggregated data.

Leaders who want to take a critical step toward ending discrimination,

## harassment, microaggressions, and mistreatment in their workplaces

need to rethink and redesign the way reporting is done. When

employers can successfully prevent retaliation, give victims agency and

transparency throughout dispute resolution, and give victims resolution

and recourse, they will be able to restore their employees’ trust in

# reporting.
