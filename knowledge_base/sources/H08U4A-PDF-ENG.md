What happens when organizations don’t take kindness seriously?

People leave or are absent, trust erodes, teams stop communicating

well, time is lost to tension and conﬂict, and customers feel the impact.

One study of more than 500 of the world’s leading companies during the

Great Resignation found that an unkind workplace culture was over 10

times more likely than compensation to be the reason why people left

a job. Another study found that Fortune 1000 managers spend nearly

seven weeks each year dealing with the fallout from employee incivility

# —the ﬂip side of kindness.

In contrast, workplaces with cultures and systems that support kindness

have been shown to have stronger relationships, greater collaboration,

and higher engagement and retention. Staﬀ are more likely to help each

other, speak up, share ideas, and stay. Customers are more likely to trust

the service and recommend it to others.

Kindness isn’t soft. It’s not optional and it can’t be left to chance.

Like safety protocols and performance reviews, kindness must be

built into how people work. That means expectations, systems, and

accountability. It’s part of the social infrastructure that builds trust,

## collaboration, and connection within and across an organization.

To make this real, organizations need a shared, clear understanding

of what kindness looks like so that employees know when they are

doing it well and consistently between colleagues, across teams and

# organizations, and with customers.

Let’s start with what kindness is and isn’t. Kindness is something we

do, not just something we feel. It shows up in the choices we make and

the ways we behave. The research of one of us (Nicki Macklin), whose

aim was to distinguish between kindness, compassion and empathy in

healthcare services, came up with this deﬁnition of kindness: The

proactive effort to support someone else’s growth, well-being, or success;

it is a set of observable, intentional actions.

Kindness often means doing hard things like giving tough feedback.

Imagine someone on a team you’re managing keeps missing deadlines.

When things are busy, it’s tempting to swoop in and ﬁx it yourself, let

it slide, or get angry or frustrated and snap at the person. Kindness

means taking a diﬀerent approach. It means creating space and time

to ask that person: “What’s going on?” Maybe he is unclear about the

task priorities. Maybe he is overwhelmed at work or at home. Whatever

the reason, your best response may be to work with him to reset

expectations, improve communication, or change his workload. This

isn’t about making excuses or lowering standards. It’s about helping

people to meet them and doing so in a way that builds trust and respect.

Niceness is about avoiding discomfort, staying agreeable, sidestepping

hard conversations, and letting things slide. Kindness means the

opposite. It doesn’t require agreement or even liking each other.

Engaging in hard conversations or raising concerns shows that you

believe the other person has greater potential or that you want to help

your team succeed.

## Kindness enables two other pillars of a high-performing workplace

culture: psychological safety and social capital. When people act

with kindness—by supporting each other’s growth, showing respect,

protecting dignity, and stepping in to help—they create conditions

where others feel comfortable speaking up, asking for help, sharing

ideas, and owning mistakes and feel a sense of purpose and inclusion.

That’s a psychologically safe environment. When these conditions build

trust, support healthy group norms, and strengthen relationships that

lead to collaboration and information sharing, that’s social capital.

Kindness, then, is integral to shaping how people collaborate, connect

# and perform.

# The Cost of Unkindness

Social isolation and political shifts have eroded kindness in all kinds of

institutions. Expectations of basic respect are no longer a given as we

move through our days. As renowned political scientist Robert Putnam

put it, people learn how to behave—what to say and do—through

participating in organized activities and communities, and when face-

to-face interaction fades, so do the behavioral norms that rely on it.

## In healthcare, data on how patients perceive kindness in their

interactions shows that poor communication and team coordination

negatively aﬀect their trust in their care. Conversely, when patients

experience kindness through actions that make them feel seen, heard,

included, and supported, their trust rises.

These dynamics aren’t unique to healthcare. The cost of unkindness

can be found in studies across a wide range of workplace settings.

The study of incivility that we mentioned earlier found that 98% of

employees had experienced unkindness (incivility) in their workplaces,

leading to increased absenteeism, lower eﬀort, less collaboration, and

reduced enthusiasm for their organization. And incivility doesn’t just

mean extreme bullying. It includes everyday rudeness, gaslighting, or

# disrespect.

Even witnessing unkind behavior takes a toll. One study found that

when people saw rudeness among colleagues, their creativity and

decision-making suﬀered. Over time, teams that tolerate low-level

unkindness risk normalizing it, eroding group cohesion, psychological

safety, engagement, and retention. That breakdown of social capital

weakens the organization’s edge as a service provider and employer of

# choice.

Kindness changes the picture. When staﬀ feel noticed, valued, and

respected, they are more willing to help each other, collaborate, and

solve problems. The biggest predictors of retention aren’t money or

workload; they are social. What matters most is respect, inclusion,

pride in our work, and team relationships. Kindness supports all of

these. It builds cultures of safety, trust, and care. And when people

see their personal values like kindness reﬂected in the organization’s

commitment to quality, safety, and culture, they are more likely to stay.

## Encouragingly, in healthcare, employee and customer experiences

often align. When staﬀ feel respected, patients tend to feel respected

too. When teamwork is strong, patients notice, and safety outcomes

improve. But when staﬀ don’t feel respected or safe enough to speak up,

they are more likely to leave, and patients trust the care less.

# A Leadership Imperative

Creating workplaces where kindness is the norm starts with a

company’s top leaders. They need to make kindness visible and align

it with what people experience. In other words, don’t just say it matters,

show it. Kindness is easy when things are smooth. The real test is how

people behave when work gets tense or relationships strain. That’s when

leaders need to create space for diﬀerent views, listen for points of

friction, and understand what gets in the way of kindness.

In diﬃcult situations, silence is a manifestation of unkindness. If people

aren’t speaking up, problems linger, and mistakes get buried. Rejecting

silence with kindness requires leaders to be intentional about what

gets rewarded, appreciated, challenged, or ignored. Unkindness must

be actively discouraged.

One CEO who understands this is Microsoft’s Satya Nadella. He has

made kindness, empathy, and curiosity integral to what it means to

lead well at his company. He has recognized that such an environment

## fosters innovation, collaboration, and trust.

Leaders who take kindness seriously build systems to support it. One

such system is Cleveland Clinic’s annual professional review process.

All physicians take part in a structured, face-to-face review each year,

where their performance, goals, and direction are discussed. Each

physician is required to set a personal improvement goal for the year

ahead; some might want to learn a new technique, improve their

communication skills, or get better at teaching. Feedback ﬂows both

ways, and people are asked to reﬂect on what’s working, what’s not, and

what support they might need. That kind of structure sets the tone. It

builds a culture of trust, clarity, and shared responsibility. It is a way

of hardwiring kindness into the organization in the sense that people

are given time, attention, and respect. That signals to people that they

matter, and that the organization is invested in their success.

# A Management Discipline

Beyond senior leaders, kindness should become part of everyday

management throughout the organization. All managers must

understand it’s not optional. They should treat it as part of the job, and

they should be held accountable for doing so.

Ultimately, managers are responsible for how their teams perform

and collaborate across the organization. In a study of 51 work teams

at a manufacturing company published in 1999, one of us (Amy

Edmondson) and her team found that psychological safety was the

single most important factor in team performance—measured by two

surveys: of the teams, who were asked to assess their own performance,

and of the recipients of the teams’ work (either a manager or a

downstream internal customer), who were asked to rate it. This ﬁnding

was echoed by Project Aristotle, a Google initiative that explored what

made that company’s 180 teams eﬀective or not: It found that the

highest-performing teams—in terms of metrics related to productivity,

achieving deadlines, and work quality—had exceptional levels of

psychological safety. All team members were aﬀorded opportunities

to speak and share ideas and demonstrated that they cared for and

supported one another.

This is what happens when kindness is built into reliable, high-

functioning systems led by managers who understand it’s not optional.

They use clear tactics for embedding kindness as a strategic priority: It’s

expected, measured, and reinforced at every level. Key management

levers for making kindness an organization-wide norm include the

# following:

- 1. Treat kindness as a hard skill.

Organizations can be clear about what kindness looks like in action

and can teach it. That includes skills like how to listen without

defensiveness, give and receive feedback, and handle conﬂict or hard

# conversations with care.

At Google, managers are trained and expected to actively create and

## support psychologically safe environments for their teams. Employee

surveys and feedback are used to gauge how team-level behaviors are

being inﬂuenced by their managers (such as how feedback is given

and received and how challenges and uncertainty are expressed and

managed). This data is integrated into each manager’s performance

review, highlighting and rewarding positive behaviors and reinforcing

accountability. Framing kindness as a professional capability reinforces

that it is a critical skill linked to success within the organization and not

# just a nice-to-have trait.

SAP, known for its inclusive workplace practices and neurodiverse

hiring, runs the Autism at Work program to teach managers how

to support psychological safety and kindness in action. They receive

training to develop skills to manage conﬂict, communicate in a clear

and kind fashion, and promote inclusive team behavior. This program

has been linked to gains in productivity, engagement, and retention.

- 2. Establish clear expectations.

To embed kindness in an organization, it must be as clearly deﬁned and

reinforced as safety, quality, and professionalism are.

One organization that does this is the All Blacks, New Zealand’s national

rugby team. It enforces a strong behavioral standard that team members

exhibit humility, show respect for others, and act responsibly in team

matters. It leaves no room for unchecked ego. It is reﬂected in selection

decisions and teamwork on and oﬀ the ﬁeld. Senior players are expected

to take charge of cleaning the locker rooms after games. Players are

expected to call each other out for behavior that doesn’t reﬂect the

norm. And no matter how talented they are, if someone’s behavior

erodes the team cohesion and culture, he is out.

Another example of creating speciﬁc expectations for kindness is the

Cleveland Clinic’s Communicate with H.E.A.R.T. training program for

all its healthcare workers. Its mnemonics such as “S.T.A.R.T. with

Heart” provides employees with an easy way to remember how to

## meaningfully connect with others during everyday conversations: Smile

## and greet warmly; Tell your name, role, and expectations; Actively

## listen and assist; build Rapport and relationships; Thank the person.

The Clinic has institutionalized this model of professionalism into

every aspect of its organization— from onboarding and training to

performance feedback—and has visibly displayed it in staﬀ spaces.

All staﬀ should know that they are expected to treat colleagues

## and customers, as well as external stakeholders such as suppliers

## and distributors, with kindness in every interaction and exceptions

—say, for having a bad day—won’t be tolerated. They should be

made to understand that even mild displays of unkindness impact

performance, trust, and morale. And just as workplaces have systems for

reporting safety concerns, they should have trusted, formal processes

for reporting concerns about unkind behaviors, especially in high-

## pressure, fast-paced, or customer-facing environments.

Managers at all levels should set the tone—by acting as a role model

and by what they do and don’t allow. Organizations can support them

by teaching them how to reinforce expectations, including what to do

when people fall short.

Some organizations can serve as models. One is the U.S. Department

of Veterans Aﬀairs, where civility training is part of leadership

development and includes learning to manage and respond to feedback

loops about unprofessional conduct in real time. Another is Ritz-

Carlton, the luxury hotel and resort chain. During induction training,

new employees are given a “Credo Card” with a list of expectations,

including greeting every guest warmly by name and showing genuine

respect and appreciation for colleagues. These are further reinforced

in daily team meetings, and when people do a good job, it is explicitly

recognized.

Here are some examples of kindness norms that can be embedded into

## onboarding, performance reviews, leadership training, and governance

# structures:

- Employees and customers will always be addressed by name, and

eﬀorts will be taken to pronounce them correctly.

- When we are in a conversation, we will actively listen and maintain our

full presence (e.g., phones are put away, eye contact is maintained).

- Gratitude for others will be expressed, and we will acknowledge the

# contributions of those around us.

- Feedback—positive or corrective—is given regularly and promptly,

consistently delivered with respect, honesty, and care for dignity and

# growth.

- If someone acts unkindly, it gets called out in real time, and that

person is held accountable for that behavior. If an individual’s

behavior puts others at risk of physical or emotional harm, it is taken

seriously and followed up through formal reporting channels.

When kindness is framed in this way, it becomes part of the shared

legend of what it means to work in a place: what it means to be a good

## colleague, professional, and manager or leader.

- 3. Measure kindness.

Most organizations that take something seriously measure it. The same

should apply to kindness. It should be measured in terms of observable

## behaviors and team experiences and not in vague or subjective terms.

While no perfect kindness metric currently exists, many organizations

already measure distinctly related dynamics such as psychological

safety, inclusion, civility, and trust. Others dig into the root causes

## of turnover, absenteeism, engagement, and productivity, which can

include the presence or absence of kindness at work.

Organizations don’t need to reinvent the wheel to measure relational

behaviors. Existing surveys can be adapted. Items not labelled

speciﬁcally as kindness can measure the conditions that help or hinder

# kindness in everyday work.

This HBR article outlines survey items used for measuring social capital

## by Press Ganey, a healthcare performance-improvement company

that specializes in measuring and improving patient, employee, and

consumer experiences. These include healthcare employees’ feelings

about being respected and involved, their sense of equity and

belonging, and perceptions of safety culture. These are items that reﬂect

environments where kindness is present. Survey items—rated on a scale

of 1 to 5, from strongly disagree to strongly agree—include the following:

- My manager treats employees with respect.

- This organization cares about patients.

- My manager encourages teamwork.

- My co-workers value employees from diﬀerent backgrounds.

- Employees can report mistakes without fear.

Customer experience data can complement employee data. In the

same survey, patient experience indicators include their perceptions of

whether they were treated in a caring and compassionate manner, and

providers’ communication practices. Key indicators include:

- Staﬀ worked well together to care for me.

- Staﬀ cared about me as a person.

- Staﬀ addressed my emotional needs.

- Nurses treated me with courtesy and respect.

- Care provider showed concern for my questions/worries. Physicians

listened carefully to me.

In Google’s Project Aristotle, internal staﬀ surveys measured staﬀ

behaviors that we see as markers for kind and respectful team cultures

such as listening without interrupting, including others in decision-

making, accepting and acting on honest feedback, and giving people

in the team equal opportunities to speak and share ideas. Measuring

these behaviors makes it clear that they’re required, not optional.

Benchmarking such data also helps teams and individuals understand

how their performance compares to others. It can help teams to

reﬂect on what they are doing well and what they can do even better.

Measuring kindness makes it visible and reframes it as a core value of

# the organization.

# Make Kindness Non-Negotiable

It’s time for organizations to stop treating kindness as an optional extra.

The evidence for kindness is clear: Kindness improves performance,

builds stronger teams, fosters trust among employees and customers,

and keeps people connected to organizations.

Like safety, quality, and professionalism, kindness must be part of

managing, taught, measured, and reinforced. It deserves to be treated

## as something vital in board reports, leadership development, and

performance conversations. It means setting a high bar for how people

work with each other and how they treat their colleagues, customers,

and other stakeholders. Kindness is the right thing to do, but it’s also

the smart thing to do to engage and retain employees and customers,

forge stronger relationships, and achieve high levels of collaboration

# and innovation.
