Sheila is exhausted. The CHRO of a mid-sized biotech company,

she’s spent the past couple of years running program after program

to support the growth and development of hundreds of globally

distributed employees. Despite these eﬀorts, she’s facing mounting

problems: Retention numbers are dipping, and the representation of

underrepresented groups in senior leadership remains stubbornly low.

Sheila is a composite, drawn from the experience of the HR leaders

we speak to regularly — well-intentioned practitioners working hard to

support their workforce and improve diversity, equity, and inclusion

across the organization, but not seeing the results they want. So what’s

going on?

We argue that many organizations have the right programs, but

they’re being implemented the wrong way, sometimes exacerbating

problems they’re meant to ﬁx. This is especially clear when it comes

## to leadership development programs, such as mentorship programs

or leadership coaching. According to research, employees that have

access to these kinds of professional development opportunities have

34% higher retention than those who do not. What’s more, a nationally

representative study found that companies with mentoring programs

saw an 18% increase in Black women managers over ﬁve years.

But leadership development is only eﬀective if it’s implemented

equitably. This is where we see many organizations falling short,

starting with the selection process.

In a study of 200 people leaders, which included a survey and

qualitative interviews, we found that while 79% said identifying high-

potential leaders (often for development programs) was a high priority,

only 16% have a formal process in place to do so. A staggering 85%

of leaders told us they relied on informal manager feedback to make

decisions about who should get a leadership development opportunity.

Most HR professionals sense that this is a problem: 51% admitted that

the way they currently select leaders gave some employees an unfair

advantage. They are onto something. According to McKinsey’s 2021

Women in the Workplace study, white men make up 35% of entry-level

employees but 62% of the C-suite. The reverse pattern is true for women

and especially women of color, who make up 17% of entry-level roles but

# only 4% of the C-suite.

The takeaway: As employees ascend the career ladder, representation

## in the leadership pipeline increases for those in majority groups, but

decreases for underrepresented ones. This pattern hasn’t budged in

# decades.

We argue that a major reason for stalled progress in leadership

representation is the inequitable way leadership development

opportunities are allocated in many organizations. When informal

means are used to select employees for opportunities like mentorship,

leadership coaching or other high-potential programs it’s all too likely

that our biases about who has potential (according to research: tall,

attractive, white, men) come into play. Since leadership development

opportunities tend to beget other opportunities, the problem of

inequitable selection compounds over time.

By primarily relying on informal feedback, organizations are impeding

their ability to make the best decisions about who may beneﬁt from

powerful development programs. Research also suggests approaching

selection in this way limits their potential impact. In their new

book, Getting to Diversity, for example, professors Frank Dobbin and

Alexandra Kalev write, “mentoring has the biggest payoﬀ for the

people who aren’t on the executive’s radar.” They share the example

of Sun Microsystems, which found giving mentors to “non-star workers”

resulted in the biggest performance improvements.

## The most equitable and eﬀective solution to the challenge of leadership

development selection is to oﬀer opportunities to all employees who are

part of the broader target population. For instance, if you currently oﬀer

leadership coaching for “high-potential” new managers, why not open it

# up to all new managers?

Dobbin and Kalev report that this is akin to the approach taken

by Sodexo, which saw its best results — increased retention and a

sustained pipeline of underrepresented talent — from democratizing

# development opportunities.

If fully democratizing leadership development isn’t currently a

possibility at your organization, we urge you to implement the following

four steps for a more equitable selection process, while keeping in mind

an important prerequisite: Since processes only work if people follow

them, it’s essential to build buy-in from managers and leaders from the

very beginning.

- 1. Clarify the opportunities.

First, identify all the formal and informal leadership development

opportunities that exist in your organization. Include all opportunities

— everything from doling out stretch assignments to job rotations to

mentorship programs — that help employees improve the skills needed

to advance and gain visibility. This exercise often brings to light just

how many opportunities are currently being ﬁlled informally.

- 2. Define the qualifications.

Next, deﬁne what qualiﬁes an employee for each of the diﬀerent

opportunities you listed. Your deﬁnitions should include clear,

measurable evaluation criteria. As a general rule, criteria should be

based not on an employee’s “potential,” where there’s lots of room for

# bias, but on demonstrated performance.

For instance, if the opportunity is for leadership training, criteria could

be demonstrated behaviors that show the employee builds trust with

team members, is curious, and takes initiative.

- 3. Communicate opportunities to all.

In our research, we found that deﬁnitional knowledge decreased

alongside organizational power: Respondents told us that 49% of senior

leaders knew what it meant to be a high-potential leader, but that only

25% of employees were also aligned on that deﬁnition.

Make sure everyone across the organization, including employees

and managers, understands the leadership development opportunities

and necessary qualiﬁcations. One simple way to do this is to ask all

managers to send out an email (based on a template prepared by

## HR) one week after performance reviews, when career growth and

development is especially top of mind for employees, that lists all

## the leadership development opportunities available, the qualiﬁcations

needed, and how to apply. This gives managers something concrete

to oﬀer to advance career conversations post-reviews and ensures

everyone knows about the development opportunities available.

- 4. Formalize the selection process.

Create a formal selection process that encourages fair and transparent

comparisons of employees to increase accountability. It’s not enough to

simply have criteria for selection if managers only apply that criteria

selectively to one or two people they already have in mind for an

opportunity. Research shows a comparative approach, where managers

see how each of their reports is performing before making a selection

decision, reduces bias.

For example, one Peoplism client (the DEI ﬁrm where Liz is co-founder),

a legal tech company, recognized that providing stretch assignments is

a key growth opportunity that leads to promotions, but that managers

were distributing these unevenly. Peoplism recommended that once

an employee receives an average score of 3.5 (out of 5) on a bi-annual

performance review they should be assigned a stretch assignment in the

next quarter. We built a simple form where managers could quickly see

who was ready for a stretch assignment, rather than relying on their

gut. The form provided an added layer of accountability. HR business

partners can be enlisted to review forms and coach managers on this

# new behavior.

Many leaders acknowledge that representation gaps at the top are

hurting employee engagement, recruitment, and retention. We argue

that the solution is hiding in plain sight: redesigning the way

existing leadership development opportunities are distributed. Instead

of perpetuating a system that rewards those we are biased to believe

have “potential,” leaders can leverage development programs to reduce

## bias and fairly advance underrepresented leaders.
