Since the late 1990s, more than 30 million people have beneﬁted from

a corrective eye surgery procedure called LASIK. Before the advent

of LASIK, surgeons used a scalpel to cut into the cornea. Then, they

reshaped it to improve a patient’s vision. This caused a lot of damage to

surrounding eye tissues. Instead of a scalpel, LASIK uses a femtosecond

laser, which emits powerful pulses of light for only a femtosecond (one

quadrillionth of a second). Surgeons can make very precise cuts that do

not cause any collateral damage.

The basic technology, known as Chirped Pulse Ampliﬁcation (CPA), was

developed in the mid-1980s by the French physicist Gerard Mourou,

earning him the 2018 Nobel Prize in physics together with Donna

Strickland. But the idea of applying CPA-generated femtosecond lasers

to ophthalmology was entirely serendipitous. Not quite coincidence

but usually unintended, serendipity involves what Robert K. Merton

## describes as “making discoveries, by accidents or sagacity, of things

(someone was) not in quest of.”

# Serendipity Is a Three-Step Process

While it is sometimes confused with luck, serendipity is a process that

involves three steps. Let’s look at how it worked in the case of LASIK:

- 1. An unexpected event happens.

In 1993, several graduate students were working in Mourou’s lab at the

University of Michigan. Detao Du was one of them. One evening, he

forgot to put on his safety glasses while he was adjusting the mirrors of

a femtosecond laser. One of his eyes was accidentally hit by the beam of

the laser. Du was immediately taken to the hospital to make sure his eye

had not been damaged.

- 2. Someone sees value in the unexpected event.

Once in the hospital, Du was examined by Ron Kurtz, the

ophthalmologist on duty. While there was no damage to his eye, Kurtz

noticed several unusual burns in his retina. As he recalls: “When we

dilated his eye, what I saw was… retinal burns in the very center of his

retina. But these were unique in that they were very small and very

precise. I was curious as to what kind of laser this was and learned what

a femtosecond laser was.”

- 3. Someone leverages the serendipitous opportunity.

Shortly after examining Du, Kurtz met with Mourou. He joined his team

and started to work on potential applications of femtosecond lasers in

ophthalmology. One year later, Kurtz and Du presented their ﬁndings

at an academic conference. Tibor Juhasz was one of the attendants. At

the time, he was consulting for a company that was exploring the use

## of picosecond (one trillionth of a second) lasers for eye surgery. The

technology did not function properly. Because the pulses were too long,

they inﬂicted a lot of damage to eye tissues.

Juhasz immediately saw the potential of femtosecond lasers. As he

recalls: “Ron (Kurtz) gave a talk about his ﬁndings with femtosecond

laser pulses … showing that everything that was the problem

with picoseconds can be overcome using femtoseconds.” After the

conference, Mourou asked Juhasz to join his team. He also convinced

the University of Michigan, the NIH, and the NSF to provide additional

funding. Together with Kurtz, Juhasz founded the company that

launched the ﬁrst femtosecond laser for ophthalmology in 2001.

Juhasz recalls the early days of the startup: “People in the industry were

initially very skeptical that the concept would work.” But his persistence

paid oﬀ. In 2007, the business was sold to a medical optics company

for more than $ 800 million. Today, it belongs to Johnson & Johnson

Vision. And the story didn’t end there. After working on corrective

eye surgery, Kurtz and Juhasz developed a femtosecond laser-based

procedure for cataract surgery. More recently, Juhasz has created a new

startup that uses the same technology to treat glaucoma.

# How Can Companies Leverage Serendipity?

Serendipity is a concept that has been around for hundreds of years.

It has led to many scientiﬁc breakthroughs. For instance, Alexander

Fleming discovered penicillin while doing research on inﬂuenza. Pﬁzer

scientists found a treatment for erectile dysfunction while developing

a blood pressure drug. But unlike scientists, business leaders and

managers are often reluctant to embrace serendipity. To some extent,

this is understandable. Serendipity is unpredictable and companies

cannot entirely depend on it to innovate. Companies are also very

diﬀerent from universities. Their raison d’être is not to advance science,

but to be proﬁtable and grow. Nonetheless, we believe that more

businesses could beneﬁt from more doses of serendipity. Here are three

science-inspired strategies that business leaders can use to better

# leverage it:

- 1. Encourage openness to surprises.

A hallmark of scientists is their openness to surprises. In the

femtosecond laser story, Kurtz was immediately intrigued by the

unusual burns he saw on Du’s retina. He was also curious to understand

where they came from.

Some managers have a similar ability to make sense of the unexpected.

In the early 1970s, Bernard Sadow was returning from a holiday in the

Caribbean. While waiting in the airport’s customs transfer area, he saw

an employee pushing a heavy machine on a wheeled skid. He looked at

his heavy suitcases and thought: “Now that’s what we need: wheels on

luggage.” And just like that, the rolling suitcase was born.

In the business world, managers overlook surprises because they are too

focused on day-to-day operations. When Sadow came up with the idea

for the rolling suitcase, he was working at a luggage company. Had he

been on a business trip rather than on holiday, he would have likely

been too busy to notice the airport employee maneuvering the heavy

machine and to make the connection that inspired the rolling suitcase.

To foster openness to surprises, business leaders should regularly invite

their team members to share the unexpected observations they’ve

made. At ﬁrst, they are likely to be skeptical. Once they begin tracking

anomalies however, their ability to spot them will improve. When

people know they’re expected to notice the unexpected, they become

more receptive and attentive to it. Over time, building this habit will

strengthen a company’s ability to recognize and act on unforeseen

# opportunities.

Haier is a case in point. In the 1990s, Chinese farmers were repeatedly

contacting Haier’s maintenance service to complain that their washing

machines kept breaking down. The service team soon discovered that

the farmers were using them to wash potatoes before selling them

at local markets. Instead of dismissing the complaints, Haier saw an

opportunity and eventually developed an entirely new range of potato-

washing machines.

- 2. Foster cross-disciplinary interactions.

Cross-disciplinary interaction lies at the heart of serendipity. When

individuals with diverse backgrounds and skills come together, the

exchange of perspectives can spark unexpected connections and lead

# to new opportunities.

## In 2022, all the main protagonists of the femtosecond laser story

## (Mourou, Strickland, Kurtz, Juhasz, and Du) received the Golden Goose

Award. This prize honors scientists whose federally funded research

has led to unexpected innovations with a signiﬁcant impact on society.

Without the combined expertise of physicists and ophthalmologists,

there would have been no femtosecond laser eye surgery. Physicists

had searched for practical applications of femtosecond lasers, but they

couldn’t come up with an innovative idea.

Within companies, employees with diverse areas of expertise are often

spread across diﬀerent departments. This makes cross-disciplinary

collaboration unlikely to happen naturally. To make spontaneous

interactions a part of employees’ daily routines, companies should

design spaces that make it easy for them to connect. Steve Jobs, Apple’s

famous co-founder, argued, in connection with his design choices for

Pixar’s headquarters, that: “There’s a temptation in our networked

age to think that ideas can be developed by email and iChat—that’s

crazy. Creativity comes from spontaneous meetings, from random

discussions. You run into someone, you ask what they’re doing, you say

‘Wow,’ and soon you’re cooking up all sorts of ideas.”

Following his lead, many companies have designed their headquarters

to encourage serendipitous interactions. A standout example is Nvidia,

## whose Endeavor (2018) and Voyager (2022) buildings in Santa Clara

have been described as a “Mecca of physical meet-ups.” With their open

catwalks, central plazas, and terraced platforms, they are structured to

## encourage chance encounters and spontaneous collaboration.

## In an oﬃce setting, connections between employees from diverse

backgrounds often form naturally through casual conversations and

spontaneous interactions. In hybrid or remote environments, however,

informal cross-team exchanges are far less common. That’s why it is

essential for managers to encourage cross-disciplinary collaboration.

This can take various forms. For instance, employees may be invited

to join another team’s meetings to share insights or oﬀer feedback.

Alternatively, they could be asked to lead a session with a diﬀerent team

to bring a fresh perspective. Managers may also form cross-functional

teams to enable collaboration on short-term projects.

Companies should also tap into the potential of external professional

networks. This means encouraging employees to engage with industry

associations and sponsoring their participation in conferences, even

those outside their direct ﬁeld. Maintaining connections with former

employees through alumni networks can also be a valuable source of

# unexpected insights and opportunities.

- 3. Make experimentation an integral part of the culture.

Experiments play a crucial role in science. They also drive major

innovations in business. For instance, the inkjet printer originated from

a failed experiment. In the late 1970s, Canon was exploring new printing

## technologies. The Japanese company identiﬁed inkjet printing as a

particularly promising avenue and assembled a small team to work on

# this new technology.

During one experiment, an employee accidentally touched the tip of an

ink-ﬁlled syringe with a hot soldering iron. Much to his surprise, the

heat caused the ink to spray out of the needle. He immediately realized

that heat—rather than pressure—could be used to trigger the spray of

# ink.

Companies are more likely to discover serendipitous opportunities

when they empower employees to run small-scale experiments.

While some of these experiments will fail, that doesn’t mean they

are worthless. What appears to be failure may be a ﬁrst step

toward an unexpected breakthrough. In a business context however,

experimentation can only thrive with strong backing from top

executives. They must champion it and acknowledge its role in driving

innovation and success. Otherwise, employees are unlikely to risk

running experiments that may eventually fail.

Canon’s leadership gave the inkjet printing team the freedom to

experiment. Although the inkjet printer as we know it began as a

fortunate accident, it earned leadership support as soon as its potential

became clear. Without that backing, one of the company’s most iconic

products might never have existed.

. . .

While serendipity is highly valued in science, it is often overlooked or

mistaken for luck in business. As a result, many managers don’t open
