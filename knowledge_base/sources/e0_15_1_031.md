# COCLEGE DISTRICT

- In- past decades, population growth in the tri-county area has been both rapid and cOnststant., This growth has averaged a little over 26 percent a decade' since 1940i 'whije the 'population has increased between '2'1 and 30 percent. Current projections,suggest that the population will continue to grow; however.; at 5l owes_ rate;

The- proportional increase of the district's population residing in the. urban centers of the three counties_has paralleled the general increase in population. The urban population has risen from 36 percent in 1940 to 62 percent in 1976: These statistics indicate that urban growth exceeds rural growth, and that no new urban centers have developed from-the small towns in the distr/ct.

The median age*of residents in the college district was 28.8 years in 1970. Currently:it is 29.5 years, which suggests the median, age of residents Insthe district-is rising. At the same time, the birth rate is declining, and it is increasingly difficult to predict when/if couples will choose to have children. FUrther, the number'of children becoming school age is declining improportion to the numbers ofresidents entering th, 25 to 35 age groupings.

# Age ofpopulation

The-median number of school yearsompleted by residents of the tri-county area was 12.16 years in 1970.. The national average was 12.2 years. aV2rage attainment_ there were a number of district residents who completed =far less formal education:

# NOTES ON INTERPRETAT4ON OF SURVFY

# I

Most of the questionnaire items allowed six possible responses: scale, with one-being high and five low, and NA (not applicable to you).

# a five point

The tables in this report were developed on the assumption that respondents would view three as a mid-point, thus anything biter than mid (points 1 and 2) would indicate a positive issesoment of quality, while anything below mid(4 Pe 5 on the scale) would indicate a negative evaluation of quality.

# % Most

# % Mid

- .% Least

# % NA

(point 3)

# (points 4 & 5)

It was further assumed that responses in the Most column had to equal.40% or moe0if tnose surveyed to be important. for both the Least and NA columns.

Gauges,of 20% or more were estaolished

In several sections of each instrument, double scales were used, one to measure -thexespondent's Ideal and the other to indicate the pdhon!s perception of -the Real situation at that time. combined fOr the'highor Most column, and 4 and 5 for the low, or Least column. Difference. as the,base figure and the positive (+) or negative (-) difference points were If the difference in the Most column was -20 or higher, 4t was computed. inter;;.eted a signal of a differenceEiiween the Ideal and,Real sufilcient enough to affect program'quality. the Least and NA columns became important signals of potential detractors to qbaliiiograms.

As before, points i and 2 on the scale were.

I = Ideal, R = RealTiM D = The percentage of responses-in the Real column was established

The high percentage of "yes" responses indicates student (coh,imer) satisfaction,, and gives an index of quality to some significant variables in the educational process.

The questionnaire also attempted to measure a number of areas that ail: program planning, and, as such, are,indicators of program quality.

Without, previous assessment data on program quality in the Livision, there was Thus several areas'of no quantitative base against which to measure quality. the.inStruments were designed to measure opinion or judgMents, representing.

All three survey instruments were p:iot tested in the Community Education Depart- ment at Linn-,Benton Community College, which is.cicse by and which attracts students much like those who enroll in adult and continuing education claises at Chemeketa Community College./ Revisions were made as a result of these tests and of suggestions from Chemeketa Community College staff in Community Services and other divisions on campus.
