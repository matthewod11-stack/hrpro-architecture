When the Covid-19 pandemic hit, people across the globe faced

## new anxieties about their health, families, income, and stability. For

company leaders, all that upheaval put worker mental health into the

can’t-ignore category of issues aﬀecting their organizations.

External forces aﬀecting employee mental health have continued to

proliferate since: The fast pace of AI implementation is changing the

shape of many careers, geopolitical tumult brings worry about stability,

and murky and shifting economic outlooks can lead to cost-cutting

# measures like layoﬀs.

In short, your people have a lot to worry about right now. A new

## survey from the workplace wellness consultancy Mind Share Partners

in partnership with Qualtrics of over 1,100 U.S. employees found that

90% of participants reported “at least minor levels of one mental health

challenge,” with the top three stressors being U.S. politics, global events,

# and personal ﬁnances.

As a leader, you’re likely feeling it, too: A 2024 Businessolver survey

of 3,000 CEOs, HR professionals, and employees found that 55% of

CEOs reported experiencing a mental health issue (such as anxiety,

## depression, loneliness, burnout, and obsessive compulsive disorder) in

# the past year.

It’s time for leaders to recommit to supporting their employees’ mental

health—and their own. HBR’s archive has plenty of strategies for how to

do it right.

# Change Systems, Not Individuals

Companies are making larger investments in employee wellness

programs than ever; however, data suggests those programs aren’t

actually resulting in better well-being outcomes for employees.

According to a trio of authors drawing on a wide body of workplace

## wellness research, individual-level interventions like well-being apps

and employee assistance programs are likely to be ineﬀective unless

paired with systemic interventions.

To take a more holistic approach to workplace well-being, the authors

suggest leaders become “behavioral architects” by embedding well-

being strategies—and support—into all levels of the organization.

Consider changes like increasing ﬂexibility (even trying a four-day

workweek) to give employees more control over their work-life balance,

putting together volunteer-led “well-being champion networks” to

provide them with peer support, and training managers to support their

team members’ mental health.

# Consider Identity

Workplace mental health expert Morra Aarons-Mele points out that “work is about people, and people are messy and diﬃcult.” That may

## appear obvious at ﬁrst glance, but identity—the interrelated elements

that make up our concept of ourselves—is a critical dimension of how

people experience and talk about mental health challenges. Employees

from younger generations may be more comfortable discussing mental

health than their older counterparts, for example, and men may feel

more stigma around mental health than women do. Aarons-Mele has a

few suggestions for how to counter these diﬀering perspectives:

- Create an organization-wide shared language and baseline of

# knowledge about mental health.

- Ensure men are visible in mental health conversations.

- Create opportunities for people who share lived experiences and

dimensions of identity to connect with one another.

# Look to Your Own Leadership Behaviors

As a leader, your day-to-day behaviors can inadvertently cause your

employees undue stress and anxiety. Tomas Chamorro-Premuzic put

together a list of ﬁve common behaviors to watch out for. For example,

are you adding unnecessary complexity by making employees guess at

what you’ll do next? Are you telegraphing pessimism, leading them to

assume a situation is worse than it is? Being more aware of how your

actions aﬀect your employees can help you “bring out the best in people

even in the worst of times,” according to Chamorro-Premuzic.

And while many conversations about mental health have moved out of

the shadows and into the open over the past few years, both stigma and

concerns about repercussions persist. As a leader, you have inﬂuence,

and discussing your own mental health can make your employees

feel more comfortable discussing theirs. As Kelly Greenwood, founder

and former CEO of Mind Share Partners, puts it, telling your own

story “reduces stigma and normalizes the ups and downs of being

## human—especially as a high-performing professional” and “positions

vulnerability as a strength instead of a weakness and shows it’s possible

to succeed and thrive with a mental health challenge.”

Greenwood oﬀers a guide to crafting an authentic, compelling story for

employees in a way that’s both inclusive and protective of your own

# boundaries.

# Improve Uptake of Programs

Storytelling may also help increase employee participation in the

mental health programs you’ve invested in. A team of behavioral

scientists and organizational behavior scholars recently conducted a

study of 2,400 employees at the Swiss pharma company Novartis to test

their participation in the company’s peer-to-peer Mental Health First

Aid support program. While plenty of employees had volunteered to

be mental health ﬁrst aiders (i.e., a source of support for colleagues),

overall uptake in the program remained low.

The authors presented participants with various anonymous stories of

their colleagues accessing the program, varying in severity from work-

related stress and anxiety to depression and panic attacks caused by

external factors. Their initial ﬁndings showed that “simply hearing

about colleagues’ struggles [could] normalize access to mental health

support at work and increase uptake of an existing peer-to-peer support

mental health program by as much as 8%.” That might not sound

signiﬁcant, but the authors note that at a large corporation like Novartis

(comprising approximately 78,000 employees), the increased uptake

could translate to 2,000 employees making use of the resource.

# Don’t Neglect Your Own Mental Health

To be eﬀective at leading others, it’s critical that you take care of

yourself. If today’s roller coaster of uncertainty is (understandably)

making you anxious, Morra Aarons-Mele emphasizes how important it

is that you address it: “If you don’t look your anxiety in the face at some

point, it will take you down.”

Instead of ignoring it or trying to push through it, she oﬀers a

four-stage process for managing your anxiety. First, you’ll do some

reﬂecting, looking inward to better understand what you’re feeling and

why. Then, you’ll start developing tactics for managing your anxiety,

including (healthy) compartmentalizing and connecting with others.

Next, you’ll learn how to be vulnerable with peers and employees—

without oversharing or letting the conversation go oﬀ the rails. Finally,

you’ll put together a support system outside the organization to help

gut-check your decision-making and advise you on more sensitive

situations. Doing this, Aarons-Mele notes, “means you’ll have better

workdays, both when things are status quo and during transitions and

# tough times.”

. . .

The past few years have taught us a couple things: It’s not reasonable to

expect employees (or yourself) to check their emotions at the door when

they come into work, and simply spending money on interventions like wellness apps isn’t suﬃcient on its own to support them. As a leader,

taking a more holistic view of your employees’ mental health—and

working through and sharing your own experiences—can make them

feel more engaged and improve the health of your organization.
