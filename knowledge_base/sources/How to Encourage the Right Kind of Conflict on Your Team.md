team were starting to take sides. Sam (not his real name) chalkedit up to a “personality clash” and decided the only thing he coulddo was find ways to make sure these two people’s work didn’toverlap.As a manager, you might dream of leading a team where everyonegets along, they all see eye-to-eye, and there are nodisagreements. But while this “conflict-free utopia” might feelgood — at least in the short-term — it doesn’t always lead to thebest results. In fact, the absence of productive conflict leads towhat Patrick Lencioni, author of the

Five Dysfunctions of a Team,calls “artificial harmony,” where people act as if everything is fineon the team but, in reality, there are unspoken ideas, unvoiceddisagreements, and even simmering resentments.

Research shows that teams where people feel safe to disagreeactually outperform other teams. They make better decisions.And the friction that accompanies disagreement — even ifunpleasant at times — allows for creativity and growth.At the same time, there is a difference between healthy andunhealthy conflicts, and what Sam was dealing with certainlytended toward the latter. Healthy team conflict moves a teamtowards its goals and builds productive, respectful, and trustingrelationships. Unproductive conflict, on the other hand, holds ateam back. Team members don’t feel comfortable sharing theirperspectives, they might even shut down opposing views, judge orblame others, or be disrespectful in what they say and how theyact.

So what can Sam — or any manager — do to encourage morehealthy conflict?It starts with acknowledging that conflict is expected andinevitable, and not only tolerating the normal tensions that allteams face, but also surfacing and leaning into them. Here are afew approaches for doing that.

Tell your team that disagreements are expected and a normal —and productive — part of collaboration, teamwork, andinnovation. Because there is a natural human tendency is to avoidsaying or doing things that would disrupt harmony, it’s criticalthat you are explicit that you expect people to disagree and that’snot a problem to solve but an opportunity to seize.Besides just saying out loud, “disagreements are normal” you canalso set norms for how you expect people to interact, especiallywhen they aren’t on the same page. I recommend you do this withthe whole team. You can offer draft norms but ask them to buildon your suggestions and offer others. Here are some examplenorms that can help you get started:“We communicate openly and say what we mean and meanwhat we say.”This makes it clear that everyone’s opinion matters, and thatdisagreements are an opportunity for growth, not a personalattack.“We focus on the issues.”This means that you all focus on the problems being solved, notthe personalities involved. Two opposing ideas aren’t “Kiyo’sidea” and “Rebecca’s idea” but two ideas that the team can wrestlewith to chart the best path forward. You can also make explicit

that personal attacks will not be tolerated, and that the goal is tofind the ideal solution for the team.“We respect different perspectives.”Even in disagreement, the team should respect each other’sperspectives. State that everyone has a unique point of view, andthat diversity of thought is essential to the work you all dotogether.It’s helpful to have these norms captured in a shared documentthat anyone can access and to revisit them regularly to makeupdates and check that the team is adhering to them.

To further depersonalize disagreements and normalize healthyconflicts, it’s helpful to acknowledge and even list the tensionsthat come up. Here are some common ones that I see in my workwith teams:

# Speed vs. quality

## Inclusive decision-making vs. eﬃcient decision-making

## Focus on the client or customer vs. the company

Innovation vs. leveraging existing core capabilities

Details vs. the big picture

Purpose/mission vs. revenueLet’s talk about that first one: speed vs. quality. On a team, theremay be someone who is incredibly efficient and super focused onmeeting deadlines. They feel strongly that moving as quickly aspossible is tantamount. And there might be someone else whothinks that speed is overrated, and it’s important to slow down

and make sure you’re producing the highest-quality work, nomatter how much time it takes.These two people are likely to be at odds, and that’s ok. This is agood tension to have. As long as they can navigate itprofessionally and productively, the project is likely to both getdone faster and be higher quality.If you’re not careful though, a tension like this one can turn intointerpersonal conflicts where one person is painted as carelessand hasty and the other slow and obstructive. And others in thegroup start to feel like they must pick sides. That’s why you namethe tensions and then use them to frame disagreements. Forexample, if Kiyo is focused on speed and Rebecca is focused onquality, and they start to press their points in a meeting, creatingtension, you can highlight that speed vs quality is an importanttension to navigate, and it’s not about Kiyo’s perspective vsRebecca’s.Take a moment to think about which tensions come up mostfrequently on your team. It might include some on the list above,but perhaps there are others too. Write them down so that you caneasily identify and name them when they arise.Discuss the positive tensions you identified with your team.Without assigning them to specific people, explain why it’s goodthat these tensions exist. Also, ask the team if there are anymissing from your list. Consider keeping a running list in a shareddocument that people can refer to. You also want to empoweryour team so they understand that when a tension comes up, theycan name it themselves, whether you’re in the room or not.

One of the advantages of naming these tensions is that youseparate the people from the problem. This is one of the coretenets of the

Principled Negotiation approach, popularized by theHarvard Law School Program on Negotiation.Another way to do this is to ask people to argue against their ownstandpoint. You can ask Kiyo to argue for why the team shouldslow down and Rebecca to argue for why it’s OK to compromise abit on quality. This will help them see one another’s perspective(even if only briefly) and it will help the rest of the teamdisconnect one particular argument from a single person.Here are some questions you can use in a discussion like this oneto keep the disagreement healthy:

Is there another angle that we’re missing here?

What are the pros and cons of perspective A (then perspectiveB)?

If we were able to remove the constraints we’re under, howwould this discussion change?

What would a middle ground between these perspectives looklike? What tradeoﬀs would we need to make to achieve that?

Lastly, one of the most critical things you can do as a leader is todisplay comfort when conflicts arise. I’ve heard people say, “Aleader’s whisper is heard as a shout,” emphasizing the significantweight and impact of your words. Whether you want it or not,your perceived power and authority over others means they turnto you for signals of whether something is ok or not. If you clamup, turn red in the face, become curt when a disagreement arises,

people will take notice and often interpret that as a sign that it’snot OK to engage in debate on that topic (or any other topic).On the contrary, if you stay calm, modeling comfort and patience,your team will be more willing to engage in and even surfacedisagreements and tensions. You might calmly say somethinglike, “This feels like a tension between speed and quality. Doothers see it that way?” And if the conversation veers intounhealthy territory, with personal attacks, consider redirectingthe discussion by saying, “Let’s shift this conversation back to aproductive space. What do we need to decide here to help us movetoward our goals?”If you dread conflict, you’re not alone. I hear from lots ofmanagers that dealing with conflicts or interpersonal clashes isone of their least favorite responsibilities. And, yet, it’s aresponsibility that often falls to managers. One Gartner

studyfrom 2023 found that 57% of managers say they are fullyresponsible for solving team conflicts.That said, tensions are inevitable and encouraging positive onescan create an environment where people feel safe to voice theiropinions and ideas, leading to better decisions and results. As amanager, you not only want to tolerate these sorts ofdisagreements but encourage them.
