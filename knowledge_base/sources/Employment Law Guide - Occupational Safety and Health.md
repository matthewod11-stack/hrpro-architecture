## Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act)

(29 USC §651 et seq.; 29 CFR Parts 1900 to 2400)

# Who is Covered

# The Occupational Safety and Health Act of 1970 (OSH Act) is administered by the Occupational Safety and

# Health Administration (OSHA). The OSH Act covers most private sector employers and their employees in the

50 states, the District of Columbia, Puerto Rico, and other U.S. territories. Coverage is provided either directly by the Federal OSHA or by an OSHA-approved state job safety and health plan.

Federal OSHA also covers certain workers speciﬁcally excluded from a state plan, such as those in some

states who work in maritime industries or on military bases.

Workers at state and local government agencies are not covered by federal OSHA but are protected under the

OSH Act if they work in states that have OSHA-approved state programs. States and territories may also develop plans that cover only public sector (state and local government) workers.

The OSH Act established a separate program for federal government employees. Section 19 of the OSH Act

makes federal agency heads responsible for providing safety and healthful working conditions. Although

OSHA does not ﬁne federal agencies, it does monitor them and conducts inspections in response to workers'

reports of hazards. Under a 1998 amendment to the OSH Act, the U.S. Postal Service is covered under the OSH Act just like any private sector employer.

The Act does not cover:

# Self-employed persons;

Farms which employ only immediate members of the farmer's family;

Working conditions for which other Federal agencies, operating under the authority of other Federal laws, regulate worker safety. This category includes most working conditions in mining, nuclear energy and

# nuclear weapons manufacture, and many aspects of the transportation industries; and

Employees of state and local governments, unless they are in one of the states operating an OSHA-

approved state plan.

The Act assigns OSHA two regulatory functions: setting standards and conducting inspections to ensure that

employers are providing safe and healthful workplaces. OSHA standards may require that employers adopt

certain practices, means, methods, or processes reasonably necessary and appropriate to protect workers on

the job. Employers must comply with all applicable OSHA standards and provide workers with a workplace that does not have serious hazards.

Compliance with standards may include implementing engineering controls to limit exposures to physical

hazards and toxic substances, implementing administrative controls, as well as ensuring that employees have

been provided with, have been eﬀectively trained on, and use personal protective equipment when required

for safety and health, where the former controls cannot be feasibly implemented. Employees must comply with all rules and regulations that apply to their own actions and conduct. Even in areas where OSHA has not

set forth a standard addressing a speciﬁc hazard, employers are responsible for complying with the OSH Act's

# "general duty" clause. The general duty clause [Section 5(a)(1)] states that each employer "shall furnish . . . a

# place of employment which is free from recognized hazards that are causing or are likely to cause death or

# serious physical harm to his employees."

The Act encourages states to develop and operate their own job safety and health programs. OSHA approves

and monitors these "state plans," which operate under the authority of state law. There are currently 22 State

Plans covering both private sector and state and local government workers, and seven State Plans

(Connecticut, Illinois, Maine, Massachusetts, New Jersey, New York, and the Virgin Islands) covering only state

and local government workers. States with OSHA-approved job safety and health plans must set standards that are at least as eﬀective as the equivalent Federal standard. Most, but not all of the state plan states,

## adopt standards identical to the Federal ones.

Federal OSHA Standards. Standards are grouped into four major categories: general industry (29 CFR

1910); construction (29 CFR 1926); maritime (shipyards, marine terminals, longshoring) (29 CFR 1915-19); and

agriculture (29 CFR 1928). While some standards are speciﬁc to just one category, others apply across industries. Among the standards with similar requirements for all sectors of industry are those that address

# access to medical and exposure records, personal protective equipment, and hazard communication.

Access to medical and exposure records: This regulation provides a right of access to employees, their

designated representatives, and OSHA to relevant medical records, including records related to that

employee's exposure to toxic substances.

Personal protective equipment: This standard, which is deﬁned separately for each segment of industry

except agriculture, requires employers to provide employees with personal equipment designed to protect

them against certain hazards and to ensure that employees have been eﬀectively trained on the use of the

equipment. This equipment can range from protective helmets to prevent head injuries in construction and

cargo handling work, to eye protection, hearing protection, hard-toed shoes, special goggles for welders, and gauntlets for iron workers. Employers must generally provide required personal protective equipment to

their employees free of charge.

Hazard communication: This standard requires manufacturers and importers of hazardous materials to

conduct hazard evaluations of the products they manufacture or import. If a product is found to be

hazardous under the terms of the standard, the manufacturer or importer must so indicate on containers of the material, and the ﬁrst shipment of the material to a new customer must include a safety data sheet

(SDS). All employers with hazardous chemicals in their workplace must have labels and SDSs for their

exposed workers and train to handle the chemical appropriately. OSHA revised its hazard communication

standard in 2012 to be consistent with the Globally Harmonized System of Classiﬁcation and Labeling of

# Chemicals.

# Employee Rights

The Act grants employees several important rights. Among them are the right to ﬁle a complaint with OSHA

about safety and health conditions in their workplaces and, to the extent permitted by law, have their identities kept conﬁdential from employers; contest the amount of time OSHA allows for correcting violations of

standards; and participate in OSHA workplace inspections.

# Private sector employees who exercise their rights under OSHA can be protected against employer reprisal,

# as described in Section 11(c) of the OSH Act. Employees must notify OSHA within 30 days of the time they

learned of the alleged discriminatory action. OSHA will then investigate, and if it agrees that discrimination has occurred, OSHA will ask the employer to restore any lost beneﬁts to the aﬀected employee. If necessary,

OSHA can initiate legal action against the employer. In such cases, the worker pays no legal fees. The OSHA-

approved state plans have parallel employee rights provisions, including protections against employer reprisal.

OSHA's Whistleblower Protection Program enforces the anti-retaliation provisions under the OSH Act and

# other statutes.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Poster. All covered employers are required to display and keep displayed the OSHA Job Safety and Health: It's the Law poster. Employers in states with an OSHA-approved state plan may be required to post a state

version of the OSHA poster. There is a separate poster for Federal agencies. The OSHA poster must be

displayed in a conspicuous place where employees can see it. Copies of the poster shall be at least 8 1/2 by

14 inches with 10 point type. The poster is available in English, Spanish, and several other languages. Posting

of the notice in languages other than English is not required, but OSHA encourages employers with workers that speak other languages to also display the other relevant versions of the poster.

Notices. Employees, former employees and their representatives have the right to review the OSHA Form

300, Log of Work-related Illnesses and Injuries, in its entirety. Employers are required to post the Summary of

Work-related Injuries and Illnesses (Form 300A) in a visible location so that employees are aware of the injuries

and illnesses that occur in their workplace. Employers are required to post the Summary Form (300A) by February 1 of the year following the year covered by the form and keep it posted until April 30 of that year.

OSHA-approved state plan states must adopt occupational injury and illness recording requirements that are

substantially identical to the Federal OSHA requirements. Since each state plan's requirements may diﬀer slightly, the Federal OSHA requirements are described below.

Records for employers with 10 or fewer employees. Employers with 10 or fewer employees at all times

during the last calendar year do not need to keep OSHA injury and illness records unless OSHA or the Bureau

of Labor Statistics (BLS) informs them in writing that records must be kept. However, all employers covered by

the OSH Act must report to OSHA any workplace incident that results in a fatality, an amputation, the loss of an eye, or the in-patient hospitalization of one or more employees.

# Records for employers in certain industries. If an employer's business is in an industry that is classiﬁed as

# low hazard, the employer does not need to keep records unless OSHA or the BLS asks them to do so in

writing. The partial industry classiﬁcation exemption applies to individual establishments. If a company has several establishments engaged in diﬀerent classes of business activities, some of the company's

establishments may be required to keep records, while others may be exempt. Industries currently designated

# as low-hazard include:

# Certain retail stores

## Eating and drinking places Most ﬁnance, insurance, and real estate industries

Certain service industries, such as personal and business services, medical and dental oﬃces, and legal,

## educational, and membership organizations

Business establishments classiﬁed in agriculture, mining, utilities, construction, manufacturing, or wholesale

trade are not eligible for the partial industry classiﬁcation exemption.

All other employers. Employers are required to use the Form 300 Log of Work-Related Injuries and Illnesses

to classify work-related injuries and illnesses and to note the extent and severity of each case. When an

incident occurs, the Log is used to record speciﬁc details about what happened and how it happened.

If the employer has more than one establishment or site, separate records for each physical location that is

expected to remain in operation for one year or longer must be kept.

Employers are required to keep a separate Log (Form 300) and Summary of Work-Related Injuries and

Illnesses (Form 300A) for each physical location that is expected to be in operation for one year or longer. The

Injury and Illness Incident Report (Form 301) is ﬁlled out when a recordable work-related injury or illness has

occurred. Together with the Form 300 and Form 300A, these forms help the employer and OSHA develop a

## picture of the extent and severity of work-related incidents.

Employers must record work-related injuries and illnesses that result in:

# Death

# Days away from work

Restricted work activity or job transfer

## Medical treatment beyond ﬁrst aid Loss of consciousness

Employers must record any signiﬁcant work-related injuries and illnesses that are diagnosed by a physician or

other licensed health care professional, such as any work-related case involving cancer, chronic irreversible

## disease, a fractured or cracked bone or a punctured eardrum.

Employers must record the following conditions when they are work-related:

Any needle-stick injury or cut from a sharp object that is contaminated with another person's blood or other

potentially infectious material

# Any case requiring an employee to be medically removed under the requirements of an OSHA health

# standard

Work-related cases involving hearing loss under certain conditions Tuberculosis infection as evidenced by a positive skin test or diagnosis by a physician or other licensed

## health care professional after exposure to a known case of active tuberculosis

Employers do not have to record certain injury and illness incidents such as a visit to a doctor solely for

observation and counseling or those requiring ﬁrst aid treatment only. For more information see the full list of

## Non-recordable Injury and Illness Incidents.

Electronic Injury Reporting. Certain employers must electronically submit to OSHA information about

recordable injuries and illnesses entered on their previous calendar year's OSHA Forms 300A, 300, and 301

using Injury Tracking Application (ITA)'. Establishments covered by Federal OSHA can use the ITA Coverage

Application to determine if they are required to electronically submit their injury and illness information to

OSHA. Establishments covered by an OSHA-approved State Plan should directly contact their State Plan.

# Reporting

OSHA-approved state plan states must adopt occupational injury and illness reporting requirements that are

substantially identical to the Federal OSHA requirements. Since each state plan's requirements may diﬀer

slightly, the Federal OSHA requirements are described below.

Employers must report to OSHA work-related fatalities within 8 hours of ﬁnding out about it.

For any in-patient hospitalization, amputation, or eye loss employers must report the incident to OSHA

within 24 hours of learning about it.

Only fatalities occurring within 30 days of the work-related incident must be reported to OSHA. Further, for an

inpatient hospitalization, amputation or loss of an eye, the incidents must be reported to OSHA only if they occur within 24 hours of the work-related incident.

Employers have three options for reporting the event:

## By telephone to the nearest OSHA Area Oﬃce during normal business hours.

## By telephone to the 24-hour OSHA hotline (1-800-321-OSHA or 1-800-321-6742).

# Report online on OSHA's website.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Every establishment covered by the Act is subject to inspection by OSHA compliance safety and health

oﬃcers (CSHOs). These occupational safety and health professionals possess the knowledge and experience

required to conduct workplace inspections; they have been thoroughly trained in recognizing safety and health

# hazards and in enforcing OSHA's Standards. In states with their own OSHA-approved state plan, pursuant to

# state law, state oﬃcials conduct inspections, issue citations for violations, and propose penalties in a manner

that is at least as eﬀective as the Federal program.

OSHA initiates inspections without advance notice based on the following priorities: imminent danger,

catastrophes (fatalities or hospitalizations), worker complaints and referrals, targeted inspections (particular

hazards, high injury rates), and follow-up inspections. Various OSHA publications and documents detail

OSHA's policies and procedures for inspections, including OSHA's Field Operations Manual.

No later than January 15 of each year, OSHA adjusts its civil monetary penalties to account for inﬂation.

Current maximum penalty amounts for each violation type listed below are available at osha.gov/penalties.

Citation and penalty procedures may diﬀer somewhat in OSHA-approved state plans.

De Minimis violations: The OSH Act authorizes OSHA to treat certain violations, which have no direct or immediate relationship to safety and health, as de minimis, requiring no penalty or abatement. OSHA does not

## issue citations for de minimis violations.

Other than serious violation: A violation that has a direct relationship to job safety and health, but probably

would not cause death or serious physical harm.

Serious violation: A violation where a substantial probability that death or serious physical harm could result and where the employer knew, or should have known, of the hazard.

Willful violation: A violation that the employer intentionally and knowingly commits. The employer either

knows that what he or she is doing constitutes a violation, or is aware that a condition creates a hazard and

has made no reasonable eﬀort to eliminate it. Proposed penalties for other-than-serious and serious violations

may be adjusted downward depending on the employer's good faith (demonstrated eﬀorts to comply with the Act through the implementation of an eﬀective health and safety program), history of violations, and size of

business. Proposed penalties for willful violations may be adjusted downward depending on the size of the

business. Usually no credit is given for good faith.

If an employer is convicted of a willful violation of a standard that has resulted in the death of an employee,

the oﬀense is punishable by a court imposed ﬁne or by imprisonment for up to six months, or both. A ﬁne of up to $250,000 for an individual, or $500,000 for an organization [authorized under the Omnibus Crime Control

Act of 1984 (1984 OCCA), not the OSH Act], may be imposed for a criminal conviction.

Repeat violation: A violation of any standard, regulation, rule, or order where, upon re-inspection, a

substantially similar violation is found. To serve as the basis for a repeat citation, the original citation must be

ﬁnal; a citation under contest may not serve as the basis for a subsequent repeat citation.

Failure to abate violation: Failure to correct a prior violation may bring a civil penalty for each day the

violation continues beyond the prescribed abatement date.

The following outlines procedures for appealing OSHA citations and penalties.

Appeals by employees and employers: If a complaint from an employee prompted the inspection, the

employee or authorized employee representative may request an informal review of any decision not to issue a

# citation.

Employees may not contest citations, amendments to citations, penalties, or lack of penalties. They may

contest the time allowed in the citation for abatement of a hazardous condition. They also may contest an employer's Petition for Modiﬁcation of Abatement (PMA), which requests an extension of the abatement

period. Employees who wish to contest the PMA must do so within 10 working days of its posting or within 10

working days after an authorized employee representative has received a copy.

Within 15 working days of the employer's receipt of the citation, the employer may submit a written objection

to OSHA. If the PMA requests an abatement date that is two years or less from the issuance date of the citation, the Area Director has the authority to approve or object to the petition.

Any PMA requesting an abatement date that is more than two years from the issuance date of the citation

requires the approval of the Regional Administrator as well as the Area Director. If the PMA is approved, the

Area Director shall notify the employer and the employee representatives by letter.

The Area Director or Regional Administrator (as appropriate), after consultation with the Regional Solicitor's Oﬃce, shall object to a PMA where the evidence supports non-approval (e.g., employer has taken no

meaningful abatement action at all or has otherwise exhibited bad faith). In such cases, all relevant

documentation shall be sent to the Review Commission in accordance with Â§1903.14a(d). Both the employer

and the employee representatives shall be notiﬁed of this action by letter, with return receipt requested.

Letters notifying the employer or employee representative of the objection shall be mailed on the same date that the agency objection to the PMA is sent to the Review Commission.

Employees may request an informal conference with OSHA to discuss any issues raised by an inspection,

citation, notice of proposed penalty, or the employer's notice of intention to contest.

Informal conferences: When issued a citation or notice of a proposed penalty, an employer may request an

informal conference with OSHA's Area Director to discuss the case. Employee representatives may be invited to attend the meeting. To avoid prolonged legal disputes, the Area Director is authorized to enter into

settlement agreements that may revise citations and penalties.

Notice of contest: If the employer decides to contest the citation, the time set for abatement or the proposed

penalty, he or she has 15 working days from the time the citation and proposed penalty are received in which

to notify the OSHA Area Director in writing. An orally expressed disagreement will not suﬃce. This written notiﬁcation is called a "Notice of Contest." There is no speciﬁc format for the Notice of Contest. However, it

must clearly identify the employer's basis for contesting the citation, notice of proposed penalty, abatement

period, or notiﬁcation of failure to correct violations. To better identify the scope of the contest, it also should

identify the inspection number and citation number(s) being contested.

# A copy of the Notice of Contest must be given to the employees' authorized representative. If any aﬀected

# employees are unrepresented by a recognized bargaining agent, a copy of the notice must be posted in a

prominent location in the workplace, or else served personally upon each unrepresented employee.

Appeal review procedure: If the written Notice of Contest has been ﬁled within 15 working days, the OSHA

Area Director forwards the case to the Occupational Safety and Health Review Commission (OSHRC). The

Commission is an independent agency not associated with OSHA or the Department of Labor. The

Commission assigns the case to an Administrative Law Judge (ALJ). The ALJ may disallow the contest if it is

found to be legally invalid, or a hearing may be scheduled for a public place near the employer's workplace. The employer and the employees have the right to participate in the hearing; the OSHRC does not require that

they be represented by attorneys.

Once the ALJ has ruled, any party to the case may request a further review by OSHRC. Also, any of the three

OSHRC commissioners may individually move to bring a case before the Commission for review. Commission

rulings may be appealed to the U.S. Courts of Appeals.

Appeals in state plan states: States with their own occupational safety and health programs have their own

systems for review and appeal of citations, penalties, and abatement periods. The procedures are generally

similar to Federal OSHA's, but a state review board or equivalent authority hears cases.

The OSH Act covers all private sector working conditions that are not addressed by safety and health

regulations of another Federal agency under other legislation. OSHA also has the authority to monitor the

safety and health of Federal employees. Federal agency heads are responsible for the safety and health of

Federal employees. The OSHA-approved state plan states extend their coverage to state and local

# government employees.

Finally, OSHA is also responsible for administering a number of whistleblower laws relating to safety and

health as described in the Whistleblower Protection section of this Guide and OSHA's Whistleblower

# Protection webpage.

The Department of Labor provides employers, workers, and others with clear and easy-to-access information

and assistance on how to comply with the Occupational Safety and Health Act. Among the many resources

available are:

OSHA Publications: Provides fact sheets, booklets, and other publications sorted by topic, publication type,

and language. Compliance Assistance Quick Start: Provides introductory step-by-step instruction to Occupational Safety

and Health Administration (OSHA) compliance assistance resources.

## OSHA eTools: Provides links to e-tools and Expert Advisors

# OSHA Safety and Health Topics Pages: Provide information on speciﬁc safety and health hazards, and

speciﬁc hazard information on diﬀerent industries. These pages provide information on hazard identiﬁcation and control and applicable OSHA standards.

OSHA's Help for Employers Page: Provides a portal to OSHA's compliance assistance resources.

OSHA Frequently Asked Questions: Highlights topics and speciﬁc questions that are often asked of OSHA.

Because states with OSHA-approved job safety and health programs adopt and enforce their own standards

under state law, copies of these standards can be obtained from the individual states. Many are available through state Web sites, which are linked from OSHA's State Occupational Safety and Health Plans webpage.

Cooperative Programs. OSHA oﬀers a number of opportunities for employers, employees, and organizations

to work cooperatively with the Agency. OSHA's major cooperative programs are the Voluntary Protections

Program (VPP), the Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP), OSHA Challenge, the

## Alliance Program, and the OSHA Strategic Partnership Program (OSPP).

Voluntary Protection Programs: The Voluntary Protection Programs (VPP) are aimed at extending worker

protection beyond the minimum required by OSHA standards. The VPP is designed to:

Recognize the outstanding achievements of those who have successfully incorporated comprehensive

## safety and health programs into their total management systems;

Motivate others to achieve excellent safety and health results in the same outstanding way; and Establish a relationship between employers, employees, and OSHA that is based on cooperation rather

# than coercion.

An employer may apply for VPP at the nearest OSHA regional oﬃce. OSHA reviews an employer's VPP

application and visits the worksite to verify that the safety and health program described is in eﬀect at the site.

All participants must send their injury information annually to their OSHA regional oﬃces. Sites participating in the VPP are not scheduled for programmed inspections. However, OSHA handles any employee complaints,

serious accidents/catastrophes, or fatalities according to routine procedures.

The VPP is available in states under federal jurisdiction. Additionally, all OSHA-approved state plans that cover

private-sector employees in the state operate similar programs. Interested companies in these states should

contact the appropriate state agency for more information.

# Safety and Health Achievement Recognition Program (SHARP): This program recognizes small employers

who operate an exemplary safety and health management system. Employers who are accepted into SHARP

are recognized as models for worksite safety and health. Upon receiving SHARP recognition, the worksite will

be exempt from programmed inspections during the period that the SHARP certiﬁcation is valid. To participate

in SHARP, an employer must contact its state's Consultation Program and request a free consultation visit that involves a complete hazard identiﬁcation survey.

OSHA Challenge: This program provides opportunities for employers to work with OSHA and qualiﬁed

volunteers (Challenge Administrators) to develop safety and health management systems (SHMS) on par with

VPP and SHARP. OSHA Challenge breaks down SHMS implementation in three stages. For each stage, the

# participants identify actions, documentation, and outcomes. Unique aspects of OSHA Challenge include: no

# application prerequisites for participants except for a letter of commitment stating that they will follow the

program and strive for safety and health excellence; no time constraints to complete the stages, which allows participants to work at their own level and pace; and the use of Challenge Administrators experienced in

SHMS to assist participants, which limits the OSHA resources needed to manage the program.

Alliance Program: Through the Alliance Program, OSHA works with businesses, trade and professional

organizations, unions, educational institutions, and other government agencies. Alliance Program participants

work with OSHA to leverage resources and expertise to help develop compliance assistance tools, training opportunities, and other information to help employers and employees prevent on-the-job injuries, illnesses,

and fatalities. OSHA's Alliances with organizations in industries such as plastics, healthcare, maritime,

chemical, construction, paper and telecommunications, among others, are working to address safety and

health hazards with at-risk audiences, such as youth, immigrant workers, and small business.

Strategic Partnership Program: In this program, OSHA enters into an extended, voluntary, cooperative relationship with employers, associations, unions, and/or councils. Partnerships often cover multiple

worksites, and in some instances, aﬀect entire industries. Partner worksites may be very large, but most often

they are small businesses averaging 50 or fewer employees. Strategic Partnerships are designed to

encourage, assist, and recognize eﬀorts to eliminate serious hazards and achieve a high level of worker safety

and health. All Partnerships emphasize sustained eﬀorts and continuing results beyond the typical three-year duration of the agreement.

Training and education: OSHA has 85 full-service ﬁeld oﬃces (called Area Oﬃces) that oﬀer a variety of

informational services, such as publications, technical advice, audio-visual aids on workplace hazards, and

lecturers for speaking engagements. Most of these ﬁeld oﬃces have an OSHA Compliance Assistance

Specialist (CAS). CASs provide general information about OSHA standards and compliance assistance resources, and are available for seminars, workshops, and speaking events. CASs promote OSHA's

cooperative programs and also encourage employers to take advantage of OSHA's training resources and the

# tools available on the OSHA website.

The OSHA Training Institute in Arlington Heights, Illinois, provides basic and advanced training and education

in safety and health for federal and state compliance safety and health oﬃcers; state consultants; other federal agency personnel; and private sector employers, employees, and their representatives. Course topics

include electrical hazards, machine guarding, ventilation, and ergonomics, among others. The OSHA Training

Institute has partnered with other training and education institutes to conduct Training Institute courses. These

Education Centers, which are located throughout the country, provide additional opportunities for the public to

## receive training on safety and health topics.

The OSHA Outreach Training Program provides training for workers and employers on the recognition,

avoidance, abatement, and prevention of safety and health hazards in workplaces. The program also provides

information regarding workers' rights, employer responsibilities, and how to ﬁle a complaint. This is a voluntary

program and does not meet training requirements for any OSHA standards. Through this program, workers can attend 10-hour or 30-hour classes delivered by OSHA-authorized trainers. The 10-hour class is intended

for entry level workers, while the 30-hour class is more appropriate for workers with some safety responsibility.

# Consultation services: OSHA's On-Site Consultation Program oﬀers free and conﬁdential safety and

# occupational health advice to small and medium-sized businesses in all states across the country, with priority

given to high-hazard worksites. On-Site Consultation services are separate from enforcement and do not result in penalties or citations. Consultants from state agencies or universities work with employers to identify

workplace hazards, provide advice on compliance with OSHA standards, and assist in establishing injury and

# illness prevention programs.

On-site OSHA consultation assistance includes an opening conference with the employer to explain the

ground rules for consultation, a walk through the workplace to identify speciﬁc hazards and to examine those aspects of the employer's safety and health program that relate to the scope of the visit, and a closing

conference. Later, the consultant sends a report of ﬁndings and recommendations to the employer. This

process begins with the employer's request for consultation, which must include a commitment to correct any

serious safety and health hazards identiﬁed. The consultant will not report possible violations of OSHA

standards to OSHA enforcement staﬀ unless the employer fails or refuses to eliminate or control worker exposure to any identiﬁed serious hazard or imminent danger. Should this occur, OSHA may investigate and

begin enforcement action. The employer must also agree to allow the consultant to confer freely with

# employees during the on-site visit.

Additional information about consultation assistance, including a directory of OSHA funded consultation

projects, can be found on OSHA's Consultation Program webpage.

Information sources: Information about state plans, VPPs, consultation programs, and inspections can be

obtained from the nearest OSHA regional or area oﬃce. Area oﬃces are listed in local telephone directories

under the U.S. Department of Labor. Contact information for regional and area oﬃces, as well as state plans

and consultation programs can also be found on the OSHA website.

OSHA's Oﬃce of Small Business Assistance administers OSHA's On-Site Consultation Program and serves as liaison and point of contact with the Agency for small businesses. OSHA oﬀers many services designed to

help small businesses and welcomes comments and suggestions from small business owners and their

# employees.
