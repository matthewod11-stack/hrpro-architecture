What is strategy? This question may be familiar if you’re a seasoned

HBR reader: It’s the title of a classic 1996 Michael Porter article on the

topic. Famously, he argued that too many companies were conﬂating

# strategy and operational eﬀectiveness:

The quest for productivity, quality, and speed has spawned a

## remarkable number of management tools and techniques…Although

## HBR / Digital Article / The Definitive HBR Strategy Glossary

the resulting operational improvements have often been dramatic,

many companies have been frustrated by their inability to translate

those gains into sustainable proﬁtability. And bit by bit, almost

imperceptibly, management tools have taken the place of strategy.

As managers push to improve on all fronts, they move farther away

# from viable competitive positions.

So what are these competitive positions? In a smart analysis, former

HBR senior editor Andrea Ovans suggests that Porter’s idea of strategy

can be boiled down to two broad options: “Do what everyone else is

doing (but spend less money doing it), or do something no one else can

do.”

While succinct, these aren’t the only approaches to successful business

competition. Ovans notes that, when surveying the vast array of strategy

topics that HBR has covered, there’s quite a lot to say about how to do

something new, how to build on what you already do, and how to react

opportunistically to emerging possibilities.

Indeed—and we decided to collect it all in one place. This is our attempt

at a “strategy glossary,” a place where 40-some classic strategic concepts

introduced in the pages of HBR can be found. They’re in alphabetical

order, with some caveats: We only included ideas discussed in depth

in HBR feature articles that exist in some form on our website. Some concepts don’t have “oﬃcial” names, but they are labeled as accurately

as possible. All were collected based on recommendations from current

## HBR editors across our digital, magazine, and press divisions.

Each concept also names the article in which it originated and includes

the authors who came up with the idea.

Adjacency expansion: Sustained, proﬁtable growth when a company

expands the boundaries of its core business into an adjacent space.

Companies that are repeatedly successful at adjacency expansion

share two common characteristics. First, they are extraordinarily

disciplined, applying rigorous screens before they make an adjacency

move. This discipline pays oﬀ in the form of learning curve beneﬁts,

increased speed, and lower complexity. Second, in almost all cases,

these companies develop their repeatable formulas by studying their

customers and their customers’ economics very carefully.

Balanced scorecard: A set of measures that gives top managers a fast

but comprehensive view of the business. The scorecard includes four

perspectives and corresponding questions, allowing managers to view

## performance in several areas simultaneously:

- Customer perspective: How do customers see us?

- Internal perspective: What must we excel at?

- Innovation and learning perspective: Can we continue to improve and

# create value?

- Financial perspective: How do we look to shareholders?

Big-Bang disruption: When an innovation beats incumbents on both

## price and quality right from the start and quickly sweeps through every

customer segment. Big-bang disruptions often come out of the blue

from people who aren’t traditional competitors, and the disruptions

are frequently developed by inventors doing low-cost experiments

with existing technologies to see what new products they can dream

up. Once launched, these innovations don’t adhere to conventional

strategic paths or normal patterns of market adoption. That makes them

incredibly hard to combat, and they can devastate entire product lines

virtually overnight. Examples include free navigation apps preloaded on

smartphones, such as those made by TomTom, Garmin, and Magellan.

Blue ocean strategy: Blue oceans are previously unknown market

spaces. Demand is created rather than fought over, and there is ample

opportunity for growth that is both proﬁtable and rapid. There are two

ways to create blue oceans. One is to launch completely new industries,

as eBay did with online auctions. But it’s much more common for a

blue ocean to be created when a company expands the boundaries of

an existing industry. For example, Cirque du Soleil reinvented the circus

and developed uncontested market space that made the competition

# irrelevant.

Consumption chain: Customers’ entire experience with a product or

service, from the moment they realize that they need it to the time they

no longer want it and decide to dispose of it. By mapping and analyzing

a company’s consumption chain and understanding customers’ pain

points, businesses can uncover opportunities to position their oﬀerings

in ways that they, and their competitors, would never have thought

# possible.

To do this, start by mapping your customers’ entire experience with

a product, asking questions such as, “How do people become aware

of their need for your product or service?” “How is your product

installed?” and “How is your product repaired or serviced?” Then,

analyze your customer’s experience by considering how a series of

## simple questions—what, where, who, when, and how—apply at each link

in the consumption chain. For example, “What are customers doing at

each point in the consumption chain?” or “How are your customers’

needs being addressed?”

Core competencies: Core competencies are the collective learning in

an organization. If you consider the corporation as a large tree, the

trunk and major limbs are core products; the smaller branches are

business units; the leaves, ﬂowers, and fruit are end products. The

root system that provides nourishment, sustenance, and stability is

the core competence. A company’s competitiveness derives from its

## core competencies and core products (the tangible results of core

# competencies).

A company’s core competencies must provide potential access to a wide

variety of markets, make a contribution to the customer beneﬁts of the product, and are diﬃcult for competitors to imitate. Management

should ask, “How long could we preserve our competitiveness if we did

not control this core competence? How central is this core competence

to customer beneﬁts? What opportunities would be foreclosed if we lost

# this competence?”

Internally, supporting core competencies requires harmonizing streams

of technology and working across boundaries. This requires a radical

# change in corporate organization.

ﬁrm’s competencies and products obsolete. However, organizations that

are able to restrain or modify these threats typically use ﬁve strategies:

- Containment strategies: Used when a thread is spotted early, these

might include locking in customers, raising switching costs, or

swamping distribution channels.

- Shaping strategies: Used when the revolution can no longer be

contained, these strategies include co-opting the revolutionaries,

inﬂuencing the revolution through venture capital, or supplying and

molding the revolutionaries.

- Absorption strategies: Used when a revolution is likely to succeed

but can be modiﬁed to complement your business, these can mean

bringing the revolution inside to enhance your existing business or

creating polarized blocs to pave the way to acquire the revolutionaries.

- Neutralization strategies: Used when a revolution has been detected

too late; has spread too widely; or can’t be contained, shaped, or

absorbed. Companies can, among other things, quash revolutions

through legal means or continuously improve existing products or

# technology.

- Annulment strategies: Used when a revolution is likely to succeed

but can be modiﬁed to complement your business; examples include

leapfrogging the threat or sidestepping the revolution altogether.

Decision-focused strategic planning: A way of reaching decisions

## through the continuous identiﬁcation and systematic resolution of

strategic issues. This helps companies produce more, better, and faster

decisions using the following guidelines:

- Separate—but integrate—decision-making and plan making. Take

decisions out of the traditional planning process and create a diﬀerent,

parallel process for developing strategy that helps executives identify

the decisions they need to make to create more shareholder value over

# time.

- Focus on a few key themes instead of a business-by-business planning

# model.

- Make strategy development continuous, spreading strategy reviews

throughout the year rather than squeezing them into a two- or three-

# month window.

- Structure strategy reviews to produce real decisions, aiming to

overcome disagreements among executives over past decisions,

current alternatives, and even the facts presented to support strategic

# plans.

Diamond of national advantage: Why are certain companies based

in certain nations capable of consistent innovation? Why do they

ruthlessly pursue improvements, seeking an ever-more-sophisticated

source of competitive advantage? And why are they able to overcome

the substantial barriers to change and innovation that so often

# accompany success?

The answer lies in four broad attributes of a nation, attributes that

individually and as a system constitute the diamond of national

advantage—the playing ﬁeld that each nation establishes and operates

for its industries. These attributes are:

- 1. Factor conditions: the nation’s position in factors of production,

such as skilled labor or infrastructure, necessary to compete in a

given industry

- 2. Demand conditions: the nature of home-market demand for the

industry’s product or service

- 3. Related and supporting industries: the presence or absence in the

nation of supplier industries and other related industries that are

# internationally competitive

- 4. Firm strategy, structure, and rivalry: the conditions in the nation

governing how companies are created, organized, and managed, as

# well as the nature of domestic rivalry

## Differentiation: The sharper a company’s diﬀerentiation, the greater

its competitive advantage. But diﬀerentiation can wear with age: The

growth it generates creates complexity, and complex companies tend to

forget what they’re good at. Often they respond by trying to reimagine

their entire business models quickly and dramatically. That’s rarely

the answer. Instead, successful companies relentlessly build on their

fundamental diﬀerentiation, going from strength to strength. They

learn to deliver it to the front line, creating an organization that lives

and breathes its strategic advantages day in and day out. They learn to

## sustain it through constant adaptation to changes in the market. And

they learn to resist the siren song of today’s hot market better than their

less-focused competitors do. The result is a simple, repeatable business

model that a company can apply to new products and markets over and

over again to generate sustained growth.

Discovery-driven planning: A practical tool that acknowledges the

because they are based on solid knowledge rather than on assumptions.

In these cases, a venture’s deviations from plan are a bad thing.

venture, little is known and much is assumed. This type of planning

Disruptive innovation: “Disruption” describes a process whereby a

company is able to successfully challenge established incumbent

businesses. Speciﬁcally, as incumbents focus on improving their

## products and services for their most demanding (and usually most

proﬁtable) customers, they exceed the needs of some segments and

ignore the needs of others. Entrants that prove disruptive begin

by successfully targeting those overlooked segments. They gain a

foothold by oﬀering a product that is inferior to those of incumbents’

products—and can’t meet the needs of incumbents’ mainstay customers

—but that delivers the functionality needed by customers in the

overlooked segments, frequently at a lower price. Incumbents, chasing

higher proﬁtability in more-demanding segments, tend not to respond

vigorously. Entrants then move upmarket, improving their products so

that they can deliver the performance that incumbents’ mainstream

customers require while preserving the advantages that drove their

early success. When mainstream customers start adopting the entrants’

oﬀerings in volume, disruption has occurred.

Finding your next core business: To determine if a company’s core

business needs to change, ﬁrst ask ﬁve diagnostic questions:

- 1. What is the state of our core customers?

- 2. What is the state of our core diﬀerentiation?

- 3. What is the state of our industry’s proﬁt pools?

- 4. What is the state of our core capabilities?

- 5. What is the state of our culture and organization?

If the answers reveal that large shifts are about to take place in two

or more of these ﬁve areas, your company is heading into turbulence

—you need to reexamine the fundamentals of your core strategy and

even the core itself. The next step is strategic regeneration, which

usually involves identifying a hidden asset that can be the centerpiece

of your new strategy. These assets typically fall under three categories:

## undervalued business platforms, untapped insights into customers, and

# underexploited capabilities.

## Five competitive forces: The state of competition in an industry

depends on ﬁve basic forces. These forces govern the proﬁt structure

of the industry by determining how the economic value it creates

is apportioned. That value may be drained away through the rivalry

among existing competitors. It can also be bargained away through the

power of suppliers or the power of customers, or it can be constrained

by the threat of new entrants or the threat of substitutes. Strategy can

be viewed as building defenses against the competitive forces or as

ﬁnding a position in an industry where the forces are weaker. Changes

## in the strength of the forces signal changes in the competitive landscape

critical to ongoing strategy formulation.

## Hardball: The single-minded pursuit of competitive advantage and the

beneﬁts it oﬀers: a leading market share, great margins, and rapid

growth. This involves picking your shots, seeking out competitive

encounters, setting the pace of innovation, and testing the edges of the

possible. While there are countless ways to play hardball, a handful of

classic strategies are eﬀective in generating competitive advantage. Best

employed in bursts of ruthless intensity, these strategies are: Devastate

rivals’ proﬁt sanctuaries, plagiarize with pride, deceive the competition,

unleash massive and overwhelming force, and raise competitors’ costs.

multifaceted. Some jobs are little (pass the time); some are big (ﬁnd

a more fulﬁlling career). They’re never simply about function; they

have powerful social and emotional dimensions. And the circumstances

in which customers try to do them are more critical than any buyer

characteristics. The key to successful innovation is identifying jobs that

are poorly performed in customers’ lives and then designing products,

experiences, and processes around those jobs.

Judo strategy: In the martial art of judo, a combatant uses the weight

## and strength of their opponent to their own advantage rather than

opposing blow directly to blow. Similarly, smart internet startups aim to

turn their opponents’ resources, strength, and size against them. Judo

strategy is based on three elements—rapid movement, ﬂexibility, and

leverage—each of which translates into a competitive principle. The

ﬁrst principle requires judo players to move rapidly to new markets and

uncontested ground, thus avoiding head-to-head combat. The second

principle demands that players give way to superior force when squarely

attacked. Finally—and most important—the third principle calls for

players to use the weight and strength of opponents against them.

reduces the chances that startups will spend a lot of time and money

launching products that no one will actually pay for.

This is in contrast to the more traditional path, where a venture’s

founders would write a business plan (complete with a ﬁve-year

forecast), use it to raise money, and then go into “stealth mode” to

develop their oﬀerings—all without getting much feedback from the

people they intended to sell to.

Lean strategy: The lean strategy process ensures that startups innovate

in a disciplined fashion so that they make the most of their limited

resources. This helps company builders choose viable opportunities,

stay focused, and align the entire organization.

The process begins with setting the venture’s vision, or ultimate

purpose—perhaps the only aspect of strategy that should be permanent.

To deliver on it, senior executives agree on a deliberate strategy,

deﬁning the ﬁrm’s objective (the near-term goal that describes success),

scope (what the ﬁrm will and will not do), and competitive advantage

(how it will win). The deliberate strategy sets the bounds within which

experiments will take place and guides daily decisions, but the results

of those experiments and decisions lead to learning that reshapes the

strategy. Though priorities evolve, at each point in time it’s clear to

everyone in the ﬁrm which ones take precedence.

## Multibusiness strategy: Enterprises that own multiple businesses often

have a ﬂawed approach to strategy: They focus too much on the makeup

of their portfolios and too little on enhancing the businesses in them.

To address this, start by recognizing that strategies for adding value to a

corporation’s businesses fall on a continuum. At one end the businesses

in the portfolio are completely unrelated; at the other they have many

similarities. Each location on the continuum requires a diﬀerent kind of

organizational structure and speciﬁc management processes to support

it. To succeed at execution, you need to determine where on the

spectrum your business falls and then align your portfolio selection,

structure, and processes with your vision of how to add value.

## Net promoter score: The best predictor of top-line growth can usually

be captured in a single survey question: Would you recommend this

company to a friend? Willingness to talk up a company or product to

friends, family, and colleagues is one of the best indicators of loyalty

because of the customer’s sacriﬁce in making the recommendation.

When customers act as references, they do more than indicate they’ve

received good economic value from a company; they put their own

reputations on the line. And they will risk their reputations only if they

feel intense loyalty. By substituting a single question with a consistent

scale—0 to 10, for example, where 0 means not at all likely, 5 means

neutral, and 10 means extremely likely—for the complex black box of

the customer satisfaction survey, companies can actually put consumer

survey results to use and focus employees on the task of stimulating

## Operational transparency: The deliberate design of windows into and

and appreciate the value being added. Witnessing the hidden work

performed on their behalf can make customers more satisﬁed, more

satisﬁed by demonstrating to them that they are serving their customers

well. To create operational transparency, consider what to reveal, when

to reveal it, and how to reveal it.

Managers should be aware of certain conditions in which transparency

Platform strategy: Traditional “pipeline” businesses succeed by

optimizing the activities in their value chains—most of which they

own or control. “Platform” businesses that bring together consumers

and producers, as companies Uber, Alibaba, and Airbnb do, require

a diﬀerent approach to strategy. The critical asset of a platform

is external—the community of members. The focus therefore shifts

from controlling resources to orchestrating them, and ﬁrms win by

facilitating more external interactions and creating “network eﬀects”

that increase the value provided to all participants. In this world,

competition can emerge from seemingly unrelated industries and even

# from within the platform itself.

Businesses that fail to learn the new rules of platform strategy

will struggle—when a platform enters the marketplace of a pure

pipeline business, the platform nearly always wins. That’s exactly what

happened when the iPhone came on the scene in 2007. By 2015, it

accounted for 92% of global proﬁts in mobile phones, while most of

the giants that once ruled the industry, such as Nokia, Samsung, and

Motorola, made no proﬁt at all.

Playing to win: A scientiﬁc approach to strategy built on rigorous choice

making and focusing on two key areas: Where you’ll play and how you’ll

# win.

A team begins by formulating options, or possibilities, and asks what

must be true for each to succeed. Once it has listed all the conditions,

it assesses their likelihood and thereby identiﬁes the barriers to each

choice. The team then tests the key barrier conditions to see which hold

true. From here, choosing a strategy is simple: The group reviews the

test results and chooses the possibility with the fewest serious barriers.

This is the path P&G took in the late 1990s, when it was looking to

become a major global player in skin care. After testing the barrier

conditions for several possibilities, it opted for a bold strategy that

might never have surfaced in the traditional process: reinventing Olay

as a prestige-like product also sold to mass consumers. The new

Olay succeeded beyond expectations—showing what can happen when

teams shift from asking “What is the right answer?” and focus instead

on ﬁguring out “What are the right questions?”

Purpose at the core of strategy: Purpose is usually seen as an add-

on—a way to create shared value, improve employee morale and

commitment, give back to the community, and help the environment.

But research on high-growth companies ﬁnds that many have moved

## purpose from the periphery of their strategy to its core—where, with

committed leadership and ﬁnancial investment, they use it to generate

sustained proﬁtable growth, stay relevant in a rapidly changing world,

and deepen ties with their stakeholders. These companies use purpose

in two strategic ways: to redeﬁne the playing ﬁeld and to reshape the

value proposition. This enables them to overcome the challenges of

slowing growth and declining proﬁtability.

## RAPID decision-making: Every success, every mishap, and every

opportunity seized or missed in an organization is the result of a

strategic decision that someone made or failed to make. Ambiguity

over who is accountable for which decisions can cause entire decision-

making processes to stall, usually at one of four bottlenecks: global

## versus local, center versus business unit, function versus function, and

# inside versus outside partners.

To make better strategic decisions, use the RAPID framework to clarify

## roles and clear decision-making bottlenecks:

- Recommend. People in this role are responsible for making a

proposal, gathering input, and providing the right data and analysis

to make a sensible decision in a timely fashion.

must bolster this data with inside insights and gain an understanding

of the interdependencies among their particular stakeholders. Armed

with that, they can develop a clear description of their purpose,

establish criteria for evaluating progress toward it, set priorities among

stakeholders, and start measuring value creation for each group. The

last step is to sustain the new strategy through cultural change and the

development of supporting processes and organizational structure.

Strategic failure: Strategy demands more than classic competitive

positioning. It requires making carefully coordinated choices about 1)

the opportunities to pursue; 2) the business model with the highest

potential to create value; 3) how to capture as much of that value as

possible; and 4) the implementation processes that help a ﬁrm adapt

activities and build capabilities that allow it to realize long-term value.

Neglecting any of those imperatives can derail a strategy, but CEOs

frequently zero in on just one. Entrepreneurs tend to focus on

identifying a golden opportunity and don’t think enough about how

to monetize it; leaders of incumbents, on capturing value but not

new ways to create it. By taking a holistic view and tackling all the

elements of strategy and integrating them well, however, ﬁrms will

greatly increase their odds of success.

## Strategic principle: A memorable and actionable phrase that

## distills a company’s corporate strategy into its unique essence and

communicates it throughout the organization. The beauty of having a

corporate strategic principle—a company should have only one—is that everyone in an organization, from the executives in the front oﬃce to

the people in the operating units, can knowingly work toward the same

strategic objective without being rigid about how they do so. Decisions

don’t always have to make the slow trip to and from the executive suite.

When a strategic principle is well crafted and eﬀectively communicated,

managers at all levels can be trusted to make decisions that advance

Strategic risk management: When a company voluntarily accepts some

risk in order to generate superior returns from its strategy. A bank

assumes credit risk, for example, when it lends money; many companies

take on risks through their research and development activities. A

strategy with high expected returns generally requires the company to

take on signiﬁcant risks, and managing those risks is a key driver in

capturing the potential gains.

There are three distinct approaches to managing strategic risks; which

model is appropriate for a given ﬁrm depends largely on the context in

which an organization operates:

- Independent experts. Some organizations—particularly those that

## push the envelope of technological innovation—face high intrinsic risk

as they pursue long, complex, and expensive product-development

projects. But since much of the risk arises from coping with

known laws of nature, the risk changes slowly over time. For these

organizations, risk management can be handled at the project level by,

# for example, a review board.

- Facilitators. Many organizations, such as traditional energy and water

utilities, operate in stable technological and market environments,

with relatively predictable customer demand. In these situations,

risks stem largely from seemingly unrelated operational choices

across a complex organization that accumulate gradually and can

remain hidden for a long time. Since no single staﬀ group has

the knowledge to perform operational-level risk management across

diverse functions, ﬁrms may deploy a relatively small central

risk-management group that collects information from operating

# managers.

- Embedded experts. The ﬁnancial services industry poses a unique

## challenge because of the volatile dynamics of asset markets and

the potential impact of decisions made by decentralized traders and

investment managers. An investment bank’s risk proﬁle can change

## dramatically with a single deal or major market movement. For such

companies, risk management requires embedded experts within the

organization to continuously monitor and inﬂuence the business’s risk

proﬁle, working side by side with the line managers whose activities

are generating new ideas, innovation, and risks—and, if all goes well,

Strategy as a portfolio of real options: In ﬁnancial terms, a strategy is

which to let ripen, and which to toss, companies make decisions based

on what they know now, what might happen in the future, and which

opportunities have already passed.

Two important metrics can help guide decision-making here: 1) value-

to-cost, or the value of the underlying assets you intend to build

or acquire divided by the present value of the expenditure required

to build or buy them; and 2) volatility, or how much things can

change before an investment decision must ﬁnally be made. Mapping

opportunities based on these two metrics can help leaders decide what

actions to take and where to place their bets.

Strategy execution: Strategy execution is the result of thousands

of decisions made every day by employees acting according to the

information they have and their own self-interest. Executives can use

four fundamental building blocks to inﬂuence those actions: clarifying

decision rights, designing information ﬂows, aligning motivators, and

making changes to structure.

Companies that execute strategy eﬀectively share ﬁve common traits:

- 1. Everyone has a good idea of the decisions and actions for which they

are responsible.

- 2. Important information about the competitive environment gets to

# headquarters quickly.

- 3. Once made, decisions are rarely second-guessed.

- 4. Information ﬂows freely across organizational boundaries.

Strategy-to-performance gap: Most companies struggle to deliver the

ﬁnancial performance their strategies promise. Leaders might blame

## poor planning, poor execution, or both, but the strategy-to-performance

gap is a common problem. While often opaque to management, there

are a few regular problems related to this gap:

- Companies rarely track performance against long-term plans.

- When they do, multiyear results rarely meet projections. Instead, they

show performance consistently falling short of ambitious projections

# year after year.

- Factors such as poorly formulated plans, misapplied resources,

## breakdowns in communication, and limited accountability for results

all drag down performance.

- Performance bottlenecks are often invisible to top management.

- The persistence of the gap fosters a culture of underperformance.

There are, however, companies that have ﬁgured out how to close

this gap. They do so by: 1) making strategy simple and concrete; 2)

debating assumptions, not forecasts; 3) using a rigorous framework

with a common language; 4) discussing resource deployments early; 5)

clearly identifying priorities; 6) continuously monitoring performance;

and 7) rewarding and developing execution capabilities.

Strategy statement: A clear, concise articulation of your company’s

strategy, in 35 words or less. This statement should deﬁne:

- the objective that the strategy is designed to achieve

- the scope of the business

- the advantage by which the business will achieve its stated objective

To develop a strategy and craft a statement, leaders should start

by evaluating the industry landscape, which includes segmenting

customers and identifying unique ways of delivering value to the

ones the ﬁrm targets. They should also analyze competitors’ current

strategies and predict how they might change. The key is to ﬁnd the

sweet spot where the ﬁrm’s capabilities and customers’ needs align in a

way that competitors cannot match.

Surviving disruption: Disruption is less a single event than a process

that plays out over time—sometimes quickly, other times slowly and

incompletely. To survive these changes, companies need to develop

a disruption of their own that allows them to reap the rewards of

participation in new, high-growth markets. To do so, companies should

business model that allows it to maintain a performance advantage as

it creeps upmarket in search of more and more customers. This helps

companies facing disruption understand where a new competitor might

challenge them, where their own advantages lie, and what barriers the

competitor will have to overcome. In other words, it helps illuminate

## Transient competitive advantage: In a turbulent environment, it can

be hard to sustain a position that allows a company to best rivals over

the long term. In this context, businesses can’t aﬀord to spend months

crafting a single long-term strategy—they need a portfolio of multiple

transient advantages that can be built quickly and abandoned just as

## rapidly. Though individually temporary, as a portfolio these advantages

can keep companies in the lead over the long run.

To compete in a transient-advantage economy, you must be willing to

honestly assess whether your current advantages are at risk. Companies

that want to create a portfolio of transient advantages need to make

eight major shifts in the way that they operate:

- 1. Think about arenas, not industries.

- 2. Set broad themes, then let people experiment.

- 3. Adopt metrics that support entrepreneurial growth.

- 4. Focus on experiences and solutions to problems.

- 5. Build strong relationships and networks.

- 6. Avoid brutal restructuring and learn healthy disengagement.

- 7. Get systematic about early-stage innovation.

- 8. Experiment, iterate, and learn.

Value chain: The activities required to produce and deliver a product or

service that enables a company to oﬀer unique value. If a value chain

is highly integrated and ﬁts together as a self-reinforcing system, it is more diﬃcult for a competitor to copy because they must replicate the

## whole system rather than just one or two discrete product features or

ways of performing particular activities.

To establish a sustainable competitive advantage, strategy must be

reﬂected in a distinct value chain. This means a company must

conﬁgure the way it conducts manufacturing, logistics, service delivery,

## marketing, human resource management, and so on diﬀerently from

rivals and tailored to its unique value proposition. If a company

focuses only on adopting best practices, it will end up performing most

activities similarly to competitors, making it hard to gain an advantage.

Value stick: A value-based strategy follows a simple principle:

suppliers. This value can be measured in customers’ willingness-to-pay

(WTP) price for goods and employees’ and suppliers’ willingness-to-sell

(WTS) price for their labor or goods. This idea is captured in a simple

graph, called a value stick, which allows companies to map where and

how they create value—and to create the opportunity to increase their

# own ﬁnancial performance.

- Core ideology describes an organization’s foundational identity. It’s

what remains constant, providing the glue that holds an organization

together as it grows, decentralizes, diversiﬁes, and expands globally.

The point of your core ideology is to guide and inspire, not to

diﬀerentiate—two companies can articulate the same ideology. This

ideology is the sum of core values and a core purpose.

- Envisioned future also consists of two parts: a 10-to-30-year audacious

goal, plus vivid descriptions of what it will be like to achieve the

goal. It is both concrete—describing something visible and vivid—and
