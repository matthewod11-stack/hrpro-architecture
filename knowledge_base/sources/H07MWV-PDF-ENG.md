A few years ago, I advised a sales team whose job involved making cold

calls. The team members would often attribute successful sales to their

own skill and expertise, while blaming external factors like poor leads

or bad timing for any failures. This is just one of many examples I can

think of from my experience working with leaders across organizations

and industries that illustrates a common human bias.

Self-serving bias is the tendency to interpret information in a way

that conﬁrms our existing beliefs and serves our own self-interest. In

situations that lack clarity, we often make assumptions that serve to

bolster our egos and self-esteem. We selectively interpret information

to support our own position, and overlook or dismiss information that

contradicts our views. In fact, in the above example, a look at the data

revealed that the team’s conversion rate was much lower than the team

expected. When presented with this data, some team members were

defensive and reluctant to acknowledge the reality of the situation.

The self-serving bias can lead to suboptimal decision-making or even

contribute to conﬂict, as we become more entrenched in our own

positions and less willing to consider alternative perspectives. This,

in turn, can make it diﬃcult to collaborate on solutions to complex

# problems.

Here’s how to combat the self-serving bias — and reach better, longer-

lasting decisions:

Consider the source of the information you’re relying on.

Doing this will likely lead you to reexamine the data you rely on to

make your decisions. As I wrote in my book Sidetracked, I once worked

with a chain of retail stores that was trying to motivate their employees.

Puzzled after a few unsuccessful attempts, they ﬁnally saw promising

results when they introduced clear performance guidelines, sales

targets, and monthly bonuses. Productivity shot up, most employees

met their targets, and managers began using these positive results in the

employees’ performance evaluations.

However, upon closer examination, company management noticed a

disturbing trend. Employees were achieving their sales targets primarily

in the last week of each month, and there was a spike in returned

merchandise the week after the bonus was paid out. In essence,

motivated by the new guidelines, workers were buying merchandise in

bulk toward the end of the month to meet their targets and returning

it shortly after receiving their bonus. Managers were evaluating their

employees based on incomplete information about their behavior and

# performance.

By considering the source of the information you’re relying on, you can

become more conﬁdent that in deciding on next steps, you’re using

relevant information to weigh others’ thinking and actions, as well as

# your own.

Think counterfactually about previous decisions you’ve made.

Counterfactual thinking invites you to consider diﬀerent courses of

action you could have taken to gain a better understanding of the

factors that inﬂuenced your choice. For example, if you missed a big

deadline on a work project, you might reﬂect on how working harder, asking for help, or renegotiating the deadline could have aﬀected the

outcome. This reﬂection can help you recognize which factors played a

signiﬁcant role in your decision-making process — for example, valuing

getting the project done on your own versus getting it done on time —

and identify changes you might want to make when it comes to future

# decisions.

The 1998 movie Sliding Doors oﬀers a great example of how

counterfactual thinking can help us understand the forces that shape

our decisions. The ﬁlm explores two alternate storylines for the main

character, Helen (played by Gwyneth Paltrow), based on whether she

catches an upcoming subway train or misses it. While watching both storylines unfold, we gain insight into diﬀerent factors that inﬂuence

# Helen’s life choices.

Similarly, engaging in counterfactual thinking can help you think

through choices you’ve made by helping you expand your focus to

consider multiple frames of reference beyond the present outcome. This type of reﬂection encourages you to take note of diﬀerent

perspectives and reach a more balanced view of your choices. By

thinking counterfactually, you can ensure you are looking at existing

# data in a more unbiased way.

Challenge your assumptions.

You can also ﬁght self-serving biases by actively seeking out

information that challenges your beliefs and assumptions. This can be

uncomfortable, as it could threaten your identity and worldview, but it’s

a key step in developing a more nuanced and informed perspective.

One way to do this is to purposely expose yourself to diﬀerent

perspectives in order to broaden your understanding of an issue. Take

Satya Nadella, the CEO of Microsoft. When he assumed the role in 2014,

he recognized that the company’s focus on Windows and Oﬃce was

limiting its growth potential. Not only did the company need a new

strategy, he recognized that the culture needed to evolve as well.

In order to expand the company’s horizons, Nadella sought out talent from diﬀerent backgrounds and industries, who brought with them a

diverse range of perspectives. He also encouraged Microsoft employees

to experiment and take risks, even if it meant failing along the way. By purposefully exposing himself and his team to diﬀerent perspectives

and new ideas, Nadella was able to transform Microsoft into a more

innovative and customer-focused company, with a renewed focus on

## cloud computing and artiﬁcial intelligence.

Research has found that people who actively seek out information that

challenges their preconceptions are better able to update their beliefs in

response to new evidence. By actively seeking out diverse perspectives

and evidence, you can overcome the limitations of self-serving biases

and make more informed decisions.

Falling prey to self-serving biases only means we are human beings.

Overcoming such biases in our work and life is not only critical to

achieving better decisions — it’s also very possible. We can make better,

more informed decisions — and unlock our full potential at work and

beyond — if we make a regular habit of the above three strategies.
