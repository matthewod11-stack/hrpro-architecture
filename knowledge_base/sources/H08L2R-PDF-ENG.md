With organizations gaining wider access to conversational gen AI

models, many managers now understand that the technology can go far

beyond simple productivity tasks. Two-thirds of managers now believe

that gen AI has the potential to be their thought partner, providing fresh

perspectives, weighing pros and cons, evaluating trade-oﬀs, enhancing

strategic thinking, and supporting leadership development. But while

expectations for the future are high, there is a long way to go. Today only

## HBR / Digital Article / How AI Can Help Managers Think Through Problems

30% of managers report that they have the skills and knowledge to use

# gen AI in this way.

Fortunately, managers can bridge the gap quickly. Based on our

## experience, countless conversations, and through thousands of

iterations of prompts, we have created an HBR Guide with instructions

and tools to help managers use any conversational gen AI tool as a

# thought partner.

With these techniques, humans and AI working together can achieve

high-quality outcomes that would not be possible working separately.

We call this process “co-thinking,” and this article will show you how to

get started.

# The Power of Co-Thinking

Gen AI can be used as a thought partner for anything from speech

preparation to root-cause analysis to strategy formulation. Let’s look at

# a few examples:

- Mario is a project manager at a manufacturing plant, and he and his

team often must solve technical challenges. Uncovering root causes

of problems is a recurring, yet complex task. Mario has designed

a structured dialogue with gen AI to help him think through each

problem. Whenever a new one arises, he ﬁne-tunes and tests his

# prompt sequence.

- Kim is a communications manager at a large consumer goods

company. She has been using gen AI both to draft press releases and

to weigh how diﬀerent stakeholders might react to them. Kim engages

in a two-way conversation asking gen AI to act as speciﬁc stakeholders

and debate with her about the content of each draft. Kim’s rule of

thumb is to challenge and be challenged by AI during the dialogue.

- Amy is a ﬁnance leader at a large technology company who is tasked

with promoting a change initiative that will transform her department

## from an internal service provider into a strategic partner for business

units. Amy has created a gen AI prompt sequence that her team

members can run to help them understand and reﬂect on how to

embrace the new mindset and behaviors that this initiative will

# require.

These stories shed light on a way of interacting with AI that goes far

beyond simply answering questions or pushing a button and getting an

output. It involves an active back-and-forth conversation, examples of

which can be seen in the below table, where both the human and the AI

contribute ideas and build upon each other’s thoughts at every step of

# the dialogue.

What the manager can do in the dialogue What the AI can do in the dialogue

- Validate

- Give different perspectives

- Decide

- Challenge opinions

The value of a co-thinking dialogue is not only in the output but also

in the dialogue itself — in fact value is co-created through the various

# steps of the human–AI conversation.

Executives in many roles have spoken about using gen AI as a co-

thinker. Masayoshi Son of Softbank has said, “I am chatting with

ChatGPT every day,” brainstorming new ideas and business strategies.

Jeﬀ Maggioncalda of Coursera called gen AI “an incredible thought

partner changing the way I do my job.”

Outside the C-suite, we met managers at all levels who embrace co-

thinking. Valentin Marguet, a project manager at Ferrari, shared that

“For technical problem-solving, generative AI can act as a co-thinking

partner, serving as a methodological expert while guiding structured

thought processes to systematically explore root causes.” We believe

that these approaches can help any leader or manager and that the time

to start is now.

## How to Design a Co-Thinking Dialogue with AI

We have created a four-step framework to help managers successfully

## design a co-thinking dialogue with gen AI.

Step 1: Assign a role to AI. Deﬁne the speciﬁc role you want AI to take,

such as acting like an expert, a team member, or a devil’s advocate. Use

introductory phrases like “Act as…”, “Help me…”, “The output of the

dialogue will be…”, etc.

Step 2: Deﬁne the setting. Choose the setting in which you’d like the

conversation to take place. Who is taking part in the conversation?

Should it be a one-to-one interaction between you and AI or as a one-to-

## many interaction (for example, at a team meeting or workshop)?

Step 3: Outline the dialogue. Envision a sequence of questions and

statements that will clarify who does what between you and the AI.

Deﬁne closely what the AI will bring and what the human will bring;

leaving the ﬂow of the dialogue to chance increases the risk that it will

go oﬀ track.

Step 4: Create the prompt. Write the prompt based on the outline you

drafted. You can use gen AI to help you reﬁne the prompt further, for

instance you can type in the chat: “I have this outline of a dialogue and

need your help turning it into a structured prompt that you can run with

me: ‘[insert your outline here].’”

The sidebar “Two Co-Thinking Dialogues to Try” shows you two

prompts that were created using this framework. We encourage you

to copy and paste them into any gen AI model of your choosing and

start your dialogue now. After you have proceeded through the dialogue

once, try modifying the prompt to address a professional challenge

you are facing — or design a new dialogue from scratch. The more

you experiment with co-thinking dialogues, the faster your skills will

# improve.

# Two Co-Thinking Dialogues to Try

Below are two prompts to help you try out co-thinking with AI. Copy and

paste either of the dialogues below into the gen AI model of your choosing

such as ChatGPT, Claude, or Copilot. The gen AI will walk you through each

# step of the dialogue.

## To Understand Multiple Stakeholder Perspectives

You (Gen AI) will act as an expert of systems thinking in

collaborative innovation, capable of taking the perspective of

# multiple stakeholders.

I want you (Gen AI) to guide me through the following steps. Always

## ask for my feedback before the next step.

[Step 1] Gen AI asks the manager to share the problem and the list of

external stakeholders that need to be involved to solve it, explaining

why the company alone cannot tackle it

[Step 2] Gen AI suggests three other stakeholders that are overlooked.

The manager provides feedback and validates the revised list of

# stakeholders.

[Step 3] Gen AI creates a table with four columns: stakeholders, their

specific needs, unresolved pain points, and associated root causes.

The manager provides feedback and validates the table.

[Step 4] Gen AI asks the manager to select the three most critical

stakeholders. Then, it suggests three red flags and mitigation actions

for each stakeholder. The manager provides feedback.

[Step 5] Gen AI suggests three immediate next steps to initiate

# engagement with each stakeholder.

# To Promote a Mindset Shift

You (Gen AI) will act as an expert in mindset change, providing

methodological coaching on what is needed and how it can be

practiced concretely.

I want you (Gen AI) to guide me through the following steps. Always

## ask for my feedback before the next step.

[Step 1] Gen AI asks the manager to share contextual information

about the organization, the new mindset to adopt, and the reason for

the shift. Then it elaborates with examples or situational scenarios to

clarify what the new mindset means in practice and how to embody it.

[Step 2] Gen AI asks the manager three questions to help evaluate

## the current maturity of the individual’s mindset shift. The manager

reflects on the results of this self-evaluation and prioritizes the areas

of opportunity to reduce the gap versus the desired mindset.

[Step 3] Based on the selected areas of opportunity, gen AI asks the

## manager to share an example from daily work.

[Step 4] Gen AI suggests three good practices, tips, and routines that

the manager can apply. The manager comments and selects one.

[Step 5] Gen AI recommends rejoining the dialogue after a few weeks

to discuss any challenges that have arisen in implementing the

selected practice.

## Getting the Most out of Your Gen AI Dialogues

Our research brought us into contact Jessica Tompkinson, a former

## global head of communications and corporate aﬀairs at Unilever

Operations. She shared some of her ups and downs of learning to

use gen AI as a co-thinker. “Looking back at my ﬁrst prompts, what

was coming back was useless for what I needed. I had to change my

approach and started to converse with gen AI like I would a colleague or

an agency. The back-and-forth conversation signiﬁcantly improved the

outcome and allowed the tools to learn more in the process.”

As you begin to use gen AI as a co-thinker, expect mixed results at

ﬁrst. Following the best practices in this list of do’s and don’ts can help

accelerate your learning curve.

# Dos

- Embrace a conversational mindset: Approach gen AI as if you’re

talking to a human collaborator. The machine can operate similarly

to the Socratic method, enhancing your critical thinking through

dialogue. You can prompt gen AI to drive you through a structured

dialogue about a topic or issue you choose, elaborating on your

answers, adding overlooked dimensions, and leading to follow-up

# questions.

- Participate actively: You must engage with the machine in a back-

and-forth interaction. Both parties contribute with feedback and

mutual challenges, and ultimately co-create the output together. To

receive appropriate advice, tailored answers, and helpful suggestions,

start by providing a brief and accurate overview of your situation with

clear context. Then, build on it by engaging actively — share your

reﬂections and personal experiences, and ask follow-up questions.

- Challenge the AI: As in a dialogue with a human, some friction

in the thinking process is valuable. Ask the AI to provide diﬀerent

perspectives, ideas, or overlooked options. Don’t stop at the ﬁrst

generated output or conform too quickly to what the AI gives you. For

example, ask “Are we missing any important aspects?” Or, “What if we

looked at this problem from the point of view of …?”

# Don’ts

- Go it alone: When people work predominantly alone with

generative AI, rather than actively involving and engaging with

human teammates, it can reduce interpersonal communication and

knowledge sharing within the team. This can hinder team-based

judgment and the ability to prevent and mitigate risks. Take breaks

from solo AI interactions to engage face-to-face with teammates,

involve other colleagues in the AI-aided process, seek feedback from

experts, integrate diverse viewpoints, and encourage peer learning.

- Go too fast: You may tend to type, click, or advance too hastily. The

speed at which gen AI executes can lead humans to rush through

without reﬂection. Request AI to help you pause and reﬂect: Explicitly

prompt AI to ask for your feedback, ensuring you have time to reﬂect

and validate before moving forward.
