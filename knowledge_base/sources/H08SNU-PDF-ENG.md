Today, companies around the world face increasing economic and

## business uncertainty thanks to the volatile geopolitical environment

and the rise of AI. In challenging contexts like this, it’s tempting for

business leaders to engage in “subtractive” tactics, such as cutting costs,

streamlining operations, and eliminating waste.

## HBR / Digital Article / In Turbulent Times, Consider “Strategic Subtraction”

To be sure, subtractive actions can be a powerful way of dealing

with emerging situations where resources are tight. However, they’re

shortsighted if the goal is only to improve eﬃciency at the cost of other

objectives, such as resilience and visibility. Rather than simply using

subtractive tactics to make indiscriminate cuts, strategic subtraction

can help you innovate in a way that positions your organization to

withstand the tumult and even rebound.

This article introduces a “triple test” to help leaders gauge how any subtractive move will aﬀect three essential performance goals:

eﬃciency, resilience, and prominence. We then map out six distinct

subtractive transformations you can apply to meet all three objectives in

# concert.

## The Triple Test for Subtractive Strategies

The eﬀective use of subtraction requires a holistic approach that

considers multiple performance dimensions beyond eﬃciency. Begin

by asking, “How can we innovate in turbulent times by subtracting to

improve eﬃciency, strengthen resilience, and elevate our prominence?”

For any innovation to thrive in 2025’s complex landscape, the use of

subtraction must include three interrelated business performance goals:

- Eﬃciency: Minimizing resources, time, and eﬀort

- Resilience: Adapting to disruptions and maintaining core

# functionality

- Prominence: Ensuring visibility and appeal to stakeholders

Relentlessly slimming a system for pure eﬃciency can leave it brittle

and invisible, eroding long-term value instead of creating it. For

example, when ﬁrms pursued “just-in-time” inventory as the ultimate

cost saver, many discovered during the Covid-19 shock that a penny shaved oﬀ warehousing was quickly lost to plant shutdowns, empty

shelves, and public frustration when the fragile networks snapped.

It was evidence that eﬃciency unsupported by resilience invites

# operational paralysis and revenue loss.

A starker lesson came from Boeing. Many years of aggressive cost-

cutting on the 737 Max program trimmed design hours and testing

budgets. However, the subsequent crashes created more than $20

billion in direct costs and torpedoed decades of brand equity, showing

how neglecting trust, reputation, and stakeholder conﬁdence can turn

## short-term savings into an existential bill.

Subtraction that doesn’t pass the full triple test of eﬃciency, resilience,

and prominence can turn today’s lean victory into tomorrow’s

# catastrophic liability.

# Six Core Subtractive Transformations

So, how can businesses leaders go beyond eﬃciency improvements

and use subtraction to innovate? Our experience in helping over

100 companies and organizations identify innovation opportunities in

turbulent times suggests six distinct ways to apply subtractive thinking

while balancing eﬃciency, resilience, and prominence. These can be

applied to processes, systems, products, and services:

## Elimination: Remove components, steps, or options entirely

This involves complete or selective removal of elements that no longer

serve essential functions. Elimination can target entire components,

# speciﬁc process steps, low-value options, unnecessary rules, or redundant handoﬀs.

For example, when IKEA ﬁnally discontinued its globally iconic paper

catalog in 2021, it removed an entire cost-intensive print channel. This

action saved the company an estimated 33,000 tons of paper each

year. Eﬃciency rose through lower production and distribution spend;

resilience improved because all product storytelling now updates

instantly on digital platforms; and the move burnished prominence by

signaling a decisive sustainability stance that resonated with younger

# shoppers.

## Substitution: Replace complex elements with simpler alternatives

This involves swapping out complicated components, processes, or

systems with simpler alternatives that serve the same core function

more elegantly. An example is Rwanda’s national health service, which

replaced unreliable mountain-road couriers with U.S.-based drone

startup Zipline’s battery-powered drones in 2016 to address blood-

delivery issues in rural areas. A 2022 study in The Lancet Global

Health reported a 67% cut in expired blood units as a result. The

light, all-electric ﬂeet required less labor and fuel (boosting eﬃciency),

eliminated the need to traverse hazardous ﬂooded roads (resilience),

and the move elevated the country’s global reputation for healthcare

# innovation (prominence).

## Consolidation: Combine multiple functions into integrated solutions

This encompasses both compression of processes and integration of

## multiple functions, components, or touchpoints into uniﬁed systems

that deliver the same value with fewer moving parts.

For instance, Estonia’s e-Residency rolls multiple bureaucratic tasks

into a single digital ID. Using this system, entrepreneurs worldwide

can launch and run an EU-based company entirely online with

one smartcard login. Paperless ﬁlings reduce administrative burdens

## (eﬃciency), a cryptographically secure backbone guards continuity

(resilience), and the program earns Estonia prominence by positioning

it as a tiny nation punching far above its weight in digital governance.

Hiding: Conceal complexity while keeping it accessible

Organizations can lighten cognitive load—without sacriﬁcing

functionality—by selectively hiding complexity in everyday workﬂows,

processes, and products. Tuck away non-essential elements from the

primary interface while preserving access when needed. For example,

an employee-onboarding portal might reveal only the next required step

while keeping full policy documents accessible with a single click. Or

consider Otter.ai, an AI-powered transcription and collaboration tool.

Its “Highlight” feature masks 100% of the transcript until you need

it. The AI meeting tool now autogenerates a bite-sized summary from

user highlights, tucking the verbatim transcript beneath a single click.

Teams spend less time scrolling (eﬃciency), the records are preserved

## for audits (resilience), and the feature positions Otter as a user-centric

# productivity champion (prominence).

Pausing: Temporarily suspend system components

Pausing involves strategically suspending features, processes, or

services that can be reactivated when conditions change instead of

eliminating them altogether. For example, using Netﬂix’s one-click

“Pause Membership,” subscribers can freeze billing for up to three

months instead of cancelling outright. This mini-sabbatical saves churn

and winback costs (eﬃciency), keeps account data intact for seamless

reactivation (resilience), and signals empathy toward customers that

## distinguishes Netﬂix in the subscription wars (prominence).

Abstraction: Create interface layers that shield users from complexity

This involves building simpliﬁed interfaces that translate user inputs

into complex backend operations, making sophisticated systems

accessible without requiring users to understand the underlying

intricacies. AWS abstracts complex infrastructure management,

allowing developers to focus on deployment without dealing

with physical servers (eﬃciency) while accelerating innovation

## (resilience). The platform’s simpliﬁed interface masks enormous

backend complexity, positioning AWS as the go-to solution for scalable

computing (prominence).

## How to Make Subtraction a Default Strategy

Leaders can make subtraction a core capability by adopting a few

## practical strategies—not in isolation, but as part of a broader shift

toward doing better by doing less:

Build subtraction into core processes Rather than treating subtraction as a one-oﬀ decision, it should be

embedded into how teams plan and prioritize. Leaders can introduce

## “stop-doing” reviews alongside traditional goal-setting exercises. In

these reviews, teams examine their workﬂows, tools, and deliverables

and identify what no longer adds value.

Elimination helps cut extraneous steps that contribute little to outcomes, while consolidation removes unnecessary handoﬀs or approval loops. Hiding can be used to remove low-value oﬀerings

or services that confuse customers or dilute strategic focus. By

building these forms of subtraction into annual or quarterly planning,

organizations improve eﬃciency and maintain strategic alignment

without expanding complexity.

# Introduce subtractive design challenges

Subtractive design challenges shift problem-solving away from

accumulation and toward essential value. Rather than asking teams how

to improve a process by adding new elements, ask how the same result

can be achieved with fewer steps, features, or constraints.

Consolidation allows teams to condense workﬂows into fewer steps

without loss of quality. Substitution invites smaller, more elegant

solutions that are easier to use and maintain. Abstraction encourages

replacing complex interfaces with simpler alternatives. Each of these

approaches supports eﬃciency by reducing operational drag. They also

support resilience, since simpler systems are less prone to failure and

easier to troubleshoot. Design challenges make subtraction a creative

constraint rather than a limiting one.

Celebrate subtraction done well

Subtraction is frequently overlooked, which makes its beneﬁts easy to

ignore. Leaders can encourage recognition by asking teams not only

to log what they’ve stopped doing, but also to celebrate that as an

achievement. This simple habit turns subtraction into an acknowledged

source of value worthy of praise. Techniques such as elimination

and pausing help make these removals deliberate accomplishments.

Eliminating a redundant task can improve eﬃciency by reducing time

wasted and deserves recognition as a meaningful contribution. Pausing

low-impact projects keeps future options open while concentrating on current eﬀorts—another strategic decision worth celebrating.

Recognizing and honoring subtraction reinforces the idea that removal

with strategic intent is a sign of progress, not neglect.

## Using Gen AI to Support Subtractive Transformation

Generative AI tools can help you identify subtractive opportunities

that humans might miss. For example, for illustrative purposes, we

prompted Google Gemini 2.5 and Claude 4 to craft the following

subtractive ideas for a large healthcare provider in India using

the six approaches described above: “Generate actionable subtractive-

## innovation ideas for [Company Name] that deliver equal or better value

## with fewer steps, lower cost, or less complexity while simultaneously

maintaining or boosting resilience and maintaining or improving

prominence/visibility. For each of [the six approaches], suggest at least

one concrete idea.” The output has been lightly edited for clarity:

- Elimination: Eliminate physical outpatient follow-ups for stable

chronic conditions using teleconsultations to boost patient

convenience (eﬃciency), ensure care continuity (resilience), and

position [Company] as a tech-forward provider (prominence).

- Consolidation: Consolidate patient touchpoints (appointments,

## reports, payments, pre-assessment) into a single mobile app to

streamline the patient journey (eﬃciency), centralize communication

## (resilience), and enhance digital accessibility (prominence).

- Substitution: Replace traditional paper-based patient intake with

voice-activated digital forms, reducing data entry errors (eﬃciency),

improving record accuracy (resilience), and showcasing innovation

# leadership (prominence).

- Hiding: Implement smart triage systems that hide complexity from

patients while ensuring they reach appropriate care levels, reducing

wait times (eﬃciency), maintaining care quality (resilience), and

improving patient satisfaction (prominence).

- Pausing: Introduce ﬂexible appointment scheduling that allows

patients to pause and reschedule appointments without

penalty, reducing no-shows (eﬃciency), maintaining doctor–patient

relationships (resilience), and demonstrating patient-centric care

# (prominence).

- Abstraction: Create a single patient portal that abstracts all

healthcare interactions behind a uniﬁed interface, simplifying access

(eﬃciency), ensuring continuity across services (resilience), and

positioning [Company] as a digitally advanced provider (prominence).

By explicitly directing the AI model to consider subtractive options of

various types, organizations can overcome the human tendency to add

and discover more elegant solutions that balance multiple performance

# goals beyond just eﬃciency.

. . .

In an era when every competitor is racing to add more features, channels, data, and spend, the real diﬀerentiator is the courage to

remove. Subtraction is neither austerity nor minimalism; it’s strategic

design. By carving away the non-essential, leaders create the white
