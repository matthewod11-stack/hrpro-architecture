To Make the Case for Paternity Leave, Dads Will Have to Work Together

For advocates of paternity leave, recent years have brought some good

news. High-proﬁle companies like Amazon, Netﬂix, and Microsoft have

created or expanded their programs. Twenty-nine percent of organizations

now offer some paid leave for fathers, up from 21% a few years ago,

according to the Society for Human Resource Management. And steadily,

more states are creating paid family leave insurance programs, which

include leave for new fathers.

But overall, the picture is bleak. Seventy-one percent of organizations not

offering paternity leave is nothing to celebrate. Even among large

## businesses with at least 10,000 employees, almost half (48%) lack

paternity leave.

Worse, when paternity leave is offered, the pressures on men not to take it

are often extreme. Some new dads have been ﬁred, demoted and lost job

opportunities for doing so.

My book, All In, is ﬁlled with such stories, and parents often share

anecdotes with me. A lawyer in Florida recently told me that his boss said

to him, “We have six weeks of paternity leave, but you’re not taking any.”

A public relations executive in California told me her husband’s boss

criticized him, asking, “Why isn’t your wife doing that?”

In a survey I helped develop for Dove Men+Care (a brand I partner with)

and Promundo, 73% of fathers said there’s little workplace support for

them. Twenty-one percent fear losing their jobs if they take their full

paternity leave. “We’re still held back by two traditional stereotypes: that

men are the primary breadwinners and women are the primary caregivers

for children,” the survey found.

These stereotypes, vestiges of the Mad Men era, hurt everyone. They hold

back women’s careers, since families are left with no choice but for women

to do more caregiving. They hurt children, who need time with both

parents. They damage businesses, which lose great women and men. EY

found that men are even more likely than women to switch jobs or careers

to have more time with their families.

It isn’t easy to stand up to the pressures against taking paternity leave.

With a new child in the home, things are hectic — and, in most cases,

money is tight. The last thing dads can do is risk their jobs and careers.

But men in this situation need to know they’re not alone. After I launched

a legal ﬁght against CNN/Time Warner for fair paternity leave, people all

over the country and around the world issued public statements of

support. Numerous colleagues of mine were openly supportive as well,

even hugging me in the newsroom. All this made a huge difference.

(Ultimately, the company changed its policy, in a win-win for both sides.)

So to ﬁght this battle — for the sake of women, men, businesses, all of

society, and most importantly children who need time with both their

mothers and fathers — we need to stick together.

For fellow dads who ﬁnd themselves in this situation, here are steps to

# take.

Seek a change in advance

Unlike other forms of leave, time off to care for a newborn is something

you can usually plan for. Find out the policies in your workplace, and the

protocols for requesting a change. Start off with the optimistic assumption

that your organization will want to do the right thing. Show executives the

research demonstrating that paternity leave saves them money by

attracting and retaining employees, including women and men.

Come out of the shadows

If, as with me, your business puts off a decision, only to say no after your

child is born, share your story publicly. When I went public with my case,

men — including some I didn’t know — called me to share their

experiences. Some cried on the phone, describing heartbreaking stories of

having to leave their wives alone at home and rush back to work. One man

had twins in the ICU. In virtually all these cases, they hadn’t discussed it

publicly. For us to take on this issue, we need to help everyone see how

widespread the problem it is, and the impact it has on our families.

Learn the laws

I discovered through my experience that most workers don’t know their

rights. I ﬁled a charge with the Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission. Many people didn’t know what that is, let alone the fact that

an EEOC charge gives a worker certain protections. After my case was

ﬁled, the EEOC also sent out guidance making clear to employers that they

should “carefully distinguish” medical recovery leave for women after a

birth and caregiving leave, which must be gender neutral. Steadily, more

men have been taking legal action.

## Take, and share, the Paternity Leave Pledge

Recently, Dove Men+Care and I announced a new effort to make paternity

leave a national norm. The Pledge for Paternity Leave is an invitation to

everyone to take action. New and expecting dads can pledge to take their

full leave — to stand up against the stigmas, exert their rights, and demand

that their workplaces treat them fairly. Allies can pledge to spread the

word about positive impacts of paternity leave and to call on officials to

endorse parental leave. And business leaders can pledge to enact paternity

# leave policies.

It takes a village to make this happen. But when we do, we help ensure

that kids will grow up seeing mom and dad as equally capable at work and

home. They see that their choices do not have to be limited by their

gender. That fuels how they see their futures. In the long run, that’s the

shift we need.
