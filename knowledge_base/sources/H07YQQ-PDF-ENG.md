You’re ready to have a greater impact on your company’s strategic

direction, but you don’t know where to begin with your ideas. You see

an opportunity to open a new market for your company, but you’re

unsure what levers to pull. You want to drive an important initiative

that spans several business units, but you don’t know how to position

# yourself for it.

## HBR / Digital Article / A Guide for Getting Stakeholder Buy-In for Your Agenda

This is where we meet many of our clients. They are successful leaders

who can run their business units and lead their teams. They are experts

in their domain, but when it comes to driving an agenda across the

enterprise, they falter. While our clients have accepted the utility of

playing politics, which is often the ﬁrst hurdle, the “how-tos” remain

# frustratingly vague.

As a result, they procrastinate. They’re pulled toward urgent but less

important tasks. Conquering the small stuﬀ is just so much easier and

provides more immediate gratiﬁcation.

This article aims to help leaders avoid this trap and become eﬀective

political operators. We oﬀer you four domains to cultivate along with

practical questions to assist you in advancing your strategic objectives

# within your organization.

## Mastering the Four Agenda-Setting Domains

Before you begin, make sure you’re clear on what you want to

accomplish and why it’s important to you. For example, consider

writing an objective statement. This isn’t necessarily a simple exercise,

and will require some time and thought. But once your objective is clear,

you can dive into the four domains: adopting an enterprise perspective,

leveraging your strategic mindset, cultivating stakeholder awareness,

and considering your personal motives and risks.

Adopting an enterprise perspective

After your goal is formulated, the ﬁrst domain for you to consider is an

enterprise perspective — thinking in terms of the larger organization,

## and not only your expertise, team, functional area, or business unit.

# Ask:

- What will the enterprise gain if you accomplish your objective?

- How will achieving your objective speciﬁcally beneﬁt diﬀerent

# enterprise stakeholders?

One of our clients, a senior VP, credited her rapid rise to her enterprise

perspective. Over the years, she cultivated the habit of taking 10

minutes before every meeting or important conversation to consider

who was attending, what their agenda or needs might be, and how

to connect her point of view to both their goals and the company’s.

This way of connecting her needs to others and the company’s gave

her the reputation of being a team player, someone who was striving

for collective wins. She rewarded her teams for doing the same, which

broke down silos and ampliﬁed the power of their eﬀorts. Her company

continued to grow and, as a result, she was oﬀered resources because it

was clear that her success meant the success of the wider organization.

Leveraging your strategic mindset

The second domain to consider is your strategic mindset —

understanding that advancing your agenda is not a linear path from

point A to point B. Rather, like a game of chess, it will mean

strategizing and planning. Achieving your goals requires patience,

making sacriﬁces, taking a step backwards, or making a lateral move

to ultimately reach your objective.

Another component of a strategic mindset is identifying the limits of

your knowledge and considering where you may be falling prey to

cognitive biases, hearsay, outdated, knowledge, following the easier (but

not necessarily advantageous) path, or being unduly inﬂuenced by sunk

# costs.

Ask yourself the following to cultivate your strategic mindset:

- In what ways is your objective a departure from business-as-

usual? How does that departure from business-as-usual impact key

# stakeholders?

- How have others attempted a similar objective or embarked on a

# similar transformation?

- What are the enterprise risks and rewards involved with attempting

# this objective?

- What are the enterprise risks and rewards of not attempting this

# objective?

- What resources do you need to reach this objective? What will it take to

# access these resources?

- What information have you accepted/discounted without having done

# your due diligence?

- What direction might you be disregarding because it seems arduous or

complicated?

After you’ve answered these questions, your job is to assess if you’re

ready to proceed with your agenda or if you need to address gaps in your

# thinking.

## One of our clients, a highly accomplished leader with experience in

direct-to-consumer business (B2C), was recently recruited to a company

that was only a wholesale business. To remain competitive during the

pandemic, the company proposed establishing a B2C channel. Given

her expertise, our client was very enthusiastic about the potential

contribution she could make to this new line of business. She dove in

energetically but was quickly met with a strong resistance.

When she reﬂected on the questions outlined above and cultivated

greater strategic awareness, she realized the magnitude of the change

she was trying to drive. This helped her to slow down and put her

attention on the long-game. She took time to analyze how her B2C

channel objectives would impact the various stakeholders, what would

be required from them, and what they would stand to gain and lose

from this new direction. In repeated conversations over six-months,

she was able to help them see how they would beneﬁt from this new

channel, and ultimately gained their support.

Cultivating stakeholder awareness

The third domain you have to cultivate is your stakeholder awareness.

This refers to truly understanding the stakeholders involved — their

needs, motivators, states of mind, and methods for reaching them.

First, identify the stakeholders needed to achieve your objective. Who

are your:

- Active supporters

- Passive players (those who are indiﬀerent)

- Skeptics

- Active opponents

Then, ask the following:

- How does achieving your objective most beneﬁt your active

# supporters?

- What central concern can you expect from your passive players?

- What central objection can you expect from your skeptics?

- What central objection can you expect from your active opponents?

## In addition, assess each stakeholder in terms of:

- The amount of direct involvement they will have with your objective.

Rate them high, medium, or low.

- The amount of inﬂuence they have over other stakeholders. Rate them

# high, medium, or low.

- The resources they control. Rate them high, medium, or low.

Finally, identify how each stakeholder needs to be approached to get

# them on board:

- With data?

- By linking it to enterprise impact?

- With endorsements from other key stakeholders?

- By aligning it with their values?

- By linking it to their potential win, their ego, or their advancement?

- By linking it to a reduction in a risk that they care about?

By now you should have a clear sense of what it will take to recruit your

stakeholders and with whom you need to continue to build trust and

# alignment.

As a result of the supply chain disruptions, one of our clients, a senior

director of global procurement, had an idea that would dramatically

reduce outsourcing, and therefore reliance on the global supply

chain. Knowing his idea was a radical departure from the company’s

existing process, and having identiﬁed his boss as a passive player,

one motivated by risk reduction, our client decided to bring up his

objective in stages. This gave his boss time to acclimatize himself to

the conversation. First, he shared his idea at a high level to gauge his

boss’ openness. In their next discussion, he gave a broad overview of the

problem and the risk it posed to the enterprise. He gave his boss time to digest that, and only when he felt his boss was suﬃciently engaged with

the issue, did he bring up his change agenda.

Considering your personal motives and risks

The ﬁnal domain you want to consider is your personal motives and

risks — knowing what’s at stake for yourself, what’s required of you, and

what you’re willing to settle for.

## HBR / Digital Article / A Guide for Getting Stakeholder Buy-In for Your Agenda

To accomplish this, there are two realms of consideration: one around

the objective itself, and one focused on what you will (or won’t) get from

# it.

First consider what constitutes achievement of this objective for you. If

you can’t achieve the full objective, what compromises are you willing

to make? And where do those compromises end; in other words, what’s

your bottom line? Finally, if you fail, what are the consequences —

# professionally and personally?

Once you have a clear sense of what success looks like for you, and

whether it’s worth the risk, go a little deeper to connect it to your own

motives. Start by thinking about why you are attempting this challenge

in the ﬁrst place. Is it for learning? Career experience? Connections? Or

# for the thrill of the pursuit?

With your answers in mind, and if indeed you decide you want to

advance your agenda, ask:

- What character strengths or values will I need to achieve this objective?

- What beliefs will limit me in achieving this objective?

- What personal priorities or challenges are competing for my time and

# energy?

- What personal support do I have or need more of?

One of our clients is the CFO of a startup, poised to go public in the next

couple of years. The CEO, who is also the founder, brought her in to help

the company get ﬁscally positioned for their IPO. This was very exciting

for her as she had the skills and was eager to pursue the challenge and

add this experience to her resume. Pretty quickly, however, it became

obvious that the founder/CEO was committed to his own ways of doing

things and was particularly hard to inﬂuence. She noticed that going

public became less and less of a priority as other market concerns came

to the foreground for the company. She came to us frustrated that she

couldn’t see the IPO to fruition. In conversation with us she realized

that learning was her key value, and that regardless of going public,

what she could learn in her role would give her great meaning. Once she

embraced the learning opportunity, the timing of the IPO became less

relevant to her, and she was able to focus on other ways to make the

# company more ﬁscally sound.

It’s common for leaders to initially bristle at the idea of playing

politics. It’s also natural to avoid hard or new endeavors because they

arouse feelings of uncertainty and potential failure. Thus, to advance

your agenda for the organization’s beneﬁt, you need a structure for

strategizing; a template to be politically skillful. By thinking through

these four domains and their corresponding questions, we hope you will

feel empowered to drive objectives that maximize your contributions

and serve your organization.
