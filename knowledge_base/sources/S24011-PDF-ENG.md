Conventional wisdom holds that leadership can be developed through

extensive study and training. Many organizations invest a tremendous

amount of time and money in programs that teach executives how

to inﬂuence, inspire, and coach others; build trust; have crucial

conversations; give feedback; change people’s behavior; and more.

Many aspiring leaders comb through books, attend seminars, and

seek out mentors, all in an eﬀort to understand leadership’s intricate

# nuances.

My research shows that another approach can complement and

accelerate those traditional, competence-focused eﬀorts. It involves

tapping into neural pathways in the brain—into faculties everyone

already possesses but might not be consistently using at work. Rather

than a trait to be acquired, leadership is a state to be activated, my work

suggests. And by shifting the emphasis from learning on the sidelines to

leading in the moment, executives can achieve real breakthroughs.

This leadership model, which has become the basis for a popular course

at Columbia Business School, grew out of work that my consulting ﬁrm,

Mentora Institute, my team, and I did. In 2006 we began building a

repository of more than 1,000 moments of transformative leadership,

capturing instances when individuals notably exceeded expectations

in critical situations. In 2022, I detailed our insights in a book, Inner

Mastery, Outer Impact, in which I introduced the main tenets of

exemplary leadership and argued that leaders can embody them by

tapping into their inner core—the space of highest potential within

them, their best self. The presence within us of such a core—of a

state of peak performance in which we’re calmly aware of our inner

and outer conditions and able to adapt our behavior as needed—is

being substantiated by scientiﬁc studies in a range of ﬁelds, including

## cognitive behavioral therapy, positive psychology, and neuroscience.

Yet the idea of it isn’t new; across the ages, people have engaged in

contemplative practices in an eﬀort to connect with what they have

intuited to be their spirit or soul and to express its qualities in their

# outer pursuits.

My ﬁrm has found that executives can tap into their inner core

with just 10 to 15 minutes of preparation before a big event. In our

research and consulting work, we’ve validated our approach, which

we call leadership-in-ﬂow. At SAP, for instance, managers trained in it

performed twice as well (at increasing their ratings on leadership trust)

as a control group of managers did. And in a cross-organizational study

spanning diverse industries, roles, and levels, more than 100 executives

who adopted leadership-in-ﬂow saw their ability to achieve successful

outcomes—measured by whether they attained their performance goals

—rise by an average of 135% within six weeks. Our ﬁndings reveal that

people have an innate capacity for exemplary leadership far beyond

# what many realize.

How exactly do you activate your inner core? In this article, for the ﬁrst

time, I introduce a playbook of quick actions people can use to tap into

## it and unlock peak performance under real-time pressure—precisely

when it matters the most.

Before diving into the speciﬁcs, however, let’s examine the fundamental

# shift that leadership-in-ﬂow entails.

# A Dynamic State

It’s a common organizational practice to evaluate people along a bell

## curve, rating every individual as a low, average, or high performer. In

fact, each of us is the whole bell curve. As a wave of scientiﬁc ﬁndings

shows, the personality and behavior of someone will change with the

context that person is in, the thoughts and feelings that individual is

experiencing, and who else is present. Someone may be extroverted in

one situation, introverted in another; agreeable in one, disagreeable in

another. That’s why leadership is not a static trait—it is a dynamic state.

But one thing remains constant: When we’re “triggered”—emotionally

upset—we tend to underperform. Conversely, when we’re “centered”

—calm, attuned, and open—we’re more likely to achieve high

performance. This happens when we’re connected to our inner core. We

## transcend ego, attachments, insecurities, impulses, and everyday habits

—like interrupting others or appearing agreeable while actually feeling

resistant—and act in a way that’s best for the cause we’re serving.

But a number of things can prevent executives from achieving this

state. First, they often walk into pivotal moments feeling stressed—

either about other things going on in their lives or about the very

situation they’re confronting. Second, they simply don’t see the greater

possibilities their situation oﬀers—to build trust, resolve conﬂict,

inspire a beaten-down team, and so on. Third, once they’re in a

situation they react in habitual, ﬁxed ways instead of observing the

dynamics among people and responding agilely. And last, they focus

## all their preparation for key events on functional and technical details

while paying little to no heed to the human dimension—to adapting

## themselves to the needs and styles of the people in the room.

Leadership-in-ﬂow is designed to overcome those obstacles. Through it

people activate the inner core not just in themselves but also in those

they work with, by drawing on energies they already possess.

# The Core Energies

Our leadership model, which builds on both ancient wisdom and

contemporary science, focuses on ﬁve types of energy:

- Purpose (committed to a noble cause)

- Wisdom (calm and receptive to the truth)

- Growth (curious and open to learning)

- Love (connected with those you work with and serve)

- Self-realization (centered in a joyful spirit)

Across all the exemplary leadership moments we studied, people

consistently used a small set of actions to tap into one or more of these

ﬁve energies. The actions were swift and straightforward, often taking

just seconds. Our analysis revealed that 25 actions—four to seven for

each type of energy—showed up regularly. (I’ll describe some of them in

the examples that follow, but you can ﬁnd a complete list in the sidebar

# “How to Achieve Leadership-in-Flow.”)

By taking these actions, leaders can break free from rigid behavioral

## scripts. One profound moment in the history of the Cold War illustrates

# how.

## On December 16, 1984, British prime minister Margaret Thatcher hosted

Mikhail Gorbachev, a member of the Soviet Politburo who was seen as

a potential future leader of the country, at what ended up being a ﬁve-

hour lunch at Chequers, the prime minister’s country home. Thatcher

wasted no time in ﬁring the ﬁrst salvo, stating, “I want there to be no

misunderstanding between us….I hate communism.”

“Very quickly, the argument between Margaret and me became very

heated,” Gorbachev later recalled, according to Jonathan Aitken’s book

Margaret Thatcher: Power and Personality. “She was accusing the Soviet

Union of all sorts of unfair things. I did not accuse Britain of anything.”

The two turned their backs to each other in the middle of lunch, and

Gorbachev’s wife, Raisa, stunned by Thatcher’s attack, indicated to her

husband, “It’s over!” For a moment Gorbachev thought they should

# leave.

And then something remarkable happened. Gorbachev centered

himself and considered his intentions in meeting Thatcher. “We are

guests here; the conversation must continue,” he thought. He reframed

the situation in his mind from “She’s attacking my government!” to

“She’s promoting her principles.”

“Mrs. Thatcher,” Gorbachev said. “I know you are a person with an acute

mind and high personal principles. Please bear in mind that I am the

same kind of person.” She responded with a nod. He then continued,

“Let me assure you that I have not come here with instructions from

the Politburo to persuade you to become a member of the Communist

Party.” Thatcher burst into laughter. “The tension was broken,” recalled

Gorbachev, “and the discussion continued, although it soon [heated] up

# again but in better ways.”

The meeting proved to be a turning point in the Cold War. It convinced

## Thatcher—and subsequently, the U.S. president Ronald Reagan—that

Gorbachev, in contrast to past Soviet leaders, was a man they could work

with. “I actually rather liked him,” Thatcher later told Reagan.

Gorbachev himself reﬂected, “It was then, during that talk in Chequers,

that the special relationship was born….We worked closely and fruitfully

together to advance the important processes of that time—curbing the

arms race, European developments, German uniﬁcation, and reversing

# Iraq’s aggression in the Middle East.”

Was Gorbachev in that pivotal moment of impasse at lunch having

a crucial conversation with Thatcher? Inﬂuencing her? Inspiring her?

Giving feedback? Building trust? Changing her behavior? He was quite

evidently engaging in all those traditional leadership activities. Yet in

that moment, he was focused on one thing—activating the inner core in

himself and in Thatcher. He did so with a few simple actions.

In emphasizing leadership in the moment, I don’t want to minimize the importance of crafting a planned approach beforehand.

First, he established a positive intention and tapped into purpose by

reaffirming and reexpressing his reasons for meeting with Thatcher

and deciding to stay and reengage with her. Second, he showed

wisdom by creating the right frame—by looking at the situation more

constructively. Third, he evoked love by showing appreciation for her

acute mind and her high personal principles and establishing an

affiliation with her—stating that he was the same kind of person. Last,

instead of criticizing her for trying to convert him, he showed her how

amusing it would be to her if he were trying to convert her, sparking

joy (self-realization). Those actions instantly changed the tone of the

meeting and helped him switch his leadership style from arguing to

# bridging.

Like Gorbachev, we all have more than one style. By drawing on our

core energies, we can pull away from a limiting identiﬁcation with

any particular style and adapt to the present moment. It is worth

noting, however, that leadership-in-ﬂow does not work by faking it.

If Gorbachev hadn’t ﬁrst truly felt admiration for Thatcher’s acute

mind and her principles, Thatcher probably would have sensed from

his demeanor that he wasn’t being genuine and would have responded

# much more coolly.

Most of us already have experience with the actions that activate

the core energies. We all, for instance, show appreciation and build aﬃliations in everyday life (though it might not occur to many of us

to use these actions if we were in Gorbachev’s situation). The neural

pathways for these actions are present in most people’s brains. Since it’s

much easier to activate existing pathways than to build pathways from

scratch, leadership-in-ﬂow is accessible to everyone—people in all roles

# and at all levels.

Moreover, as Gorbachev’s story shows, the energies and actions can be

harnessed to advance traditional leadership skills. Because they’re like a

standardized set of building blocks, their use can help radically simplify

# competence-focused training.

Getting into the Flow

When great athletes are in a ﬂow state their achievements look eﬀortless

## —yet of course everything in their daily routines (from training to

warm-ups to postmatch analyses) is intentional. The same is true

with leadership. Indeed, in emphasizing leadership in the moment, I

don’t want to minimize the importance of crafting a planned approach

beforehand (to increase the chances of reaching the right state) and

afterward (to learn from the experience and improve).

I advise executives to begin by targeting a speciﬁc upcoming event,

like a board presentation or a negotiation, and homing in on a single

objective, whether it’s building urgency, gaining buy-in, resolving

conﬂict, or inspiring peak performance. Having no concrete goal or

juggling too many goals can hinder a ﬂow state. Executives should

then replace any negative emotions or beliefs about that situation

with a positive intention. If, for example, you are feeling unmotivated

about a proposal-review meeting with your CFO because you believe

she’s already decided against funding your request, you could set your

intention to be “I will draw out my CFO’s perspective and points of

resistance, build greater understanding between us, and prepare the

## conditions for a strong long-term partnership with her.”

Research shows that our intentions inﬂuence our emotions, thoughts,

## and perceptions, and that those in turn inﬂuence our behavior.

When you believe other participants in a meeting won’t respect your

perspective, or that a subordinate won’t be happy with your feedback,

or that one party will have to lose for the other to win, you’ll be less

likely to engage in behaviors that build trust, open people’s minds, and

# deepen understanding.

Next, I tell executives to pick three to ﬁve actions they can take to

advance their goal for the event. They should base their choices on the

energies they’re most drawn to and the context they’re in. To resolve

a conﬂict, for example, they may activate wisdom by fusing opposing viewpoints, or they may activate love by empathizing and aﬃliating.

Leadership-in-ﬂow does not require a ﬁxed sequence of actions in any

situation; executives should pick suitable actions that feel authentic to

# them.

Consider how Adrian, a physician, resolved a disruptive situation

that occurred at his hospital when the administration suddenly

mandated a daily morning huddle for clinicians and staﬀ without

consulting them. The clinicians and staﬀ were deeply upset because

the huddle was held during patient appointment hours, and they felt

it would negatively aﬀect patient care. As a member of the operations

committee, Adrian decided to intervene. He asked the administration

to put the program on hold for a week. He began with an action that

activates wisdom: understand before you act. By holding conversations

## with administrators about their motivations and with clinicians and

staﬀ about the complications they were experiencing, he discovered

that top hospital systems had implemented similar huddles and found

they greatly improved communication and workﬂow and created a

sense of community. He then convened a meeting of the clinicians

and staﬀ. He set the tone by expressing appreciation (thereby creating

love energy) for the tremendous sacriﬁces people were making. He then

drew on purpose by appealing to the values and purpose of those present

by reminding them of their collective commitment to providing the best

patient care. Next he took two more actions that lead to wisdom: He

created the right frame by helping people switch from an “us versus

them” attitude to jointly looking for the best path forward, and he fused

opposing points of view by getting the two sides to see the value of

not just doing their work well but also coming together to share, learn,

and connect. It worked. “I received several text messages and emails,”

he recounts, “acknowledging how I had been able to turn around the

situation and bridge the divide.”

Once executives have chosen the actions they’ll undertake, they should

spend ﬁve to 10 minutes before the event reviewing them and the

intention they have set and taking time to center themselves. (There

are any number of practices people can use to do this, such as deep

breathing or a brief meditation.) As part of this they should spend two

minutes visualizing how they’ll perform each chosen action. Our data

shows that people who engage in such visualizations are 70% more

likely to succeed at their goals. “It’s like the warm-up that athletes

do before a game to perform better and avoid injury,” a key account

director at IBM told us. “We executives too need to warm up our minds

prior to events to think better and to prevent meetings from going in the

# wrong direction.”

Such preparation also frees up more of the brain’s executive system

—the frontal lobes—to deal with evolving dynamics, allowing people

to adapt quickly as conditions change. They can use whatever action

makes the most sense to them, moment by moment, shifting toward

# diﬀerent energies as the event unfolds.

At one ﬁnancial services company, tensions were running high on

the analytics team of an executive called Roger. It was getting a

lot of assignments but didn’t have a good process for prioritizing

them. Deadlines were being missed, and teammates were blaming

one another, much to Roger’s irritation. He decided to bring the team

together for a conversation. To put aside his negative emotions, he set

the intention “I will create positive energy and rally the team around my

vision.” He started the meeting by showing empathy and appreciation. “I understand how diﬃcult it has been these last few weeks,” he

said. “I recognize how hard you all have been working, despite these

obstacles.” The love energy these actions released helped put his team

at ease. Sensing an opening, he switched to activating growth energy by

soliciting advice, inviting the team members to share their perspectives

on the challenges they faced. Seeing that some were nervous, he gently

nudged them and thoughtfully probed. As team members got more

comfortable sharing their perspectives, one suggested that they start

saying no to new requests, while another pushed back because that

would compromise their objective of being a responsive team. Roger

fused these opposing viewpoints by proposing that they become better

at setting and resetting expectations about deliverables and deadlines

with their internal clients. “Every person in the room felt personally

accountable, engaged, and invested,” he recalls. As a result, valuable

ideas emerged about how the team should prioritize work, and the

chronic delays were alleviated.

Sometime after an event, executives should do a postmortem to assess

how well it went, how successful they were at meeting their goals and

using the chosen actions, and what they learned from it. Even when

things don’t turn out as desired, this practice can produce valuable

insights. As a vice president of business development at Wilton Re told

us, postmortems have helped him “translate instances of ‘failure’ into

opportunities for growth,” allowing him to ﬁnd pride in moments when

he honored his intention and tied it to his values.

# Building Success upon Success

In our cross-organizational study, we saw that the performance of the

more than 100 executives who were practicing leadership-in-ﬂow for

six weeks kept improving from one event to the next. As I’ve noted, by

the end their ability to achieve their goals had more than doubled on

average, even though the objectives, context, and other parties involved

in each event diﬀered. We believe this is because of the consistency of

## the building blocks—the ﬁve core energies and 25 actions. As executives

become more experienced at using them, they can eﬀectively apply

# them in a wide variety of situations.

These ﬁndings align with research on expert performance showing

that experts are more eﬀective at organizing information—something

psychologists call “chunking”—in their disciplines than novices are.

Experts recognize structures that novices do not, are able to both take

## a high-level view and observe detailed nuances in a situation, and can

transfer their chunking strategies more eﬀortlessly to new contexts.

Similarly, our research shows that executives who are experienced

with leadership-in-ﬂow can tune in to the energies in the room while

others may only see outer behaviors; can see situations both from the

## high-level, ﬁve-energy perspective and from the more-nuanced actions

perspective; and can transfer their ability to harness the core energies

# from one context to another.

Robin, a senior manager at a professional services ﬁrm, was assigned by

her employer to take on a challenging client project in which multiple

deliverables were due under a tight deadline. In preparing for her ﬁrst

meeting with the clients, Robin decided to focus on activating wisdom

by creating the right frame and love by acting/expressing thoughtfully

(bringing a deep sense of caring to how you make tough decisions and

communicate hard truths). Though she had received training on acting/

expressing thoughtfully, she learned about creating the right frame in

the midst of her preparation, when reviewing the 25 actions.

“The meeting got oﬀ to a surprisingly rocky start,” Robin later recalled.

“The clients started to give negative feedback on another project, and

that threatened to derail the conversation.” Robin’s normal response to

such criticism would have been to defend her organization’s work and

to engage in problem-solving on the issues raised. Instead, she decided

in real time to draw on wisdom by disarming (ﬁnding something true in what an opposing party is saying and aﬃrming it), an action she had

used in earlier contexts, by agreeing with the clients that their concerns

were important and assuring them that her team would look into them.

Seeing the clients calm down, she brought them back to the purpose of

their meeting, emphasizing how crucial it was to give full attention to

the issues they needed to resolve. She positioned it as an opportunity for

the two teams to hammer out details now to avoid problems later. She

was able to get the meeting back on track and to get agreement on what

her team and the clients would do to complete the project successfully.

Leadership-in-ﬂow makes it easy for executives to expand their arsenal

of actions over time, as Robin did. Our analysis has revealed that once

they start practicing leadership-in-ﬂow, executives perform just as well

with actions they’ve picked up during event preparation as they do

with actions they’ve been trained on at a workshop. This is because the

actions are simple, and the neural pathways needed to use most of them

are already present in us.

. . .

In our early years, we associate learning with structured classrooms and

set curriculums. Yet as we navigate the complexities of work and life, it

becomes evident that some of our most profound breakthroughs emerge

when we are “in the ﬂow”—when we immerse ourselves in real-world

experiences and challenges, respond in real time as conditions change,

and tap into virtues and energies already present in our core.

Losing touch with the ﬁve energies amid life’s whirlwind is natural,

but rekindling them is within our reach. All we need to do is focus on

a goal, open our hearts and minds to new possibilities, and select the

right actions that will activate our inner core—that state from which

# remarkable performance arises.

# How to Achieve Leadership-in-Flow

Leadership is not a set of traits to be learned; it is a state that can be

attained by establishing a positive intention and then activating five core

energies we all possess, via quick actions that take just a few seconds to

execute. Below are 25 actions that you can use to tap your core energies.

## Purpose Energy: Committed to a Noble Cause

- 1. Appeal to values and purpose. Discover and understand people’s dearly

held values and purpose and then tie them to what you’re seeking.

- 2. Reaffirm and reexpress. When facing an unexpected change or a

setback, find a way to reapply your core values and purpose to the new

# situation.

- 3. Embark on a hero’s journey. Craft a compelling vision that inspires

people to pursue a goal despite tough challenges.

- 4. Push, pull, pause, pivot. When you run into resistance, find a way to

move forward by refining your idea and then presenting it again; shelving

it if the costs are too high; waiting for changes that might renew interest

in it; or reimagining it altogether.

## Wisdom Energy: Calm and Receptive to the Truth

- 5. Understand before you act. Approach an issue with heightened

curiosity, and fully explore it before making your move.

- 6. Disarm. When you encounter disagreement, find something true in what

the other party is saying and affirm it.

- 7. Fuse opposing viewpoints. Find a way to integrate contradictory

positions into a more nuanced and balanced perspective. For instance,

if team members disagree about the quality of their presentation, their

manager might point out that while the presentation was analytically

persuasive, it overlooked building an emotional connection.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Leading in the Flow of Work

- 8. Dial an emotion up or down. Intensify positive feelings or dampen

negative ones to bring out the best in yourself and others. Sensing rising

frustration in a team meeting, a manager can shift the conversation to

past successes and team strengths before turning people’s attention

# back to the debate.

- 9. Direct emotional energy. Harness the energy your feelings are

producing to advance your purpose. For instance, use the pain of defeat

to motivate a team to practice with greater discipline.

- 10. Untwist your thinking. Eliminate distorted thoughts so that you can see

the situation in a clear, objective light. No, a presentation wasn’t a “total

# disaster.”

- 11. Create the right frame. Describe challenges, opportunities, and

assignments in a way that brings out the best in people.

## Growth Energy: Curious and Open to Learning

- 12. Practice a growth mindset. Recognize the vast untapped potential that

# exists in you and others.

- 13. Solicit advice. Gain a deeper understanding of others’ perspectives by

asking experts and stakeholders to openly share their thoughts.

- 14. Acknowledge, apologize, address. Swiftly acknowledge, apologize for,

# and correct mistakes.

- 15. Learn from adversity. Use setbacks and failures to help you and others

become better—not bitter.

- 16. Anticipate, assess, adjust. Think about the challenges that may lie

ahead and plan how you will evaluate and adapt to them.

## Love Energy: Connected with Those You Work with and Serve

- 17. Appreciate. Recognize positive qualities in situations and people.

- 18. Affiliate. Find common ground with others.

- 19. Deepen human connection. Create strong emotional bonds with others

by accepting and offering bids for connection.

## 20.Empathize. Attune yourself, without judgment, to the emotions and

thoughts of others, and make them feel understood.

- 21. Act/express thoughtfully. Bring a deep sense of caring to how you

make tough decisions and communicate hard truths.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Leading in the Flow of Work

## Self-Realization Energy: Centered in a Joyful Spirit

22.Get centered. Step back from your thoughts and feelings and focus on

# the tranquility deep inside you.

23.Affirm a core identity. Help people see a positive quality as already

being present at their core. For example, a manager might say,

“Remember how composed you were at your last presentation? That

is an intrinsic quality I’ve seen you possess. Tap into it, and this meeting

will go smoothly.”

## 24.Cultivate intuition. Generate creative insights on critical issues by

inducing a relaxed state of mind, for example, by taking a walk or

# meditating.
