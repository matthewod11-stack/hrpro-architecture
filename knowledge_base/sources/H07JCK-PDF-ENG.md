“They’re just not doing their job,” grumbled an executive in a group one

of us (Amii) was recently facilitating. She was resentful over what she

viewed as a lack of productivity on her team.

Being a leader has always been challenging, but manager stress and

burnout is rising: A November 2021 Gallup survey found that 35% of

people managers reported feeling burned out “very often or always,” as

compared to 27% of individual contributors and 22% of leaders.

When it’s a constant mental strain to get the work done, managers may

have a short fuse. When expectations aren’t met, the brain short-circuits

# to judgment and reaction.

This is exactly the opposite of what your employees need. In healthy

workplace cultures, leaders know how to balance accountability for

results with empathy. One way to do this is to aim for reﬂection instead of reaction. If you’re playing the long game, how you achieve goals is going to get you further than what you achieve short-term.

Employees who feel they can learn and grow are more engaged.

Receiving developmental feedback is also critical to development.

Our call to action is for leaders to take a pause and reﬂect before the

pressure of high demands leads to lashing out. When frustration and

judgment hovers, cultivate curiosity and ask yourself the following six

questions. They will serve as your north star checklist to make sure

you’re centering empathy in your attempts to encourage performance.

- 1. Have I been clear about expected work outcomes?

Leaders often underestimate the need to communicate. Reﬂect on how

eﬀectively you’ve shared your expectations when it comes to roles,

deliverables, support, and results. Identifying what success looks like

## for a particular project in terms of quality and desired impact can

enable others to organize their time, energy, and other resources more

# eﬀectively.

Frequent communication is helpful in communicating a clear vision.

Helping team members understand how their unique contribution

supports business outcomes can energize an employee’s sense of

purpose. It may also save valuable time by preventing confusion down

the line. And you should always check in with your employee to assess

how clearly your message has been understood.

- 2. Are my expectations reasonable?

Consider the assignment and compare it with similar work you’ve

delegated in the past. Is the current project adequately resourced? If

not, you may need to ﬁnd additional resources or scale back your own

# expectations.

Is it a stretch assignment, intended to be a challenge or stimulate the

employee’s growth? If yes, you may need to provide more guidance

and mentoring. Consider whether you’ve made yourself available

for questions and any necessary approvals. Assess the timeline and

whether the person is adequately supported to meet expectations.

- 3. What do I know to be true about this employee?

When you’re frustrated with an individual’s performance, take a step

back and remember the whole person. Assess their knowledge, skills,

and abilities. Reﬂect on their strengths and areas for growth. Some

people may enjoy and do better with greater autonomy, while others

prefer more communication, support, and connection.

If you notice a downturn in performance, have a direct and kind

conversation to ﬁnd out what’s going on. There may be personal events

at play, such as an ailing family member, a breakup, or additional

caregiving responsibilities. In your check-ins, make sure you are

focused on listening. Ask about their experience with the work at hand,

and assess whether they understand your expectations. Feelings of

stress and overwhelm may require a diﬀerent kind of support than on-

- 4. Am I managing to results?

Successful managers focus on outcomes, not how or when the work gets

done. We all possess unique working styles and preferences. Your way

may not be the natural route for others, so beware of the bias towards

# your own style.

Micromanaging means we’re impinging on our employee’s autonomy,

which is a core psychological need. By outlining a clear vision for

results, you enable employees to either take the lead or to elicit more

guidance. Ensure that you’ve connected the outcomes you’re seeking

to the company’s larger vision and goals. People want to feel they are

doing meaningful work and aligning purpose between the individual

and organization can boost engagement.

- 5. Am I holding everyone to the same standard?

Despite our best intentions, unconscious bias can cause us to favor

some people over others. Understanding the uniqueness of the

employee at hand, consider whether you’re holding all team members to

the same standard. Are you tougher on men, women, or people of color?

Do you invest time equally in your team’s development? Do you make

assumptions based on age? Having clarity on results can also help you

avoid unconscious bias. If you’re unsure whether you are being fair, you

can also talk with a trusted colleague to get their view on the situation.

Another bias to be aware of is proximity bias, which describes how

managers can be more inclined to favor those who are physically closer

to them. If you work in a hybrid environment, do you give preference in work assignments to people who come to the oﬃce more often? Note

that proximity bias disproportionately impacts women and caregivers.

- 6. Am I providing actionable feedback that is clear, firm, and kind?

If you have concerns or criticism of the work, don’t delay your feedback.

Research shows that feedback is best given in the ﬂow of work. Reach

out as soon as a potential misalignment appears. It’s much better to

catch it early, and not let issues fester.

## Also solicit feedback from your employee about their experience on

the assignment. Alignment and candid conversations build trust and

commitment with your employees. Employees who feel supported

## by their boss experience the greatest job satisfaction, and companies

with high-trust workplace cultures perform nearly two times better

than those without. Plus, you may gain information that changes your

perspective on how the project is going.

. . .

Self-reﬂection takes discipline and time — and the investment is

worth the reward. Companies with managers who cultivate strong

relationships with their employees experience higher loyalty, trust,

productivity, and joy. Use these reﬂection questions as a guide to

bridge any gaps in your expectations. Making the conscious decision

to drive performance from empathy is the diﬀerence between the true

competitive advantage — discretionary eﬀort — and punching the

clock. These actions diﬀerentiate managers from leaders.
