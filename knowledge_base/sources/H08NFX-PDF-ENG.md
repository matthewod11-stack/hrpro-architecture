With a series of executive orders, the Trump administration has put a

target on corporate diversity, equity, and inclusion policies. As of this

writing, key portions have been enjoined by a federal court. Yet the

administration has signaled its intention to make noncompliance so

punitive that many companies still are scrambling to review their DEI

## programs and practices for EO compliance.

In the rush, two key facts are getting lost in the shuﬄe. The ﬁrst is

that core federal and state equal employment opportunity (EEO) laws

have not changed. Trump’s executive orders did end federal contractor aﬃrmative action programs, and Trump can direct federal employees

to take certain actions against “illegal” DEI policies and programs. But

what is “illegal” under core EEO laws today hasn’t changed from before President Trump took oﬃce. This highlights that what companies are

concerned about is not entirely legal risk, but regulatory and litigation

# risk.

The second core fact is that companies have a First Amendment right to express their views on DEI. This right was aﬃrmed in the spring of 2024

## by a conservative-leaning panel of judges of the Eleventh Circuit, which

struck down Florida’s prohibiting companies from expressing certain

# ideas in DEI trainings.

## But with Attorney General Pam Bondi’s February 5th memo directing

the Justice Department’s Civil Rights Division “to investigate,

eliminate, and penalize illegal DEI and DEIA preferences, mandates,

policies, programs, and activities in the private sector,” leaders are

understandably and urgently looking for guidance on how to pursue

## their lawful, fair, and business-driven DEI initiatives.

The clearest guidance thus far has been largely overlooked. In

various comments to employer and student groups, Equal Employment

## Opportunity Commission (EEOC) Acting Chair Andrea Lucas has

illuminated the kinds of measures she considers appropriate. This is

signiﬁcant because the EEOC will play a central role in enforcing the

administration’s views.* Lucas has unsurprisingly warned companies to

avoid rules that base decisions on race or gender, but she has expressed

- Standardizing interview questions, promotion criteria, and hiring

# policies

- Removing “culture ﬁt” from hiring and promotion practices

- Widening the pool of applicants by expanding colleges and

geographical areas where you recruit

- Conducting regular audits to identify potential areas of legal risk

## A less-direct but still helpful source of hints about the administration’s

position can be found in complaints ﬁled by America First Legal, founded by Stephen Miller (currently Trump’s deputy chief of staﬀ). (An

important note: Filing a complaint does not necessarily mean America

Legal’s legal theory will prevail.)

Using these two sources as guidance, we’ll assess the risk levels of

common corporate DEI policies and programs. We’ll also look at the

research on what actually works to deliver concrete gains toward a fairer

# and more diverse workplace.

Diverse-slate requirements and diversity goals are risky and often ineffective.

These two common DEI practices have been targeted in complaints

## ﬁled by America First Legal with the Equal Employment Opportunity

# Commission.

Most current corporate diversity goals are very diﬀerent from quotas,

which have long been illegal. Yet even lawful aspirational goals may

well be targeted in the current environment, even if they were carefully

framed to ensure their legality. Nevertheless, they may not be worth hanging onto, because these goals are often ineﬀective. One inﬂuential

study found that managerial diversity goals alone didn’t predict

increased diversity.

Diverse slate requirements, which compel organizations to interview a

speciﬁed number of women or people of color for open roles, also are in

the crosshairs. Are they worth going to the mat for? Maybe not.

The most well-known example of this requirement is the NFL’s Rooney

Rule, which requires a diverse slate of candidates for head coach,

general manager, and other executive positions. Studies in 2021 and

2023 found that the onset of the rule did not consistently increase

the number of head coaches of color. Earlier studies suggest why:

White coaches lower down the chain are twice as likely to be promoted as Black coaches, with the diﬀerential promotion rate occurring both

before and after the Rooney Rule was put in place.

Targeted professional development programs present risks—but ones that are easy to minimize.

Many companies have professional development programs that oﬀer

skills- and network-building to speciﬁc groups—for example, through

## internships or fellowships, employee resource groups (ERGs), and

sponsorship/mentorship programs. These programs are important

because the single strongest predictor of who’s in your network is

similarity—like likes like. This means women and people of color

are often excluded from the kinds of mentorship, sponsorship, and

leadership opportunities that are crucial to job success.

A recent Supreme Court decision made these programs easier to

challenge under federal law. This week, the Supreme Court heard oral

arguments in Ames v. Ohio Department of Youth Services, a case that may

make these programs even more vulnerable in the near future.

Luckily, companies can sharply lower their risk proﬁle in several

ways by reviewing and evolving these programs. The basic principle

is to ensure that professional development isn’t limited to race- and

gender-based employee resource groups (ERGs). One possibility is to

provide programming tailored to a wide range of groups, from introverts to neurodivergent employees. Another is to oﬀer multiple avenues

## for professional development—for example, through both programs

targeted to speciﬁc populations and to all employees through the

company’s learning platforms. Also advisable is to open up ERGs and

similar initiatives to any person who wishes to participate, provided

they support the group’s goals. If handled well, this can enhance program eﬀectiveness.

Internships and fellowships limited to speciﬁc groups based on race

or gender also are easy to reframe. America First Legal sued several

law ﬁrms with fellowship programs but dropped those suits when the

ﬁrms redeﬁned the programs as open to everyone with a demonstrated

# commitment to diversity and inclusion.

Another alternative is to do what has worked at the University of

California system: Ask candidates to describe in an essay the challenges

they have faced, and how they have overcome them. This approach

sends the inclusive message that the goal is to address disadvantage

experienced by any group. It also reaches ﬁrst-generation professionals,

which Acting Chair Lucas has recommended.

It’s not illegal to use the term “DEI,” but you can consider alternatives.

Companies are acutely aware that anything named DEI, DEIB (diversity,

equity, inclusion, and belonging) or DEIA (diversity, equity, inclusion,

and accessibility) will show up in searches for potential targets for litigation or government enforcement eﬀorts—even if the programs are

lawful and compliant with EEO laws. Some companies have shifted

from using the phrase “DEI” to “belonging,” on the theory that creating

an environment where a broad range of talent can thrive is not illegal—

which is true. Other companies, concerned about employee reaction,

have told us they have no intention of changing the name of their

initiatives. The decision depends on your appetite for reputational and

# regulatory risk.

More risk-averse companies, including those worried about government

contracts, may want to avoid the standard buzz words. Other options

include “meritocracy initiative” (“merit” has been used by Acting EEOC

Chair Lucas) or “culture initiative.” The most risk-averse alternative is to

call your DEI initiative “organizational and professional development”

or use terminology related to engagement or talent.

The drawback to these name changes is potential loss of focus: An

inﬂuential study found that the single most impactful DEI measure is

to make DEI a part of someone’s job. So if your company chooses a

more generic name, make sure you preserve as part of someone’s job

description the mandate to work toward a true meritocracy that avoids

special treatment of any one group—and make sure you mean it.

Maladroit DEI trainings can be risky, but competent trainings are far less so.

Training is important because people can’t interrupt bias if they don’t

know what it looks like. But trainings that focus only on race or gender

with buzzwords like “white fragility” and “patriarchy” run the risk of

## reverse-discrimination lawsuits and regulatory attention under state

anti-DEI statutes. Research has also found that this type of training, commonly oﬀered in the 1990s and early 2000s, often failed to reduce

# bias.

# A Low-Risk Approach That Works

The good news is that the most eﬀective programs are also the programs

that, Lucas’s guidelines suggest, carry the lowest legal risk. These focus

on changing structures, not people and produce progress toward DEI

## goals in hiring, performance management, access to opportunities, and

# culture.

Experiments performed by the Equality Action Center (EAC) (where two

of us, Joan and Jamie, work and Laura is on the board) have shown that

well-designed training can dramatically decrease key forms of bias. The

EAC has performed “bias interrupter” experiments across a wide variety of industries, using an approach that aligns with the guidance oﬀered by

# EEOC Acting Chair Lucas by:

- Using audits to root out bias or inequity in current processes to ensure

## equal employment opportunity for all employees

- Standardizing decision-making to ensure that it’s evidence-based and

# consistent

- Building mechanisms to spot and correct for factors like “culture ﬁt”

that can embed bias

This approach has produced documented, year-over-year progress in

more than a dozen companies. For example, a manufacturing company

wanted to level the playing ﬁeld with respect to hiring. We helped them shift hiring managers to structured rubrics and ratings and oﬀer

managers a workshop on what hiring bias looks like, with concrete

ways to interrupt it. The numbers of women and people of color who received job oﬀers sharply increased. An energy company identiﬁed

a 13-point disparity in men’s and women’s access to career-enhancing

core technical opportunities. We worked with them to build a workshop

to ensure fair access to opportunities as well as a tasking tool that

kept track of who did what. The result was that in just a few months,

the company equalized access to the core technical work. A third

example: We worked with a consumer goods organization that was

worried that bias was embedded in its performance management. We

helped them shift to a system that ranked people on competencies,

backed up by two to three pieces of evidence, and oﬀered managers a workshop on fair and eﬀective feedback. This reduced a key form of

performance-evaluation bias by 19 points—and, in addition, increased

the number of employees who received evidence-based feedback for

## every demographic group by an average of 44 points.

Take a deep breath. We can do this. There’s a low-risk model that

actually works.
