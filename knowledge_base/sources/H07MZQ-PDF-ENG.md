While in a meeting, I (Ben) felt my phone buzz in my pocket. My heart

skipped a beat, sweat slowly beading on my forehead. I closed my eyes

and hoped that it wasn’t a dreaded call from school. It was. I excused

myself from the meeting and stepped out into the hallway. As expected,

my kid’s school was having diﬃculty with them and needed me to pick

them up. I popped back in to apologize for leaving early and joined the

rest of the meeting from my phone as I jogged to the train station to get

# back home.

This had happened nearly a dozen times over the past few months. Six

months later my child would be out of the public school system.

Parents of neurodivergent children — which both of us are —

experience personal challenges that are diﬃcult to explain. There are

many reasons for this — the lack of (especially accurate) representation

## of neurodiversity in the media, the myth of the “perfect” family, the

pressure to be the “perfect” parent or to have the “perfect” child,

the social media illusion. But it all comes down to it often being too

exhausting to get into explanations at work on top of everything else we

are dealing with. Some of us summarize these experiences with words

like “autism” or “developmentally delayed,” but if someone hasn’t dealt

with these issues, they really have no idea what those words mean.

These personal challenges also mean that parents of neurodivergent

kids bring new abilities to their work beyond job-related skills, forged in

the crucible of an atypical parenting situation. In terms of planning and

time management, we are experts at forecasting successful timelines,

and are hypervigilant against obstacles to a team’s goals.

If we are to use these skills and thrive in the workplace, colleagues

need to more deeply understand our parenting situation. In personal

contexts, a lack of understanding can be annoying: friends who get

angry when we miss an appointment to deal with a meltdown at

home, diﬃculty ﬁnding babysitters, everyone’s unsolicited advice on

something we never said was a problem. In work contexts, however,

parenting a neurodivergent child can be debilitating. We need more

support. We need more ﬂexibility. We do not need yet another ﬁght.

Organizations need to provide systems and processes to help employees

more easily integrate their work and parenting challenges while also

recognizing the profound asset these parents are to the workforce.

There’s no way around it: parenting neurodivergent kids is a challenge.

Even though we have advanced as a society in creating better

understanding of the spectrum of neurodiversity, it still is not well-

resourced or given social priority. Finding basic services can be

## challenging. In the U.S., the quality of care and availability of support

services can swing wildly from state to state and city to city.

Unsurprisingly, these factors cause parents of neurodivergent children

to drop out of the workforce at very high rates. This is often because

one parent needs to provide full-time support to their child, especially if the family can’t aﬀord adequate care. Organizations must take it upon

themselves, both from a moral and performance perspective, to step in

to ensure that these parents get the support they need to stay — and

# ﬂourish — in the workforce.

# The Neurodivergent Parenting Experience

Working while parenting a neurodivergent child can be wildly

unpredictable. Depending on how the child presents, the necessary

care can vary widely in time requirement, magnitude, variability, and

frequency. In some cases, it means some days an employee has to call

in to meetings without video because they need to be physically near

their child the entire day. In others, most days might not require any

considerations, but on others, parents will need to step out with little

notice. This is not a reﬂection of the parent’s commitment to work or,

in many cases, their ability to be productive and meet goals. Rather, it is a demonstration that they also have time commitments to their families to support and care for the unique and diﬀerent abilities of

# their children.

My (Kalifa’s) son was diagnosed educationally just before he turned

3, and medically, just after. He was a bubbly baby who reached most

developmental milestones really quickly. He was a funny little leader in

daycare. But as time passed, I noticed two things: he preferred parallel

play, meaning he didn’t really interact with his peers though they kept

trying to interact with him, and he just wouldn’t speak. He was around 2-and-a-half when I became convinced that something felt diﬀerent

about how he interacted. But as a new mother, I wasn’t sure what to look

for. The internet was not helpful (and a scary place for a new parent).

My doctor asked me to monitor him, but I was not sure what to monitor for. Most people around me shrugged it oﬀ as me being hyper-worried, insisting he would grow into it. But I knew something was diﬀerent.

Fortunately, I am a research junkie and pored over research papers,

## early intervention papers, and information on state assistance

programs. It was a taxing process. I felt overwhelmed, anxious, and

stressed. I made no mention of this at my job and kept working like

normal. I checked my company’s resources for potential help. I checked

our insurance coverage, and it was unclear that there was anything

there. So I took all my lunch breaks, early mornings, and post-work

hours to schedule appointments and in-home visits. I was spent. But

after a few months, I found him support. He started a county early

intervention program on his third birthday. Afterwards, I still didn’t feel

like I could speak about it. I didn’t fully understand the diagnosis, and

I knew there was nothing I could ﬁnd in my company that showed they

cared. I felt that my role as a parent of a neurodivergent child had no

# professional place at work.

It took me about three more years before I spoke up about what

parenting my autistic son looks like at work, but I did it because I

realized I was in a position to normalize the conversation and create

a foundation for support for anyone going through what I went through.

When I did speak up, I was overwhelmed with messages from people

sharing their own stories with me.

My (Kalifa’s) autistic son, now 8 years old, often goes through periods

where he has severe sleep issues (which can be typical with autism)

that amplify some behaviors related to autism and comorbid conditions.

This disrupts the whole family’s sleep — including his younger siblings’

— and also means I am exhausted and stressed out during my workday.

These unpredictable periods take a toll on my energy, well-being, and

# sometimes productivity at work.

Initially, I would push through to the point of complete exhaustion,

which would compound through the sleep regression period. To better

cope and minimize this impact on my performance, I learned to do

three things at work: 1) I immediately rearrange meetings when I can,

- 2) I take breaks between meetings and while doing work that requires

intense focus like writing or data analysis, and 3) I am open about my

experience. I realized that while people may not be able to completely

understand my son’s situation, they can relate to sleep issues — an

entry-point for discussion. I know the sleep regression periods are not

everyday occurrences and are ﬁnite. And I knew I could create balance between my personal and work commitments by changing how I work,

which has allowed me to better monitor my son’s needs during those

# periods.

This all means that sick days for parents like us may be to preserve our

mental health and well-being. We often have to stand in to be the only

and biggest advocate for our children. We have to have the energy to

pour into them and ﬁght systematic obstructions that refuse to give

them a chance to exist. It means intentional self-care and pouring

into ourselves to ensure there are no chinks in our battle armor. And on a very practical note, ﬁnancial support that allows us to aﬀord

therapists, both for ourselves and our children, is essential, as this

support is not always covered well by insurance, if we have it to begin

with. Without that support, parents are often left to fend for ourselves

and grind through extremely challenging situations that most people

can’t fathom. These parents are people you probably work with closely,

collaborate with, and even share a joke with every day — who have

learned to struggle silently so that they do not appear performance-

compromised at work.

Support is far more important than companies realize. Organizations

should provide additional support for parents early on in the parenting

journey that includes valid information about neurodiversity from

trusted sources. This can take the form of informational sessions,

speakers, or employee resource groups (ERGs). This won’t just

## help parents of neurodivergent children, but also neurodivergent

members of the workforce, while educating other employees about

# Supporting a Fundamental Asset

Learning how to be more inclusive is a key lesson that comes with neurodiverse parenting. It is easy to categorize people who are diﬀerent

as “them,” or to describe people we choose to other as “weird” or “odd.”

When caring for neurodivergent children, you quickly begin to better

understand the actions and behaviors that can be viewed as strengths,

and you also learn how things typically viewed as weakness and disabilities can simply be supported and viewed as diﬀerent abilities.

You learn to see past quirks and idiosyncrasies towards solutions. For

example, many autistic people are strong at pattern recognition. Many

autistic people are amazing data analysts, but they may not interview

## well because of speech and cognition delays or comorbidities such

## as anxiety or attention deﬁcit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). These

lessons that parents of neurodivergent children learn very quickly can

make them some of your best and most productive leaders.

As workforces increasingly acknowledge neurodiversity, these parents,

if they choose to, are uniquely qualiﬁed to act as a bridge

between neurodivergent and neurotypical employees and help develop

processes, systems, and programs around neurodiversity that will make

## them and the organization more successful.

Regarding time, parent-determined schedules are essential. These

schedules can be planned somewhat in advance, but some parents may

require more variability in their hours than others. This may mean that

meetings at unusual hours are actually easier for these parents; if the

kids are asleep by 9 p.m., a 9:30 meeting will be less stressful than one at

5 p.m.

While emotional support should include ﬁnancial resources — fair pay,

mental health services, and childcare support — other employees also

need to step up. Empathy and curiosity from coworkers, rather than

judgment, goes a long way towards making parents of neurodivergent

children feel safer and more engaged in their work.

When other parent coworkers deliver anecdotes about their own

experiences to try to help, they often in fact demonstrate how

uninformed they are. This can signal that sharing more challenging

parental experiences isn’t okay. Instead, it’s important to get curious

## about what a parent of a neurodivergent child experiences and maintain

an open mind. Trainings can help. Some parents, of course, may not

want to share more, and that has to be respected; in many cases, they

are still trying to process it themselves.

Supporting charitable organizations is also a nice side eﬀort, but

be sure to avoid problematic organizations such as Autism Speaks*.

When considering nonproﬁts that support neurodivergent people, look

more closely at how they advocate for their target group. Do they

include these persons in their leadership and decision-making? Do they

promote fear or understanding? Aligning with organizations that are

problematic can send the same message as doing nothing at all. In fact,

it can sometimes do more damage.

. . .

Supporting parents of neurodivergent children is diﬀerent from support

systems companies are used to, but it’s not a huge lift. These

parents have extremely valuable skills that only appreciate over time.

Supporting them is both a moral and economic imperative, especially as

more employees begin to acknowledge and identify with neurodiversity.

As always, listening to your employees with diﬀerent backgrounds,

integrating their feedback and experiences, and continuing to evolve

the organization will certainly and immensely beneﬁt it and society

overall. And if these conversations get challenging, you can be sure that

parents like us can handle it.
