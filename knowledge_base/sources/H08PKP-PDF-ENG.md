John, the CRO of a private equity-backed tech company, faced

mounting pressure to meet sky-high sales targets tied to an acquisition.

He knew the goals he was given were unachievable. Saying yes risked

burnout and failure; saying no risked his credibility.

It wasn’t just the sales targets. His company was undergoing multiple

changes at once: shifting to a SaaS model, rolling out a new CRM,

restructuring teams, and enforcing a return-to-oﬃce mandate.

John’s dilemma is now common. Change is no longer an occasional

disruption but a constant. Employees are now experiencing ﬁve times

more planned change initiatives than they did just a decade ago. Add

unrealistic goals, and the result is predictable: disengagement, burnout,

## and a sharp decline in execution—in short, widespread change fatigue.

As executive coaches, we’ve consistently seen that leaders who take

on impossible goals don’t do it because they lack judgment—they do

it because pushing back feels risky to them. Pressure from the top, a

culture of “yes,” and intense market competition make committing the

only safe choice. Many leaders also fall into the well-known traps of

optimism bias, perfectionism, or a need to prove their worth, all of

which skew their decision-making ability.

The real leadership skill is not ﬁguring out how to do it all; it’s knowing

when and how to push back. That’s where strategic refusal comes in.

Strategic refusal is a structured method to force prioritization and push

back on unrealistic demands that jeopardize team productivity, morale,

or well-being. The idea isn’t to avoid responsibility, but rather to protect

the team, maintain long-term performance, and ensure sustainable

outcomes—all while safeguarding your reputation.

Strategic refusal has two main components: a matrix to help you

determine when to act and a framework to guide you on how to act.

# The Strategic Refusal Matrix

Prioritizing work under competing demands can be diﬃcult, especially

when pushing back feels risky. The strategic refusal matrix provides a

structured way to assess whether to commit to, renegotiate, deprioritize,

or decline a request based on both strategic importance (i.e., how

critical is this initiative to long-term business success?) and execution

feasibility (i.e., do we have the capacity, resources, and timeline to execute eﬀectively?).

- Low Strategic Importance + Low Feasibility → Decline & Justify:

“This initiative is unlikely to drive meaningful results, and we don’t have the capacity to execute it eﬀectively. Let’s focus our resources on higher-priority eﬀorts.”

- High Strategic Importance + Low Feasibility → Renegotiate: “This

initiative is critical, but we don’t currently have the resources to

execute it well. Can we adjust the timeline or allocate additional

# support?”

- Low Strategic Importance + High Feasibility → Deprioritize: “While

we could execute this, it would divert focus from higher-value work.

Let’s pause this initiative and revisit it later.”

- High Strategic Importance + High Feasibility → Commit & Focus:

“This is both critical and feasible. Let’s allocate the right resources and

move forward.”

# The Strategic Refusal Framework

Once the strategic refusal matrix has helped you determine that a

request should be declined, renegotiated, or deprioritized, the next step

is execution. This is where we’ve seen leaders get stuck because they

don’t want to be perceived as diﬃcult, uncommitted, or deﬁant. The

four steps below provide a tactical approach and long-term plan for

pushing back in a way that’s constructive and strategic, protecting your

## team from change fatigue and yourself from reputational damage.

- 1. Reframe saying no.

Because a message’s framing signiﬁcantly inﬂuences how it’s received,

reframing how you present your refusal will shape whether it’s seen as

an obstacle or a demonstration of strong judgment. Framing refusal as

a leadership decision focused on impact shifts the conversation toward

having to make a choice.

Reframe refusal as prioritization. Simply saying “This initiative

will overwhelm our team and lead to missed deadlines” can be

interpreted as negativity. Connect your decision to the company’s

# strategic priorities. For example:

- “We can take this on, but only if we pause X.”

- “I want us to succeed—let’s focus on X and Y and do them well.”

Reframe the conversation from tasks to impact. Rather than

discussing what can’t be done, frame the conversation around what’s

most valuable to achieve. For example:

“If we take on this new initiative, we won’t be able to execute

some of our critical projects on time. To ensure we deliver on the

new initiative, we would need to deprioritize X or Y. What’s more

# important from your perspective?”

Key Insight: Loss aversion means people prefer avoiding losses over

gaining rewards. Therefore, reframing a refusal as avoiding negative

business consequences (like missed objectives, resource dilution, and

execution failure) is often more persuasive than focusing on personal

# capacity limits.

- 2. Show the cost of saying yes.

Senior leaders often make decisions without fully grasping operational

constraints, resources, and risks, and can fall into planning bias,

causing them to assume best-case scenarios and underestimate

challenges. Prioritization is easier when the cost of saying yes is visible

# to them.

Expose leadership to operational realities. Bringing senior leaders

into execution discussions forces them to confront the reality of

feasibility. You could suggest:

- “Let’s have leadership sit down with the teams who would execute this

to get a clear sense of timeline, risks, and capacity.”

- “Before we approve this, let’s hear from the teams executing it to

# conﬁrm feasibility.”

Expose the trade-oﬀs. Help executives weigh consequences by framing

decisions around priorities. Guide them to make informed choices by

laying out the consequences and what will be delayed, deprioritized, or

compromised. This reframes your refusal as responsible leadership. You

can say:

- “We can hit that number, but we’ll need to cut back on product

development—are we okay with that?”

- “Are we willing to accept these execution risks to achieve this new

# goal?”

Present feasible alternatives. Oﬀering what’s possible instead of

rejecting what’s not keeps you in solution mode, reinforcing your

credibility while making you appear less resistant. For example, you

might say:

- “Given our core priorities, I know my team won’t be able to launch the

new business line in six months. But we could complete the necessary

research and draft a product design to set us up for launch in the new

# year.”

- “Instead of a 40% increase now, what if we commit to 25% but make it

# sustainable?”

Key Insight: Planning bias is a product of System 1 thinking, which is

fast, conﬁdent, and overly optimistic. Slowing decisions down surfaces trade-oﬀs and sharpens strategic focus.

- 3. Build a culture of strategic refusal.

Prioritization should be a built-in process, not an individual struggle.

The most eﬀective organizations don’t leave tough decisions to

individuals alone; they build a decision-making process that embeds

discernment—normalizing questioning goals and evaluating change

initiatives before committing—into their culture. By systematizing

the process, you ensure that decisions are made deliberately and

strategically and are backed by solid data and rationale.

Implement red team reviews. Before approving any major initiative,

convene a cross-functional team to stress-test its feasibility and

evaluate its potential impact. One CEO we worked with adopted this

approach and ultimately narrowed their annual priorities from eight

to three, driving signiﬁcantly better execution. This prevented leaders

from overcommitting and helped the company focus on high-impact

# initiatives.

Conduct pre-mortems. Before committing to an initiative, conduct a

session to predict potential failure points. Ask: “If this initiative fails

in six months, why did it fail?” This forces teams to surface risks and

capacity constraints up front, which helps them create more realistic

# plans.

Establish kill criteria. For every major initiative, establish predeﬁned

signals that would trigger a pause or stop. This allows you to manage

expectations up front and reduce sunk-cost bias if conditions change.

Key Insight: Decision fatigue leads to poor prioritization. Systematizing

refusal reduces mental overload and ensures consistent execution

# quality.

- 4. Model strategic refusal.

The strongest leaders aren’t the ones who take on the most; they’re the ones who prioritize the best. The most eﬀective CEOs and executives

we’ve worked with actively want their teams to speak up when goals

are unrealistic instead of ultimately underdelivering. As one CEO put

it, “I’m always going to have more ideas, but I need my leaders to tell

me what’s possible, what’s not, and why.” Blind agreement followed by

missed delivery is the worst outcome.

Frame pushback in business terms. Frame your refusal around impact, risk, or trade-oﬀs. Do not position your refusal as a personal

bandwith issue. Executives tend to respond best when the conversation

is focused on outcomes, customer experience, or business risks. For

example, you could say:

“If we focus on solving these three core problems, we’ll make the

biggest impact for customers and the bottom line. If we spread

ourselves too thin, we risk underdelivering across the board.”

Support your case with data, not emotions. A leader in a healthcare

organization we worked with created a formal resource-planning

process to quantify what each new initiative would require. This

transparency transformed prioritization discussions, shifting them from

subjective debates to fact-based decisions. The result? Normalizing

prioritization in public and therefore setting the tone for their

# organization.

## Key Insight: Leaders with a strong decision-making process gain

credibility, whereas those who agree blindly erode trust when they

# underdeliver.

Saying yes to everything doesn’t strengthen your leadership—it

overloads it. Being able to say no when needed is what separates strong

leaders from struggling ones. Leaders who push back strategically aren’t

seen as diﬃcult but as credible decision-makers, trusted advisors, and

the ones who drive sustainable results. They don’t just work hard; they

prioritize relentlessly.
