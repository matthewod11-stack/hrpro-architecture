I believe in the importance of merit.

And that is why I advocate for inclusion.

This might seem paradoxical, but it’s not. What I really want is fairness,

which humans are generally wired to seek. Both the ideal of merit and

## HBR / Digital Article / The False Dichotomy of Merit and Inclusion

## the ideal of inclusion reach toward fairness: a system where eﬀort and

ability—not arbitrary barriers—determine success at work. Yet in our

less-than-ideal world, we’re falling short of this goal. Many stories I’ve

encountered in my global neurodiversity and disability work illustrate

# this.

Consider Brian. Brian is brilliant. He completed a double major in

computer science and math in three years. His performance on pattern-

recognition tests had previously been considered impossible. He seems

to be an ideal ﬁt for the cybersecurity jobs he’s passionate about—but

he can’t get one. Why? The typical interview format of rapid-ﬁre of

questions—including “weird” inquiries like what animal he would be or

whether he prefers golf or tennis—ﬁlters him out. Not his skill. Not his

talent. Instead, the problem is a ﬂawed hiring process with overreliance

on interviews—a measurement that lacks validity, particularly for

# autistic candidates.

He and many other skilled and talented job-seekers would have been

top candidates if the hiring criteria focused on the actual skill of

performing the job rather than performing the role of a generic

“ideal candidate”—in other words, if we actually measured merit. But

too often, interviews measure acting ability rather than the relevant

coding, accounting, or shelf-stocking skills. This means that hiring

procedures relying on interviews are generally less valid than direct skill

assessment, and that they’re particularly unfair and discriminatory for

people who are better at performing the job than appearing like they can

perform the job.

When measurement lacks validity, selecting the top candidate doesn’t

reﬂect merit. It reﬂects bias, barriers, and the lack of inclusion. We’re

not selecting the best; we’re selecting the best-ish from a narrow circle

of those fortunate to exist on a level section of the playing ﬁeld—not

those relegated to the steep slopes, who show incredible talent but are

disadvantaged in the face of bias based on class, non-English names,

gender, age, race, looks, disability, and more. People who have the

talent and skills needed to help organizations thrive are often unable

to do so because they regularly face exclusion and barriers—from

internships to promotions to pay. In fact, research shows that bias in

promotions and reward distribution is just as prevalent as bias in hiring,

exacerbating and multiplying rather than reducing unfairness in the

# span of our careers.

Caitlyn, an award-winning UX designer, knows about these barriers.

At 26, she was hit by a drunk driver, resulting in facial paralysis and diﬃculty speaking. While speaking and appearance have nothing to

do with Caitlyn’s ability to design, her job interviews—conducted by

humans or by AI trained on human biases—result in rejections. And

even as a freelancer, she’s expected to work at a deep discount because

“who will hire that face?” as she overheard one of her clients saying.

Then there’s Sophia, a top-performing data analyst who had saved her

company millions by implementing predictive analytics that helped

reduce supply chain costs and streamline operations. Despite those

accomplishments, she is repeatedly passed over for promotions, with

managers citing the need for “fresh energy”—and then asking Sophia to

train her new managers. At 56, her merit hardly means anything in the

# face of ageist bias.

The ideal of fairness will always be out of reach if merit measurement is

not inclusive and if the very deﬁnition of merit is misunderstood.

supposedly written in 2034, “The Rise of the Meritocracy,” intended

it as dark satire. His meritocratic future was a dystopian version of the

UK focused on biological superiority measured by IQ and monitored by

a ﬁctional “Eugenics House.” In this world, some elite parents traded

their lower-IQ babies for “clever” babies born into the underclass (or

even kidnapped them). Young warned that meritocracy, when taken

to extremes, creates a self-congratulatory elite that disregards the

## struggle, suﬀering, and abilities of others—like the book’s narrator

who, according to the concluding footnote, is killed, presumably in

the uprising of the lower classes he believed to be incapable of

eﬀectively rising up. Nevertheless, many readers interpreted the idea

of meritocracy as positive, and in common usage, it became a cherished

## ideal promising that talent and eﬀort determine success.

Today, meritocratic framing, regardless of the intention, often serves to

justify inequality and unfair barriers while perpetuating the myth that

opportunities to obtain success are evenly distributed. In reality, there

are drastic diﬀerences in opportunities based on the circumstances

of one’s birth. Perceptions of merit are frequently shaped by biases

and social capital rather than objective performance, and marginalized

people are often judged more harshly for mistakes others get away with.

To get closer to fairness, we need both merit and inclusion. The

## false dichotomy of merit and inclusion harms both individuals and

organizations. When cultures overemphasize merit without inclusion,

systemic barriers are ignored and privilege is mistaken for talent.

Conversely, tokenistic inclusion practices breed cynicism; when people

perceive inclusion as a lowering of standards, it delegitimizes the need

for true inclusion—supporting everyone in maximizing their talent.

## And when organizations practice exclusion in the name of merit, they

## miss opportunities for innovation and productivity and fall behind

competitors who manage to embrace fairness in the form of both merit

# and inclusion.

The ideal of a merit-based society is attractive. And it might

possibly work—in a world where a homeless child has the same

opportunities as a trust-fund baby, everything is disability-accessible,

and women’s contributions are not ignored. But in the world we

live in, true meritocracy, where everyone plays on an even ﬁeld,

requires the removal of many unfair barriers. It requires inclusion.

By removing systemic barriers, organizations can create environments

where inclusion enhances meritocracy and merit mechanisms enhance

inclusion, ensuring that talent and eﬀort genuinely determine success.

## Organizational Strategies for Ensuring Inclusive Merit

Creating a fair system that harmonizes merit and inclusion requires

intentional design and ongoing evaluation. Below are actionable

strategies organizations can adopt to ensure inclusivity of merit,

practicing fairness while unlocking the full potential of their workforce.

## Design job-speciﬁc and inclusive assessments.

True merit requires assessments that are tailored to real job

responsibilities and free from bias. For example, job-simulation

exercises that directly reﬂect day-to-day tasks—such as coding

## challenges for developers or case scenarios for managers—assess merit

# better than traditional interviews.

To create merit-based systems, organizations must eliminate

socioeconomic bias, test tools for cultural neutrality, and ensure they’re

accessible for candidates with disabilities. Both hiring assessment

tools and promotion methodologies should predict the long-term job

performance across all populations. This includes populations that have

been traditionally excluded and that are therefore not represented in

the currently available data used for predictive modeling.

# Build inclusive development pathways.

One of my earliest experiences of discrimination at work was being told

that professional development was only available to men. My merit and

performance did not matter. It was that disregard for merit that ignited

my passion for creating fair talent development systems—systems that

are both merit-based and inclusive. In truly fair systems, organizations

nurture the potential of all employees. This means making all aspects

of career development, from onboarding and networking to leadership

development pipelines, inclusive of the full range of talent. It requires

expanding the narrow deﬁnitions of potential that currently exclude

## talent like Sophia from leadership considerations.

# Build fairness into design.

Fairness by design eliminates the need for “special” programs. It builds

with curb-cuts from the start, removing the need for afterthought

## ramps. Transparent pathways for promotions and development

preempt suspicion and the risk of litigation. Fairness and ethical

treatment of people dismantle barriers before they arise, creating

environments where inclusion is seamless because it’s fully integrated

and where merit is made clear through transparency.

That built-in fairness is the foundation of my model for dignity-focused,

thriving organizations, The Canary Code. Its evidence-based principles

## —transparency, the use of valid tools, a focus on outcomes and

## organizational justice—facilitate merit-based decision-making, while

employee participation and ﬂexibility help maximize the alignment of

## individual strengths and organizational goals.

# Monitor, measure, and iterate.

Inclusive merit requires continuous evaluation and adjustment to

ensure systems remain fair and eﬀective. This means regularly

analyzing hiring, promotion, turnover, and performance data to

identify and address any disparities, and to ensure that merit-based

systems still work. Otherwise, it’s likely that merit will be diluted

## by favoritism, nepotism, inappropriate measurement, and similar-

## to-me bias. Transparent analysis of ﬁndings and a participatory

approach to solutions are also likely to support the perception of

leadership trustworthiness, which is crucial to building collaboration

## in environments fraught with political and interpersonal tensions.

. . .

Inclusive merit is about designing systems that recognize and reward

talent in all its forms. By ensuring valid measurement, eliminating bias,

and being honest with ourselves about just how level our playing ﬁeld is,

organizations can truly create environments where fairness thrives.
