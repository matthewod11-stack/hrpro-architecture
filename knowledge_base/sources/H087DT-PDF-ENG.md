When you’re struggling with your mental health, getting through your

workday can feel a lot harder than usual. If your workload is making

your anxiety, depression, or other mental health difﬁculties worse, it’s

not always the quantity or type of work that’s the culprit. Sometimes

it’s that your workday isn’t structured in a way that suits your natural

## rhythms or your mental health challenges.

Structuring your workday well can help with a wide range of difﬁculties,

from depression and anxiety to ADHD and bipolar disorder. But there’s

no one-size-ﬁts-all version of a mentally healthy workday. What’s

right for you will be based on self-knowledge, experimentation, and

balancing your needs with the needs of others.

How can you ﬁgure out the best approach for you? First, I’ll describe

some speciﬁc strategies tied to particular mental health challenges;

then I’ll discuss mentally healthy time management in general.

## Strategies for Speciﬁc Mental Health Challenges

Let’s start with some advice that may help people who deal with

# common mental health issues.

# Anxiety and depression

Whether your anxiety or depression is chronic or short term, it can make

you more likely to avoid certain situations and prone to procrastination.

For example, you may ﬁnd yourself feeling extra sensitive to any

signs someone is not happy with your work, but you may also avoid

addressing it rather than tackling it head-on. If this sounds like you,

consider structuring your days to make avoidance and procrastination

more difﬁcult. For example, create short deadlines for steps in a project

rather than one deadline for the whole thing. Or, have a set time of

day when you take at least one small step forward with a task you’re

avoiding. Making progress on tasks you’d prefer to avoid will stop the

stress from getting even worse.

# ADHD

Many mental health challenges cause people to struggle more with

planning and seeing the big picture. This is temporary in the case of

## problems like depression, but more chronic with issues like ADHD.

If you feel overwhelmed with planning, try to enlist the assistance

of others, when they’re willing. For example, ask a client to map out

deadlines for each stage of a project, or make planning with others a

# consistent part of your schedule.

# Bipolar disorder

Some folks with mood disorders, especially bipolar disorder, struggle a

great deal when their rhythms are disrupted — for example, if you’re

asked to do shift work or to take an early-morning ﬂight to a conference.

If you need a consistent schedule for your mental health, consider

asking your boss what adaptations are possible.

# Any mental health condition

You’ll ﬁnd many examples of the accommodations you can ask for

in the United States by searching online or looking at the Equal

Employment Opportunity Commission’s website. Anyone with a mental

health challenge of any sort should familiarize themselves with these

# options.

If you deal with a mental health condition regularly, look into the

## options available under the Americans with Disabilities Act sooner

rather than later — and well before you’re in a crisis. Don’t make

the mistake of thinking your issue doesn’t warrant accommodations if it objectively does. And note that diﬀerent countries use diﬀerent

terms for similar legislation. For example, the United States uses

“accommodations,” whereas the U.K. uses the phrase “reasonable

# adjustments.”

If you’re comfortable, talk to your manager about your condition and

why a particular accommodation would be useful to you. Your therapist

can help communicate only relevant information without excessive

personal details. For example, they could write a letter to your boss to

ensure you’re comfortable with what they are disclosing.

In general, when you have a mental health difﬁculty, try not to be

constantly overchallenged, but don’t completely avoid challenges and

triggers either. For example, if you have social anxiety, then sprinkle

activities that trigger your anxiety among activities you feel conﬁdent

with. (For me personally, this means working with people I know well

most of the time but working with new collaborators some of the time.)

# Strategies That Anyone Can Use

The following steps can help anyone support their mental health at

work, whether they deal with a condition chronically, occasionally,

or somewhere in between. These strategies also work for people

who have subclinical problems (for example, a degree of anxiety

but not enough to have been diagnosed with an anxiety disorder)

or people seeking to increase their resilience against mental health

difﬁculties or relapses. If you have an active mental illness, including

high-functioning depression or anxiety, note that self-care and time

management aren’t substitutes for actual evidence-based treatments.

The strategies mentioned here are supportive; they are not treatments.

# Build strong habits around deep work

Developing strong habits around how you work — including how you

do deep, focused work — will help you feel in control of your life and

# schedule.

Why? Consistent routines add structure to our days, boosting our

sense of control. Our brains get accustomed to performing sequences

of behaviors and eventually start to do these almost on autopilot. A

common example of how behaviors become automatic: Within a few

months of learning to drive, we all turn on our car, put on our seat belt,

release the brake, then look in our mirrors — without really thinking

about it. The same thing will happen with your productivity habits if

you’re consistent with when and where you do your job. If you do deep,

focused work during the same slot in your day, like 10 AM to noon,

keeping up that habit will become easier and more automatic over time,

even on days when you’re not at your best.

But this will only happen if you’ve got well-established, consistent

habits. If you sometimes do your focused work at 10 AM, but other times

you try to do it at 1 PM, you won’t experience the full beneﬁts of how

habits reduce your need for discipline.

Anyone can beneﬁt from this strategy, but particularly those who have

episodic mental health challenges, like depression, or those who go

through periods when their concentration is poor due to anxiety and

rumination or worry. If you have strong habits for when you focus

on work, it’s more likely you’ll get your work done. Keeping up your

important habits during stressful times can protect you against the risk

of unraveling. It can help you feel steady, stop your conﬁdence from

eroding, and ensure you don’t have added stress from piles of undone

# work.

Create routines to do tasks without imminent deadlines

Tackling tasks with imminent deadlines may feel intuitive and obvious,

but if all you’re getting done is what’s right in front of you, you’ll

generally feel a lack of control. When you accomplish important small

tasks that don’t have deadlines but that do need to get done, on the

other hand, you’ll feel like you’re managing your life well. Regularly set

aside time for these kinds of small administrative tasks. Whether it’s

getting back to a colleague about a collaboration that’s weeks away or

ﬁnally scheduling that appointment with the doctor or therapist, admin

tasks create a lot of mental drain. You think I should do that but don’t.

And those thoughts keep recurring. To-dos that roll over from one day’s

# list to the next don’t feel good.

In my book Stress-Free Productivity, I observed that I can do up to an

hour of admin tasks before I start my deep work, without disrupting

how much deep work I get done. The reason I focus on my admin tasks

ﬁrst is that if I attempt to get to them after deep work, I’m too tired. And checking oﬀ at least one “life admin” task (something not related

to work) per day keeps them from piling up and creating mental clutter

# and stress.

Your work and your patterns of attacking it might be diﬀerent

from mine. What’s important is that you observe your patterns and

sequence tasks accordingly. For example, say that realistically you’re

only productive for four days a week. Consider accepting that rather

than ﬁghting it. If you notice that all you manage to do on Fridays is

phone it in, see what happens if you’re honest about it. Experiment

with organizing your schedule accordingly — get your must-dos

done Monday to Thursday — rather than criticizing yourself for the

limitations of your focus and discipline. Accepting our limitations can sometimes have a paradoxical eﬀect: Self-criticism takes up a lot of

energy, so when we stop doing it, we have more energy for more

# productive things.

Use an unfocused mind to get things done

A huge part of why work can feel so overwhelming is the false idea that

we should be focused and undistracted all day. That’s not possible, and

not necessary or desirable, especially if you’re trying to do anything

# innovative.

It’s more realistic and mentally healthier to have a mind that’s

alternately focused and unfocused, because during our brains’

unfocused recovery time we make creative connections without even

trying to. For example, you’ve probably had a brilliant idea for a project

while taking a shower or going for a walk, right? When we’re unfocused,

pathways that felt murky while we were concentrating can suddenly

become clear. Problems we couldn’t solve from up close up suddenly

become simpler.

So rather than trying to force your brain to do task after task, let it

relax and wander after you’ve been productive for a while. Personally, I

## achieve this through a combination of walks, errands, chores around the

house, and entertainment (like reading a blog post in the middle of the

# workday).

I need to let my mind wander most after deep work sessions or when

I’m feeling overwhelmed by how to prioritize. If I take a walk when

I’m feeling mentally cluttered, my unfocused mind usually does my

prioritizing and organizing for me. If you’re stuck on an assignment and

aren’t sure what to do next, rather than stressing about it, let your mind

wander for a bit. That way you’ll be able to mull over ideas without just

staring at a blank page.

Unfocused time can also be hugely helpful to people experiencing

mental health challenges at work. For example, someone with social

anxiety needs breathing space to recover from feedback or to adjust

to the working styles of new collaborators. Likewise, someone with

depression needs opportunities for small bites of pleasure, like a leisurely coﬀee in a sunny spot, to bolster their mood.

Making time to be unfocused should become a regular part of your

habits. Maybe you can do your deep work in the mornings and then

treat your afternoons as opportunities for serendipity and wandering. However you do it, ﬁnd ways to let your brain oﬀ the hook for a while

each day. And remember, the more you’re doing novel or innovative

work, the more you’ll need mental down-time to recover from the toll of

it. Very challenging work involves lots of mental and emotional fallout,

including disappointment, uncertainty, and frustration. If you expect

yourself to be ﬁring on all cylinders at all times, you’ll shy away from

doing the types of novel and challenging work that require unfocused

# recovery time.

# What Managers Need to Know

If you’re a manager, make sure you understand how the previous advice will help your staﬀ both feel better and do their work better,

and familiarize yourself with the types of accommodations that help

people with speciﬁc mental health challenges. You can do this by simply

searching online, talking to HR, or asking a psychologist to do an

education session for your workplace. With the latter option, explain

## to the psychologist in advance how your workplace functions so they

can consider types of ﬂexibility that won’t be excessively disruptive.

Learn from your staﬀ about what their difﬁculties are and what would

help them, and of course, never judge them negatively for their mental

health. A particular difﬁculty doesn’t say anything about their talent,

dedication, or their quality of work. Since people may be reluctant to ask for accommodations, remind staﬀ regularly that you’re open to requests

and that you welcome honest conversations about mental illness and

health. Be as creative as you can in making accommodations. Your job

is to bring out the best in your people, and you’ll do that by supporting

their mental health in the ways they request.

. . .

Structuring your workday to support your mental health and

structuring it to do your best work don’t have to be at odds. Using the

tips from this article, you should see improvements in both your mental

# well-being and your productivity.

# Health at Work.
