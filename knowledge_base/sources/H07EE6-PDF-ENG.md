One popular strategy to preserve worker safety is implementing a

hotline that workers use to register complaints. But too often, hotlines

go unused, not because employees don’t have grievances, but because

employees don’t trust them — a lose-lose for employer and employee

alike. Employees need mechanisms to keep themselves safe, and

employers need a healthy and engaged workforce.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Create a Worker Safety Hotline That Really Works

We studied one eﬀective hotline to see what might be diﬀerent and

replicable about it. The hotline is part of the enforcement arm of a

## private, supply chain monitoring eﬀort, the Milk with Dignity Program

## (MD), a member of the Worker-Driven Social Responsibility Network.

Unlike other hotlines, the MD program hotline is well-utilized, ﬁelding

## more than 460 calls over 30 months from a population of approximately

260 workers. This success is even more impressive because the

MD program serves a workforce largely comprised of economically

precarious, migrant workers, who are less likely to complain than other

# workers.

We analyzed detailed records of MD complaint line calls, assessing the

type and number of concerns raised by workers, as well as investigation

and resolution processes. Interviews were also conducted with 14

stakeholders from the MD program. We found that the MD model

counteracts common hotline challenges by being easy for dairy workers

to use and resolving complaints quickly, unlike many complaint

mechanisms that can draw out investigations for months and even

## years. Speciﬁcally, this hotline diﬀers from others in three key ways.

# Access

Hotlines can be challenging for employees to access: Either workers

don’t understand their purpose, they are not staﬀed at convenient (non-

working) times, or workers, like the general public, prefer to text or

message rather than using an 800 number.

The MD program solved these problems with two low-cost initiatives.

First, workers are instructed in using the hotline annually in a worker

education session. These paid sessions are led (in Spanish) by fellow

workers who now work on the MD Program’s education and advocacy

team, while staﬀ from MD’s monitoring arm are on hand to translate

the sessions for English speakers. As a result, workers build direct connection with the auditors staﬃng the complaint line during these

# sessions.

Second, workers can call or text complaints via WhatsApp, which is

popular among a Vermont farmworker population that has limited cell

service but available internet. The hotline is staﬀed around the clock,

# seven days a week, by a bilingual staﬀ.

# Supervisor Deterrence

Many worker hotlines sit quiet because workers fear retaliation for

speaking out. Vulnerable workers often worry that their hours could

be docked, their wages reduced, or their position eliminated. This type

of direct retaliation is concerning, but our research uncovered another

way supervisors discourage (even unknowingly) workers from reporting

incidents: Many employers simply do nothing to address the concerns

that are raised, often because they fear that making changes will be too diﬃcult or costly to implement.

The MD program’s enforcement structure shakes farms out of this

status quo thinking. Employers receive a premium in exchange for

participation in the MD program; those who engage in or allow

retaliation against complainants face suspension from the program, and

loss of this premium. Furthermore, the MD program requires employers

to engage with and respond to all valid complaints — doing nothing

is not an option. As a result, farms develop a proactive approach to

complaint resolution, and become less resistant to change. The MD

hotline also rigorously protects complainant conﬁdentiality. Taken

together, these measures build employee trust, as workers see that

raising concerns can yield tangible improvements.

# Transfer of Burden

Worker hotlines inherently place some responsibility for monitoring

## conduct in the workplace on the employees themselves. Complaint

processes can be lengthy with little reward, and disillusionment among

workers — a pervasive feeling that speaking up would not lead to

meaningful change — is a problem for hotline utilization.

## The MD program counteracts this challenge in two ways: First, MD

staﬀ take on the primary burden of investigation and resolution,

involving complainants only when necessary. Second, and perhaps

most importantly, the MD program drastically shortens complaint

investigation timelines: Records show the median investigation was

one day, and full resolution of a complaint took about ﬁve days. This

compressed timeline is due in large part to how the MD program

# handles complaints.

While MD staﬀ retain the option of resorting to a more formal

investigative complaint process, they also broker conversations

## and collaborative problem-solving between workers and employers

where possible, drawing on personal relationships with workers

and supervisors cultivated during farm visits. By shortening and

informalizing the resolution process where possible, the MD program

helps employers avoid lengthy investigations and work disruptions,

while also quickly addressing worker concerns and fundamentally

shifting the grievance burden.

# The Upshot for Managers

## The success of this hotline model oﬀers four important, generalizable

lessons for managers seeking to establish eﬀective grievance

- 1. Hotlines need to be accessible, at the times, in the languages, and

through the mediums that workers prefer.

- 2. Hotlines need to institute serious protections against retaliation with

immediate, biting penalties for non-compliance.

- 3. Workers need to see fast responses to concerns, and quick resolutions

when they make valid complaints.

- 4. Informal complaint resolution can be more eﬀective, faster, and

better oriented to workers’ needs. Nevertheless, retaining the option

of a formal process is essential to guarantee complaint process

# integrity.

Dairy farms are a prime example of an industry context where

precarious workers may hesitate to utilize a grievance mechanism, but

the success of the MD hotline suggests these barriers can be overcome.

In fact, in our research the managers we spoke with emphasized

that turnover, a key labor cost for the dairy industry, plummeted

after the MD hotline went into eﬀect and workers began sharing

concerns. Building on this success, the hotline model — developed

by the MD Program and other WSR Network members — is now

being implemented in a variety of workplaces, including Hollywood to

# address sexual harassment.

Ultimately, a worker hotline that is well designed and utilized by

employees not only helps managers ﬁnd harm; it also can allow

managers to move from a reactive to a proactive approach to workplace

# abuse.
