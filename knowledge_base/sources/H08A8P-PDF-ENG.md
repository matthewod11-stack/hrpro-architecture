“Does it look like I have the words ‘suggestion box’ plastered on my

forehead?” Dana* griped to me in our coaching session. Her colleague

Ethan had yet again oﬀered unsolicited input on her new business

development initiative. As soon as she laid out her proposal, Ethan

burst in with, “Have you considered an email marketing campaign?”

and “This is deﬁnitely something you should partner with sales on!”

Over time, his well-intentioned enthusiasm began to frustrate Dana. She

hesitated to share her ideas with Ethan, guarding against unprompted

input that often left her feeling undermined, not supported.

If you’ve ever been in Dana’s shoes, then you know that unsolicited

advice — even the well-meaning kind — can sometimes feel intrusive

and undermine your conﬁdence. Perhaps in a meeting, a colleague

jumps in to suggest diﬀerent ways to interpret data you’re presenting

— seemingly embarrassing you in front of senior leaders. Or maybe

## during a one-on-one with your manager when you share a challenge

and hope for a bit of empathy, your boss turns it into an impromptu

consulting session, outlining strategies you should try (based solely on

# their experience, of course).

Whether someone frequently points out ﬂaws before fully

understanding your plans, gives input on topics where they’re not

the expert but you are, or responds to a straightforward request with

suggestions about things you didn’t ask about, getting advice out of

the blue can feel like a jab at your skills and competency. But chances

are, your colleagues or boss aren’t out to criticize you. They’re probably

trying to oﬀer a fresh perspective.

As with most aspects of workplace relationships, balance is key. While

it’s good to be open to new ideas and feedback, you also need to

trust your own expertise and insights. When unsolicited input becomes

chronic, overwhelming, or is frequently misplaced, it’s okay to set

boundaries respectfully. Here’s how to do that so you can stay open-

minded without feeling pushed around.

## Frame your ideas as a decision, not a discussion.

Instead of saying, “I’m thinking about trying X,” you could say, “I’ve

decided to do X because of Y and Z beneﬁts.” You can also use

phrases like “After a lot of research, I’ve committed to…” or “We’re

moving forward with…” This shows that you’re sharing information, not

soliciting feedback or looking for input on whether or not to proceed.

Consider Dana’s situation. Instead of saying, “I’m exploring the best way

to launch this new initiative,” she might say, “To get this new initiative

oﬀ the ground, I’m prioritizing corporate sponsorships and advertising.”

There’s now a higher likelihood that Ethan might ask how he can help

with Dana’s plan versus volunteering more suggestions.

# Show that there’s already support.

Demonstrating that your idea has backing is a smart way to leverage

the psychology of social proof. When you mention that you’ve already

seen positive results or that you have the support of higher-ups, external

vendors, or partners, it signals to your colleagues and boss that your

idea is validated and potentially accepted within the organization — or

# outside of it.

Mention any positive outcomes or successes, even if they’re early. For

example, “We’ve just started X, and already we’re seeing Y result,” subtly

implies that you’re on the right track and not looking for alternatives.

If relevant, highlight that you have support or approval from key

stakeholders; for example, “I’ve discussed this with [manager/leader],

and they’re on board with moving ahead.”

Combine a compliment with a boundary.

To politely regain control over a conversation, signal that while you

value someone’s input, you’re not currently looking for other ideas. This

strategy is particularly useful in meetings where time is limited and you

need to focus on speciﬁc agenda items.

Try phrases like:

- I appreciate where you’re going with this, but I need to stick to the

current plan to meet our deadlines.

- Thanks for chiming in. For this particular project, we’ve fully

committed to X after lots of consideration. We’ll keep your ideas in

# mind for the future.

- Those are interesting thoughts. For consistency’s sake, we’re going to

follow our current strategy until we have more data, but I’m open to

revisiting your suggestions in our next phase.

Pair one of these phrases with a non-verbal cue, like gently and brieﬂy

raising your hand as if to say “stop” or “time out.” Just be mindful

of who you’re talking to. Certain bosses or leaders may see this as an

# aﬀront.

Directly ask for what you need.

Be clear about the type of input you are open to. For example, “I value

your insight. For now, I’m speciﬁcally looking for feedback on managing

the budget, rather than exploring new features.” Or, “I’m excited to

share what I’ve been working on. I should mention that at this stage I’m

hoping to share about the progress we’ve made rather than brainstorm

# other concepts.”

You can also direct their enthusiasm in a way that beneﬁts both of

you by guiding them toward areas where you actually need assistance.

For example, “Your input could be really useful on the compliance

side. Could we focus there versus ideating on the strategy more?” This

makes them feel valued and ensures you’re happy with how they’re

# contributing.

While unsolicited advice can be annoying, it also gives you an

opportunity to practice taking work less personally. When others’ input

does become overbearing, you’ll know how to stand up for yourself

# clearly, kindly, and assertively.
