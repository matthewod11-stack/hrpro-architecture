Abstract This paper examines the impact of factors determini ng foreign direct investment (FDI) inflow of South Asian countries using annual data sets from the period 2005-2017 and estimates overall trends and factors impacting FDI in South Asian countries. The study utilizes panel data analysis and examines the selected variable like GDP, export exchange rate. The empirical results are robust in general for alternative variable determining FDI inflow. The policy inference of the study is that expandi ng the interest of economic integration around the globe and interdependence of FDI between member’s countries is a vital feature for maintaining the sustainability of growth.

- 1. Introduction

The world experienced a massive transformation process of globalization in terms of economic production and investment. The role of investment (FDI) in the process of transformation is very decisive. FDI has become a principle criterion of economic development in both developed and developing countries. FDI is defined as an ‘investment involving a long-term relationship and reflecting a long-lasting interest and control by a resident entity of one country of an enterprise resident in a different economy’. FDI influences the income, prices, production, employment, development and economic growth and general welfare of the South Asian countries. The benefit of FDI can be in the form of knowledge and technology spillover, employment generation and enterprise development. FDI going in and out of these emerging and transition economies like Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India, Bhutan, Afghanistan, Nepal, Maldives and Bangladesh collectively known as South Asian

countries, which are of economic significance in th e process of Global Transformation. It was seen that FDI inflow in south Asian countries was $470billion in 2018. In 2017, FDI flow witnessed a descending trend; global flows of foreign direct investment (FDI) fell by 14% in 2017 to an estimated $1.52 trillion. As a result of higher expected FDI growth in developed countries, the regional distribution of FDI may tile back towards the developing countries in the global inflow. FDI flow of developing economies reached to 46% of global inflow, developing Asia (33%) continues to be the region with highest FDI inflow significantly above European Union (21%) traditionally the region with the highest share of global FDI. FDI inflow was up also in the other major developing regions, Africa (3%) and Latin America and the Caribbean (10%). Although FDI to developed economies resumed its recovery path after the steep fall in 2012, it remained at a historically low share of the total global FDI flow (49%) and still 57% below its peak in 2007. Thus developed countries maintained their lead over developing countries. Developing economies and transition economies now constitute

half of the top 20 economies ranked by FDI Inflow.

South Asia (Sri Lanka, Pakistan, India,Bhutan, Afghanistan,Nepal,Maldives and Bangladesh) are eight biggest economies that are expected to remain the fastest-growing region in the world with 6.9 percent in 2018 and it was anticipated that growth should

further strengthen to 7.1 percent on average in 2019- 20 despite the brittleness in some emerging markets. “FDI recovery continues to be on a bumpy road” said UNCTAD Secretary-General Mukhisa Kituyi. It was seen that FDI in SAARC countries w continuously decreasing from the previous year as shown in below Table 1.

It was seen from the above trend that FDI Inflow in SAARC countries is 3%, ASAEAN is 9 %, BRICSis 18 % and SADC is 0.5%. It was seen from the above table that compounded annual growth rate was decreasing for SAARC by -0.67 because of instability in India due to demonetization and GST. And India is the largest recipient of FDI Inflow in South Asia as shown by the below trends after India, Pakistan is the largest recipient of FDI in SAARC.

of 1970-1995. The study indicated that the size, growth, domestic saving, country’s solvency, trade.openness and macroeconomic stability variable are catalyst of FDI. The UNCTAD (1999) advocated both positive and negative association between growth and FDI ,depending upon the incorporation of various variable like infrastructure, market integration etc.

economies during 1960 to 1987 by using a model based on traditional derived –factor of a multiple product monopolist .The study finds that FDI inflow are more elastic with respect to cost of capital than wages and also more elastic with respect to aggregate demand in export than domestic demand.

DierkHerzer(2009) “Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of outward foreign direct investment (FDI) on economic growth. In this Two econometric approaches are used: cross-country regressions for a sample of 50 countries and time-series estimators for the USA and Both approaches tell the same story: outward FDI is positively associated with growth. This finding is robust to several model specifications, potential outliers, and different estimation techniques. In addition, Granger-causality tests for the USA indicate that causality is bidirectional, suggesting that increased outward FDI is both a cause and a consequence of increased domestic output. This paper, in contrast, deals with the effects of aggregate outward FDI on the economy as a whole.

Balasubramanyan et al. (1996) found significant positive association between FDI and economic growth and suggest that the above relationship is more holistic in the export promotion policy in contracts to import substitution policy of the country.

Sing and Jung (1996) argued that political risk,business, condition and macroeconomics policies matter for FDI in developing countries.

The above studies indicate mixed result and mostly provided information about determinants related to FDI inflow in SAARC Countries. Thus the review helped in choosing the factors or alternative that may gauge empirical analysis of determinates of FDI in SAARC.

The classical model for determinants Of FDI begins from the earlier research work of Dunning (1973, 1981) which provide a comprehensive analysis based on ownership, location and internationalization paradigm. Lucas (1993) examined the determinates of FDI inflow for select East and south Asian

This study compliments the exiting literature by providing empirical analysis on South Asian countries only as the exiting studies contain large number of countries but do not have China and South Africa in their list which is the major recipient of FDI in the world. In this study the dependent variable is FDI, net inflow (BOP in current US $ and independent variable is Export and import of goods and service, GDP per capita (current US$), official exchange rate (LCU per US$, period average / consumer price).Real effective Exchange rate is taken for the more accurate results.

and to provide more efficient estimation and information of the parameters. Panel data technique is used because of its advantage over cross section al and time series analysis in using all the informati on available,which are not detectable in pure cross sections or in pure time series. Battag and kao (2000), Hsiao (1958, 1986) and Baltagi (1995) argued panel data sets posses several major advantages.Panel dat a suggests individual heterogeneity to deducted the risk of producing biased result and revised a large number of data points to enhance the degree of freedom and variability and to be able to study the dynamic of adjustments. The panel data model includes three different methods.

Based on the above hypotheses posed, the estimation model is as follow:

Where, LFDI : Log value of Foreign Direct Investment LGDP :: Log value of Gross Domestic Product Per capita LE &I :: Log value of Export and Import of goods and services LOER: Log value of Official exchange rate This study comprise analysis of eight emerging economies of the world know as South Asian countries

The panel data estimation is employed in the study for the SAARC to capture dynamic behavior of the parameter and to provide more efficient estimation and information of the parameter. Here the Hausman test (1978). Prove that we have to use the random affect model for the analysis. Random affect model assist in controlling for unobserved heterogeneity when the heterogeneity is constant over time and not correlated with independent variables. This constant can be removed from the data through differencing, for example by taking a first difference which will remove any time invariant components of the model.

So, we have chosen Panel data analysis, and in panel data analysis we have used Random Affect method of Estimation because fixed effect model is rejected in the analysis based on Hausman specification test. Further, highest value of Hausman test rejects the validity of fixed effect test. The estimates through panel data analysis through Random Affect Method are show in Table 4.

significant at 5 percent level which shows that determinates are potential determinants of FDI inflow, where the Exchange rate is not significant which indicate that this determinants might not be important determinants in this case. The positive value of th e coefficient indicates perfect synchronization of determinants variable with FDI inflow whereas negative sign shows that they affect FDI inflow in reverse manner i.e. decreasing value of the determinants. The coefficient of LGDP and LE&I show that foreign investor are highly sensitive to the market growth as 1 percent increase in the variable leads to 1.53 percent and 1.33 percent increase in FDI respectively. Whereas coefficient of Official Exchange rate indicates that 1 percent increase in leads to 0.012 percent increase in FDI which is very nominal in nature.

- 6. Conclusion: As stated earlier the motive of the study is to examine the factors that determine the FDI inflow to the SAARC countries. Economic integration provides development and security to the respective countries and world at large. It can be concluded from the analysis that financial system that is growth of the GDP plays a very significant role in mobilizing FDI inflow in to the nation.The study made an attempt to recognize the factor determinants the FDI inflow in SARRC countries from 2000-2017 for which determinants include GDP, Export and import and Foreign exchange rates.The study found the GDP and Export and Imports are potential determinants of the FDI inflow. The challenges for the SARRC countries isto maintain its GDP growth so that FDI inflow shouldcontinue and follow the upward trend. Moreover the governments of the respective countries

have to optimize their economic conditions to attract more FDI. 7. Policy Implication GDP and Exports and Imports are crucial factors in engaging FDI, which may help to make appropriate policies for improving the performance of domestic economy. In addition, the business facilitating dimension in the form of treaties and investment promotion agencies may be supported by good political environments, corporate governance, efficient economic policies and sound infrastructure measure to exploit the benefits from FDI. 8. Limitation The study analyzes the impact of determinants of FDI Inflow in the eight economies of the SAARC as a whole unit but it does not analyze how the selected determinants variable influence the FDI inflow on each country on individual basis. There are other important determinants which are not covered under this study like Gross capital formation, labourcost, work forc e, market capitalization, inflation etc. Labour cost are import determinants in the India, Pakistan, Nepal. 9. Scope For Further Research The research can be further extended to analyze how profit remittance homes countries by direct investors contributes to current account deficit (CAD). It ca n be constructed from the above study that as a policy implication FDI can cause worsening of balance of payment position by causing current Account Deficit (CAD) in long run. Another area of further research can be sect oral analysis to enhance the understanding of the industry specific FDI flow and its determinants to analyze whether FDI stock and output are reinforcing manufacturing sectors along the primary sectors or not.

## Talent Development: Existing Status, Constraints, Scope and Suggested Strategies

## Rajeev Ranjan Mishra* Dr. Piyush Sharma** Dr. Sanjeev Kumar***

# Abstract

Although talent development is increasingly needed in organizations, there is skepticism about its notion in blueprint and reality. This paper probes and extends better understanding into the disparity on the dissimilarities of the notion, meanings and approach to talent development. It also examines the range of tools available to organizations for development. Gaining inferences from a series of research papers, it revealed that talent development is an important constituent of the complete mechanism of talent management. The study underline d why talent development has proved crucial to the success of an organization, whether in prosperity or adversity. The restrictions faced by organizations in the implementation of TD strate gy have also been discussed. Though the study is exclusively qualitative in its essence; it highlights avenues for future studies. This study will help training professionals in dealing with certain problems and challenges that lead to the management and development of talent at work.

Introduction Human capital is regarded vital for an organization in order to gain edge over its competitors (Price, 2004); an indispensable entity that is available for a premium for organizations and becoming scarce resource (Kim and McLean 2012; Pruis 2011; Lockwood 2006)every passing day. It is illustrated in Talent Shortage Survey conducted by ManpowerGroup in 2018 that reported shortage of talent for the key leadership roles in 67% of the large organizations across the world. These talent ‘gaps’, ‘crunch’ or ‘shortage’ have hindered the business advancement (Collings and Mellahi 2009) by impacting on its operating costs, bottom-line Rajeev Ranjan Mishra* Research Scholar, Faculty of Hospitality & Tourism, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh Dr. Piyush Sharma** Associate Professor, Faculty of Hospitality & Tourism, Amity University, Uttar Pradesh Dr. Sanjeev Kumar*** Assistant Professor, IHTM, M.D. University, Rohtak

# profitability, competitiveness, service, quality, brand and investment in the longer-term.

Moreover, the issue of the shortage of talent is almost global. Michaelset al., (2001) found that organizations around the world have little choice but to strive for the same group of talented people with the similar tools, tactics, and perspectives employed by many other organizations. This has led to certain unfair and illegal practices like poaching of talents. In an era of internationalization, where talent and intellectualism are preferred as the principal medium of exchange, developing talent has become pre-requisite for making a fortune because it is the talented people who wil l make your customers choose your brand and support your business.

The notion of developing talent is not new; there has always been a need for talented employees since eternity. But, the crunch for talented employees has only hit the business sector today because of the paradigmshift of human resource. Norma D’Annunzio-Green (2008) revealed that since mobility

is no longer a concern for “Generation Y” employees due to their propensity towards changing their jobs regularly, talent retention has turned out to be a serious problem for the HR managers. These employees focus more on employability as opposed to employment, thereby exerting pressure on organizations to impart them continuous professional advancement opportunities. Furthermore, a remarkable development during the past years is that employees not anymore dedicate or confide their employment to one employer. They embrace a proactive approach, looking for organizations with the best professiona l advancement criterion (Mirvis and Hall, 1994; Sullivan, 1999; Roehling et al., 2000; Tanskey and Cohen, 2001). This has led to a worldwide battle amongst corporations for developing and encompassing appropriate talent development mechanisms into their frameworks.

Human resource managers, the world over, have realized that talent development has turned out crucial for business growth (Cook and Macaulay 2009; Kim and McLean 2012). In developing strategies to this end, they burn the candle at both ends and for a little while the development of talent has assumed a significant role for organizational advancement.

All such elements bring forth talent development - as a subject field, at the top of the priority list. However, there are relatively scant and fragmented scholarly papers that centralize quintessentially on talent development (Garavanet al., 2012). It is with this objective that this study was proposed. Studies and researches relevant to the topic were systematically reviewed to further examine this domain.

Analysis of literature indicated that several researchers and academicians have described talent development with an array of ideas and thoughts that identify gaps for a great deal of uncertainty and lack of transparency about what organizations characterize as talent, it s applicability and the overall objectives of talent development and thus pose a danger to its implementation.We expect that through the empirical observations accrued from the numerous papers and articles we will clarify the challenges encountered i n the development of talent and the difficulties faced by

the organization and its manpower in the direction of a framework based on talent. The paper also critically examines the range of TD interventions available to organizations.

- 2. Objective of the Study The prime concern of the present study is to review the prominent and relevant literature of past researches pertaining to talent development so as to probe the notion, meanings and approach to talent developmentand highlight the constraints confronted by organizations and the employees in the direction of a framework based on talent. The study also examines the range of development tools available to organizations.The aim of the study is also to offer a base for identifying opportunities so as to provide better guidance for further research into this domain. s

- 3. Research Methodology This study is qualitative in nature. Research paper published in the period between1987 to 2016 are taken into account. Secondary data has been accessed from review of literature as well as from various journals and articles. The articles have been accessed from online databases i.e. scholar.google.co.in, Nationa l HRD network, emeraldinsight.com, elsevier.com, sciencedirect.com, researchgate.net, academia.edu and data available in books are collected in order to carry out an in-depth analysis.

- 4. What is ‘‘Talent’’? Collings and Mellahi (2009) claimed that talent contributes significantly to the overall organizational accomplishment.But what is ‘‘talent’’?A discourse on talent development would be impaired in the absence of an interpretation of the term “talent”.Talent in broad terms relates to the aptitudes, abilities or the art that a person acquires in a certain profession or domain.

Howe et al., (1998), Tansley (2011) and CIPD (2007) revealed that the word ‘talent’ has been used since ancient times; and also stated that it has differen t understandings and perceptions, all of which depend heavily on situations, persons, and organizations. This is consistent with researches of Iles et al., (2010) who pointed that talent connotes varied meanings to diverse

persons, organizations, establishments, etc. However, (Williams, 2000; Michaels et al., 2001; Tansley, 2011; and Gallardo-Gallardo et al., 2013) stressed that a distinct knowledge of the meanings, descriptions and notion of the term ‘talent’ is critical for the progress of establishments.

Principally, talent is often understood from either an objective perspective (characteristics of people as talents) or a subjective perspective ( people as talents). Some researchers hold an objective perspective of talent, which portrays the characteristics of being talente d instead of talented people. Aptitudes (Thijssen& van der Heijden, 2003), proficiencies (Thijssen & van der Heijden, 2003; Ulrich, 2007; Lehmann, 2009; Siikaniemi, 2012) and organizational abilities (Claussenet al., 2014) are few of the key attributes expressing talents from an objective perspective. Michaels et al., (2001) portrayed talent as entirety of an individual’s skillsets, his inherent powers, abilities, level of knowledge, understanding, expertise, caliber, rationality, demeanor, behavior, personality and zeal. Talent was defined by Gagne (2000) as supreme expertise of organized and consistently cultured qualities or expertise. On the other hand, some of other interpretations with subjective perspective relate to great-performance workers (McDonnell et al., 2010), highly-promising workers (McDonnell et al., 2010), persons who can produce substantial contribution to the present as well as prospective achievement of t he organization (Stewart & Harte, 2010; Morton 2004), individuals who can fulfill present as well as futu re leadership criteria (Rhodes et al., 2008), and managers as a whole (Sheehan, 2012). Zikmund (2000) described talent as all those individuals who can accelerate organizational effectiveness either by means of their instant endeavour or eventually by displaying the highest degrees of excellence.

of what talent denotes and in what way organizations need to manage them are yet a matter of discussion (Collings and Mellahi 2009).

There is unexpectedly scant printed papers and articles that focus on global talent development problems and defines the dimensions and outlines the peripheries of the notion (Cohn et al., 2005; Garavan et al., 2009;Younger and Cleemann, 2010; Cook, 2010). It is recognized, nevertheless, that talent developmen t (TD) is a key element of global talent management (Barlow, 2006;Novations, 2009; Cappelli, 2009;Scullion and Collings, 2011; CIPD, 2011; Garavanet al., 2012).

In HRM and HRD publications, talent management (TM) is more than ever being mentioned about (Berger and Berger, 2003;Stahl et al., 2007; Cappelli, 2009; Burbach and Royle, 2010;Collings et al., 2011). It is a prominent, even “imperative” subject across the globe (Barlow, 2006; Birschel, 2006; Jenkins, 2006;Berry, 2007; Powell and Lubitsh, 2007). Dessler (2009) viewed TD as a crucial constituent of talent management, which is a bunch of organizational methods and practices (McDonnell et al., 2010; CIPD, 2011) that describes how organizations lure, choose , engage, train and handle employees in an optimized and planned manner (Scullion and Collings, 2011).These two notions are also frequently related to, and occasionally used mutually (Lewis and Heckman 2006)with, career development (Collings et al., 2009), which features a continuing range of training and associated exercises that determine th e success and fulfillment of an individual’s profession (Dessler, 2009).

- 5. Defining the Scope of Talent Development Organizations have been continuously emphasizing that they wish to manage and develop talent. However, researches have shown that the notion of talent development is conceived diversely in various organizations with varying degrees. Few academicians consider it as interchangeable with HRM and the issues

According to Evans et al., (2002) talent development aims at evolving leaders through processes such as 360- degree feedback, networking, coaching, training, job assignments, action learning, mentoring and challenging employees. Davis et al., (2007) defined TD as the manner of transforming an organization, its workforce, its various stakeholders, and set of persons within it, by way of meticulously organized and impromptu training, with an objective to have an edge for the organization. Mehdiabadi et al., (2016) defined TD as an all-inclusive system comprising of a

set of principles, tasks, and procedures focused at enhancing the interested and competent employees for the mutuality of individuals, host organization s, and community at large.

According to Garavanet al., (2012) talent development emphasizes on the planning, selecting and execution of development techniques for the talented individuals to make sure that the organization has the present as well as forecasted inventory of talent to achieve business goals and the development tasks are in sync with th e talent management programs of the organization.

Thunnissenet al., (2013) stressed that talent development coupled with talent attraction and engagement are considered as the three principal techniques or processes in TM. Pruis (2011) stressed that talent development is a long term, holistic an d comprehensive process that keeps the organization stable, progressive and creative. Therefore, Neal a nd Sonsino (2012) concluded that the existence of the organization counts on their creativity in practice s, procedures, products and leadership. Ketter (2010) recommends that as organizations strive in new marketplace with limited resources, talent development remains a requisite for them.

Stahl et al., (2012) asserted that “one of the major issues being faced by the corporates worldwide is t o create and maintain a strong pool of talent” and one definite way of creating talent pipeline is in the form of talent development. Govaerts et al., (2010) in his study revealed that organizations need to implement talent development systems if they intend to retain their employees. He also stressed that organization s should allow staff members to learn new things and practice what they are well-versed in.Gandz (2006) revealed that talent development practices are usually carried out by establishments to make sure that there is no talent deficit, to assure envisioned progress ion instead of substitution, and to brand the organization like a talent magnet in the corporate world.

Inclusive versus Exclusive approach toward Talent Development The inference of inconsistencies in interpretation of talent implies that it ca n mean whatsoever firms and

establishments would like it to imply (Gallardo- Gallardo et al., 2013) and consequently, this perception of talent decides which set of worker sought to be developed. Few establishments, for example, will involve all grades of employee in their definition of talent, whereas others will concentrate on handpicked ones only.

Iles et al., (2010) have pointed out disagreement regarding what talent may comprise of for the purpose of developing the talent of any individual. Consequently, two approaches to talent development were identified: an exclusive approach which centralizes on crucial tasks, profiles and trains them to perform these responsibilities and an inclusive approach th at centralizes on developing all budding staffs; this eventually leads to maximumadvantages for the establishments (Pruis 2011).

Talent can be seen as being exclusive to some great- performance workers or as a characteristic that every workers exhibits in a certain degree and that can be cultured and evolved by way of different mechanisms (Lewis and Heckman, 2006; Collings and Mellahi, 2009). Downs &Swailes (2013) asserts that approaches pertaining to talent are usually an exclusive process concentrating on a small fraction of workers in an establishment termed as key players or stars; regardless of the truth that “talent persists at every level o f employees, development processes in establishment concentrate mostly on top executive and administrative positions”

Berger and Berger (2003) advocates inclusive approach and believe that every individual has one talent or the other that can be determined and unleashed. Nevertheless, they recommend that an establishment that facilitates talent management effectively classifies workers and emphasize development investments in key, great-performance and highly-promising employees.Baum (2008) stressed that management should apprehend talent from inclusive perspective, to ensure that all employees are considered based on their ability to assume additional duties and assignments and be elevated within their department and in the broader sense organization.

The scientific data advocates a blend of approaches in establishments. A CIPD (2011) survey concluded that several establishments have opted for an exclusive approach which concentrates on grooming top executives only. There has been a great deal of emphasis on huge potential, future stars, prospective managers and go-getter. The exclusive approach implemented by Somerfield Ltd (Cook and Macaulay 2009) assisted the organization in creating a bench strength of budding leaders. Cook and Macaulay (2009) revealed that a more inclusive approach was implemented by Electrolux Ltd, wherein every staff member is regarded as talented. They recommend that not merely the high promising workers need to be focused upon. Mere concentration on handful employees who are selected, groomed, compensated and taken to next level can result in discouragement and inefficiency of rest of them and they may not get an opportunity to be promoted to leadership positions. Although the McKinsey Consulting Group in the beginning strongly favoured an exclusive technique to developing, currently they recommend an inclusive technique which aims to develop not only “A players” but “B players” as well (Ernst & Young, 2010). Yet, comparatively lesser number of organizations implements inclusive technique.A survey conducted in Public Personnel Management (Reilly, 2008) clearly indicates that inclusive techniques are prevalent in state owned enterprises. Bersin (2010) views this inclusive approach as a kind of talent segmentation but with credit th at entire staff members contribute in the organization. Christensen et al., (2010) stated that this kind of approach is in accordance with an innovative perspective. Such approach implies that every employee must be viewed talented in view of his capability for innovative thinking. To surpass the drawbacks of these approaches, Van der Sluis and Van De Bunt – Kokhuis (2009) advocated the mixed approach that facilitates organizations to derive the benefits of these two models. Ford et al., (2010) further reveals that a mixed approach to development would eventually be most appropriate when it comes to equity, impartiality and staff encouragement.

There is significant discussion about the pros and cons of exclusive and inclusive approaches; but, it is important to realize the manner in which both techniques affect organizational profitability and the commitment of staffs that are ignored in an exclusive technique.

Modus operandi - Make versus Buy approach toward talent development Brewster et al., (2007) revealed that due to unfair and illegal acts like poaching of talents, establishments have lost some of their talented staffs to their rivals and have been left with an option to either train or attract other staffs in order to thrive as well as survive. However, there is no clarity whether organizations should concentrate more on hiring and recruitment or developing of talented employees (Briscoe and Hall 1999). Make or buyapproach has been an object of continuing discussion among management scholar in the literary works (Cappelli, 2008; Cappelli& Keller, 2014). Pfeffer (2001), as one of the patrons of ‘make’ approach, cautions that sheer consideration to hire and engage and overlooking the development of talent might weaken the establishment in the long run. Furthermore, according to Garavan et al., (2012), concentrating on procuring talents from the outside is less fruitful in the longer term; on the contrar y, establishments must practice the policy of developing talented employees internally, with a view that sta ff members have sector and business-related know-how and expertise (Lepak and Snell, 1999) so that he remains in competition. Consequently, for the purpose of realizing their mission and goals, establishments have to aim at staff development.

The particular technique for organizations is based on strategic goal, learning requirements, availableness of resources, etc. Based on McCauley et al., (2010), the kinds of programs utilized to develop talent by organizations may be classifie d into these distinct groups: developmental assignments, feedback processes, developmental relationships,formal programs and self-development activities.

Developmental Relationships Bonding and relationships are considered an extremely strong determinant of growth and advancement as these are a great basis of evaluation, obstacles, support and guidance (McCauley and Douglas, 2004; Rock and Garavan, 2006). As stated by Higgins and Kram (2001), developmental relationships are treated as a bonding in which one person cares about the progression of the career of another person. Novations (2009) and CIPD (2011) specified that these are undertaken extensively for developing strong promising talented people. Lombardozzi and Casey (2008) concluded that the techniques in these activities entailed a frequent interaction among definite designer-driven learning actions, learner-driven actions, communication among themselves and learner action and reasoning handling. These activities var y from those which are evolved instinctively in the work station and in different facets of human activity (such as mentors and role models) to such which are deliberately oriented to encourage and promote learning (such as professional coaches and social identity networks). One more extremely prominent technique premised on relationships is the community of practice (Wenger, McDermott, and Synder, 2002; Saint-Onge and Wallace, 2003). They include a set of people, usually from a particular establishment, having similarity in acumen and tasks however engaged in multiple divisions or territories.These people get together for knowledge sharing, to discuss ideal procedures, enrich one another and guide each other since they are confronted with similar kinds of problems.

handling day-to-day issues and challenges. Evans al., (2011) revealed that such orientations give employees the chance to discover varied organizational, societal, cross-cultural and work practice scenarios. As a matter of fact, studies have time and again revealed that challenges lead to on-the-job learning (McCauley et al., 1994; DeRue and Wellman, 2009; Dragoni et al., 2009), which leaders regard as a main source of knowledge (Morrison et al., 1987; McCall et al., 1988).

Action learning team is probably one of the highly organized types of developmental assignments. It is a series of development mechanisms wherein crucial real- life issues pertaining to an organization is addres sed. Three types of goals are aimed at: delivering quantifiable business outcomes, conveying learning unique to a specific background, and developing broader management competencies and proficiencies (Palus&Horth, 2004). Meaningful action learning may stretch from implicit, simple learning at job to orientated and substantial-impact learning activities to revolutions of individuals and establishments (Marsick, 2002).

Feedback Processes While feedback instinctively takes place in the course of human dialogue in organizations, but sincere response regarding one’s conduct, abilities, and influence on other people is uncommon and irregular in most of the establishments. For managers to obtain constant, premium-class response, employee advancement mechanisms must incorporate formal feedback practices.

Developmental Assignments Pushing employees vertically above in the organization has remained a general approach of exposing them to new problems and difficulties, however the more intentional use of lateral movements and temporary tasks is more commonly an important aspect of employee development practices (McCauley, 2006; Yost and Plunkett, 2009). Job rotations, secondments, project assignments/stretch assignments and job moves (multinational assignments and nation-wide transfers) enable employees to learning through experience – by

Coleman (1987) defined assessment center as “a series of testing techniques aimed at allowing applicants to display, in normal circumstances, the competencies and capabilities that are crucial to be successful in a particular task”. The results of the assessment center process can be used for employee selection or development.

360-degree feedback employs a meticulously framed tool (questionnaire) and gathers views in an organized manner regarding an individual’s performance from a broad set of persons (colleagues, subordinates, clients and other stakeholders). Chappelow (2004) lately

concluded that probably the most noteworthy drift in the domain of employee development in the last two decades might have been the universality and acceptance of 360-degree feedback. People termed it as the most remarkable management innovations in the last 20 years (London & Beatty, 1993; Atwater & Waldman, 1998). This mechanism gives better results if it begins with managers at the top of the hierarchy and flows downward all through the organizational structure.

Formal Programs This technique involves participation to business events, executive education and formal education. Examining its goals, Rothwell and Kazanas (2003) put forward a demarcation between employee education that concentrates on transforming people to assist them groom for job progression vertically (up the chain of command) or horizontally (across a range of specialized skill) and staff training that is a short-period, transformation endeavor aimed at enhancing productivity at an individual level.

Self-Development Activities Organizations may provide a plethora of self- activatedprograms to develop leaders. Books, articles, newspaper, magazines, manuals, journals, reports, publications and online materialsact as a primary source of learning and awareness for employee members. Distinguished personalities, eminent speakers, guest lectures, seminar, conference and workshops give an opportunity to experts, wizards and veterans who can share ideas and keep abreast with the recent technological advancements and developments in the industry. Attending seminars, conventions and trade shows also provides orientation to contemporary ideas and concepts and latest developments, as well as networking with like-minded people who are continuous source of learning and guidance. Events that encourage and energize knowledge sharing and dialogue beyond management levels – fireside chats, town hall meetings, staff meetings, conclaves, etc. – can well be considered as an important component of the employee advancement mechanism as these expose employees

to various aspects, strengthen institutional core values, and promote open-mindedness, positiveness and transparency. These flexible chunks of learning are less- time taking, are accessible whenever learning is required, and available in abundance.

- 7. Conclusions On the basis of this review of the domain of talent development, a number of tentative inferences can be concluded. Talent development is a considerably under-developed and less-researched topic. It is consistently regarded as an important constituent o f talent management process, which in turn is put forward as one of the top most challenges encountered by the organizations these days.Though talent is limited and economic downturn has compelledfew organizations to put talent development to the offstage, yet it is requisite for every organization. For tale nt development to be effectual there is no universally- accepted approach. However, the broad array of development tools needs to be considered to determine its suitability. From our point of view there is scope in the talent development concept. A universally accepted definition of talent development and its scope need to be further researched. There can be no convincing manner of distinguishing talent, so talented individuals might be unnoticed, or those selected may not have the competence they initially appeared to have. Furthermore, there is one area about which there is no unanimity, and this concerns who all employees of the organization should be taken into consideration for the talent development program. There is proof that the new approaches to talent development are emerging: an earlier focus on exclusive models that intended to identify and develop top management talent (A players) is giving way to a realization that A players need to be part of productive and talented teams, and these teams, consisting of ‘B players’, can be found at all leve ls of the organization, and indeed in supplying or partner organizations. Inclusive approaches may therefore dominate in the second decade of the 21st century, much as exclusive approaches did in the first decade.

## Review of Ownership Based Blockchain Frameworks in Government Applications

## Deepika Sachdev* Dr. Deepankar Chakrabarti** Dr. Ankur Mittal***

# Abstract

Blockchain Based Applications are becoming increasingly popular in the Government Sector due to increased needs of Trust and Transparency. Due to its Decentralized architecture, strong encryption algorithms and immutable timestamping it is being used in diverse applications including Health Care, Education, Voting and Smart Governance. Block chain has many variants based on Ownership, Consensus Protocols and Tokenization Str ategy. This paper analyses Blockchain Taxonomy based on Ownership and Access rights. It th en reviews a multitude of Blockchain based Government applications based on their Ownership characteristics and needs for anonymity and Read as well as Write privileges. Based on the classification framework, the final objective is to create and verify the Blockchain Framework Mapping based on the Applications Business and Security requirements.

## Key Words: Blockchain, Government, Permissioned, Public, Trust

- 1. Introduction According to the Pew research centre Public trust in the government is at a historic low, where only 17% of the Americans say that they can trust the government. Blockchain with its key traits of decentralization, immutability and Cryptographic security helps to bring transparency and auditabili ty to applications, which is a key factor for Trust enhancement by the public. Due to an increasing interest by Business and IT Firms, Blockchain has multiple variants to adapt to a vast variety of applications. This paper approaches Blockchain Applications for Government through the lens of Trust and Ownership. Blockchain is currently in use in Deepika Sachdev* VP Delivery Knowesis Pte Ltd, Singapore Dr. Deepankar Chakrabarti** Professor, Decision Sciences, School of Business, University of Petroleum & Energy Studies, Dehradun Dr. Ankur Mittal*** Associate Professor, School of Business, University of Petroleum & Energy Studies, Dehradun

Government Applications for multiple use cases including Land Reforms, Defence, Payments and a Registries. The objective of this paper is to create Blockchain Taxonomy with the goal of helping future Government Applications make optimized decisions on the right choice of Blockchain Framework based on Functional Needs. The methodology used to create this Framework starts with creating a Blockchain Framework based on Business, Technology and Trust Requirements. This is followed by an Evaluation of Application Use Cases in Government based on varying Trust and Business Requirements. This is followed by a thematic evaluation of the Use Cases to create a Taxonomy for Mapping the Optimized Blockchain Framework based on Application Requirements for Government Sector. This framework is finally verified by applying to existing Government Use Cases.

- 2. Theoretical Background Blockchain Functional Pillars The key Blockchain characteristics important for a Government application are:

Immutability: once information is recorded, it cannot be altered.

- Decentralization: Multiple participants have access to information and hence there is no single owner of information

- No Intermediary: decisions are made by consensus and not controlled by a single party. Based on the type of Blockchain selected, the consensus can be owned by a central authority or can be public

- Transparency: all information can be accessible by all participants

- Transaction Speeds: Blockchains offer low to medium Transaction Speeds, varying based on the

type of Blockchain Framework selected

Blockchain Schematic View The Blockchain protocol created by Satoshi Nakamoto[19] is an append-only ledger with very restricted update or delete capability. Instead of storing individual transactions, it stores blocks of transactions which are cryptographically chained together. Blockchain which was started by Satoshi for a Finance as its applications is now rapidly spreading to oth er sectors. Due to its promise of True Decentralizatio n and removal of the Middle Man, Blockchain is a killer application for the Government Sector, and as described in [8], Blockchain’s goal is to enable Digital Autonomous Government (DAG).

# Figure 1: Blockchain Schematic

Blockchain as a Trust Enabler At its core, Blockchain is a Decentralized Asset Managed Platform. Its unique characteristic is that it enabl es parties who do not have existing Trust Relationship to

exchange Assets, which could vary from Physical Assets, Currency or Digital assets in a secure environment. The below diagram depicts Data Exchange Mechanics in Trusted versus Non Trusted Organizations:

Blockchain technology is ideal for creating trust in information and scenarios where heterogeneous stakeholders are involved. Unlike traditional, centralised databases, where a single entity is generally responsible for collecting, securing and sharing information, blockchain platforms are based on decentralised, shared databases that are updated and verified by the community of users. Using Smart Contract Business Logic can be automated in the Blockchain for verification by Public Administrators, leading to substantial cost and time savings.

- 3. Data Integrity and Reliability According to Oz Nathan et al. in “Decentralizing Privacy: Using Blockchain to Protect Personal Data”[23]centralized organizations including Public Sectorgather large quantities of personal and sensitive information. The individuals have limited control over the data and how it is used.[5]. In continuation, Nathan et al. continue to create Blockchain based frameworks where the Users have full control of their data and do not need to trust third parties with their information. As mentioned by Ahmed Alketbi et.al in[2] a key advantages of the Blockchain is that it is resistant to outages due to its Decentralized architecture. Known Challenges of Blockchain with Government Right to Forget & Data Portability

- 4. User Privacy Also as mentioned in[17], Blockchain is expected to increase the reliability of information through use of consensus mechanisms which ensure that information exchange happens only upon getting consent from all relevant parties. As mentioned in[2] the Blockchain promises data integrity and prevention of the unauthorized change of data by the use cryptography. Security is maintained through decentralized Ledgers which are controlled by a consortium and not Individual Owners. Blockchain is very good at creating trusted audit trails of information, making it simple to create platforms to track when and where data was entered. 5. Decentralized Access Control Paradoxically, blockchain also make it relatively easy to keep data both private and easily shareable. Depending on how a system is designed, administrators can develop complex permission schemes to control who has access to what kinds of information, what can be shared by whom, and so on. In contrast to databases, Blockchain enables such capabilities among large, diverse groups without relying on or having to trust a single authority to do the job. In the paper [23] Nathan et. have created a novel Blockchain based Framework where access-control policies would be securely stored on a blockchain and only the authorized users are allowed to change it.

GDPR applies to Personal Data including data which has been Pseudo Anonymized. It is applicable for 3rd party entities which own Subscriber Data known as “Data Controllers”. GDPR enforces that all private data be pseudo anonymized and only minimal data be shared with 3rd Parties. One of the key components of this is the “Right To Be Forgotten” i.e. when the individual removes his consent from the organization, it should be immediately deleted from the system. However, the key attribute of Blockchain is immutability which opposes the Right to Forget.

# Lack of Trusted Information

- 78% of the land is unregistered in Ghana[9] ● In Haiti, a large earthquake in 2010 destroyed all the municipal buildings that stored documents[6]

- In India, millions of rural families lack legal ownership of the land they work on.

## Figure 3: Ownership Based Blockchain Quadrant

Ownership Based Blockchain Frameworks The below diagram depicts the Blockchain Quadrant based on Ownership and highlights key characteristics for each:

# Permissionless Blockchains

Permissionless Blockchains have Public Ownership and are open and transparent. As mentioned in [14] if anyone can join the Blockchain, it is called Permissionless and such networks are highly censorship resistant. However, they are relatively slower compared to Permissioned Blockchains.

# Public Permissionless Blockchain

These are publicly accessible to everybody. Any participant can record transactions, take part in the validation of the blocks or read data in the Blockchain. Consensus is reached through protocols like Proof of Work or Proof of Stake where any of the participants can start a node and start recording transactions. Bitcoin and Ethereum are the most common examples of Public Permissionless Blockchains. However, these have limitations on number of Transactions supported

per second[15]. All Users have access for Read and Write in the public Permissionless Blockchain.

Private Permissionless Blockchain In these there is no restriction on which participan t can take part in the Consensus Mechanism. However there is restriction on who can read and write the content in the Blockchain. Permissioned blockchains Permissioned Blockchains typically have Private Membership, are trusted and overcome the Performance problem of Permissionless Blockchains.Governance is closed and the network of nodes is permissioned and new nodes can only join with permission from the validator nodes as mentioned in [15] Public Permissioned Blockchain Public Permissioned have rules that determine who can take part in the validation process and start nodes.Whitelisted nodes can participate in the Consensus Mechanism. This is normally used by Public institutions like Government Agencies, Corporates or Educational Institutes. The owner creates Validator Nodes that define the Governance

rules for the Blockchain including parties that can create new nodes or write to the Blockchain However, read access is available to all making the Blockchai n publicly accessible as mentioned in [15]. Private Permissioned Blockchain These Blockchains are controlled by Unique group of one or many owners who decide participants in the Consensus Mechanism. Only a select group of whitelisted users can read or write to these Blockchains as is suggested in [11].These are typically a network of partners that are connected through Business

Operations and benefit by sharing data in an immutable database. As mentioned in [15], if public verifiability of the records is not required then Private Permissioned Blockchain should be considered. As described in [3], Hyperledger the most popular Permissioned Blockchain can scale up to 3500 TPS.

Blockchain Framework Based on Ownership Based on the above analysis, the below matrix captures a framework to capture the Blockchain characteristics based on Application Business requirements:

# Implementation Use Case

# Land Registries Georgia[20]

Land Registration process in Georgia cost varied from 50-200$ and a Minimum of 1 Days. The average price of Registration is expected to come down to 5-10 cents per Registry after the pilot launch. Georgia had maintained a verified account of land titles in its NAPR database, which was crucial for the success of a Blockchain project. Bitfury did not attempt to build a brand new Blockchain based land registry. It only created a time stamping layer on top of the existing digital land records of NAPR. As part of the proposed Phase 2, Georgian citizens will be able to access their property information on the NAPR website and put it up for sale. The network nodes verify that the buyer has sufficient funds and that the seller owns the property before the transaction is concluded.

According to consulting firm McKinsey due to distortion created by large-scale corruption and inefficiency in India's land markets has shaved 1.3% off the country's GDP every year, Earlier, farmers had to pay a document writer up to 70USD or more to prepare registration papers. Blockchain is now facilitating automated documents at zero cost. Not to reduce transaction time, QR Code marked documents are transferred directly to the registrar's office at the time of appointment.

Private Blockchain which has a total of 58 attributes such as names, mobile numbers, boundaries with latitude and longitude coordinates, Aadhaar numbers,neighbouring plots, roads etc. are linked to each property and recorded in the Blockchain.

Estonia has E-Residency for foreign nationals also enabled on Blockchain called ID- Kaarts[21]

As mentioned in [21], Estonia uses 2048 Bit Encryption to guarantee privacy for its citizens. Document Hashes are stored in the Blockchain which are protected by KSI Keys.

Visa Applications, Payments of Bills, License Renewal. Plans to save 1.5 Billion$ every year by the use of Blockchain

As mention in [2] Dubai Government plans to use IoT integrated with Blockchain for Smart Cities

(a) Owner: Can be owned by None or by a Consortium based on the Regulatory and Privacy requirements of the Application. (b) Transaction Volumes in TPS: Refers to the theoretical maximum amount of Transactions Per Second that a Consensus Protocol can achieve as mentioned in Comparative Analysis of Blockchain Algorithms[18]. As described by Thurimella et. Al in [22] a key factor going down for Public Blockchains is the ability to support higher Volumes of Transactions. (c) Anonymity Requirements: Based on Business

Requirements, data in the Blockchain can either be available for read to all Users or to a select group of users based on Access Rights. As mentioned in Global Benchmarking Study[7], Transactionsdata need to have a certain level of privacy; on the contrary, in pub lic blockchains, by design all transactions should be visible to every participant. (d) Need for Shared Write Access: Based on the Business requirements, some or all Users will have Write Access. In the consortium, it is possible that Read Access is granted to all members, but Write Access is granted only to limited Super Users.

(e) Business Rules Complexity: As described by Thurimella et. Al in [22], since in a Permissioned Blockchain, the participants have given permission upfront it is much easier to build innovative applications.In Permissionless Blockchains, since the Nodes are run by multiple owners, to make any change in the Business Rules implemented by Smart Contracts, it needs to be accepted by majority of Node Owners before the Business Change can be implemented in the complete Blockchain. As mentioned in [1] it is difficult to enforce laws in a Permissionless blockchain on individuals without impacting the whole blockchain Infrastructure. (f) Time for Contract Closure: As mentioned in Global Benchmarking Study[7] it is mandatory for enterprise applications that once transactions are confirmed t hey cannot be reversed. In Public Blockchains, settleme nt finality is only probabilistic since an alternate long chain can reverse the current transactions. 8. Framework Verification through Case Study In order to verify, the mapping Framework for Business Requirements based on ownership and the Blockchain Framework, we shall apply real world Use Cases where Blockchain Frameworks were used to solve Business problems globally by Government.

were listed on a ledger containing all the previous results. In one Use case the participants were asked to choose if temporary accommodation should be provided in case the residential building in which they live is demolished.The popular polls were reported to have participation of up to 220,000.The platform peaked at approximately 1000 transactions per minute. It was public Blockchain access to all citizens, however citizens had to download node software for getting permission to join. As mentioned by Talib et al in [2] voting can be done in Blockchain for complex discussions to maintain democracy.

Land registry – Ubiquity in Brazil As highlighted by Victoria L. Lemieux in [12] in April 2017 Ubiquity announced a pilot project to create a blockchain based registry to lower costs and improve transparency.

This was developed on Bitcoin for transaction recording as a Public Permissionless Blockchain. It used “Colored” Coins to tokenize the land and has a Web based front end to capture information. Multi Sig wallets were used when multiple parties need to be involved in case of Transaction Sale and Purchase.

activities for Health Care are maintained in the blockchain. All users have secure authentication using either there ID Card or the Mobile Number. It is used to perform digital timestamp of the records and stored securely through cryptographic hashing.As mentioned in in [5], the digital hash of the document is stored the Permissioned Blockchain using KSI technology.

- 9. Summary The literature review focusses on an objective

assessment of the potential use cases of Blockchain in Government, the categorization of the Use Cases based on the functionality, and then a subjective framework that helps identify the best Blockchain framework to be applied based on the application Use Case. The applicability of the same has been verified through real world scenarios. There can be further research done on the same to extend the Blockchain categorization based on Consensus Protocols underlying the Blockchain technology.

A Study on the Impact of Demographic Factors on Group Performance of Neighbourhood Groups

# Rajeev G* Prof. C. Suriyaprakash. PhD**

# Abstract

This paper analyses the impact of demographic facto rs on the Neighbourhood Group (NHG)performance of Kudumbashree in Trivandrum, Ker ala. The results showed that there is significant difference between that performances of the groups as the demographic factors differ. Analysis were done on the survey data collected fro m NHG.The paper also throws light on the aspects of homogeneity parameters which might have to be relooked while constituting the groups. Key factors like education and age are some very important aspects which can be used effectively to constitute the group.The authorities also can lo ok at focal points which if intervened can considerably improve the performance. The purpose o f joining the group also can be looked upon while considering the homogeneity. Paper focuses on demographics as the homogeneity is often overlooked and taken for granted in group formation which needs to be inquired.

## Key Words: NHG, Performance, Demographic, Homogeneity, Improve, Formation

- 1. Introduction Self Help Group was first started as a concept by National Bank of Agriculture and Rural Development (NABARD) in 1986 on an experimental basis and it was implemented in 1991.SHGs were started with a view to contribute to the alleviation of poverty. SHG- Bank linkage programme was launched in 1992.SHGs were conceived to enable the access to finance for the poor who cannot otherwise borrow from banks because of lack of collaterals.SHGs were initially formed t o grow and sustain as independent financial institutions (Tapadhan Roy,Kaushik Sen, 2015). But its popularity and acceptance lead to Government offering subsidies to the groups. SHGs are formed by women and is also act as a tool to support and empower the poor women in the society. SHGs as compared to other Models such as

JLG(Joint Liability Group), has got broader objectives to fulfill. Beyond the narrow confines of financial objectives SHGs (S K Sharma, M. Mehta, 2014) SHGs focus is on building the capacity of the members and empowerment of women in the family and the society. Because of this it requires a federating structure entrenched in the society unlike the JLG.

SHG’s performance should be understood more deeply as there are evidences from various studies which suggest that the SHGs have not met its goals in women empowerment and well being looking from the perspective of status change this is studied by (Rahman,1998) that 60% of loans are used by their husbands. (Ranjula Swain,2007) opines that the meaning of empowerment is rather complex to explain and in stricter sense women are not

1.2 SHGs Role and Functioning SHGs are primarily formed for the empowerment of marginalized in the society. They are informal associations formed for reaping the economic and social benefits through solidarity and mutual support. Kudumbasree also follows the concept of SHGs for bringing prosperity to poor women in Kerala. Even

though Kudumbashree intends to instill and develop entrepreneurial spirit in poor woman who then can drive the prosperity in their family. SHGs are democratic in its functioning and is built on mutua l trust and support. Here women from similar financial background come together to solve their issues which primarily arises out of financial reasons (Planning Commission Report, 2008). Kudumbasree has a federal structure which has got three tiers with Neighbourhood Group at the bottom and ADS in the second tier an CDS at the top. (Panchayath level) (Jacob John, 2009) Kudumbasree is also characterized by the involvement of local

government hence the planning is done locally and supporting interventions are made more effectively. SHGs enables the rural poor in creating linkages with the formal credit institutions which otherwise wouldn’t have been possible because of lack of collaterals and lack of steady income flow.

1.3 The Three-Tier Framework The 3 tier framework of Kudumbashree CBO structure is shown below. The 3 levels of the structure are the Neighborhood Groups (NHG), Area Development Societies (ADS) and Community Development Societies (CDS).

The literature available even though is scant specifically in the context of Neighborhood Groups (NHGs) in Kerala, it helps in understanding the factors that affect the group performance. The factors identified through the review of literature are multi-dimensional in nature and hence has given a new dimension to the study. Relevance of the variables are studied empirically and through qualitative survey prior to the building of model. The variables are extracted from various studies based on their correlation and relevance to NHG performance.

2.1 SHG performance SHGs are formed with the objective of eradication of poverty in the society through the empowerment of women. This is so much so as a country the women should be brought to the forefront Performance of the SHGs are closely connected to the alleviation of poverty and improvement of financial and social status. Therefore it is very important that the SHG performance be measured comprehensively. Unfortunately, most of the studies held are focused on the financial parameters and leave the organizational and social parameters which leads to narrow and incomplete assessment of the group performance.

In a study conducted by (S.C Bharamappanavara etal., 2015), it is concluded that Organizational and soci o economic factors influences the SHG performance. Study concluded that there is positive correlation between overall group performance and organizational parameters like attendance, transparency, trust,decision making with consensus etc.

2.2 Demographic variables and group performance Manimekalai and Rajeshwari (2001)showed in their studies that SHGs have improved their performance when they were provided loans and the groups have also developed belongingness and attained skills which lead to increased performance.

In a study conducted in Karnataka (Nagaraj, N; et al, 2009) it is inferred that education plays an important role in group performance. But here the case is such that the area of study is conducted in Hatenhalli which has a literacy rate of only 21%.In our study the ar ea under study has a literacy rate of more than 95% and hence the validity of the result may not be significant.

In a study conducted in Bihar(Meena et al.,2011) there is a positivecorrelation between education and training to the attitude of group members.Education and training seem to have lead to an increased performance of SHGs.

Singh Y K et al. (2007) A study conducted by in Moradabad showed that age is negatively correlated with group cohesiveness and performance while education is positively correlated to group performance.

Khaki, A R and Sanghmi, M( 2012), In an empirical assessment done the purpose of borrowing by SHGs is predominantly found to be for family related needs.This has been validated and found true in most of the studies with exceptions.

demographic aspects are vital while constructing th e group which often are not considered with enough importance.

- 4. Objectives of the study This study analyses the correlation between Demographics and Group Performance.

- 1. To analyze the demographic variables of NHGs of Kudumbashree

Anshuman Sahoo(2013) in his paper presents that younger and older women are less interested in joining the groups as compared to the women in the agre group of 30-45 years.This is mostly true in the case of Kudumbasree also.

J.M Saraswathi et al (2014) in her descriptive stud y conducted in Northern and Southern part of Karnataka suggested that the purpose of SHG members joining the group, for financial security and for their children’s education. It is also found th at almost 50% of the women participate in income generating activities and 5% joined to avoid boredom.

Lina Joy, Prema A and S.Krishnan (2008) in their study concluded that experience has more effect than age on group performance..

S.M Feroze, A.K Chauhan, R. Malhothra in their studies concluded that homogeneity and peer pressure lead to increased repayment performance and hence better group performance.The paper further discusses that the homogeneity in demographic variables and organizational variables lead to better information sharing and lesser information asymmetry thus leading to better group performance.

- 2. To study the correlation between the demographic variables and group performance

- 5. Research Methodology and Data Analysis Primary data is collected through questionnaire survey among NHGs in selected Panchayaths. Secondary data is collected from Kudumbashree and from District panchayath offices in Trivandrum.Samples were collected from both rural and urban NHGs. Study is descriptive in nature. Focus group interviews were conducted at Krishibhavans mostly co-ordinated by the agriculture officers at respective panchayaths. Total sample size is 487 which is collected from rural an d urban NHGs. (Neighbourhood Groups). Questionnaire is prepared and tested and a survey has been done using the same. Sampling method used is stratified sampling. The demographic variables considered for the study are Caste, Social status, Number of members, Age, Purpose of Joining, Education etc. These are grouped into categories.

Descriptive and quantitative analysis has been conducted. Tests used to prove the hypotheses are t-test, anova , post-hoc multiple comparisons and mean plots to understand the differences between and within the groups.

- 3. Problem Definition Neighbourhood Groups when constructed it is seen that the group members are in general homogenous in many aspects. But many studies across continents have shown that the demographic factors has an impact on the performance of the group. Kudumbashree inspite of its success seems to have plateaued and there seems to have a lack of direction going forward. These

5.1 Hypotheses Hypotheses are derived from the objectives and are tested to arrive at the conclusions.The null hypotheses are

The ANOVA table suggests that the significance value is less than .05 and hence there is significant difference between the performance of groups when education

status of group members changes.[F(2,484) = 186.7, p<.05%]. Null hypothesis is rejected. Hence it is inferred that

This is the table that shows the output of the ANOVA analysis and whether there is a statistically significant difference between group means. We can see that the significance value is 0.000 (i.e., p = .000), which is below 0.05. and, therefore, there is a statistically significant association between the Member’s performance and social status/caste. This is great to know, but we do not know which of the specific groups differed. Hence, we use find this out in the Multiple Comparisons table which contains the results of the Tukey post hoc test.

Post Hoc Tests From the results so far, we know that there are statistically significant differences between the groups as a whole. The table below, Multiple Comparisons, shows which groups differed from each other. The Tukey post hoc test is generally the preferred test for conducting post hoc tests on a one-way ANOVA, but there are many others. We can see from the table below that there is a there is no significance in the Gro up Performances between the SC/ST, OBC and Gen.

As we have found a statistically significant result we need to do post hoc tests.Tukey post hoc tests are used to compare each of the conditions to every other condition. A Tukey post hoc test revealed that the age group <30 (1.914 ± .45 min, p<.05) is significantly different from 30-50 (3.95 ±, 43 min, p < .05) and >50(2.82 ± .23 min,P<.05). A comparison of

30-50(3.95 ±, 43 min, p < .05) also is found to be significantly different when compared to <30 (1.914 ± .45 min, p<.05) and >50(2.82 ± .23 min,P<.05). The third pair wise comparison of >50(2.82 ± .23 min,P<.05) is found to be significantly different from the other two groups.

have significant impact on group performance. Group Performance can be improved if changes are made in the demographic factors. Better education is positively linked to Group Performance and groups consisting of members with better education shows better mean performance. Caste and age are also seem to show correlations to Group Performance. The results suggests that there are factors which if intervened by the authorities significantly contributes positivel y to Group Performance.Among such factors, education with emphasis on skill enhancement and a good orientation to members on income generation with respect to opportunities available can be two prime

areas of focus which can yield positive results in group performance. The study revealed that the group while homogeneity is critical it is found that homogeneity doesn’t help if the group members are all less educated. In such cases a mix of members in terms of education can be included. It is also observed that many a time caste becomes a criterion for group formation which should not be the case as socially backward castes need some handholding which can be done from the members of other castes who are better off. Thus right interventions in terms of sk ill training and group constitution can positively impact the performance.

Innovation and Sustainability: The Story of Indian QSR Foodbox Dr. Shruti Tripathi* Dr. Rashmi Rai**

Abstract Sustainopreneurship is a neologism created by mergi ng the words sustainability and entrepreneurship. Today as the world is moving towards the fourth industrial revolution it has now become imperative for businesses to come up with ne w ideas which can sustain in future. The economy also values such people who can turn our day to day concerns into business opportunities. So was the intent of Mr Satish Chamyvelumani, Found er of Foodbox: “The idea was to serve people with food from their favourite brands while on the move.” In recent years, there have been great strides in the field of food technology. One such stride was made by Satish Chamyvelumani, who is a pioneer in a complete “Indian” Quick Service Restaurant sector. The global market research organization CRISIL st ates that the Indian QSR is largely dominated by international players (>65%).The reason lies in their western menu which has high shelf life, is compatible with the cold storage set-up, prepared with few ingredients and goes well with quick to serve menu. The present case is about an out and out Indian player in QSR sector- Foodbox now known as Frshly. It not only defies the set pattern of international brands but also food retail. It has made a significant entry keeps itself ahead of them by opting innovation in through its speed, hygiene, packaging and above all the Indian-ness of its menu in this format, which until now is first of its kind. There is also international brands go for casual dining category; it takes care of the utility segment-the working class which requires it as a second option to home-made food in form of lunch/dinner. It is also not an app based model which we generally find in food tech business rather it is more on the ground model. The innovation comes in the form of the dispenser which dishes out food within 90 seconds fresh and hot! Key Words: QSR,Innovation, Automated Food Dispenser, World Cla ss Packaging, Multiple

“We have an online monitoring system that sends alerts when stocks are low and keeps a watch on when food is packed” – Rajasekaran Mathuram (M), CTO.

- 1. Introduction What seems to be a scene out of a sci-fi has come true for commuters at Chennai’s Koyambedu bus stand, simply by entering few commands on the touch screen,

# Volume 6 Issue 1

# January - December, 2019

# ISSN 2393-9451

swiping the ATM card, the food arrives on a conveyor belt in just 90 seconds. It surprises many at the b usy bus stand atChennai. The machine contends with several eateries at the terminus and roadside food vendors to win over the customer’s palate.

- 2. Quick Service Restaurant (QSR) The concept of fast food culture started from North America where people have very busy and fast life style. In our country two types of format dominate the fast food market QSR and street food. QSR as the name suggests marked not only by speed but also low cost and uniformity. It is also defined by pre-prepared and ready to serve food without too many interventions at the order time and standardized systems and processes. The branded QSRs open many outlets to make the overheads affordable.In India the fast food market is around two decades old and it started with McDonalds and has largely been dominated by international giants like Mc Donalds, KFC, Dominos and Pizza Hut. The menu popular amongst all isvarieties of burger, Pizza and Chow Mein. It is interesting to note that the international QSR s are more famous for their non-veg varieties whereas the Indian QSRs like Haldiram’s, Bikanerwalas and Sagar Ratnas are popular for their vegetarian menus.

CRISIL reports that the rise in the expense on dining he out specially in tier 2 cities is also boosted by t increase usage of smart phone food apps, growth in incomes resulting in increase in disposable incomes , changing lifestyle and eating patterns, increased consumer awareness to maintain the life style status and, importantly, greater accessibility of QSR outlets.

- 3. Foodbox The makers of AtchayamFoodbox, as the machine is called, claim that it is a first of its kind concept in the food and retailindustry world andthat it’s not t just a vending machine. “This is like an ATM where you withdraw cash by yourself,” says SatishChamyVelumani, the founder and CEO. “Some people call it’s a vending machine but it’s a lot more than that, it’s an ‘intelligent restaurant’.”

The problem sows the seed of the new idea. As child when Satish used to travel long distances he enjoye d the trip but worry about the food, its availability and hygiene. The problem led him to ponder about the ways he could enjoy fast and hygienic food while travelling,from trustedsources. This thought was put through extensive research to get converted into Foodbox.

India beinga young and developing country has embraced urbanization of living style very fast.Thi s young population is the main consumer of the QSR. The quick service outlets have thrived in India because of the nuclear family systems, women working and having financial independence, expanding middle class, urbanization, youth spending due to peer pressure and better logistics. All this contributing to make the market of QSR worth of 8,500 crores and with the current compounded annual growth rate of 25 %( Assocham) it is likely to touch 25,000 crores by 2020.

The above mentioned statistics reflect the growing demand of quick service restaurants and fast food chains in the country. Also to be noticed is the fa ct that despite economic slowdown this sector has clearly escaped the trend. Food being a basic necessity it will always be a priority.

Foodbox, an automated eatery point which serves everything from light tiffin to complete meal combo packs from leading restaurants. Itserves simple yet important need to get quick hygienic food on the go without the risk of missing the train.

- By 2015, Chamyvelumani set up six more across Bengaluru, Hyderabad and Chennai.

## development positions with Lenovo, Group M, Cavin Kare and CRI pumps.

- 5. The Journey The CEO, Satish Chamy Velumani - holds masters’ degrees in science (majoring in engineering) and business administration (both from the US) - worked at 3M for about eleven years, before returning to India to establish Atchayam Business Solutions. When Satish C Velumani set out with his idea, he knew technology would form the backbone of the venture and counted on his engineering background and experience as project manager at 3M to help. But that’s when he discovered that the technology he sought didn’t exist. The next three years were spent in developing the technology and giving concrete shape to the concept.Besides him, the core team of Atchayam’s Foodbox (which was conceptualized in late 2010) comprises Ramesh Narayanan, co-founder and chief financial officer, and Rajsekar Mathuram, CTO (Chief Technology Officer). The position of CTO is justified by the fact that the whole concept revolves around the robust use of technology. The CFO is a chartered accountant and has been running a business process outsourcing (BPO) firm in Chennai for a decade, and the CTO, who holds a masters’ degree in science (majoring in computer science) and worked at Verizon (a global leader in delivering innovation in communications, information and entertainment) in India and the United States for over twelve years before joining Atchayam.

Ramesh Narayan, co-founder and CFO, Atchayam Foodbox says, “Investment was in R and D. We are still researching on the techniques. Total investme nt is Rs 5 crore. We are planning on multiple versions of it. It’s just a beginning. Encouraged with the response from its first Food Box, Atchayam founders are now planning units at Chennai central station and the airport.The longer-term plan is to go national and so, the next time you’re traveling in Chennai, you now know where to grab a bite.”

- 6. The Organization Structure and Design and Operational Efficiency The organization is flat and doesn’t have much of a hierarchy. It has the CFO, CTO, CSMO (Chief Sales and Marketing Officer) and Operations manager reporting to CEO along with an HR executive and an Engineer. Managers and executives in each function report into their respective chiefs.

As aCEO of this organization, Satish C. Velumanicreates leaders at every single level. To achieve this, they have adopted a matrix organization where every individual with potential is given a program leadership responsibility. Regardless of the hierarchy, everyone reports in to the program manager as they work on that program. They have several programs running at the same time. So, a leader automatically becomes a follower (in another program) and vise-a- versa. This completely eliminates hierarchy and improves efficiency it also helps the organization to drive ahead at a much higher speed than their competitors. The small but strong team helps the organization to be focused on the future plans to expand.

- 7. The Location The location of outlets and partner restaurants is key part of the Foodbox business model. While the first was set up at the DLF IT Park, the second is at Koyambedu, Chennai’s busiest bus terminal. The founders were clear in their parameters for finding strategic locations. The locations of both the joints are near to the sourcing restaurants and also have high footfall. The company uses the “Real-Win-Worth analysis” (extensively used by companies like 3M on over 1500 projects bringing profit and success, See Exhibit-1) to determine the feasibility of location and launch.

Foodbox increases, Atchayam should be able to scale operations significantly, bringing down costs even lower in the next couple of years.”

At the Atchayam Food Box at DLF IT Park and Koyambeduomni bus stand, customers can walk in and leave with the food in less than five minutes.

To enable people to use food box at public places like bus stand or railway station, they also have an option where people can pay money to the staff at the counter, who in turn provide them with a Foodbox card that they can swipe to get the food. The entire box can hold 225 food packs at one time. Sales at Koyambedu is currently 70-80 packs per day and at DLF IT Park it’s anywhere between 200 and 300.

- 8. The Intelligent Restaurant The Koyambedu joint is a bright, air-conditioned nook in the not-so-salubrious environs near the bus terminus, and overlooks the grim wholesale vegetable market. Tucked into a small kiosk at the entrance of Hotel Chennai Deluxe, the ‘Food Box’ is a large, automated vending machine that issues set meals sourced from restaurants across the city. A hulking red- and-yellow contraption, it takes up almost a fourth of the space. Payment can be by card or cash. Barcodes match the order to the right tray inside the food box, and then begins the fun. It’s a concept wherein food is brought from a number of eateries. It cuts down the time spent waiting for an order to arrive. Moreover it is affordable. And most importantly, it keeps in mind the health of the consumers too - on board is a team of nutritionists that strives to make each meal nutritious, without compromising on the taste.

machine and choose their preferred restaurant along with their choice of pre-determined food combinations. And within 90 seconds, piping hot food in neat packaging slides out of the dispenser, removing human intervention in the entire food packaging and delivery process. It gives convenience to customers. The packing and delivery is also automated and it’s compact and convenient. Consumers can stand in the queue to receive their order and go upstairs where they can dine.”

When a customer chooses the meal from the touch screen and pays for it, the combo number is sent to a computer that directs a robotic arm to match it with the barcode on the right food tray from cold storage. It then travels on an automated conveyor belt where a device pierces holes on the cover of the tray, after which it goes into a microwave and comes out on the same belt piping hot. On receiving an order, the combo number is sent to a computer that directs a robotic arm to pick the right box from cold storage. A conveyor belt takes it to the microwave oven and then to the dispenser. At a time it handles two orders.

The outlet has two screens that clearly explain the process of ordering in three steps. Step 1: Select th e food from the menu displayed on the screen. 2: Pay the bill using any credit or debit card or by cash to the staff behind the screens, who use the food-box card and swipes it. A printed bill with an order code comes out. 3: Take the bill and watch the screen for the order number and then get the food coming out on the conveyer belt. All it takes is 90 seconds.”We did a six- month due diligence on food testing. The food still remains good for eight hours but we have programmed the machine early as we are very conscious about the quality,” says Velumani.

After extensive research and planning Food Box came into realityand the outcome was an intelligent food dispenser. Not only does the dispenser keep the food fresh, the meal is served piping hot like in any of thefavorite restaurants. The system is also designed to never serve food that is approaching the end of its shelf life- ensuring that the food at Foodbox is always fresh.

“My first question was – does the technology for an automated restaurant even exist,” says Satish. As it turns out it didn’t and the toughest, fiddliest part of t heir job was putting it all together. “And now we have India’s first fully automated, multi-brand, food retail- facilitator,” he says, with a dramatic sweep of his hand.

meal. The meals are then stored in a climate-controlled, automated system which heats the food just before serving. It is the coolest part of the establishment. There are rows upon rows of slots, 250 of them, stacked with trays here. The dishes like curd rice are issued in a separate container as it can’t be heated. The automated system allows constant replenishment of food, based on stock and demand thereby minimizing wastage. The online monitoring system sends alerts when stocks are low and keeps a watch on when the food is packed. Though the food trays come with an eight-hour expiry, it automatically stops selling a ny food item that is beyond six hours to ensure qualit y. Till the lid is opened, no can touch the food after being sent off from the restaurants. Everything is automated. The meals are packed in 100% virgin polypropylene, food-grade packaging materials at the

partnering restaurants.

Un-bought food goes back to the restaurants; they bear the food cost while Atchayam is responsible for transport and packaging. Other expenses include rental for the location and the cost of the machine. Its revenue: a share on every sold meal. The average ticket size of a meal is Rs 130, of which Atchayam gets Rs 40 as facilitation fee.

Thetravelers also order by phone or online, and meals are delivered to them at their seat in the bus. For the moment, however, novelty outweighs utility at the Food Box. Most customers prefer to eat at the spot.

The Foodbox was designed at Synetics Automation, Coimbatore, but the software was put together by the company’s CTO, Rajasekaran Mathuram.

- 10. Funds Now, Atchayam is working on reducing the cost of its equipment, which will help it achieve break even faster. Currently, store break-even at the operating level takes six to 12 months, depending on location and size. While the first machine cost the firm nearly Rs 35 Lakh to set up because of the learning (technology) and subsequent corrections, it has since come down to Rs 14-15 Lakh. The aim is to lower the cost further to Rs 10 Lakh in the next year. Chamyvelumani has also applied for a patent for the technology, both in India and overseas. Foodboxstarted with Rs 4 crore from funding through family and friends and a private investor in the US . Now, it is looking for its next round of funding not only pan-India through tie-up with local restaurants but also in Singapore and West Asia. That means reaching out to more cities and restaurants across border also. “We see ourselves as facilitators for restaurant chains while solving an age-old problem of travelling families,” Satish Chamy Velumani says. For expansion, the Company takes the help of venture capitalists and angel investors to raise funds. Restaurants like the model because it increases sale s without too much investment. “Their packaging technology is superior. Also, we have restrictions in terms of having outlets in places such as railway stations and bus stands. This box can be set up easily,” says KT Srinivasa Raja, managing director of Adyar Ananda Bhavan. “For us, it saves the cost on establishing retail outlets. Once they reach the scale, I see a big scope for their service.” Therefore, it’s a win-win-win situation for partnering restaurants, customers and Foodbox. What is exciting and revolutionary about Atchayam’s Foodbox? The sustainability Factor:

- Multiple Restaurants at one place. Order from multiple restaurants & pick up at one point. It empowers and creates an ecosystem for the restaurants for a wider out-reach to its consumers and tap new markets.

- With the help of IoT (Internet of things) it makes a User-Friendly Ordering Station for better services.

- Ultra Quick Service - The food delivery mechanism is not just intelligent-it’s really fast. 90 seconds is the average time taken to serve a meal!

- Easy to use.

Indian dishes in erstwhile westernized fast food market.

- The model of this concept is sustainable not only in terms of packaging and maintaining the quality but also it provides a unique economic model which requires minimal investment and benefits its partners to get higher revenues. It gives its consumers an open transparent platform to assess the best food and compare it against their own set of parameters. Thus, giving the consumers a free choice.

- 11. Future Plans: The Journey of Foodbox to Frshly The company with its plan to go international has also changed its name from FoodBox to Frshly. As the name Foodbox denotes frozen food in international market. So Frshly is the new name adopted by the founders for Foodbox.

- Foodbox is a retail facilitator. It feeds people local dishes on the move. Fresh and fast is the unique selling proposition (USP).Thereby, saving the most important resource, time. ● Automated Food Dispenser. ● Takeaway Friendly world class packaging assuring fresh and hygienic food made from 100% virgin food grade material.

At present there are 15 outlets of Frshly in Chennai and Bengaluru with expansion plans to move towards Delhi, Mumbai and Pune corporate and IT parks and food courts in shopping malls as possible locations to set up outlets.

The company is looking to install such automated delivery mechanism devices at airports, bus depots and railway stations and is in talks with the concerned authorities.

Atchayam has already tied up with the second largest online ticketing portal for buses in India -Ticket Goose, where customers can order food online and have it

delivered to their seats. The same comfort that an airline passenger gets, choosing from the menu and getting a hot meal at their seats. The firm is also in talks with the railways to set up its next Foodbox at Chennai Central. “We are also looking to take the machine to trade shows and exhibitions,” says Chamyvelumani.

The company is eying about 500+ stores in the next 5 years. Foodbox is the best alternate for a place where a food court is not practical.

The model allowssetting up a national or even global chain by collaborating with local vendors (in each region).

The model works on collaboration basis and being innovative, it has no competitors also. So the competition comes from other food options available at each locality. However, the choices (multiple restaurants under one roof) and convenience (best in class packaging, super fast delivery, and fully automated delivery for consistency and improved hygiene) are our biggest advantages over others.

- 12. Conclusion The largest band like Dominos having over 750 outlets in over 150 cities works on casual dining and delivery model. Its menu is restricted and dominated by different variety of pizzas. The second largest player Subway also has casual dining model but the ordering process is very lengthy; sandwiches made to order with 30 different options for a single sub! Faaso’s which is the biggest Indian fast food player has 64 outlets across India but it only dishes out wraps and not the complete Indian meal. Travel Khana which falls in the category of travel food has an online ordering portal for fo od delivery by restaurants only in trains is restricted by minimum order quantity ranging from Rs. 150 to Rs. 500 depending on the restaurant/city. Therefore, the concept of aggregation for fresh food and delivery through fully automated outlets is something that has never been done before. The customer gets his favorite restaurants’ food all un der one roof, for about the same price. The restaurants can reach more customers (outlets) without incurring any additional fixed cost. So this is a true gain for all (including the business).

It also gets a competitive edge over other QSR players e that by the fact that the international players hav found it relatively difficult to adapt Indian food into an assembly line production model. They are at ease to offer foreign cuisine which can be served quickl y, and is more amenable to the cold storage format and a centralized kitchen.

## Competency Models for Training & Development: A Review

## Swati Bhatia* Dr. D. N. Rao** Dr. (Maj) Deepak Bhatia***

# Abstract

Business and industry have been using and applying different competency models for developing job profile, recruitment & selection process, train ing & development programs, training needs analysis, learning &development programs, performance appraisal, succession planning and viz. a viz. Competency-based approaches and models are becoming an answer to the organization’s expectations in all fields (public and private) to increase the products’ quality and employees’ capacity. Competency models are based on the idea that there is a productive relationship between employee competency and their deliverables.

Dubois and Rothwell define competencies as, “characteristics that individuals possess and use in appropriate and consistent ways to achieve desired performance. These characteristics include knowledge, skills & traits, social motives, thought thinking.” Many researchers have shown growing interest in the development and nurturing of competency models to enhance organizational output. A competency model “is a descriptive tool that identifies the competencies needed to operate in a specific role within a job, occupation or organization etc.”

## patterns, mindsets, self image and ways of

In the present scenario, it has become highly criti cal for organizations to lay emphasis on the aspect of developing competency model to identify key competencies which are required for any business to thrive. The objective of this research paper is to review the competency models and link it to the training and development models in practice.

## Key Words: Competency Model, Training, Skills, Human Resource,ETA

- 1. Introduction

The evolution of competency models over a period of time has highlighted that the employees’ workplace is flooded with a multitude of complexities. The significance of competency management became

widely accredited with the works of McClleland (1973) which advocated the measurement of competencies. He recommended that though intelligence influences performance, personal characteristics, such as individual’s motivation and self-image differentiate successful from unsuccessful performance. Furthermore, Parry defines competency as “a cluster of related knowledge, skills and attitudes that affect a role, which correlates with its performance on the job and can be measured against accepted standards and can be improved via training and development.”

Several organizations are embracing and implementing suitable competency models to empower its workforce in order to enhance its competitive advantage,

innovation and effectiveness. Competency models serve a number of purposes such as a guiding tool to hire, train and create a highly effective tool of human resource. They also facilitate cohesive work environmentand create a productive work place. In the context of this research article, it should be noted that the term competence model, refers to the sets of competencies and characteristics forming the competency model. Moreover, it is “a standardized description of specific activities and competencies within a context (considering both the people and work performance perspective) that are necessary to function as a professional in a particular field.

Abraham, Karns, Shaw, and Mena (2001) reviewed US firms based on capabilities they thought about valuable for effective administrators and assessed whether firms utilized those skills in evaluating their directors.

Boyatzis (1982) planned his administrative competency model by examining more than 2,000 directors and discovered in excess of 100 potential administrative abilities. Hollenbeck, McCall, and Silzer (2006) expressed that the competency model can’t be viewed as a solution for effective initiative, however a push to catch pioneers’ involvement, learning’s, an d information.

- 2. Review of Literature Thomas N. Garavan, David McGuire (2001) supported that exploration on skills ought to be embraced inside a situation that takes into account contemplating representatives as complete people.Charles Woodruffe, (1993) concluded that competencies can be applied for effectiveness at workplaces and found nine important competencies for managers. In the late 1970s, the American Management Association commissioned a consultancy firm, McBer& Company (now a part of Hay Group), to study competencies. McBer& Company identified the characteristics that differentiate superior managers from average ones, and referred to these as competencies (David R. Moore, Mei I Cheng, Andrew R.J. Dainty, (2002). Mansfield (1996) analysed three sources of data that host competency frameworks: focus groups or resource panels with subject matter experts (SMEs), generic competency dictionaries, and interviews over a critical event with superior performers. Goleman (1999) highlighted the role of emotional competence. Burgoyne (1993) saw capabilities from a practical point of view in that how authoritative objectives can be achieved by improving the exhibition of individuals in the most ideal way. Spencer and Spencer (1993) built up the activity ski ll evaluation strategy that constrained associations to change their accentuation from customary sets of expectations to building up a competency model by assessing the primary individual attributes related with normal to-phenomenal employment execution.

Brophy and Kiely (2002) referenced that McClelland was told by the US Foreign Service to examine new techniques for research that can gauge human execution and diminish the predisposition of customary knowledge and fitness testing, and this prompted the idea of estimating capabilities. It was fought by Brophy and Kiely (2002) that when a competency-based methodology is utilized, accentuation is set on practices basic for occupati on execution. It was declared by Albanese (1989) that a solitary arrangement of abilities can’t totally catch all parts of an administrative job.

Dubois (1993) proposed a five-advance key frameworks model for competency demonstrating, covering viewpoints, for example, “prerequisites investigation, competency-based instruction planning, structure foundation based exercises, making of a competency-based outline plan where learning happens in an efficient way, arranging and formation of a competency-based learning condition and evaluation exercises.”

Zingheim, Ledford, and Schuster (1996) associated capabilities and competency-structures with competency-based compensation. Le Deist and Winterton (2005) sketched out that competency systems are likewise being connected in different fields of HRM for adjusting hierarchical objectives and specialists’ gifts. Spencer and Spencer (1993) exhibited the “Icy mass Model” that separated key qualities and resultant practices and execution in an occupation profile into five classes: abilities, learning, tho ught processes, attributes, and mental self portrait.

Shippmann et al. (2000) prescribed that given work profiles and authoritative conditions, a lot of seven to nine capabilities are commonly required for a particular employment. Lucia and Lepsinger (1999) hypothesized capabilities as a detailed instrument to distinguis h learning, aptitudes, and capacities (KSAs) and practices required to be successful inside an association.

that there is a clear connection between personal competencies, managed individual development, and the organization’s performance. However, this connection now appears to be tenuous or nonexistent. The various Competence Models are:

# 3.1 Employment & Training Administration

- 3. Competency Models for Training and Development in Organizations

Many organizations make widespread use of competencies. Managers, Learning and Development professionals, and other employees use competency management, dictionaries, measurement and assessment, and competency-based development. Many organizations base their HR policy, and often also their HR development, assessment and throughput cycles, on competencies. The success of this approach is based on the assumption

# Model (ETA Model)

The components of the competency models created by ETA and enterprises are predictable with the writing that depicts competency models. Rothwell (2002) clarifies that there are center abilities that are expected everything being equal. This would incorporate learning, aptitudes and capacities (usually alluded to as KSAs), just as delicate abilities or practices ( Lucia & Lepsinger, 1999; and Rodriguez, Patel, Bright, Gregory, & Gowing, 2002). The center abilities or aptitudes are comparable crosswise over occupations and are expected of numerous occupations.

Roth (2002) orders the center abilities further portraying essential and moderate skills. Exhibit of the center skills delineates a person’s word related or proficient capability (Spencer and Spencer, 1993). The central skills may incorporate perusing, composing, calculation, tuning in, addressing, talking, intellectual, singular duty and confidence, assets (time, cash, individuals, and data), relational, and data and innovative. The larger amount skills (McClelland, 1973; and Rothwell, 2002) might incorporate frameworks thinking, individual authority or eagerness to learn, mental displaying, shared visioning, grou p learning, self-information, shortand long haul memory, topic learning, pleasure in learning and work, adaptability, tirelessness and certainty, feeling of direness, genuineness, offering appreciation to other, and activity. In a significant part of the ongoing writing on competency models, there are works related or useful abilities with supporting social skills (Delamare Le Deist &Winterton, 2005). These models have competency areas separated into competency gatherings and further sub-ordered into sub-abilities. As one proceeds to the following dimensions in the chain of command, the skills become additionally engaged and explicit to the business, employment or occupation, and position. Specialized skills can be found in the level(s) over the middle of the road dimension of the competency model.

responsibility. The following two examples indicate how they apply to Learning and Development.

# 3.2.1 Association for Talent Development

# (ATD Model)

The best-known example is the ATD competency model (ATD, 2014), formerly American society for Training & Development consisting of generic competencies, and the following job-specific ones:

- Managing learning programs Integrated talent management

- Coaching ● Knowledge management ● Change management ● Performance improvement

Instructional plan ● Training sessions ● Learning innovation ● Learning sway assessment

Each section specifies what to do, but not how to do it. In the case of performance improvement, this includes identifying the client, carrying out performance, cause and system analysis, collecting data, and other tasks.

- Recognizes clients’ and colleagues’ implicit

expectations. Is able to adapt to the organizational culture. ● Anticipates formal and informal communication

# within the organization.

3.2.2 The Skills Journey Shepherd (2017) introduces a skills-based development model for L&D professionals, and explains that a skill has physical, social and cognitive dimensions. There is a great deal of confusion between skills and competencies because their definitions overlap (Kamperman, 2009).

- Shows empathy in communication with clients, colleagues and others’.

Despite their shortcomings, competency models do have a function in individual professional development, and in defining the knowledge required to do the job (Campion, 2011; Stevens, 2012).

Shepherd’s model consists of three domains, each defining four roles. The skills to be developed for each role are as follows:

## Interaction with stakeholders as architect, analyst, manager, and evaluator.

# 3.2 Competency Models for Learning and

# Development

## Interaction with learners as instructor, facilitator, coach, and expert.

Competency models depict the information, aptitudes, and frames of mind required to carry out a

Shepherd (2017) also defines each role in operational terms. For example, the content curator ‘draws upon the wealth of information and people that could be valuable to their learners, and suggests where they should start.’

# 3.2.3 Development-Oriented Competency

# Models

The ATD competency model and the skills journey are two examples of development-oriented models that describe the what. What do you need to know and do in order to work as an L&D professional? This creates a common language and a shared body of knowledge for the profession, as well as legitimizing professional action.

Providing we take account of the drawbacks mentioned in the previous section, an L&D competency model serves a valuable function, and in terms of the practicality of working, a generic model is not enough.

There are various dimensions of capability for the different conduct descriptors incorporated into a competency model. Dreyfus and Dreyfus (1980) depict dimensions of skill that incorporate tenderfoot, experienced novice, professional, educated specialist, master, virtuoso, and maestro. From the amateur that is centered around principles and restricted or resolute in their conduct to the person who is eager to defy guidelines to give imaginative and creative answers for business issues. An adjustment of this model, by Benner (1984), portrays dimensions of execution as pursues:

- 1) Untalented or not significant; 2) Beginner; 3) Student; 4) Skilled; 5) Capable; and 6) Master.

Competency models additionally have been utilized to arrange employments in both the private and open divisions. When taking part in progression arranging, competency models are utilized by business to get ready and advance skilful occupant specialists to empty places of administration. At the point when a competency model has been produced for each situation inside an association, the HR, preparing, the board and representative are working as one to meet the objectives of the association Competency practices can carry a typical vocabulary and viewpoint to those working inside an association or framework. A consistency o f desires is comprehended by every player on a hierarchical group or inside an expert system. This orderly structure is utilized to pass on the attractive practices and thinking as one grows exclusively and expertly, inside an association or crosswise over businesses. While a competency model may profit different periods of the HR experience or practice, in disengagement, the estimation of a competency model isn’t completely figured it out. To be utilized effectively in an association or other expert system, capabilities must be comprehensive or incorporated all through the majority of the HR rehearses.

Competency models are being utilized in different regions of HR the board to adjust the objectives of an association and abilities of its labourers. Note that a competency model portrays the characteristics expected of a specialist to be effective in a situation, in a group, and inside an association, however a skill model depicts what an individual labourer must perform reliably to accomplish or surpass the vital objectives of the association (Delamare Le Deist &Winterton, 2005; and Teodorescu, 2006). As it were, there are skills required in an occupation and these can be held by both normal and model representatives, however there are likewise capabilities held by just the excellent specialist (Dubois, 1993).

and advance in a vocation inside an association. As indicated by Raven and Stephenson (2001), people must show general ability in the accompanying four zones:

- 1. Meaning capability – understanding the way of life of the association and acting in agreement;

- 2. Relation capability – making and keeping up associations with partners of the errands or association;

- 3. Learning fitness – recognizing answers for errands and thinking about encounters with the goal that what is found out improves the following undertaking finished; and

estimated in social terms, however more precisely there are practices related with these skills. In this manner, appraisals of such abilities are not objective; rather they depend on flawed or interpretable suspicions. In the event that an association coordinates competency models all through their HR rehearses (i.e., preparing and advancement, choice, and execution and appraisal exercises), the competency model structures created to portray occupations or occupations and special open doors ought to be imparted to all chiefs and staff; worker investment being developed of a competency model can help with giving familiarity with the model just as make acknowledgment.

- 4. Change fitness – acting in new ways when the assignment or circumstance calls for it.

These abilities would be required and drilled by both the normal and model representative. By understanding the competency model for a position or association, the individual picks up a familiarity with the yields or items or administrations conveyed through the position and has a “goal for a learning procedure” Competency models can be utilized to control singular expert advancement, just as help instructors and coaches in creating educational plans that addresses the issues of managers

- 5. Challenges with Using Competency Models

Competency models have their place in HR practices and their utilization can be a technique for talkin g a comparative language among different crowds when examining work prerequisites. In any case, competency models are not the sole answer for each enlisting and determination choice or other administrative capacities (nor should they be the main device used in gathering instruction and preparing needs .Framing capabilities as a result can disregard the psychological and individual procedures that are used in creating and displaying aptitudes and using information. Regardless of the endeavours to survey the abilities related w ith individual qualities, attributes and inspiration, s uch skills are hard to characterize and in this way hard to evaluate. Such capabilities can’t be straightforwardl y

- 6. Conclusion The estimation of competency models is that an entire individual appraisal or all encompassing methodology can be created to analyze the capabilities that an individual has may in any case need to gain as required by a given industry or occupation. The data would then be able to be utilized effectively by HR advancement (HRD) or workforce improvement experts in different applications with the workforce. With specific exemptions considered, competency models are a reasonable instrument that can be used to set up the present and future workforce and hold talented occupant specialists to meet the activity necessities and different needs of employers.ETA is plainly reliable with the writing as far as helping high development ventures with creating competency model structures and making interests in undertakings that utilization them. The workforce speculation framework and their accomplices are now utilizing competency models in an assortment of ways. For the gaps in competency acquisition, further training and development can be offered and provided to aid in acquisition of the desired skill, knowled ge, behaviour, trait, etc. Allowance for some less needed or desired competencies should be considered as well to perhaps enrich the talent pool. For occasions when these competencies are not developed, it is likely that inaction or an ineffective behaviour may prevent th e worker from accomplishing job tasks and organizational goals. 61

The workforce speculation framework and their accomplices are now utilizing competency models in an assortment of ways. For the gaps in competency acquisition, further training and development can be offered and provided to aid in acquisition of the desired skill, knowled ge, behaviour, trait, etc. Allowance for some less needed or desired competencies should be considered as well to perhaps enrich the talent pool. For occasions when these competencies are not developed, it is likely that inaction or an ineffective behaviour may prevent th e worker from accomplishing job tasks and organizational goals. 61

- 1. Introduction Non banking financial companies (NBFCs) constitute as important segment of the financial system in India. The financial system of India comprises of financia l institutions, financial instruments and financial markets that provide an effective payment and credit system and thereby facilitate channelizing of funds from savers to the investors of the economy. NBFCs are financial intermediaries engaged primarily in the business of accepting deposits and delivering credi t. They play an important role in channelizing the limited financial resources to capital formation. NBFCs supplement the role of banking sector in meeting the increasing financial needs of the corporate sector, delivering credit to the unorganized sector and to small local borrowers. NBFCs have a more flexible structure than banks. As compared to banks, they can take quick decisions, assume greater risks, tailor make their services and changes according to the needs of the Dr. Bhaskar Biswas* Assistant Professor of Commerce Raja Rammohun Roy Mahavidyalaya, Radhanagar, Hooghly

clients. Their flexible structure helps in broadeni ng the market by providing the saver and investor a bundle of services on a competitive basis. A non banking financial company has been defined vide clause (b) of the section 45-1 of the chapter 111B of the Reserve Bank of India Act, 1934 as (i) a financial institution, which is a company ; ii) a non banking financial institution, which is a company and which has as its principal business the receiving of depo sits under any scheme or arrangement or in any other manner or lending in any manner ; iii) such other non banking institutions or class of such institutions , as the bank may with the previous approval of the central government and by notification in the official gazette, specify. NBFC has been defined under clause (xi) of paragraph 2(1) of Non Banking Financial Companies Acceptance of Public Deposits (Reserve Bank) Directions, 1998, as: ‘non banking financial company ‘means only the non banking institution which is a loan company or an investment company or an equipment leasing company or a mutual benefit finance company. NBFCs provide a range of services such as hire purchase

finance, equipment lease finance, loans and investment. Due to the rapid growth of NBFCs and wide variety of services provided by them, there has been a gradual blurring of distinction between banks and NBFCs except that commercial banks have the exclusive privilege in the issuance of cheques. In India the last decade has witnessed a phenomenal increase in the number of NBFCs. The number of such companies stood at 7063 in 1981, at 15358 in 1985 and it increased to 24009 by 1990 and to 55995 in 1995. With the amendment of the RBI Act in 1997, it is obligatory for NBFCs to apply for a certificate of registration (COR). The number of NBFC started to decline in 2005 the total number of NBFC has come down to 13261 and in 2014 the total number of NBFC has again increased to 36347.

- 2. Classification of NBFC: Originally the registered with RBI were classified as: i) Equipment leasing company ii) Hire purchase company iii) Loan company iv) However with effect from December 6, 2006 the above NBFCs registered with RBI have been reclassified as: i) Asset Finance Company ii) iii) Loan Company Investment company

following study was very interesting and useful for our research:

Saggar(1995) examined the financial performance of 10 leasing companies at disaggragate level and compared with other groups of NBFCs for a period of 1985-90. The study by Seema Saggar does not reflect the overall performance of NBFCs as it is based on selected 10 companies.

Islam(1999) made anattempt has been made through this study to explore the lease financing in Bangladesh to trace out the historical backgrounds of leasing in Bangladesh. Leasing is a contract between the owner of the equipment (lessor) and the user (lessee) that gives the lessee the right to use specific property, owned by the lessor, for a specific period of time in return for stipulated and generally periodic, cash payments (rents). It is an innovative and alternative way of financing our commercial and industrial undertakings. The business has become more and more popular day by day. The study encompasses the operation of lease financing followed by three leasing companies Industrial Development Leasing Company (IDLC), United Leasing Company Ltd (ULC), and Phoenix Leasing Company Ltd(PLC). The ownership and organizational structure of prominent leasing companies greatly contribute to the success of leasing business in Bangladesh. Leasing business will continue to grow in Bangladesh as a preferred means of acquiring equipment for its convenience and flexibility in financing.

An Asset Finance Company is a company which is a financial institution engaged in the principal business of financing of physical assets supporting productive/ economic activity, such as automobiles, tractors, lathe machine, generator sets, earth moving and material handling equipments, moving on power and general purpose industrial machines.

Bajaj Finance, Shriram Transport Finance Corporation, Mahindra &Mahindra Financial Services, Sundaram Finance and CholamandalamInvestment & Finance Company.

Kantawala (2001) the present study attempts to examine the financial performance of different groups of NBFCs separaterly. The present study attempts to examine the relative financial performance of different groups of NBFCs for the period 1985-86 to 1994-95 in terms of profitability, leverage and liquidity On the basis of the study, it can be concluded that there exists a significant difference in the profitability ratio s, leverage ratios and liquidity ratios of various categories of NBFCs.

- 3. Literature Review: Many researchers have studied working capital from different views and in different environments. The

Raza, Farhan and Akram(2011) in their study compared the financial performance for the period 2006–2009 by using financial ratios and measures of

investment banks working in Pakistan. Financial ratios are divided into three main categories and measures including two indicators. Seven investment banks out of nine are selected for analysis for comparison purpose. They concluded that the performance of investment banks on the basis of efficiency ratio is different than on the basis of liquidity ratio, capital or leverage ratio and financial measures. Due to the unavailability o f data of other two banks, the results are compiled from the data of seven banks. The findings were consistent with the analysis reported by the central bank of Pakistan (State Bank of Pakistan, SBP) in its report for financial sector analysis 2006-09.

Financial ratios and financial measures were taken for the said purpose. Investment banks are the most important contributors in the economic development of a country. And they offer huge impact on capital and credit markets of the country. Financial measures were based upon two indicators total asset and total equity. Financial ratios included return on assets ratio (ROA), return on Equity ratio (ROE), Admin Expenses to Profit before Tax Ratio, Cash and Cash Equivalent to Total Assets Ratio, and capital ratio. This study concluded that ranking of banks differs as th e financial ratios change.

Alam, Raza, Farhan and Akram(2011) intended to classify the leasing companies on the basis of financial ratios and to make horizontal and as well as vertic al analysis among leasing companies for the period 2006- 2009. Ten leasing companies out of ten companies are analyzed. That study concluded that ranking of leasing companies on the base of net investment in finance lease is different from the ranking based o n return on assets (ROA), return on equity (ROE), return on revenues (ROR) and lease ratio (LR) and the ratios such as ROA, ROE, ROR and LR are negative in 2009 due to the net loss after tax.

Dalfard, Sohrabian, Montazeriand Alvani (2012) conducted the study related with the assessment of leasing companies’ efficiency. This article applied data envelopment analysis (DEA) models for the efficiency assessment and ranking of leasing companies on the Tehran Stock Exchange (TSE). Total asset, P/E, and ROE are considered as inputs and EPS, current ratio, and sales growth are considered as outputs of each DMU. The results indicated that both the CCR and BCC models are not capable of ranking the five considered leasing companies. Due to the failure of the standard DEA models to rank the efficient set o f leasing companies, a super efficiency DEA model, namely AP-DEA, is applied. The unique feature of this study is the use of a super efficiency DEA model to rank the leasing companies of the TSE.

- 4. Objectives of the study: In the present study an attempt has been made to evaluate the close relationship between earnings and profitability and earnings and liquidity of the five non banking finance companies (NBFC) viz.

Bank Employees Task Performance: A Role of Leadership Style with Reference to Indian Banking Industry

# Sakshi Sharma* Dr. Manju Nair**

# Abstract

Leading with sustainability in this high-tech global competition had become a major concern for every single organization all over the world. Here, not only customer expectation but employees’ aspirationswere also accelerating day by day, which had captivated banks too for focusing on the excellency whether it was a company’s product or its company employees. Employee’s high-level performance & development had become an enormous challenge, where it had been acknowledged that manager’s leadership behavior can had a constructive influence on their employees, which stimulate employee’s performance for long term grow th. Task performance was most pertinent and directly connected to the organization’s goal, where employees’ behaviors, efforts were rightly indulged into the prescribed job activities, and technical process of organizations. Thus, to retain & increase task performance in banks, there was a need to strategized a perfect leadership style along with other HR tactics. Thus, this analytical supervisor’s leadership style on their employee task performance, where the hypothesis was tested through a multi-stage sampling of 422 employees from public & private banks in India.

study aim was to identify the role of Bank

Key Words: Transformational, transactional, Leadership styles, task performance, banking sector

- 1. Introduction of the Study: Organizations, internal & external frameworks had been facing a huge challenge; every single company, currently adapting themselves to gain an advantage in this dynamic state of competition. Here, human resource management continuously focusing on inducing a high-level performance with core competencies in every employee (Barney, 1995). The notion performancehad been extensively researched, but still, no specific dimension or factors had noticed. It might be the reason that employee performance was a multifaceted term, which cannot quantify in one

parameter, as different employees had a different way of performing or putting efforts in a different zon e. Over that, the researcher, Borman, and Motowidlo (1993) framed two different employee’s performance dimensions, as per employees’ behavior for organizational success i.e., task & contextual performance. It was stated that task performance depicts the efforts of employees, which were relate d to their job description which directly assists in the process of creating goods and services in the organization and which were more linked with the company’s formal system (Borman and Motowidlo, 1997; Werner, 2000). Moreover, contextual performance related to the “employee’s extra-role behaviors. Thus, bothwere significant in their plac e, while focusing at the urgency in the banking industry related to high-tech employees for core competencies, there was a need to give utmost importance to employee’s behavior for producing task performance

which involved task responsibility and specific job attitude to perform the technical function at stipulated time. (Motowidlo & Schmit, 1999). There had been several theories which were signifying that leadership style marked a massive difference in any of its follower’s performance, but theoretical work found it tough to make a clear association among “which leadership styles relate which performance factors of employees”, since both the notions had multiple perplexing variables which made it difficult to validate the reliable source and outcome among them. The problem statement of this research paper was that the banking sector plays a lead and significant role in Indian economic growth. However, to accelerate it for future uncertain challenges with the more effective result in the overall world, banking top officials and supervisorswere required to inspire their subordinates for High-level performance. Leadership was a critical aspect that might had a high impact on employee individual job performance” (Yukl, 1998). Hence, the banking sector, including public and private banks, must hire a specialized leader to understand the importance of banks’ mission and vision along with employees’ aspirations. So, to trace the bright and positive relationship among a leader and performance, this paper through primary data, had attempted to explore bank employees’ level of task performance concerning three independent leadership style (Transformational, transactional and laissez-faire). Consequently, thi s research paper will also examine that which style mostly prevails in the bank and the different levels of impact of all three styles on their follower’s performance in Rajasthan, directed to project the study hypotheses.

from their opponents; one of these was the company manager’s or leader’s capacity to accelerated organization services with new know-how to acquaint the hastily reformed probabilities (Hamel & Prahalad, 1990). Several leadership styles had dissimilar relation with their employee’s behavior; an efficient leader always gives direction, guidance by persuading thei r cohorts (employees) on the way to attain individual & organizational objectives, which cover all facets of in & out of the organization. Kumar (2014) explained that “The term leadership was valued as a distinct course through which a manager or a person stimulus other to accomplish an objective & leads everyone in the organization in such a manner that develops them in a more unified and lucid way.” Although many experts had acclaimed that leaders always make efforts in fostering, the aspiration of the organization by inspiring subordinates towards the positive effort collectively. However, Still, academicians contend that here was a gap in the leadership literature of the Indian banking sector. Although, there had been several individuals and organizational factors that result employee’s performance like employee’s personality, satisfaction, engagement, abilities, and skills (Flippo, 1995) or the organization’s culture, structure, superior behavior peers, reward system and many more. Among them, the leadership style of superior was found as the most impacting factor. The past facts on leadership & work performance had made various authors & researchers to rethink in some specific way as the past the result was lacking consistency. Deinert et al. (2015) stated that even though there was a need to observe “specific “transformational factor or the behavior o f leadership” on the scale in India. Additional explicitly, we can notice that still, studies had not yet explor ed the leadership behaviors of Indian bank officials a nd its connection with bank employees’ task performance.

- 2. Literature Review: Looking towards the banking structure of India, there was a need for restructuring the banking management system from top to down, wherever there was a lacking in innovation or zeal to work for core competitive advantage. Besides, in today’s banking era, where change was not constant, and it was unavoidable, which needs a prompt response, the challenge of employee performance developmenthad also become an enormous concern for leaders. Every organization possesses a diverse source, which discriminates them

- 3. Research Methodology: In the current study, the quantifiable method was implemented to gather data from nearly 422- respondents comprised of 212 employees from a private bank and 210 employees from a public bank in Rajasthan state. The multi-stage sampling the technique was used to collect data from three citie s

(Jaipur, Jodhpur, and Udaipur) of Rajasthan based on the highest number of bank branches, in this explorative research, primary data was collected by online questionnaire-based on two verified tools i. e., MLQ (Bass 1999) for measuring leadership style of supervisor’s,and secondly, the employee’s task performance was measured based on IWPQ (Koopman’s 2013, 2015). Descriptive and inferential statistical analysis was conducted for analysis of data- based on objectives of the current study i.e., mean, SD, Pearson correlation, and Multi-regression method.

3.2 Hypothesis of the Study: H01a “Transformational leadership style was most prevailing style of managers in banks”.

H02a “There was a significant relationship between leadership style and Task performance of subordinates in banks”.

H03a “There was significant impact of superior’s leadership style on Task performance of subordinate’s in banks”.

# 3.1 Objective of the Study: 1.

“To determine the Transformational, Transactional and Lassize faire leadership style of supervisor’s in banks”.

- 2. To determine the Task performance of employees in banks.

3.

“To identify the relationship between Leadership style and task performance of subordinates in banks.”

4.

“To evaluate the extent to which leadership styles impact employees’ Task performance in banks.”

- 4. Data Analysis: Cronbach alpha values must be between 0.7 to 0.8 or above. In the current study, the calculated value of Cronbach’s Alpha of MLQ and IWPQ was .886 with mean value 176.62, which was more than a minimum permissible value, hence proved that there was consistency in responses. Thus, the result of a reliability test confirmed the internal consistency of both the tool and all 54 items seems quite logical and suitable. Objective 1: “To determine the Transformational, Transactional and Laissez-faire leadership style of the supervisor’s in banks”.

The table above 4.1 compares the ratings of the responses received from the targeted sample of this study (bank employees). The results clearly show that the concentrated bank employees view on their leaders or reporting managers style where it was found that leaders were more practicing the transformational leadership characteristics, that discloses that lea ders exhibited transformational style “often” with, its mean value of (M=3.40), and (SD-0.720) standard deviation expressed variation in employees responses. Nearly only a few employees view their reporting managers

practicing “seldom” transformational style (Min=1) whereas more than few other employees perceived their reporting managers adopting “frequently” this style (Max=5). Secondly, the result of the transactional style of leadership discloses that their reporting manage r exhibited this style in-between “sometimes” and “Often” with the means value of (M=3.23), and (SD=5.92) standard deviation expressed variation in employees’ responses. Next when we measured the result in terms of the laissez-faire style of leader ship, exhibits the views of employees about their reporting

Further, the range showed that the lowest score of (min=1) concludes that some applicants specified that their reporting manager or superviso rs never shows this style whereas others (max=5) specified that supervisors showed the Laissez fare style as frequently. Hence this Mean score of 2.43 proves the Laissez-Faire leadership style was not much prevailing

in banks of Rajasthan state. Therefore, the above table explores that the most dominating style of superior was transformational style, which comes before the transactional leadership style. Hence, this would accept our study alternate hypothesis that Ha1: “Transformational leadership style was the most prevailing leadership style in banks of Rajasthan state”. Objectives 2: To determine the Task performance of employees of banks in Rajasthan.

Table 4.2: After observing the performance of subordinates of Rajasthan’s public and private sector Bank, employees task performance was assessed subjectively, i.e. the person’s assessment of his/her performance was asked. “According to the frequency analysis, the study can verify that the data gather ed for Task performancehad been normally distributed and the datahad gathered around the mean of 3.81 and with an std. dev. of 0.690. The bell curve indicates that almost every reply to the questions to quantif y the task performance of the bank employees was close to the mean, while fewer people had provided answers unlike from the mean value”. Timely planning mean score was 4.1 with SD-0.92, optimal planning mean score was 3.53 & SD-0.96, employees keep in mind the result mean score was 4.01 & SD-0.978, ability to separate main issues mean value which was 3.6 and SD-1.064 and ability to perform in time mean value was 3.79 and SD-0.94. In this survey, the highest scores were received in “I manage to plan my work so that it was completed on given duration” (M=4.10 & SD=0.928) and the lowermost scoreswere in “My planning was always optimal” (M=3.53 & SD=0.966). Through the above result, we can depict that bank employeeswere more than average in their Task performance where they found to be a focus on planning and organizing of their work, optimization of the task, giving priorities to the most important

# work, time management.

Objective: 3: “To identify the relationship between Leadership style and task performance of subordinates in banks”.

Hypotheses H02: “There was no relationship between the leadership styles and employees Task performance of banks in Rajasthan.”

Now, next, to examine the above hypothesis Ha2, a Pearson correlation will be used among leadership styles & employee performance. Table 4.3 below displays the result of the correlation matrix.

Leadership styles with Task Performance: The Above (Table no-1.3) exhibits the results on the relationship among the supervisor’s different Leadership styles (as measured by SPSS_LS) and Task performance (as measured by SPSS_TP). The outcome shows a “significant a positive relationship between Task performance and leadership styles, where a value of “r = 0.404, p-0.000 < 0.05, with an almost a strong level of the task performance, found associated with Leadership styles”. Thus, the null hypothesis “HO2: Leadership styles had no significant relationship with Task performance”, got rejected. Now we would also evaluate the different styles of an individual relationship with task performance in the next paragraph. Result of correlation of three types of Supervisor leadership styles with task performance:

Means if leaders focused on employee’s individual need and aspiration, with the idealized attribute, intellectual stimulation, and motivation along with contingent rewards, then the follower’s task performance got enhance more.

Objective: 4: “To evaluate the degree to which leadership styles impact employees’ Task performance in banks.” To test this Hypothesis multi regression was run on data

H03 “There was no significant impact of superior’s leadership style on Task performance of the employee’s in banks.”

The table below 4.1.1 showed the model of regression with three (transactional, transformational and laissez- faire leadership style) independent variables, which explicates 16.4 % of the variance in followers task performance. further, we found that the adjusted R2 indicates “no over-fitting of the model & that the outcomes had better be generalizable from the viewpoint of the ratio of observations to variables in the equation”. Here, the standard error of estimate had been abridged to 0.63293.

Further, in the table 4.1.2, the result of the F statistic found with a degree of freedom of 3 and 418, where the considered F value i.e. 27.304 was far above 1.00 (α = 0.05), which specified that in totally the regression was extremely significant. We approached the identical inference by observing the value of p was 0.000, as this prob value was below the significant level of α = 0.05, this concludes that the regression as a whole was significant.” F (3, 418) = 27.304, p = .000, R2 = .164, suggesting that the leadership subscales factors do significantly predict task performance among bank employees.

As it can be noticed that, “residual distribution w as comparatively uniform, near normal distribution, which signifies that research dependent variable follow a normal distribution.” Research Contributions and Discussion: The empirical study rejected the null hypothesis and it was found the utmost dominant styles among bank managers were transformational leadership style followed by transactional leadership styles. That means the leaders in banks “encourage their subordinates or group members to realize targets beyond their own predictions through inducing every single employee

to pursue even complex performances. And Leaders also convince their followers to exchange their sel f- interests with organizational interests by fulfilling their aspirations (Bass, 1985; Bass and Avolio, 1993)”. Further, finding also rejects both the second and the third hypothesis and depicts that overall leadership style was highly correlated and impacted the employee’s task performance in the bank. Here, the study found TFLS and TSLS, both these styleswere positively related to follower’s task performance, though effect sizes differ substantially. Nonetheless, cross-section al research designs with different other performance dimensions or measures inclined to get moderately many strong effects. Descriptive analysis of the correlation matrix displayed a transformational leadership style as most significantly related style with task performance of employees tracked by transactional leadership style and there was no relation found in Laissez-faire style with task performance “Empirical data of Regression coefficient proved 16% of the variance of followers task performance through leadership style where the highest positive influen ce was through transformational leadership style.” 5. Recommendations & Managerial

directed to capitalize extra in training of transformational leadership, and banks must select the top-level executives/managers based on transformational behavior and a few factors of transactional behavior for collective high employee performances. Similarly, this study also induces bank leaders’ consideration of employee’s aspiration and need to promote their behavior for a high level of task performance,through employee’s psychological development program and also by creating belongingness in employees with full security, self - identity and appreciation. These initiatives of leaders in banks would also develop organizational effectiveness by creating core competencies in employees. Banking organizations essential to give due consideration to a new intervention training programs that improve managers’ styles of influencing. Bank leaders themselves can promote their replicas by selecting and endorsing their followers for becoming an exclusive future transformational and transactional leader, that would support in succession planning in banks. 6.

be covers, which would assist and approve the contributing paths explored in the present study. B y focusing on other new emerging factors or parameters could be included for a clearer picture of the over all performance of followers. Further, more research must observe other new styles of leader behaviors concerning these consequences like a servant and an ethical leadership style.

- 7. Conclusion: This current study determined and attempted to examine the effect of several bank manger’ leadership styles and their relation with employee’ s

task performances, where it was explored that the highly dominated style in the bank was Transformational leadership styles, which was certainly connected to the task performances. Along with that transactional style also appeared as the contributo ry feature and displayed vital parts in enhancing followers task performance in banks. Furthermore, still, ther e was a demand for exposing more surveys and initiatives for knowing the impact of individual factors of bot h leadership styles by examining, the antecedents of such behavior in leaders, instead of normal exercise of merging all into one general scale as per previous literature.
