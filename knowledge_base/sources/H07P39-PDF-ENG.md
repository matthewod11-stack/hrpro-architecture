When “Kathy,” a former client of Luis’s, got hired as a VP at a ﬁntech

company, she wanted to have an impact. She saw things that could be

better, had ideas about how to change them, and was hungry to get

down to the business of making those changes. She approached change-

making like a crusader, driven by her passion for what she believed in.

She expressed her ideas fervently, making impassioned speeches during

team meetings. She fearlessly pointed out what was going wrong and

what could be better. And as someone who was seen as not being afraid

to “speak truth to power,” she adopted the role of advocate for less-vocal

or more junior team members. While on occasion these pitches landed

and led to short-term change, she was much more frequently frustrated

at the lack of action that resulted. Worse, this approach made her

increasingly isolated in the organization, feeding a vicious cycle that made it increasingly diﬃcult for her to aﬀect change.

In today’s fast-paced corporate landscape, most highly experienced

leaders entering an organization are driven by a desire to make a

signiﬁcant impact and drive meaningful change. However, the approach they adopt in championing new ideas becomes the diﬀerentiating factor

between success and failure. Unfortunately, when faced with resistance,

some leaders become frustrated and disengaged or even choose to

leave the organization. Research shows that this is particularly true for

leaders who are hired speciﬁcally to be “change agents.” Moreover, the

leadership training and research ﬁrm Leadership IQ found that 46% of

newly hired executives fail within the ﬁrst 18 months.

Recognizing the need for a transformative approach that would allow

her to advocate for her ideas without alienating others, Kathy needed to

shift her mental model from that of a crusader to that of a collaborative

# leader.

The crusader approach: Passionate but isolating

A crusader is a leadership style described in the book Built for Growth.

The crusader embodies a passionate advocacy for their vision, values,

and goals. Their decisions are guided by a set of core beliefs and values.

They tackle change directly and forcefully, driven by a profound sense

of purpose that fuels their willingness to voice their opinions, even in

# the face of opposition.

While this approach can initially instill conﬁdence and self-eﬃcacy

often proves counterproductive in the long run. The crusader leader

is often perceived as closed minded, inﬂexible, and overly passionate.

While passion can be a positive trait, it becomes detrimental when

accompanied by predictable negative behaviors. Crusader leaders tend

# to:

- Speak up frequently and vehemently, sometimes to the point of

dominating conversations.

- Interrupt others or answer questions with their viewpoint. In other

words, they don’t always listen to understand.

- Be outspoken about their opinions, often pushing their own agenda

without considering other perspectives.

- Exhibit visible and frequent frustration when faced with resistance,

doubling down on justifying or defending their approach, often

assuming that pushback stems from ignorance rather than a genuine

# divergence of viewpoints.

# Are you a crusader leader?

As you reﬂect on your leadership style, you might recognize some

traits of a crusader. Even though there’s no single reason why someone

might adopt this approach, it can be driven by various factors, each

with its own set of consequences. It’s important to be introspective

and understand the root cause and impact of your leadership style so

you can adopt a more balanced one. Here are some key indicators of

# crusader approach:

You’re passionate.

Leaders who are passionate about an issue may display behavior that

can be misinterpreted as inﬂexible and defensive. They often have

considerable expertise in an area. They believe passionately that their

way is the best way forward, which makes them less likely to accept or

consider alternative perspectives. This leads to exhaustion, as research

has shown that prioritizing passion above all else can be ineﬀective and

# harmful.

You get frustrated by the slow pace of a particular change.

Crusader leaders see themselves as needing to single-handedly push

hard to make progress, adopting a tightly focused approach and losing

the opportunity to recruit supporters and collaborators to help make

lasting change. Their sense of urgency is not shared by the group they’re

trying to inﬂuence.

You’ve seen the crusader approach work in the past.

Some leaders default to the crusader style because they’ve seen its

immediate results in past situations. They’ve witnessed how this

approach can achieve impressive results, overwhelming dissent and

driving to decisions — in the short term. But in the longer term, these

tactics can backﬁre and undermine the crusader’s ability to achieve

lasting change.

How to make the shift from a crusader to collaborative leader

A more eﬀective approach to driving change in the workplace involves

adopting the mindset of a collaborator. Instead of doggedly pursuing

a myopic perspective, collaborators focus on building relationships,

understanding organizational dynamics and reasons for resistance, and

using this knowledge to advocate for change in a shared, strategic

manner. Here are six ways to become a more collaborative leader:

# Understand the organizational culture.

Whether we like it or not, how inﬂuential we are is ultimately in the

hands of those we want to inﬂuence. And inﬂuence is highly context

dependent. Instead of sticking to your guns and putting yourself out

there without understanding the context you’re operating in, a better

approach is to identify how things work in your organization. Look for

clues about what works and what doesn’t. In meetings, pay attention

to which behaviors are rewarded and which aren’t as eﬀective. Watch the most eﬀective leaders in the organization and consider asking

them how they might approach a particular situation. Is their approach diﬀerent from yours? When you understand the “rules” of the game,

you’ll be in a much better position to play it.

Choose your battles.

Crusaders tend to advocate for changing big things — things that, to

their frustration, are complex and require a winning coalition. And

in some instances, the crusader isn’t the right person to make those

changes. For instance, suppose you’re a manager at a software company

## and notice ineﬃciencies in both the software development process and

the company’s recruitment strategy. While your passion and drive may

urge you to tackle both issues, overhauling the recruitment strategy might be more complex, requiring collaborative eﬀorts and a broad coalition to address eﬀectively. Fighting the recruitment battle can lead

to frustration, burnout, and an erosion of credibility if changes don’t

materialize quickly. And most likely, the recruitment team will respond

defensively to your initiative. Instead, focus your energy and resources

on streamlining the software development process, an area where you

can make a signiﬁcant and meaningful impact given your expertise.

# Seek feedback.

Others often see us more objectively than we see ourselves. Research

has shown that people don’t realize how they behave in certain

situations, or they misremember their actions, leading to an inaccurate

perception of themselves. Crusaders, often consumed by their vision,

may overlook crucial details or perspectives, leading to an incomplete

# view of the situation.

Be relentless about asking for feedback and suggestions to better

understand how your approach is being perceived and what you can do next time to become more eﬀective. This is a transformative (and

often sobering) step for a crusader transitioning to a collaborative

leadership style. It not only cultivates self-awareness, but also gives

you a comprehensive understanding of your actions’ consequences, including potential negative eﬀects on team dynamics, morale, and

# productivity.

# Develop and leverage relationships.

It’s crucial to build and foster a winning coalition of individuals who

can support your ideas. Imagine the organization as a heavy wagon that’s diﬃcult to stop or steer in a diﬀerent direction from the outside.

Instead of trying to push or pull the wagon alone, leaders should get

on the wagon and work with the drivers to steer it from the inside.

This approach requires building relationships and coalitions within the

organization to gain support for ideas and create a sense of shared

# ownership.

An easy way to “get on the wagon” is to align your ideas with other

people’s as a way to gain supporters and allies. For example, let’s say you’re a scientist who is concerned about high staﬀ turnover

rates. During a meeting, a colleague from HR discusses their goal of increasing employee engagement. Instead of pushing your staﬀ

retention concern independently, you could propose a joint project

that addresses both concerns — for example, a pilot program in your

department that integrates strategies to enhance employee engagement

that might reduce turnover rates. By doing so, you’re integrating your

initiatives with the needs and concerns of your HR colleague, making it

easier for others to support yours and their proposal.

Be open to other perspectives.

To gain inﬂuence, you must also be open to being inﬂuenced. Nobody

wants to “negotiate” with someone who isn’t open to other perspectives

and can only see the world through their own limited view. Instead, try

to cultivate genuine curiosity about other ways of seeing challenges and

solutions. Instead of digging in or restating your preferred approach,

ask open questions of colleagues who don’t share your view and try

to identify shared perspectives. While you might see a straight line

between the problem and solution based on your perspective and

expertise, others may not see the trajectory as clearly and will struggle

to enact the desired strategy as a result. Even the right decision can

lead to the wrong outcome if you’re unsuccessful in creating a shared

understanding of how to successfully implement the change.

# Focus on long-term goals.

Building lasting change requires maintaining focus on the long-term

objective. Sometimes, being a crusader is warranted and appropriate,

particularly when urgent action is needed and you have the authority

to make a change. However, these situations tend to be few and far

between. If you want to achieve ambitious lasting change, it’s unlikely

to happen all at once, and you most likely can’t do it by yourself.

Confront your crusader self with these three questions: Is this problem

mine to solve? Do I need to solve it alone? Do I need to solve it now?

With this focus, you can apply the right level of long-term vision to the

things that really matter, including letting go of ﬁghting every battle

# along the way.

. . .

The need for change is inevitable in any organization, but the approach

to driving change is a determinant of its success or failure, as Kathy, our passionate crusader, realized. Aﬀecting lasting change is not a solitary quest, but an inherently shared eﬀort. It requires embracing

a collaborative mindset that respects and includes diverse perspectives,

maintains a strategic focus, and patiently navigates the complexities

of organizational dynamics. It’s not about surrendering your passion

or advocacy but leveraging them in a more inclusive, strategic, and ultimately eﬀective way.
