As you move into senior roles, some leadership styles will come more

naturally than others, shaped by your personality and past successes.

And over time, your favored style may become your brand, expected by

## others and increasingly authentic to you.

But what happens when your preferred approach suddenly loses

followership? If you don’t adjust, you could diminish your credibility

as a leader. On the other hand, adopting an unfamiliar style can be both

awkward for you and confusing for your colleagues.

The challenge to become versatile across leadership styles is arguably

harder than improving technical expertise or strategic competence

because it calls for personal transformation. And these days, if you’re

not committed to developing past your comfort zone, you’re unlikely to

inspire others to stretch themselves and follow your example.

In my work coaching executives, I’ve seen that having the courage

to develop greater adaptability in their leadership approach is worth

the eﬀort. Leaders who expand their range of styles not only sustain

followership, they’re often surprised by how agility gets easier with

practice. Here are ﬁve strategies to help you successfully meet the

moment when your default leadership style stops working.

## Scan for shifts in the business, stakeholders, and yourself.

When your leadership style loses impact, it’s typically because

something changed in the systems around you. To avoid blind spots

## in your eﬀectiveness, look for sudden changes in three areas: the

business you serve, the stakeholders you manage and inﬂuence, and

# your personal concerns.

Ask yourself: Have market dynamics, customer needs, or product

strategies shifted? Are your stakeholders requiring something diﬀerent

in order to willingly follow you? And within yourself, have any new

responsibilities demanded a change in your conﬁdence and presence?

I once coached a VP who noticed morale dropping across his team and

complaints rising from internal customers about work delays. As he

scanned for shifts in the business and key stakeholders, he recognized

that constant pivots in strategy to keep up with market competition

confused the team’s priorities. At the same time, internal customers

were applying pressure on shared projects. And the new VP, newly

promoted, was trying too hard to please everyone, rather than managing

around a clear vision and strategically setting boundaries on service.

The result was a purely reactive team seen as order-takers targeted for

## criticism rather than valuable strategic partners.

By scanning at the level of the business, stakeholders and self, the VP

realized he needed to lead with more clarity and conviction to improve

credibility around what his team could promise and deliver. Shifting his

style with this intention helped reset and re-engage both his team and

# stakeholders more eﬀectively.

Identify a style you’re overusing and try on new ones.

To help you assess which styles you tend to favor, consider how you

show up across these six leadership styles, as provided by psychologist

Daniel Goleman’s research: directive (using command and coercion),

authoritative (deﬁning a vision to follow), pacesetting (insisting on high standards), aﬃliative (preferring personal bonds), democratic (seeking

consensus for decisions), and coaching (prioritizing individual growth).

Several factors inﬂuence your chosen style, from your personality and

unique strengths, to how you were taught about leadership, perhaps

from prior bosses or mentors. But comfort breeds complacency, and

as needs change, your over-reliance on one approach can limit future

# followership.

One of my coaching clients was a CEO who had spent his whole career

at his company. Because of his deep institutional knowledge and a

scrappy, “roll up your sleeves and get it done” personality, he preferred

to operate in the weeds, involving himself in extremely tactical issues.

This pacesetting style—hands on, detail oriented and pushing for his

view of excellence—worked well when the company was small and his

leadership team was made up of longtime colleagues who expected it.

But as the business scaled and new leaders were hired to help the

company develop a mature operational structure, his involvement

became a bottleneck. And his style, once eﬀective for solving

simpler problems, now limited his managers’ capabilities in addressing

increasingly complex ones. He realized that in order to sustain

eﬀectiveness, he needed to try on some new styles, namely a

visionary one that encouraged team ownership, and a coaching one

that empowered others to grow themselves in preparation for future

# demands.

Be transparent about style changes.

Expanding your range of styles is a sign of sophisticated leadership,

but be prepared for growing pains. Not only is adopting a new style

unfamiliar to you, but it may confuse others if done without warning.

Failing to share the context of what and why you’re changing, may be

seen as erratic and even worse, diminish trust.

To ensure alignment, build on your ongoing social contract, explaining

your intention and how you’ll experiment with broadening your range

when leading your team. You might tell them:

Over the past year, I’ve noticed a habit of mine that is getting in

the way of achieving the results we all want. I like to jump in and

insert myself in the work when I don’t see progress. But that’s not

working for either of us. Going forward, I’m going to try to empower

you more, asking questions to invite your ownership and delegating

more intentionally. If I seem quieter in meetings, it’s not that I’m

disengaged, and if I’m asking lots of questions, I’m not trying to

test you. I’m just trying to listen and encourage your process and

# solutions rather than mine.

Reinforce how this shift will help everyone: “Being a more intentional

coach will not only help me spend more time on the big issues on my

plate but also show you I trust you and want to give you opportunities to

show what you can do.”

Taking ownership for where your style needs to expand can

understandably make you feel exposed. But remember it’s courage,

humility and your modeling of vulnerability that will strengthen your

team’s capabilities and increase your followership.

Practice, seek feedback, and expect pushback.

Once you’ve clariﬁed your intentions, start experimenting in small, yet

visible ways. Ask for feedback on how your new approach is landing,

but don’t be discouraged if some colleagues aren’t happy with it. After

all, even if your prior style had its ﬂaws, it was familiar. Changes in how

you lead them may feel unwanted until they experience the beneﬁts of

# adaptation.

One of my coaching clients was an SVP of technology, responsible

for innovating engineering processes to improve his company’s

competitive edge. His style was grounded in vision-building and

democratic decision-making, motivating the team to imagine the

impossible and engage in healthy, inclusive debates about how to get

# there.

While his team felt safe and supported, several recent project

failures reduced other stakeholders’ conﬁdence in the SVP’s

operational maturity. He developed a reputation for overpromising and

underdelivering, caused by two problems with his leadership approach:

his unwillingness to give critical feedback to his team and an aversion

to consistent, detailed reporting to his peers on progress. To his credit,

he made demonstrable changes in his approach in response to these

# setbacks.

To more objectively assess his team, he asked himself who he would

re-hire (or not) if he had to start the team from scratch. Then he deﬁned

speciﬁc gaps for each and coached them with targeted feedback,

acknowledging that his prior avoidance of that limited their potential.

And when his team engaged in endless debates, he redirected them

toward closure and action. Lastly, he had his team develop a cadence

for planning and reporting out to stakeholders based on key metrics of

# interest.

Not everyone on the SVP’s team welcomed these style shifts. After all, it

meant more work and personal accountability. But he continued to seek

feedback as a way of calibrating his approach to avoid over-indexing the

other way. And by persisting with experimentation while accepting the

pushback as a necessary part of evolving, he oﬀered a model for them to

expand their range as leaders too.

Commit to developing versatility over mastery.

As you experiment with new leadership styles, don’t be discouraged if

some just never feel right. Stay open to practicing across styles so you

have access to more choices when the moment calls for it. And commit

to choosing your approach based on purpose rather than personal

preference. This not only increases your leadership eﬀectiveness in a

given context, but it ensures you’re actively growing your adaptability

# muscle for future needs.

In today’s ever-changing workplace, being adaptive is a major strategic

advantage. A recent study reported more than 60% of corporate

learning professionals believe leaders must become more behaviorally

adaptable to meet future needs. And these days, companies are even

creating C-suite roles speciﬁcally designed to foster agility because of

its criticality for achieving enterprise-wide alignment. But versatility

demands vulnerability and often letting go of your core identity.

For example, if you’re a leader who has built trusted relationships before

setting expectations, you might view the necessity to be authoritative

and decisive ﬁrst, as an aﬀront to your values and “who you are.” And

yet in holding onto what feels authentic, you could miss the opportunity

to use a directive style when it’s more eﬀective for the moment at hand,

such as providing clarity in crisis, or helping new employees know what

is expected of them before ramping up to their own level of competence.

To develop your adaptability across styles, let go of the need to feel

authentic at all times. Versatile leaders often embody all six styles in the

span of a day, depending on the purpose of the interaction. Read the

room, consider if people need you to be decisive, observant, facilitative,

or something else at that time, and show up accordingly, just to see what

# works.

In any leadership role, your style of engaging others plays a signiﬁcant

part in determining success, sometimes even more than the subject

matter of the work. And when your style suddenly loses its desired

impact, it can be hard to know how to shift it without losing your

authenticity or confusing those you lead. By using these strategies, you

can make sure you’re sustaining followership by optimizing your style

for the moment and developing your adaptive range for future shifts.
