I have argued over the past decade that the Human Resources(HR) function has the potential to become one of the leaders inanalytics. The key word, I thought, was potential. Not anymore. Arecent global survey on which I collaborated with Oracle suggeststhat HR is right up there with the most analytical functions inbusiness — and even a bit ahead of a quantitatively-orientedfunction like Finance. Many HR departments are making use ofadvanced analytical methods like predictive and prescriptivemodels, and even artificial intelligence.

This is a big change from a decade ago, when I began to study theuse of talent analytics. (Jeanne Harris, Jeremy Shapiro, and Ipublished an

article in HBR on the subject in 2010). At that time,the only really sophisticated HR analytics capability weuncovered was at Google and perhaps Harrah’s (now Caesars).There was a fair amount of reporting going on, but not muchprediction. Few HR organizations even had a dedicated analyticsperson. “HR analytics” typically meant a debate about how manyemployees the organization had, or the best way to measureemployee engagement.Even before the new survey results came out, I suspected thatthings were very different today. Most large companies have atleast a small people, talent, workforce, or HR analytics group.There are many conferences devoted to the topic. It’s verycommon for organizations today to model workforce growth,attrition, engagement, and other key variables.The survey involved 1,510 respondents from 23 countries acrossfive continents. It included senior managers, directors, and VPsfrom from HR (61%), the Finance function (28%), and generalmanagement (10%). I was hired to help design, analyze, andreport on the survey. All of the executives were from companieswith $100M in revenue or more. Detailed results are

here.While it’s obvious that HR is moving in an analytical direction, Idid not expect the very high level of sophisticated analyticalactivity in the survey. Here are some highlights:

51% of HR respondents said that they could perform predictiveor prescriptive analytics, whereas only 37% of Financerespondents could undertake these more advanced forms ofanalytics.

89% agreed or agreed strongly that “My HR function is highlyskilled at using data to determine future workforce planscurrently (e.g. talent needed),” and only 1% disagreed.

94% agreed that “We are able to predict the likelihood ofturnover in critical roles with a high degree of conﬁdencecurrently.”

94% also agreed that, “We have accurate, real-time insight intoour employees’ career development goals currently.”

When asked “Which of the following analytics are you using?”“artiﬁcial intelligence” received the highest response, with 31%.When asked for further detail on how respondents were usingAI, the most common responses were “identifying at-risk talentthrough attrition modeling,” “predicting high-performingrecruits,” and “sourcing best-ﬁt candidates with resumeanalysis.”This level of self-assessed capability for HR analytics was high inalmost every geography and every specific question, but it wassomewhat lower in Asian, European, and Australianorganizations. It was generally highest in the U.S., the MiddleEast, and Latin America. Across industries, it was lowest in the“hospitality, travel, and leisure” and “media and entertainment”categories. Particularly high industries included financialservices, energy and utilities, professional services, and wholesaledistribution.

Why is HR more comfortable with advanced analytics thanFinance, which has always been a function based on numbers? Ihave noted for years that Finance organizations and the CFOswho lead them have found it difficult to move past descriptiveanalytics and reporting — which they do very well — to moreadvanced analytics. There are certainly exceptions to this rule,but it helps explain why the growth of advanced analytics hasbeen faster in HR.But no function in a business stands alone with regard to data andanalytics. One reason that Oracle surveyed both HR and Financeexecutives is that those two functions have an increasing need tocollaborate. Workforce expenditures are often among anorganization’s highest costs, and a company’s financial situationwill dictate fluctuations in the size and makeup of the workforce.The survey found high levels of collaboration and mutual respectbetween HR and Finance, and a growing need for collaboration.For example, 82% of respondents agreed or strongly agreed, andonly 5% disagreed, that “Integrating HR and Finance data is a toppriority for us this year.” However, several interviews conductedafter the survey revealed that there is still much opportunity forgreater sharing of data and collaboration on analytics.Of course, not everything is rosy in the world of HR analytics. Iwas quite interested to see that the function’s use of analyticaltools surpasses the ability to interpret and act on them. Whenrespondents were asked about the area of “most needed todevelop or improve” analytical skills for HR, the highest-rankingchoice was “acting on data and analytics to solve issues.”“Cultivating quantitative analysis and reasoning skills” and“advising business leaders by telling a story with data” alsoranked highly. My experience is that these skills are equallylacking in other functions. Perhaps it is another sign of HR’s
