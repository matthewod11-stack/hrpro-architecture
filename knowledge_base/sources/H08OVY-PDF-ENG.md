Your boss is set on a strategy that sounds great in theory, but which

you’re sure will be a logistical nightmare. Or maybe you’re in a team

meeting, and everyone is nodding along to your boss’s idea that you

believe will crash and burn. Speaking up in these moments takes ﬁnesse

and nerve. How do you voice your concerns to your boss without

being confrontational? Should you ask questions or make a direct case?

And how do you frame your point so it lands without straining your

# relationship?

# What the Experts Say

Disagreeing with your boss is tricky because “there’s the inherent

power dynamic,” says Melody Wilding, executive coach and author of

Managing Up: How to Get What You Need from the People in Charge.

“This person controls your paycheck, your bonus, your future at this

organization, and with that power comes uncertainty. You worry about

their reaction: whether they’ll retaliate, shut you down, or even hold

it against you.” The right approach can mean the diﬀerence between a

productive conversation and an awkward standoﬀ, according to Robert

## Bordone, a Senior Fellow at Harvard Law School, and neurologist

## Joel Salinas, coauthors of Conﬂict Resilience: Negotiating Disagreement

# Without Giving Up or Giving In.

While avoiding conﬂict might feel easier in the moment, that comfort

comes at a cost, says Salinas. “Ask yourself, ‘What are the consequences

of staying quiet?’ Reframing it this way can make speaking up more

compelling and help you push past the hesitation.” The key, adds

Bordone, is recognizing your power to aﬀect change. “Belief in your

capacity to shape outcomes is at the core of negotiation, inﬂuence, and

disagreement,” he says. “These skills rely on the understanding that you

can inﬂuence others—even a powerful boss.” Here’s where to start.

Get out of your own way

Understanding the psychological and cultural dynamics behind why

it’s hard to push back on your boss is the ﬁrst step. “Most of

us are brought up to respect and defer to authority,” Wilding

says. “Feedback, tough conversations, and disagreements usually roll

downhill; they’re not something we’re taught to give upwardly.”

## From a neuroscience perspective, interactions with authority ﬁgures

often trigger a strong emotional response, Salinas adds. “Our brains

associate these interactions with potential threats, often linked to past

experiences with parents or teachers,” he says. “This stress response—

racing heart, tense muscles—is what makes it harder to stay strategic

in tough conversations.” Recognizing these factors helps you manage

## stress and approach disagreements with a clearer head.

# Embrace disagreement as an advantage

Next, reframe disagreement as a necessity, not a risk. Speaking up

beneﬁts you, your boss, and the entire organization, says Wilding.

After all, when employees don’t challenge timelines, priorities, or

direction, companies waste money chasing the wrong goals. Being a

truth-teller can be a smart career move. “The higher leaders rise, the

more disconnected they become from day-to-day operations, and the

fewer people challenge them,” she says. You earn trust by speaking up,

even when it’s tough. “Your boss will see that you won’t mince words.

Done well, it can be an advantage.” Bordone adds that staying silent can

take a toll. “You’re going to feel frustrated, you won’t sleep well, and

your performance could suﬀer,” he says. “There’s a real ripple eﬀect.”

Gauge your “pushback power”

Disagreeing with your boss requires shifting from “a subordinate

mindset to a partnership mindset, where you recognize your

perspective is valuable and worth sharing,” says Wilding. The aim is

to be seen as a “trusted adviser,” not someone who just follows orders.

Wilding suggests evaluating your “pushback power”: your ability to

challenge decisions based on factors like tenure, your relationship

with your boss, and the state of the organization. Read the room: Is

the business in crisis, where decisions need to be made quickly, and

everyone must be on board? Or is it stable, with room for feedback? “It

doesn’t mean you can’t speak up if those factors aren’t in your favor, but

you may need to be more incremental in your approach,” she says.

Appreciate that timing is everything

It’s tempting to push back the moment your boss says something that

doesn’t sit right with you. But, says Wilding, it’s often smarter to wait for

## a more opportune moment, like your next one-on-one, when the topic

is still relevant, but cooler heads can prevail. “Timing is everything,”

she says. Think, too, about the setting, adds Bordone. Trying to have a

## potentially contentious conversation with your boss in the hallway on

a Friday afternoon, just as they’re leaving for the weekend, isn’t ideal.

Naturally, “when the conversation doesn’t go well, and you’ll think, ‘I

tried, but it didn’t work,’ when in fact, it was the wrong time and place.”

Know who you’re dealing with

How you express disagreement depends on your manager’s style and

priorities. Some bosses appreciate directness, says Wilding. (E.g., “I’m

not on board with this,” or “I don’t agree.”) Others take it personally.

(“If one of my team members said that to me, I’d probably cry,” Wilding

admits.) Bottom line: Know who you’re dealing with so you can present

your concerns in ways that resonate. A manager who values morale and consensus will react one way, while one focused on eﬃciency

and results will respond another. “Saying, ‘I worry this plan will burn

people out,’ lands diﬀerently than, ‘I worry this plan will waste money,’”

she says. Bordone suggests watching how your boss reacts when other

people push back. Who speaks up successfully, and how? “Noticing

these patterns won’t guarantee success, but it will give you a smarter

# way in.”

# Ask questions

Lead with curiosity, says Bordone. Jumping to justiﬁcations can sound

defensive and put you both in opposite corners. “The goal is to be

useful and productive, not just contradictory or ‘You’re wrong,’” he says.

Wilding recommends open-ended prompts like, “Help me understand

what factors are inﬂuencing this decision?” or “Who have you spoken

to about this?” These questions oﬀer insight into their thinking and

signal collaboration. Wilding also suggests getting a small agreement

before oﬀering your perspective, a psychological principle known as a

## “micro yes.” Asking, “Are you open to another perspective?” or “Could

I share what I’m seeing?” makes the conversation “feel less adversarial

and increases the chances they’ll be receptive,” she says.

# Appeal to values

When you disagree with a big-picture decision, Wilding suggests

framing it around your role and responsibilities. Try: “I want to make

sure this project succeeds and that you have all the information to make

the best call.” This shows you’re acting in the team’s best interest and

oﬀering your perspective in service of the larger goal. For example: “As

a product manager, I see it as my job to steward our road map and

ensure we’re prioritizing the right features. To do that, here’s what I

think.” Acknowledging your vulnerability can help, too, says Bordone.

He suggests: “Part of me knows a lot of thought has already gone into

this decision, but I also feel it’s worth bringing up my concerns because

we might miss something important. So let me share my perspective.”

# Focus on the future

When you’re disagreeing with something your boss has already done—

like pointing out a misstep during a client call—don’t rehash the past.

Instead, Wilding advises focusing on the future. She suggests saying,

“I’d like to touch base about that last meeting and discuss how we

can improve moving forward.” This shifts the conversation to solutions,

using the earlier situation as a “springboard to the future.” For example,

you could say, “Next time, it might help to clarify who’s speaking when

so we can both showcase the value we bring to the client.” And never

say, “That was a bad move,” Bordone says. “That puts your boss in a

crummy position as the bad decision-maker. No one wants to be there.”

Be prepared for defensiveness

Despite your best eﬀorts, your boss might react badly. So, take a beat.

“Even a brief pause can make a diﬀerence when you feel pressured,”

says Salinas. Ground yourself with a breathing technique to calm your

nerves. Be ready for resistance, too, says Wilding. If your boss responds

with, “You’re trying to undermine me,” or guilt-trips you with, “I

thought you were a team player,” she recommends ﬂipping it. Respond

with, “I am a team player, that’s why I’m bringing this up. I want us to

be as productive as possible.” If they say, “I thought you were behind

me,” reassure them: “I am behind you, that’s why I want you to have this

information in order to make the strongest decision.” Make it clear that

your feedback is meant to support, not undermine.

# Look for compromise

Another approach is to suggest a solution that isn’t all or nothing.

“Maybe we don’t go fully in the direction I’m proposing, but how about

we try a pilot?” says Wilding. This shows you’re ﬂexible and willing to

collaborate, while also conveying that you’re not just going to roll over.

“If you back oﬀ entirely and never bring it up again, your manager

might get the impression that your feedback can be easily dismissed,

and they’ll think, ‘I don’t have to listen next time,’” she says. Stand

your ground (while being open to alternatives) but avoid digging in

your heels just for the sake of it, advises Bordone. “You don’t want a

Groundhog Day situation where you keep trying without progress. If

things still aren’t working, it’s time to ask yourself: Can I live with this?”

Know when to back off

“In most cases, you should probably back oﬀ,” if your boss really and

truly isn’t willing to budge, says Wilding. “Realize that there’s still a

hierarchy. Your manager has the authority to make decisions. Your

inﬂuence is substantial but limited.” Pick your battles: There will be

times when you simply don’t see eye to eye. As Bordone puts it, “Short

of something being unethical or illegal, you do the best you can and

# hope for another day.”

Reﬂect—and don’t gloat

If you didn’t have luck persuading your boss, Bordone suggests taking

time to process. Once you’ve cooled oﬀ, ask yourself: “What did I do that

I thought worked, and what could I have done diﬀerently?” Remember:

“Sometimes, you need to let bad decisions play out, so people listen to

you in the future,” says Wilding. “I’ve seen situations where people’s

managers come back to them and say, ‘I should have listened to you.’”

If it turns out you were right in the end, don’t rub it in. “We have to let

people face the consequences so they can come to that realization on

# their own.”

# Principles to Remember

# Do

- Tailor how you express disagreement to your manager’s style and

priorities by observing how they react to others’ pushback.

- Lead with curiosity and ask open-ended questions, like “Help me

understand what factors are inﬂuencing this decision?” to foster

# collaboration.

- Pick your battles and know when to back oﬀ, especially in lower-stakes

# situations.

# Don’t

- React impulsively if your boss gets defensive; take a pause to

ground yourself and calmly frame your feedback as supportive, not

# undermining.

- Dig in your heels for the sake of it; stand ﬁrm but be open to

alternatives and willing to ﬁnd a middle ground

- Rub it in if you’re right and your boss didn’t listen; let them learn from

# their mistakes.
