Approximately 100,000 children are adopted by parents in the United

States each year. While there are less-expensive options for adopting a

child, namely adoption through foster care, some adoptions can cost up

to $58,000. In addition to the ﬁnancial burden, people opting to build

their families through adoption are faced with the unique challenges

that come with the adoption process, such as making life-changing

decisions, ﬁlling out seemingly endless paperwork, going through the

home-study process, and enduring the emotional roller coaster of

waiting to be matched with their child and ﬁnalizing the adoption.

And when one or both adoptive parents are working, they’re faced with

balancing all of those challenges with the demands of their work.

What we know is that when employees perceive their organization to

be supportive of their family in general, they’re more satisﬁed with

## their jobs, more committed to their organizations, and less likely to

leave — all great things. So, what can organizations do? The answer

is simple: Provide meaningful support for adoptive parents. We sought

to understand the beneﬁts of this kind of organizational support by

surveying married couples who had adopted a child within the last few

# years.

## The Benefits of Providing Adoption Support

The good news for organizations is there is a variety of types of support,

some more costly than others, that adoptive parent employees see as

# meaningful.

Some organizations provide ﬁnancial reimbursement for adoption-

related expenses, paid or unpaid leave, ﬂexible work arrangements,

## or managerial support for employees during and after the adoption

process. These are all forms of organizational support for adoption

(OSFA), which is the intentional eﬀort on the part of an organization,

through ﬁnancial, environmental, or procedural means, to support an

employee who is in the process of adopting or has recently adopted

a child. The 2022 SHRM Employee Beneﬁts Survey found that 28% of

organizations oﬀer paid adoption leave.

In our research, we discovered that OSFA has a far-reaching positive

impact for both the employees and the organization. Our study showed

that more OSFA led to positive outcomes for employees at work (e.g.,

higher organizational commitment). OSFA also led to more positive

outcomes at home (e.g., increased family functioning and decreased

# relationship tension).

But the positive impact didn’t stop there: Employees’ spouses were

also more committed to the organization that provided OSFA, a factor

that has been shown to be important to employees’ own commitment

to their organization. Finally, and most importantly to the adoption

community, OSFA led to increased attachment of the adopted child to

both the employee and their spouse, a huge family — as well as societal

# How to Support Adoptive Parents

Here are ﬁve ways leaders can better support adoptive parents in their

# organization:

# Financial reimbursement

Adoptions are expensive. On average, it costs families $35,000 to adopt

a baby through a private adoption agency. Employees seeking to build

their families through adoption will be faced with agency fees, legal

fees, medical expenses, and more. Providing ﬁnancial reimbursement

to aid in these adoption expenses will not only help with the ﬁnancial

burden of adopting, reducing stress for the employees, but it could

also motivate more employees to adopt. In a recent study by the

## Dave Thomas Foundation for Adoption, 64% of Americans said their

employer’s ﬁnancial support of adoption impacts their decision to

# adopt.

Paid leave

Oﬀering paid leave is another way to support working adoptive parents.

Many adoption-friendly organizations will oﬀer the same leave beneﬁts

to adoptive parents as they oﬀer for maternity and/or paternity leave.

Similar to ﬁnancial reimbursement, paid leave plays an important role

in whether employees adopt — 68% of Americans claim that access to

paid leave impacts their decision.

# Flexible work arrangements

Managers can also support adoption by providing ﬂexible work

arrangements for adoptive parents. The adoption process can be

complex and may require employees to leave work for home studies,

court appointments, or even domestic or international travel. Granting

employees the ﬂexibility to work outside of normal hours or to work

remotely will help them better manage their work and family demands

throughout the adoption process. As one survey participant told us:

“[The organization’s] ﬂexibility was invaluable. It eased the stress in

so many ways. It gave me the freedom to spend lots of time with my

family but contribute to my normal work as well. They really helped me

# balance things.”

## Connect employees with adoption networks or support groups

Another way to support adoptive parents is to connect them with local

adoption networks or support groups. Not only will the support they

receive from there be beneﬁcial, but being the one to connect them

shows that you care about their family and support their adoption

eﬀorts, which is sure to go far in ensuring employee commitment and

# loyalty.

# Celebrate!

The adoption of a child is a monumental event for your employees and

should be treated as such. Society is quick to celebrate pregnancies and

births, showering the new parent with ﬂowers, cards, parties, and gifts.

Yet adoptive parents often get overlooked. Celebrating your employee’s

new family communicates to them that you recognize the signiﬁcance

# of the event.

Providing support to adoptive working parents doesn’t have to be

complicated or even expensive. Our research suggests that the return

on investment is signiﬁcant, enhancing employees’ and their families’

well-being. Further, providing OSFA is an important step toward

legitimizing adoption as a way to build one’s family and an innovative

way to beneﬁt society as a whole.
