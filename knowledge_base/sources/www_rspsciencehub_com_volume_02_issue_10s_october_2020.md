Abstract The objective of the conceptual paper for analysing the opportunities and challenges of HR Analytics for reducing the attrition rate in the organization. The paper highlighted the important reasons of high attrition in different type of organizations and the effective approaches by the respective organizations for reducing attrition rate. Employee attrition is one of serious issues in the current corporate scenario as it impacts on the organizational image, values, culture, reputation, and job satisfaction. Moreover, high attrition is related to high cost for any organization. This research intended to explore employee attrition and finding out gaps in work and improve in those areas for reducing attrition accordingly. The sources of data used are both primary & secondary. HR Managers of select organizations were requested to share the recent trends with the usage & applications of HR Analytical tools. The data was collected by conducting personal interactions over telephones as primary source. Journals & research articles in the domain of HR analytics were used to get better insights. Effective recruitment structure, working environment and Employee Engagement is created. Though the prediction by HR Analytics is a challenging job but there are many methodologies which can change the look of the organization and HR team can measure and predict the gap for attrition. This research paper explains the analytical process for reducing attrition and importance of utilization of HR Analytics. Key Words– HR Analytics, Employee Attrition, Retention, Value-Culture-Job Satisfaction- Reputation, Recruitment, Job Structure.

- 1. Introduction HR Analytics is the method of collecting and evaluating Human Resource data to improve an organization’s culture, workers performance, retention etc. (Eric W. MacIntosh, Alison Doherty – 2009[5]). HR Analytics has the power of early prediction of the movement of the employees and organization. In the big organization where huge no of employees are working, HR Analytical tools or methodology are very much productive for

providing the data-supported understanding on what is working fine and what is not so that organizations can make changes or improvements and plan more efficiently for the future (Sandeep Yadav, Aman Jain & Deepti Singh-2018[1]). The most used Analytical tools by organizations for their analytical works are as (e.g. [16]) –

analysis and visualization. It can explore huge data sets. Like able to analyze and clean millions of rows of data.

- 2. Python is a programming language, and it is very much useful for substituting with R. Mainly in the IT organizations use this programming language for the analytical work in the organization.

- 3. Excel is the most basic tool of HR Analytics. For any type of numerical and graphical calculations, we use this tool very frequently. This tool also quite common for all organization and HR team as well. Excel is most user-friendly tool for all employees.

- 4. Tableau is remarkably like Power BI in that the accumulation and conception of various data sources. This tool founded in 2003 for research produced at Stanford University, the software has created identical position in the world. It is one of the best business intelligence tools in the current scenario.

- 5. SPSS another one of the most used tools of HR analytics in the social disciplines. It is very user-friendly approach; through this tool anyone can analyze the data without proper statistical knowledge as well. As it is very user friendly anyone wants to analyze data, they can do the same easily.

In this paper, made a sincere attempt to understand the significant of HR Analytics to deliver high performance to the organization. The first part reviews the previous work done by existing authors and discovers the gap for the research. Second portion highlighted the study objectives of the research. The last section explains about input framework of effective process and output parameters the reducing organization. The last section provides implication of the effective tools and framework followed by conclusions and references.

# Sandeep Yadav (2018)

Sandeep Yadav et.al (2018) in their research on “Early Prediction of Employee Attrition using Data Mining Techniques” have focused on the importance of data mining techniques to forecast the attrition patterns in employees. Researchers have taken an IT Industry along with different departments of the organization for their research on prediction of employee attrition. Authors have used – Name of the employee, Number of Projects handled, Average Monthly Hours given, Job Satisfaction Level, Time spent in the organization (Years), Last Evaluation, Departments, Work mishap, Absent, Promotion & Rewards last 5 years, compensation, salary level as a variables for measuring the reasons of attrition. Techniques as Data Pre-processing, Featuring Engineering, Data Modelling & Comparison are employed the research Hot Encoding process is IT, used to steely various department as Accounting, Management, Product Management, Sales, Support, Technical. Logistic Regression, SVM Model are usedfor getting the Categorization Results of Hot Programming Method.

The outcome of these study shows, Employee attrition can influence an organization in many disciplines like reputation, revenues, position in the market, and cost in terms of both time and money. So, during hiring if the organization able to take preventive measure that will help the organization to reduce attrition. It was understood that development, promotions are not the only justifications at the back of the employee attrition. During hiring other aspects also, company needs to consider. And through this concept the firm can build dependable and correct models which can improve the hiring and preservation cost of quality employees and the attrition position of enable

HR Plays a vital role in the organization by providing experienced skilled, employees. An effective HR team of an organization always take care of their employees and build a healthy organizational environment, employees love to work for long term. Retention is most challenging job for an organization but if the employees get a healthy working environment with the proper compensation, appreciation and

Now HR Analytics works on the pattern or trends of the organization and found the gaps where the organization needs the improvement(e.g. [12]) Like other challenges attrition one of the biggest challenges for any organization and HR analytical team can reduce the attrition by taking the proper steps from the beginning when the recruitment team hire employees for the organization.

In many cases we have seen after joining, employees didn’t enjoy their job and within few months or years, they prepare their mindset for giving the resignation and here the team HR Analytics can make a change by using some input, process and output. Here we have created a model and selected specific objectives, input, process, and output. For reducing the attrition through HR Analytics, we considered the flow from beginning from the point recruitment starts.

Several organizations recognized that extremely high cost is involved for replacing an employee and which almost over 200% of their annual remuneration, “AmericanProgress.org.” described that the actual cost might even be higher due to training program / onboarding process(e.g. [15]). So, enhancing retention and employee commitment are frequent to priorities for HR department. HR Analytics enable to help by improving through a combine analysis that looks at data points. On the other hand, we have found that not only a single factor or objective is responsible to the attrition of any organization. There are several objectives which might be the reasons for the high attrition rate and HR Analytics can make different tools or frameworks for working on those objectives for
