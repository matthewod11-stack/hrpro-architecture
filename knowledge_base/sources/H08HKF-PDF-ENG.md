# HBR Staff using AI

As companies devote resources to implementing AI, many realize

that they need a strategy to manage the technology’s well-documented

ethical, regulatory, and legal risks. A responsible AI program (or “RAI”

program for short) not only builds guardrails for particular AI solutions

and the teams that manage them, but it also deﬁnes the enterprise-wide

## policy, governance structures, roles and responsibilities, processes, and

## more that enable wide-scale deployment of AI.

# HBR / Digital Article / Designing a Responsible AI Program? Start with this Checklist

We’ve helped companies in the Fortune 500 across multiple industries

design and implement RAI programs (sometimes called “AI ethics,”

## “AI ethical risk,” and “AI governance” programs), from healthcare and

pharmaceuticals to insurance, ecommerce, food and beverage, mining,

and more. In doing so, we’ve noticed a pattern: Companies are rushing

to implement their RAI programs before they’ve ﬁnished designing

them. The results are predictable: ineﬃcient and diﬃcult-to-scale eﬀorts at managing AI’s ethical, reputational, and legal risks; wasted

resources; and slowed innovation.

It’s understandable how this happens. Before leaders are ready to invest

resources in an RAI program, they want to know whether AI even works

for the intended use case, so they put RAI to the side. No one wants to

invest in seat belts if they don’t know if the car can move. Then, when

they ﬁgure out that some AI solutions actually work and there’s real ROI

on the table, the risks they brushed to the side become urgent problems.

Leaders rush to implement RAI programs without having fully thought through whether they’re eﬃcient and eﬀective. Because many simply

don’t know what a robust RAI program looks like, teams are often left

trying to ﬁgure it out on the ﬂy.

One seemingly reasonable solution is to develop what one might call

a mini RAI program aimed at just the speciﬁc solutions that will be

deployed. There might be use case- or solution-speciﬁc RAI policies

for usage, risk assessments, metrics, and so on. This is a ﬁne stop-gap

measure, but eventually these mini RAI programs become unwieldy and

ineﬃcient, and things will fall between the cracks. At this point, if not

sooner, designing and implementing an enterprise-wide RAI program is

# necessary.

To help leaders get oﬀ to the right start, we suggest a series of questions

that acts as a checklist to determine whether your organization is ready

to implement, scale, and maintain an enterprise-wide RAI program. If

your organization can answer “yes” to all of these questions, it’s likely

in a good position to implement. If you answer “no” to any of them,

we highly recommend slowing down the implementation of your RAI

program and waiting to complete the design until the answer is yes.

While this may feel like a step backwards, it will ultimately propel implementation faster and more eﬀectively than charging ahead.

## 8 Questions to Determine RAI Program Readiness

- 1. Have you determined the strategic objectives of your RAI program?

It’s important to deﬁne what counts as successfully designing and

implementing your RAI program. Are you aiming to be best in class?

To skate by existing regulatory requirements? To be ready for pending

or upcoming regulations? Answers to these questions will have large

impacts on how the RAI program gets rolled out — for instance, how

you design risk assessments, augment workﬂows, conduct internal

# audits, and more.

Relatedly, organizations need to decide how to operationalize their

RAI programs across various markets, what thresholds/benchmarks are

appropriate in each market, what resources they’re willing to invest in

## the program, and which stakeholders (vendors, suppliers, partners, etc.)

will be held to these same standards.

Why does this matter? Because how you roll out your program across

multiple markets informs what enterprise-wide procedures and metrics

you choose down the line. If, for example, you decide to roll out the

program consistently across all markets, then you can have a consistent

set of procedures and metrics across those markets. If, on the other hand, the program is diﬀerent depending on the market (e.g., in the way

you uphold GDPR in the European Union but not in the United States), then diﬀerent procedures and metrics of success are appropriate.

Similarly, your organization needs to decide various thresholds —

## e.g., for escalation, go/no-go decisions, risk mitigation, and so on.

Determining whether the same thresholds apply across all markets or

whether they will vary by market is a foundational decision and impacts

how your RAI program rolls out for years to come.

- 2. Are your RAI values clearly connected to procedures?

Many organizations have an RAI values statement. Almost every one

of these includes a commitment to high-level concepts like fairness,

privacy, transparency, safety, and accountability. The problem is that,

articulated this abstractly, the values are impossible to implement.

The solution is to connect those values to procedures. For instance,

to be committed to fairness may refer, in part, to a commitment to

identifying which stakeholders might be discriminated against at each

stage of the AI lifecycle. It may also include a commitment to managing

those potentially discriminatory outcomes and conferring with those

stakeholders when the risk is suﬃciently high.

Without this connection to more concrete procedures, it’s just not clear

what the values amount to in practice because words like “safety” and “fairness” likely mean diﬀerent things to diﬀerent stakeholders

throughout the organization. Agreement on high-level values that mean diﬀerent things to diﬀerent people creates the illusion of

internal alignment. That illusion evaporates when organizations try to implement programs across misaligned staﬀ.

- 3. Have you designed RAI metrics (KPIs and OKRs)?

If there is one place where organizations stumble, it is in designing

metrics to measure the rollout, compliance, and impact of the RAI

program. But this is essential when we’re talking about implementing

## a program across thousands or tens of thousands of employees (in some

## cases, 100,000+), across dozens of countries and hundreds of markets.

# HBR / Digital Article / Designing a Responsible AI Program? Start with this Checklist

There is an important diﬀerence between metrics for the RAI program

itself and metrics for speciﬁc AI models or solutions. It is not just

the models themselves that need to be measured — the RAI program

itself must be tracked for the purposes of ensuring compliance and

improvement. Establishing metrics that track the rollout and impact of

the RAI program, as well as whether and how employees are complying

with it, is critical.

Metrics should measure the extent to which:

- Employees are aware of the RAI program, including the policies and

procedures that pertain to their role

- Each employee is abiding by the RAI program, including situations

in which an employee is either using the AI themselves or overseeing

someone else using AI

- The RAI program is producing the desired impacts • Eﬀorts at improving the RAI program are successful

Designing RAI metrics is as complex as it is important. Important high-

level decisions include:

- What is it worthwhile to measure, and what metrics will be used?

- Who is responsible for collecting and evaluating them?

- What is the frequency at which the metrics will be collected?

- What are the appropriate measurement targets, benchmarks, and

# thresholds?

- At what rate will metrics be deployed? For example, quality assurance

and quality improvement metrics can only be collected once the

program has been operational, otherwise there’s nothing to measure.

- 4. Have you trained the people responsible for overseeing the implementation and impact of the RAI program? An RAI committee is a cross-functional, cross-departmental team populated by people from diﬀerent parts of the organization with diﬀerent perspectives on competing strategies, priorities, and types of risk. To function eﬀectively, the team must be aligned on what the risks

of AI are and how to prioritize distribution of resources to manage those

# risks.

The team members’ unique expertise is required to prevent and

mitigate each type of risk, but it can also be a weakness because a)

each member tends to focus on the risks pertaining to their expertise, b)

some risks of AI, particularly ethical ones, are outside of each members’

area of expertise, and c) members aren’t experts at rolling out and

overseeing an RAI program.

This last point is particularly important. The committee is responsible

for ensuring the RAI program is rolled out appropriately and has

the desired impact. This is a complex, continuous endeavor. Training

sessions or workshops in which teams achieve alignment on the

## enterprise priority of the RAI program relative to other strategic

priorities, what the risks are, what their sources are, what risk

thresholds and metrics are appropriate for each market/context of deployment, and what makes the diﬀerence between a go/no-go

decision, can play a pivotal role in whether the committee is able to eﬃciently and eﬀectively discharge its responsibilities.

- 5. Do you have the personnel you need?

One of the most important requirements of an RAI program is precisely

the aspect that no one wants to do: ensure the program is being scaled

and maintained in a way that meaningfully reduces risk. And one of

the major obstacles is that there is no one in the enterprise who has the

skills and knowledge to do this work. Even existing QA/QI and audit

personnel are not up to the task if they are not trained for responsible

AI in particular, including the vast array of the (sources of) ethical,

## reputational, regulatory, and legal risks of AI.

There are two paths forward here: hiring new personnel or training

existing QA/QI and audit teams. In our experience, no one wants to

hire new personnel, at least to start. Training existing personnel is

less expensive and less disruptive and, so long as they can take on

the additional work, is to be preferred. That said, organizations should

anticipate needing to hire personnel in this area as their AI program

matures and thus increasingly more AI and more AI teams enter the

# organization.

- 6. How will your RAI program harmonize with other enterprise priorities? An RAI program has a number of features that interact with other

aspects of the enterprise. Most generally, this includes RAI policy,

## procedures, risk assessment, risk mitigation, metrics, quality assurance

and quality improvement, and audit. These aspects of the RAI program

will interact with cybersecurity programs, privacy programs, other

## IT optimization programs (e.g., multi-cloud computing), and more.

Harmonizing the RAI program with these is a matter of ensuring it

“plays nicely” with them. More speciﬁcally:

- Does the RAI program interfere with those programs? For instance, it is

## crucial that the RAI program not unnecessarily stiﬂe innovation.

- Does the RAI program augment those other programs? For instance,

might it augment the cyber program?

- Whether the RAI program interferes with or augments other

strategic priorities, what needs to be tweaked so that everything

works in harmony? This could include human resources, workﬂow

# augmentation, ﬁnancial resources, etc.

- 7. Have you developed an RAI strategic roadmap?

You need an RAI strategic roadmap that articulates, among other

## things, the important execution steps for everything from design to

## implementation to monitoring to quality assurance to auditing of the

RAI program. This will also include the budgeting, the ﬁnancing, the

people who will have oversight, management style, and so on. Other

high-level questions include:

- Will the cadence of deployment of the RAI program be: a) enterprise-

## wide and simultaneous or b) sequentially by department/role?

- If a) will you do advanced training for all departments

simultaneously, or is it only the general training module that is

delivered simultaneously? Will you only require attestation or will

you test whether they have the appropriate level of knowledge?

- If b), what’s the sequence/how will you prioritize? What milestones

must be hit to proceed to subsequent departments/roles?

- Will you include vendors, suppliers, strategic partners, board

## members, and other important stakeholders?

- 8. Have you designed an implementation playbook?

You need an RAI playbook that articulates how the strategic roadmap

will be executed by each department, role, workﬂow, type of AI, and

type of AI interaction. The playbook should also include guidelines,

checklists, tutorials, etc., to ensure adherence to the documented

procedures. Key decisions include:

- How will you revise/recalibrate/customize workﬂows for each

# department?

- How will you attain the goals outlined in the strategic roadmap?

- How will each department assess and mitigate identiﬁed risks?

- How will you include vendors, suppliers, strategic partners, board

## members, and other important stakeholders?

# Baby Steps

It is common for organizations to want to take “baby steps” in

rolling out any enterprise-wide program. An RAI program is no

exception. Implementing new policies, governance structures and

entities, procedures, quality assurance and quality improvement,

internal audits, training, etc. — each of which is a component of an eﬀective RAI program — is a complicated aﬀair.

In large organizations, it aﬀects tens of thousands of employees and

## other stakeholders (e.g., vendors, suppliers, strategic partners, etc.). It

also competes with other strategic priorities and contends with limited

resources. For this reason a phased rollout of the RAI program is highly

recommended. In other words, taking baby steps to implement an RAI

program is highly recommended. However, this must be distinguished

from taking baby steps in the design of the program. The program

should be designed as fully as possible prior to implementation.

An analogy is helpful. If you ultimately want a building with four wings

but you only have the resources to build one of those wings, you would

do better to complete the design of the four-wing building and then

build in phases than you would to build a single wing and ﬁgure out

later how to make additions to what you’ve already built. Similarly, it

is better to design a complete RAI program and build in phases than

to build a bit now and ﬁgure out later how to tack on other elements.

Fortunately, completing design of an RAI program requires far fewer

# resources than implementation.

Many organizations have started building their RAI programs and met

with diﬃculty in deploying them. In most every case, this is either

because existing elements of the program need augmentation or there

are elements that have not been started because there isn’t suﬃcient

knowledge of what rolling out a robust RAI program requires. While this

checklist is not exhaustive — and of course there are more details on

how to develop each of the elements listed above — we hope it helps to

map out the RAI terrain in enough detail such that organizations know

where they need to go.
