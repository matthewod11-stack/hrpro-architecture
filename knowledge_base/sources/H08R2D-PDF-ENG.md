It’s a basic goal of most companies: to grow revenue each year. But

as globalization recedes, populations in many nations grow older (and

buy less), and sustainability concerns lead more people to scrutinize the

necessity of every purchase, companies are facing headwinds to growth.

And while growth can be a particularly powerful diﬀerentiator in such

a challenging context, it is also particularly risky. Pushing for growth at

all costs can end up destroying value rather than creating it, through

wasteful investments and diverting resources from the core strengths of

# the ﬁrm.

The question thus arises: How can companies build lasting value

# without growth?

# Stability Has Its Perks

To ﬁnd answers, we studied more than 10,000 companies from North

America, Europe, and Japan over the past 20 years. From that cohort,

we identiﬁed 172 stable ﬁrms, deﬁned by steady, near-zero revenue

# growth throughout the period.

These stable companies delivered shareholder returns similar to market

averages, but at 12% lower volatility. This low volatility also correlates

with both greater resilience and longevity: Stable ﬁrms were half as

likely as the average ﬁrm to suﬀer severe value collapse by losing 90% or

more of their market capitalization over the 20-year period we assessed.

They are also nearly twice as old as the typical S&P 500 company,

averaging almost 100 years of age. Finally, of these stable ﬁrms, 57 of them—one in three—managed to outperform the market in terms of

# total shareholder return (TSR).

If we take a closer look at those 57 companies that outperformed,

our analysis reveals that these successful, stable companies do not

conform to a single proﬁle: They sell to both consumers and businesses,

oﬀer products as well as services, and appear across a wide range of

## industries (though less frequently in fast-growing sectors, where they

can ﬁnd themselves left behind by competitors).

Still, they share some notable similarities. For one, 25% of stable

outperformers had an owner with a controlling interest, compared to

less than 8% of companies in the S&P 1500—suggesting that a sense of

ownership may play a role in enabling a disciplined, long term–oriented

approach to value creation. This is consistent with the observation that

stable ﬁrms steered clear of the risks that often accompany aggressive

growth, such as overly ambitious, large-scale mergers or acquisitions,

which have a failure rate of 70% to 75%.

Instead, these businesses used four distinct strategies to achieve

# outperformance in the absence of growth:

- 1. At Your Service: The Asset-Light Play

Many businesses facing low growth prospects react by seeking to

acquire new customers—often at high cost—but stable outperformers

are more likely to maximize value from existing customer relationships.

They do this by shifting from physical products with declining demand

to asset-light services and software. This approach not only deepens

customer ties but also improves margins and lowers asset intensity.

The stable outperformers that made this shift increased their EBIT

margins by 8 percentage points between 2004 and 2024 on average,

driven by 50% lower capital expenditures and 25% lower cost of sales.

This enabled them to also achieve an average annual TSR of 9%.

This path is most common in asset-heavy industries undergoing digital

transformations or in IT companies becoming more service-oriented.

More broadly, it may oﬀer an interesting path for businesses facing

## commoditization or pressure from competitors.

A case in point is Siemens: In 2014, it announced an increased focus on

software-as-a-service and digital twin technology. This move reﬂected

## a shift from traditional industrial conglomerate to digital industrial

innovation leader, embedding software and data-driven services into its

core oﬀerings and creating more resilient revenue streams and deeper

customer integration. We found that while pursuing this strategy over

the past decade, Siemens achieved an annual TSR of 12%.

- 2. Take the High-End Road: The Gross Margin Play

Mature businesses are often tempted to rely on a strong brand

image while cutting costs. However, enhancing quality can be a more sustainable path to value creation, enabling ﬁrms to establish a diﬃcult-

to-erode position and improve their gross margins.

The stable outperformers who “took the high-end road” increased their

## gross margin by, on average, 12 percentage points over the 20-year

sample period. This enabled them to achieve an average annual TSR

of 9%, driven mainly by margin expansion and a strong cash ﬂow

# contribution.

While we observed this strategy most commonly among consumer

businesses, it may be relevant to many companies operating within a

## niche—whether due to product uniqueness or specialized expertise. By

becoming irreplaceable, these businesses can strengthen their pricing

power and move upmarket, whether they produce luxury goods or

# industrial components.

## For example, Morgan Advanced Materials, a UK-based manufacturer

of ceramics and carbon materials, developed products with superior

## thermal resistance, electrical insulation, and mechanical strength to

better serve its customers in sectors such as aerospace, semiconductors,

and electric vehicles, where components must operate reliably under

extreme conditions. We found that the company’s superior products led

to an improved pricing power, doubling its margins over the 20-year

period, and achieving an annual TSR over 3% above the FTSE 100—

while not growing revenues in real terms.

- 3. No Place Like In-House: The Balance Sheet Play

When revenue growth is out of reach, balance sheet expansion oﬀers

another alternative to create value. Stable outperformers often grow

their asset base through vertical integration to control a larger share of

the proﬁt pool and increase their value added. This approach also helps

them build a unique asset portfolio that strengthens their diﬀerentiated

## value propositions and competitive moats.

On average, the stable outperformers that followed this strategy doubled

their total asset base as they vertically integrated. Their control of a

larger share of the value chain enabled them to expand their gross

## margins by 8 percentage points on average throughout our period of

observation. Their investments also yielded high returns: On average,

ﬁrms following this strategy achieved an annual TSR of 9%, driven by a

# cash ﬂow contribution of 5%.

This strategy is most prevalent in asset-intensive sectors such as

industrials, utilities, and materials—but any business with an already-

diﬀerentiated product and signiﬁcant market share facing cost

pressures from suppliers may ﬁnd vertical integration a compelling

# path to value creation.

The hospitality industry oﬀers a striking example. Unlike most hotel

chains that franchise their brands to accelerate revenue growth,

Whitbread, owner of the largest hotel brand in the UK, Premier Inn,

owns all its hotels, directly manages their operations, and even controls

digital distribution as well as revenue management by centralizing

bookings on a proprietary platform. Although this integrated strategy

constrains rapid expansion, consistently delivering a high-quality

customer experience is an essential pillar of its competitive advantage—

which we found has enabled the company to deliver 10% annualized

# TSR over the past 20 years.

- 4. Take It to the Bank: The Dividend Play

Rather than aggressively pursuing growth, stable and mature

companies often prioritize returning cash to their shareholders.

However, without signiﬁcant revenue growth, it can be challenging for

these companies to meet dividend growth expectations, and therefore,

to achieve high TSR. Our analysis identiﬁed an alternative strategy for

value creation through dividends: providing consistent and predictable

payouts that make their stocks behave like bonds.

This “bond-like” approach exhibited dividend volatility one standard

## deviation below the market average and oﬀered investors greater

stability and reduced risk, enabling these companies to outperform

## the market despite limited growth in revenues, margins, or dividends.

These stable outperformers built ﬁnancial slack, for example, by

reducing their debt-to-equity ratios by 30% on average. In this way, they

achieved not only a high and stable cash ﬂow contribution to TSR but

also enhanced their valuation multiples by an average of 3% per year.

This strategy can be observed in all industries and sectors but is

## most applicable for companies with predictable streams of revenues

and little ﬂuctuation in investment patterns. Take GATX, a railcar

leasing company: It has paid out uninterrupted quarterly dividends

since 1919. Over the last 20 years, the ﬁrm has not had a reduction

in dividend payouts for a single year and has maintained dividend

## volatility 1.5 standard deviations below the average of our sample—

driving annualized TSR of 12%, fueled almost entirely by cash ﬂow

# contributions and multiple expansion.

# What About Talent and Innovation?

Pursuing low growth-strategies does come with challenges. For one,

growth typically means opportunity—for career progression, new skill

development, and other means of advancement. If a company isn’t

actively growing, these opportunities may be more limited, which could

make it challenging to attract and retain top talent.

To counter this, companies executing a low-growth approach must

be intentional in how they design their talent strategy. Some of

the companies in our study leverage their stability to invest in long-

term initiatives and partnerships to attract and develop talent. These

eﬀorts might include targeted recruiting programs, apprenticeship

opportunities focused on specialized skills, industry certiﬁcations, or

partnerships with local educational institutions. Such channels build

community ties and create a consistent stream of candidates.

For example, UK home builder Persimmon launched the Persimmon

Academy in collaboration with local colleges to tap into overlooked

labor markets in the regions where it operates. The program, which

enables the company to access new talent, shape skill development to

## align with its business needs, and foster stronger engagement across its

workforce, has recently been expanded to new regions after its initial

# success.

Beyond talent pipelines, stable companies can also foster long-term

engagement by reimagining the employee value proposition—for

example, by highlighting perks such as opportunities for horizontal

rather than vertical mobility and focusing on job security, enabled by

the reduced volatility of a low-growth strategy. This approach may be

particularly appealing to younger workers, many of whom have spent

## their careers in economically uncertain environments.

For example, Mondelēz International’s internal talent marketplace,

Match & Grow, enables employees to take on short-term projects beyond

their usual roles or functions, gaining exposure to new experiences and

collaborating with diﬀerent teams. Since its launch in 2023, more than

25,000 employees have participated in the program.

Another potential challenge for low growth-companies is maintaining

## an innovative culture—one in which creativity and imagination thrive.

Without such a culture, there is a risk that complacency sets in. Yet

rather than chasing disruption or innovating to unlock new markets,

many of the stable ﬁrms in our sample highlight the power of

# continuous, incremental improvements.

For example, Diageo introduced an innovation team that focuses

on integrating emerging technologies and experiences to enhance

their existing portfolio; this team developed the world’s lightest

## whisky bottle for Johnnie Walker Blue Label, as well as an AI-

powered virtual concierge that provides personalized cocktail and gift

## recommendations to consumers of its Seedlip brand.

Counterintuitively, constraints imposed by low growth can even

become powerful catalysts for innovation. In fact, rapidly expanding

## companies sometimes purposefully introduce limitations to their use

of resources to encourage creative problem-solving. Patagonia, for

instance, has been growing at more than 9% per year (and is therefore

not part of our sample), but it self-enforces strict sustainability

standards that limit the materials used in making its products. By using

only organic or recycled fabrics and by urging customers to purchase

fewer items, Patagonia has developed pioneering programs like its

## famous repair and buyback initiatives, central to its value proposition.

. . .

The strategies and success of stable outperformers show that growth is

# not the only path to value creation.

However, company leaders should bear in mind that, while the stable

companies we identiﬁed could sustain outperformance over decades,

their levers may be exhausted at some point: Margins cannot be

increased beyond 100% and dividend volatility cannot fall below zero.

Pursuing a strategy of stability does not absolve leaders from having

to continue to explore and revisit growth opportunities as conditions

# evolve.
