ﬁred, organizations rushed to create or update anti-harassment policies,

## complaint procedures, and training programs.

This approach may be misguided. Programs, policies, and training alone

do not stop sexual harassment and abuse. My book Working Law —

based on surveys of organizations, interviews with HR professionals,

## and content analyses of both human resources journals and federal

court opinions — shows that sexual harassment policies and procedures

can comfortably coexist in organizational cultures where women are

regularly subjected to demeaning commentary, unwanted physical

contact, and even threats or sexual assault. In other words, someone can

be sexually harassed without recourse in an organization with plenty of

# rules on the books.

We know, for example, that employees who have experienced

harassment are often reticent to use company complaint procedures

because they fear retaliation. Some believe that they must put up with

harassment in order to get ahead. Research suggests that as few as

25% of women who experience harassment use an internal company

complaint procedure or ﬁle a complaint with the EEOC. The few

who do are often confronted with dismissive complaint handlers who

treat their experiences as interpersonal problems or instances of poor

## management rather than sexual harassment.

But one factor that’s often left out of this conversation is the role the

courts have played in shielding companies from legal liability. When a

case does manage to reach the legal system, courts will often side with

a company due to the mere presence of an oﬃcial policy, regardless of whether the policy is actually eﬀective in addressing harassment

or abuse. I call these policies “symbolic structures,” and they often

do more to protect employers from lawsuits than they do to protect

# employees from harassment.

Consider the case of Leopold v. Baccarat, Inc., decided by a federal

trial court in New York in 2000 and aﬃrmed by a federal appeals

court in 2001. Andree Leopold, a saleswoman, sued after her supervisor

repeatedly threatened to replace her with someone “young and sexy”

and referred to saleswomen using vulgar, dismissive language. Baccarat,

the employer, pointed to its policy against harassment and its grievance

procedure as evidence of fair treatment. Leopold claimed that she did

not use the complaint procedure because it would have required her

to report the harassment to her immediate supervisor — the person she

was accusing of harassment. The policy also lacked a guarantee that she

would be protected from retaliation. The court ruled in favor of Baccarat

anyway, recognizing that the procedure was inadequate in some ways

but nonetheless stating that “the law is very clear that any reasonable

policy will do.”

This is just one example. But analyses of a half-century of judicial

opinions tell a story of judges who increasingly view the presence of

## anti-harassment policies and complaint procedures as suﬃcient for

employers to avoid liability, even where there is substantial evidence

that harassment occurred. In order to understand why this happened,

and is continuing to happen, it’s important to ﬁrst understand the

history of anti-discrimination law and how companies responded to it.

In many ways, the current state of court decisions begins in a familiar

# place: human resources departments.

## The Birth of Discrimination and Sexual Harassment Policies

After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which prohibited

most large employers from discriminating against employees on the

basis of race, color, religion, sex, or national origin, companies were

in an unfamiliar position. The law did not specify precisely what

constituted discrimination or what employers were expected to do. HR

professionals and management consultants jumped into the vacuum,

promoting a variety of new antidiscrimination policies, complaint

## procedures, aﬃrmative-action oﬃcer positions, and other structures as

## mechanisms for compliance with civil rights law. Organizations quickly

adopted these structures, and by the mid-1970s they came to be widely

accepted as evidence of nondiscrimination.

The problem, however, was that the symbolic value of these structures did not depend on their eﬀectiveness. Yes, in some organizations, the

presence of antidiscrimination policies and complaint procedures was accompanied by meaningful eﬀorts to reduce bias and to hire and

## promote minorities, women, and other disenfranchised groups. In many

other cases, however, discrimination and inequality was allowed to

persist. Over time, the mere presence of these symbolic structures came

to be accepted not only by HR and management professionals, but also

# by lawyers and courts.

It should be no surprise, then, that when sexual harassment became

an issue — largely with the 1979 publication of Catharine MacKinnon’s

## book Sexual Harassment of Working Women and guidelines by the EEOC

in 1980 (since updated here) that deﬁned sexual harassment as a form

of illegal sex discrimination — organizations followed the practice that

had proven successful in compliance with civil rights law.

A good example of this is a 1981 article in Personnel Journal, which is

now known as HR Focus. The authors wrote:

If the employer has no knowledge of the harassment, liability may

be avoided if two conditions have been met: (1) The employer has a

policy discouraging sexual harassment, and the employee failed to

use an existing grievance procedure and (2) the sexually harassing

situations are rectiﬁed as soon as the employer becomes aware of

# them.

In fact, this was not accepted law at the time. But it did foreshadow

later legal developments, beginning in 1986. That’s when the U.S.

Supreme Court formally recognized sexual harassment as a form of

sex discrimination in Meritor v. Vinson. Although the court found the employer’s anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure ineﬀective

in that case, it did hint that an effective procedure might protect the

employer from liability. The Meritor decision, in turn, led to a sharp

increase in employers arguing that they should not be liable if they had

## an anti-harassment policy and complaint procedure in place.

In 1998, the Supreme Court — citing the 1980 EEOC guidelines —

explicitly addressed the issue of anti-harassment policies and complaint

## procedures in the Faragher v. City of Boca Raton and Burlington v.

Ellerth cases, which were decided together. The HR profession did not

sit back idly during the arguments. The Society for Human Resource

Management (SHRM), the ﬁeld’s professional association, ﬁled an

amicus brief in the Faragher case arguing that employers should be aﬀorded legal protection when they create anti-harassment policies.

SHRM also wrote that employers, rather than courts, were best suited

to address sexual harassment. In its own amicus brief in the Faragher

case, the EEOC distinguished between two types of harassment: quid

## pro quo harassment, in which a supervisor conditions tangible economic

beneﬁts on sexual favors, and hostile work environment harassment,

in which employees are subjected to unwelcome sexual advances or commentary that is suﬃciently severe or pervasive to aﬀect the

employee’s ability to perform their job. The EEOC advocated that anti-

harassment policies and complaint procedures should be a defense

## to allegations of sexual harassment in hostile work environment

# harassment only.

The Supreme Court, in essence, agreed with both SHRM and the EEOC.

It created the Faragher-Ellerth aﬃrmative defense, which is nearly

identical to the rule articulated in the 1981 Personnel article, with the

distinction advanced by the EEOC added. The aﬃrmative defense set

forth allows employers to escape liability if they can prove:

a) That the employer exercised reasonable care to prevent and

## correct promptly any sexually harassing behavior, and (b) that the

plaintiff employee unreasonably failed to take advantage of any

preventive or corrective opportunities provided by the employer or

to avoid harm otherwise.

The court went on to specify that in most cases, a policy prohibiting

sexual harassment and a complaint procedure would satisfy the ﬁrst

prong of the aﬃrmative defense. And so having a policy became a proxy

for companies actually doing something to prevent sexual harassment.

As a result, it has become almost impossible for an employee to

win a hostile work environment case about sex or race harassment.

## Although the Faragher and Ellerth decisions only apply directly to

## hostile work environment harassment cases, judicial deference to

organizational policies and complaint procedures, which had been

## increasingly common in all types of discrimination cases even before

Faragher and Ellerth, has become even more common since these

# decisions.

How Do We Know? We Have the Data

## My colleagues Linda Krieger, Scott Eliason, Catherine Albiston, and

Virginia Mellema, and I collected and coded a representative sample

## of 1,024 organizational discrimination and harassment court decisions

beginning in 1965 — after the passage of the Civil Rights Act — and

continuing through 1999. Later, Brent Nakamura and I coded and

analyzed a follow-up representative sample of 164 court decisions

at ﬁve-year intervals after 1999: 2004, 2009, and 2014. We coded

references to all types of organizational structures, including what were

## explicitly antidiscrimination policies and procedures but also more

## general governance structures, such as formal evaluation procedures

or progressive discipline policies. Courts frequently view the latter policies as evidence of rational governance and hence an eﬀort to avoid

discrimination. This allowed us to examine the conditions under which

judges deferred to the various symbolic structures that organizations

created.

We coded a judge as having deferred to the presence of symbolic

structures when the judge found the structures to be legally sound yet failed to consider the eﬀectiveness of the structures at all; declared that

an inadequate procedure was suﬃcient; or ignored substantial evidence

# of discrimination or harassment.

As shown below, judicial deference to symbolic structures increased

steadily over time, beginning in the lower courts and traveling up the

judicial hierarchy. It originated in federal district court but increased

dramatically in the circuit courts of appeals beginning in 1980.

Deference increased substantially again after 2000 in both the district

and circuit courts. By 2014, judges were deferring to symbolic structures

in about 70% of district court cases and nearly 50% of circuit court

# cases.

Given that judges often rely on the mere presence of anti-harassment

policies and complaint procedures, we cannot look to the courts for a

solution to the problem that the #MeToo movement has exposed.

# What Should Companies Do Next?

If companies truly want to prevent harassment, they need to go beyond

policies and procedures. While there’s currently too little research that

points to a deﬁnitive solution, a 2016 EEOC report makes important

recommendations based on social science research by prominent

scholars: First, increase the representation of women and people of

color at all levels of management. Second, be aware of factors that

increase the likelihood of harassment such as power disparities, isolated

or decentralized workplaces, a tolerance for alcohol, and prominent or

powerful employees who believe that rules do not apply to them.

Perhaps the most important ﬁnding in the EEOC report is that

workplace culture can have an enormous impact on the prevalence of

harassment. Harassment is less likely when leaders make clear that they

have a strong commitment to a culture of inclusion and respect for all

employees, and when they hold managers and employees accountable

# for harassment in a fair manner.

Moreover, HR professionals and managers should recognize the many

obstacles that inhibit victims of harassment from using company

complaint procedures. People who oversee the complaint process

should make it as easy as possible for employees to report harassment,

## protect complainants from retaliation, respond to complaints seriously

and swiftly, and take decisive action to sanction harassers. In addition,

the EEOC report recommends conducting conﬁdential climate surveys

## of employees for a better sense of the prevalence of harassment. Of

course, survey feedback is useless unless organizational management

commits to making necessary changes based on the results.

HR professionals helped to create the system of symbolic structures

that the courts now treat as evidence of compliance with civil rights

law. They now have the responsibility, alongside other managers and

executives, to build a culture of respect and inclusion for all employees,

and to ensure that anti-harassment policies are taken seriously and

that complaint procedures provide meaningful redress for harassment.

The #MeToo movement has mobilized support for change, but toothless policies will not curb harassment without strong eﬀorts by corporate

# leaders.
