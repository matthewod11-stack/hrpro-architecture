Laura is the VP of product at a fast-growing software company. She’s

known for her sharp instincts and hands-on style, but is stretched

thin: reviewing every product tradeoﬀ, attending every design review,

and mediating between engineering and sales. Her team is capable but

stuck, reluctant to move forward without her.

## HBR / Digital Article / Should You Delegate That Decision? Ask These 4 Questions

Laura’s experience—a full calendar, an overﬂowing inbox, and a mind

pulled in four diﬀerent directions before noon—is common among

senior leaders. Everyone wants a piece of your judgment: on priorities,

personnel, budgets, strategy, and the ﬁres that ﬂare up daily. But there’s

only so much time and so many decisions that you can—and should—

take on.

Most leadership advice says to delegate more. But how do you know

what kinds of decisions are ripe to delegate, particularly in today’s high-

## stakes, fast-moving, and ambiguous environment?

# Identifying Decisions to Delegate

In coaching clients like Laura, I’ve uncovered four questions to help

senior leaders identify which types of decisions are safe—and strategic

# —to delegate.

- 1. Who’s closest to the action, and what can they see that I can’t?

This question helps you identify proximate decisions, where someone

on your team is closer to the work than you are and has direct, timely insight. Whether it’s the sales manager who just got oﬀ a diﬃcult call

with a client or the engineer who built the feature themselves, someone

closer to the action might have a clearer understanding of the context

than you do.

These decisions can also be about workﬂows: Think scheduling rituals,

## communication cadences, or handoﬀ points between teams. The people

doing the work often know best how to improve it.

Why it helps: This question shifts attention from hierarchy to insight.

It reminds leaders that proximity is a form of expertise, and honoring it

can yield faster, more grounded decisions.

- 2. Is this a decision we’ve made before—and could it be routinized?

Pattern decisions—like approving discount requests, prioritizing bug

ﬁxes, or evaluating vendor proposals—repeat over time. You’ve likely

seen the same issue before and already have guardrails in place.

Someone else can use historical data or follow a clearly communicated

procedure to solve the problem.

Why it helps: This question reveals where you’re spending time on

decisions that could be systematized. Once you deﬁne the criteria, you

can create a checklist—and a handoﬀ opportunity.

- 3. Whose perspective would lead to a better answer than mine?

Sometimes, someone else can bring a unique lens, whether it’s lived

## experience, technical expertise, or direct exposure to the customer’s

world. Other times, the right person has little to no direct contact to the

customer’s world, but still has the insight or know-how to ﬁnd the right

solution. Even if you outrank them, their view may be sharper.

Why it helps: This question surfaces underused insight and creates

space for others to bring forward what only they can contribute.

- 4. Where is momentum stalled, and who could move it forward with a decision? These are stuck points—places where work is delayed either because no

one feels empowered to move it forward or because there is no obvious

role or responsibility that oversees this work stream. The risk isn’t a bad

call; it’s no call at all.

Why it helps: Leaders often try to step in and push the work. But asking

this question gives someone else the authority to unblock the path.

Asking yourself these four questions isn’t just about reclaiming

hours. It’s about reclaiming leadership. When you hand over decision

ownership with structure and intention, the ripple eﬀects are

# substantial:

- You free up mental space for strategy, relationships, and innovation.

- Your team builds judgment by practicing real decisions, not just

executing tasks.

- Your organization moves faster because decisions don’t pile up on

# your desk.

# When It’s Still Hard to Let Go

For some leaders, asking these four questions is enough—but others hesitate. They might see decisions that technically could be delegated,

but the personal discomfort of letting go still lingers.

When Laura mapped her work against the four questions, she saw

several clear opportunities for delegation. But she still wasn’t sure how

to step back. I suggested she ask herself these three questions to move

from insight to action:

- 1. Why am I the only one who can make this decision?

If your answer is “because I always do,” “because I’m faster,” or “because

they might get it wrong,” it’s worth pausing. This question helps identify

whether you’re holding the decision for strategic reasons—or just by

# default.

Laura realized her presence in every decision was training her team to

defer, not develop. Her input—even when minor—reset alignment. She

saw that her team could succeed without her if she could give them the

space to try. This insight helped her loosen her grip.

## HBR / Digital Article / Should You Delegate That Decision? Ask These 4 Questions

- 2. Would a team member beneﬁt by owning the outcome—not just the task? Once you’ve acknowledged you don’t need to make the call, this

question helps you ﬁnd the right person to step in and frames

## delegation as a professional development opportunity.

Laura saw this clearly. Her directors were experienced but unclear on

their decision-making authority. By holding on to the calls, she had

blurred the lines. Letting go wasn’t a loss of control—it was a path to

# growth, both for them and for her.

- 3. Can I deﬁne what must be true for the decision to succeed without making it myself? This question closes the loop. Can you articulate the success criteria so

that someone else can take action conﬁdently?

Laura realized she didn’t need to pick product features. Clarifying the

roadmap and what success would look like allowed her directors to

make the ﬁnal call—and explain it back.

If you’re still hesitant, ask yourself: Is there anything beyond my

answers to these three questions that would prevent me from delegating

this decision successfully? If yes, name it. If not, let go.

When Laura began to delegate decision-making, her team was surprised

at ﬁrst—and then energized. With clear criteria and new authority, they

stepped up and owned more decisions on their own. Laura stayed in the

loop, but was no longer in the way.

. . .

When you let go of the right decisions, you don’t lose control—you

extend it. You turn decision-making into a shared capability. You

become not just a leader of work, but a leader of leaders.
