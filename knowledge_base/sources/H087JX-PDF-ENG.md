Ever since the ﬁrst return-to-ofﬁce mandates emerged in 2021,

managers have grappled with the delicate task of balancing

## organizational policies with the preferences of their employees. The

pressure from higher-ups to bring people back to their cubicles has been

building over the years, and as a manager, you need to tow the company

# line.

So, what should you do about team members who are still dragging

their feet? How can you maintain a positive work environment without

causing unnecessary tension? And how can you eﬀectively address your

employees needs, while also following company policy?

# What the Experts Say

According to a survey by ResumeBuilder.com, 90% of companies with oﬃce space will put in place RTO policies by the end of this year, with

most tracking employee attendance. These decisions thrust managers in

the center of a protracted RTO battle, tasking them with implementing

policies they had no hand in creating and might not fully support.

But even if you have reservations about your employer’s rules and

deeply sympathize with employees who are struggling with the policy,

you must make a concerted eﬀort to embrace it, says Art Markman, a

## psychology professor at the University of Texas at Austin and author

of Bring Your Brain to Work: Using Cognitive Science to Get a Job, Do

it Well, and Advance Your Career. Your job is to help the organization

succeed, so “you can ﬁght the policy up to the point where it’s been set

in stone, after which you either enforce it or quit,” he says. You’re not

just a robotic keeper of the rulebook, however. Your role as a leader is to

“enforce the policy in a way that doesn’t undermine it, while at the same

time showing empathy with the people who have to live with it.”

## Carol Kulik, a professor at the University of South Australia and the

author of Human Resources for the Non-HR Manager advises working

with your team members to “co-design the return” together. “That

means addressing their concerns, advocating for them where possible, and ensuring they derive value from spending more time at the oﬃce.”

Here are a few steps to try if your company is insisting on RTO but some

of your employees are still resisting coming in.

Show compassion. The tension over returning to the oﬃce might seem

as if it’s about location, but it’s actually about autonomy, says Kulik.

“The pandemic was the ﬁrst time workers had a say in creating their

own routines, and it oﬀered them a taste of autonomy,” she says. Your

employees’ reluctance to relinquish that is understandable: “They’re

not voluntarily walking back into the cage.”

Ask your resistant team members about their concerns and the diﬃculties they face coming into the oﬃce. Listen attentively,

empathize, and oﬀer support. Markman warns against inadvertently

adding to team members’ complaints or fostering negativity, as it could

undermine the policy and fuel resentment. “You can show empathy for

the situation, while still focusing on the advantages of the policy for

both the organization and individuals,” he says.

Be collaborative — and look for creative solutions. One of the most

powerful things a manager can do amid this transition is to ask people

what they need and be responsive to that, says Markman. “Say, ‘I know it’s a change. I know it’s diﬃcult. What would help?’”

Some of the biggest challenges associated with RTO include money

## and inconvenience. Lengthy rush-hour commutes and disruptions to

school pickups are common complaints. In this case, explore options

like adjusting your team’s start and end times to give them a window of

overlap with each other. Some team members could come in early and beat the traﬃc, while others could come in later after the school run,

says Markman. “Think about what might make people’s lives easier and

better while still fulﬁlling the mission of the policy.”

While the RTO mandate may limit some of the ﬂexibility that employees

have come to value, managers may still have the ability to provide

ﬂexibility to their team members in meaningful ways. “If one of your

team members has a sick child and needs to be home for three days, be

ﬂexible and accommodating,” says Markman. And although eliminating

the mandate is beyond your authority, you may be able to identify

times when more work-from-home allowances could be permitted, says

Kulik. You could propose remote work during periods that require deep

thinking or designate a “free week” each month where employees can

choose their work location based on their tasks. Kulik says that “these

minor compromises demonstrate to the big bosses that we all are on the

same page” and share a desire to achieve common goals.

Another oft-cited reason employees don’t want to work at the oﬃce is

that it’s practically impossible to get any work done. Knowledge work is solitary, but oﬃces are often noisy. This presents an opportunity to evaluate your oﬃce environment, says Kulik. “You don’t need to gut

your building or do anything dramatic.” Simple adjustments, such as

relocating more chatty, social teams or designating a quiet corridor, can

be eﬀective.

Prioritize inclusion. To better understand the needs and concerns of

your team, Kulik recommends looking at the demographic data to

identify groups of employees who seem most resistant to returning to the oﬃce. This information can help you “diagnose a culture problem,”

she says. For example, if your most recent hires are wary, it may be

due to a lack of proper onboarding and a sense of disconnection. Or, if

female employees are expressing more doubts, it may indicate a need

# for a more inclusive environment.

She suggests addressing these issues by creating activities and

initiatives that can help to create more engagement. This might include

introducing employees to colleagues with similar interests or arranging

mentorship opportunities. “When people feel excluded, you have to

work harder to include them.”

Make coming in worthwhile. “Nothing will tick oﬀ an employee more than coming all the way into the oﬃce and being on a Zoom all day,”

says Markman. It’s crucial, he says, to create an engaging in-person

work environment by providing team members with opportunities to

learn from colleagues, participate in high-level meetings, or collaborate

with diﬀerent teams. Early-career workers particularly beneﬁt from

observing experienced colleagues, he says. “It’s harder to internalize the

goals of what the next job entails if you’re not able to see how others

work.”

Kulik suggests motivating skeptical team members by focusing on

building strong individual relationships, providing tailored feedback,

oﬀering exposure to clients, and assigning them to challenging, high-

proﬁle projects that can help them see the impact of their work. The goal is to “help employees see that there are things they get at the oﬃce

they don’t get at home,” Kulik says. She advises talking to your bosses

about using discretionary budget to launch events and initiatives to make going back to the oﬃce more enticing, including social events that

build a sense of community.

Markman also suggests emphasizing to your bosses and boss’s bosses

the signiﬁcance of being visible to the rank and ﬁle. “Prior to the

pandemic, a lot of upper-level management disappeared into higher

ﬂoors. But they need to walk the halls, show their presence, and

engage,” he says.

Celebrate the wins. The downsides of returning to work are about as inevitable as ﬁnding fragrant leftovers in the oﬃce fridge. Which is why,

according to Markman, you need to be extra vigilant about celebrating

the positive moments of bringing everyone back together. That could

be an energetic and productive team meeting or a spontaneous idea

sparked by casual conversations over donuts in the breakroom.

There’s no need for excessive optimism, but a simple acknowledgment

such as, “Wasn’t this better than a Zoom meeting?” serves as a reminder

of the special advantages that come with working alongside each other

in person, even for those who may have been less than thrilled about the

idea of coming back. “It’s a recognition that we had a good time working

together in person to solve problems, as opposed to the Hollywood

squares of virtual meetings,” says Markman. “We spend an enormous

percentage of our waking hours at work, on some level, it needs to be

# fun.”

Measure results. Finally, you’ll want to conﬁrm that the return-to-oﬃce

mandate is doing what it’s supposed to. “Continuing to take a look at

the policy shows you’re willing to use data to inform decisions,” says

Markman. He recommends talking with upper management before the

mandate is in place, to determine clear success criteria for it.

Once it’s up and running, keep an eye on metrics like productivity and

absenteeism — as well as retention. Research from Gartner found that

the intent to stay among knowledge workers was 8% lower at companies

with strict RTO mandates. For high-performing employees, it was 16%

lower. Pay attention to how long it takes your team to get things done

and if it’s tougher to hire with the mandate in place.

Then, take a good, hard look at the data. “It could show that

your strategies are working and that everyone’s still motivated and

engaged,” says Kulik. “Or it might reveal that people were actually more

productive working from home.” The goal is to ﬁnd a balance between

company policies and your people’s needs, adds Markman. “Make sure

the mandate makes sense for your team,” he advises. If it doesn’t, be

prepared to adjust or revisit.

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Ask employees what’s holding them back from coming in and be

responsive by oﬀering creative solutions that address their speciﬁc

# needs.

- Champion events and activities that add personal value to the in-oﬃce

# experience.

- Ensure that you’re creating a healthy and inclusive in-oﬃce

# environment.

# Don’t:

- Undermine the policy and fuel resentment by piling on to your team

members’ complaints about the policy; instead, listen, empathize, and

# oﬀer support.

- Be overly rigid. Even if you lack the authority to change the mandate,

use what wiggle room you have to provide ﬂexibility to your members

# in meaningful ways.

- Underestimate the importance of fun; celebrate the positive moments

# of in-person collaboration.
