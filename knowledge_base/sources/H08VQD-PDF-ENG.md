Are you afraid of boredom? In this video, Harvard professor Arthur

C. Brooks, author of The Happiness Files: Insights on Work and Life,

makes the case that boredom isn’t a problem to escape with another

scroll on your phone. Make room for being bored, he argues, and you

create the mental space to wrestle with life’s deeper questions of meaning

and purpose. You can watch more videos from Brooks on our YouTube

channel, including insights on imposter syndrome, professional identity,

and ﬁghting workaholism.

## HBR / Digital Article / You Need to Be Bored. Here’s Why.

ARTHUR BROOKS: You need to be bored. You will have less meaning

and you will be more depressed if you never are bored. I mean, it

couldn’t be clearer. Let me give you the good side of boredom in general.

Boredom is a tendency for us to not be occupied otherwise cognitively,

which switches over our thinking system to use a part of our brain that’s

called the default mode network. That sounds fancy. It’s really not.

The default mode network is a bunch of structures in your brain that

switch on when you don’t have anything else to think about. So, you

forgot your phone and you’re sitting at a light, for example. That’s when

your default mode network goes on. We don’t like it.

## My colleague in the psychology department here at Harvard, Dan

Gilbert, he did experiments where people had to sit in a room for

15 minutes with instructions to do absolutely nothing, and there was

nothing in the room to do, except there was a button in front of them

that they could push. And if they did, they gave themselves a painful

electric shock. Sit there bored, or get a shock. A big majority of the

participants gave themselves shocks instead of thinking about nothing.

We don’t like boredom. Boredom is terrible. Why is boredom so

bad? Well, because the default mode network makes us think about

things that might be kind of uncomfortable. When you think about

## nothing while your mind wanders and thinks about, for example, big

questions of meaning in your life. What does my life mean? You go to

uncomfortable existential questions when you’re bored.

That turns out to be incredibly important, incredibly good. One of the

reasons we have such an explosion of depression and anxiety in our

society today is because people actually don’t know the meaning of

their lives, much less so in previous generations. Tons of data show this,

and furthermore, we’re not even looking. Why not?

## HBR / Digital Article / You Need to Be Bored. Here’s Why.

I’ll tell you why not. We ﬁgured out a way to eliminate boredom. We’ve

been able, almost completely, to shut oﬀ the default mode network

in our brains. How? The answer is that thing in your pocket with the

screen, which you take out even when you’re standing on the street

corner waiting for the light to change, is like, I might have to wait here

# for 15 seconds.

What are you doing? You’re actually trying to not be bored because the

default mode network is mildly uncomfortable, because it sends you to

the types of questions that you can’t get your mind around. You can’t

get your arms around. Well, that’s a big problem. That’s a doom loop

of meaning. If every time you’re slightly bored pull out your phone, it’s

going to get harder and harder for you to ﬁnd meaning, and that’s the

## recipe for depression and anxiety and a sense of hollowness, which, by

the way, are all through the roof.

I get it. You don’t want to be bored. You need to be bored. Be bored

more. Tomorrow, when you go to the gym in the morning after you

wake up, don’t take your phone. Can you handle it? Not listening to a

podcast while you’re working out. Just being in your head. I promise

you, you’ll have your most interesting ideas while you’re working out

# without devices.

It’s probably been a long time since you’ve done that. Commute with

nothing, not even the radio. Can you do that? Start getting better at

periods that are 15 minutes and longer of boredom, and watch your

life change. Number one, you’ll be less bored with ordinary things in

your life. If you get better at the skill of boredom, you’ll be less bored

with your job. You’ll be less bored with your relationships. You’ll be less

bored with the things that are going on around you.

But more importantly, you’ll start digging into the biggest questions in

your life, purpose, meaning, coherence, signiﬁcance. And who knows?

You might just get happier. People ask me all the time, is the doctor

taking his own prescriptions? And the answer is, yes. Yes, I am.

I’m prone to the same pathologies as anybody else because I have the

same brain chemistry as everybody else. So what do I do to ﬁght that?

And the answer is, well, I do a number of things. I have a no device

policy after 7:00 in the afternoon. I don’t sleep with my phone.

We don’t have devices when we have meals in my family. Because we’re

there for each other. We’re not there for people who aren’t there. Three,

I have regular social media and screen cleanses where I don’t use my

device for longer periods of time. First, it’s like children screaming in

my head because that’s how dopamine is saying, get the phone, get the

phone. That’s addiction.

But it calms down and I feel better. And I feel sort of blessed by the end.

And I pick the phone up by the end because I have to check my emails.

And I have to be a normal, functioning, connected person in the world.

But it does remind me that my life doesn’t have to revolve around these

# devices.

These protocols are really, really helpful and I recommend them to

anybody and everybody. Don’t sleep with your phone. No phones during

meals. Regular social media fasts. You’ll get better. People worry that if

they do these things, they’re going to miss something. There are ways

that you can remedy that.

One of the things that you can do is you can have your phone on. You’re

just not looking at it, and there’s only one or two numbers that can reach

you in case of emergencies. Phones can do that by the way. If you don’t

have to do that, ask your kid.

But don’t use emergencies in as an excuse. Here’s something that’s

not an emergency: What’s going on Twitter. That’s not an emergency

answer nothing. It doesn’t matter. The news can wait. Seriously,

your grandparents didn’t what was going on every single second in

# Washington, DC.

You’re killing yourself with this stuﬀ. Are you kidding me? It’s bad for

you. So let me say it straight to my kids. Put down your phones. You

need more meaning in your life. And so do I.
