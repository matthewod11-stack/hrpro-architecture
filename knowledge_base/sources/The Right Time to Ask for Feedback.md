know what you think of this deck. Can I have your notes by EODtomorrow?Unexpectedly, she sends you back a shopping list’s worth ofcriticisms. (She clearly failed to read between the lines and realizethat you were just looking for compliments.) In an instant, yourpride spirals into self-doubt and stress.

Research shows that this situation is not uncommon — our desirefor validation is

human nature. At work, this can lead us to seekthe approval of others and make us feel like failures when wedon’t immediately get it. Once we’re stuck in this mindset, we’reless likely to learn and more likely to react defensively to usefulcritiques.How do we overcome this (very normal) challenge? Timing whenwe ask for feedback can make all the difference.

# In one study, scientists

discovered that people who soughtfeedback on a completed speech or draft were primarily lookingfor affirmation of their work. As a result, the constructivefeedback they were given was less impactful — and this could befor a number of reasons. When we’re told to make a big changeafter finishing a project, we may feel anxious because the deadlineis approaching. Similarly, if the feedback is to make severalsmaller changes, we may tell ourselves the feedback-giver is nit-picky to save our egos. Our instinct, in both situations, maybe topush back. Instinctually, we may defend ourselves, even when weknow the other person is right.

In the same study, when people asked for feedback well beforethey had finished a project, their main motivation was to maketheir work better. As a result, the constructive feedback they weregiven was more impactful because it encouraged collaboration,learning, and inclusion. In summary, asking for feedback ahead oftime is better for everyone.

The sweet spot for asking for feedback is when your work —whether it is a project, a presentation, or something else — isabout 50% to 60% complete, according to Dan Heath, the authorof

Upstream: The Quest to Solve Problems Before They Happen.“I think a lot of writers make the mistake of getting 90% of theway there, and then they start asking for feedback,” Heath

told me

in a recent interview. “And at that point, if you get negativefeedback, you can’t afford to take it on. Your instinct is going to beto push back and think, ‘Oh, well that’s just nit-picking,’ or, ‘I can’tafford to revisit that.’”“Asking for feedback earlier in the process gives you the mentalspace to really re-think, if necessary,” Heath explained.At work, asking your boss or peers for feedback earlier willdemonstrate your willingness to adapt. More importantly, it willprovide you with the opportunity to learn — to genuinelyconsider and implement suggestions that can elevate your workbefore you complete it. This process will ultimately make yourwork stronger, and in turn, you’re likely to receive less negativefeedback once you do turn it in.

When you do reach out for feedback, it’s important to ask forspecifics. The more specific the feedback is, the easier it will be foryou to incorporate it into your work. Heath explained that askingfor vague feedback often gets you ingenuine responses. Forexample, if he were to ask someone, “What did you think of mybook?” they would be more likely to say something positive tospare his feelings. Instead, he suggests asking pointed questions.When asking for feedback on a particular project at work, thinkabout what you really want to know. For instance, if you’reworking on a presentation, do you want your coworkers ormanager to critique how engaging it is? Do you want to know ifthe data on your slides are easy to understand, or are you lookingfor feedback on how effectively you’re able to craft the data into astory? The more pointed your questions are, the more useful thefeedback will be. A pointed question might sound like:

Does this data point make sense?

Is the story I’m telling on slide 5 clear or confusing?

Should I add more visuals to slide 7?

Gaining feedback on your overall work performance, as opposedto a one-off project, can be a little more tricky. The best approachis to initiate quarterly check-ins with your manager that arefocused on getting formal feedback about your role andresponsibilities. This is a good way to avoid unpleasant surprisesonce your annual performance review rolls around.During these meetings, use the start-stop-continue framework togather insights on your performance. Ask your boss for one thingyou can start doing, one thing you can stop doing, and one thing

you can continue doing — but remember to make your asksspecific.For instance, instead of saying, “What are some skills or behaviorsthat I need to improve?” you can say, “What can I start doing tofurther develop my project management skills?” Instead, ofasking, “What are some things I can stop doing?” you can ask“Which of these projects is a greater priority for us right now?Instead of wondering, “What are some things that I’m doing wellthat I can continue to grow myself in?” you can pose the question,“What’s one thing I did well on this project that you’d like to seeme do again?”By having regular performance check-ins, you’ll be able to speedup your growth and identify your goals and focus areas ratherthan waiting for a once-a-year feedback session.Being open to feedback (especially early in your career) sets thestage for continued development and professional growth. Thisopenness to critique and constructive criticism not only leads toimproved work but also helps in fostering a growth mindset,which is essential for personal and professional development.When you prioritize learning and improvement over seekingaffirmation, you become more resilient in the face of setbacks andbetter equipped to handle the inevitable challenges that arisethroughout your career. So, embrace feedback, ask for it early andoften, and use it as a tool to refine your skills and become the bestversion of yourself.
