the demands of conﬂicting constituents and put the interests of the

# enterprise above their own.

I’m hearing this too. My clients cite several forces that are encroaching

on their cohesion and ability to lead—and subsequently diminishing

others’ conﬁdence in them. Shifts in political power have led to abrupt

policy changes, challenging leaders to remain agile and compliant amid

evolving regulations. The whiplash of changing priorities, particularly

## in areas like DEI, pricing, and supply-chain sourcing, forces leadership

teams to make swift decisions with limited clarity. And global tensions

and conﬂicts may well disrupt supply chains and market stability,

requiring leaders to proactively assess and manage these risks to protect

their organizations. Finally, heightened political activism and societal

tensions increase personal risks for executives, necessitating robust

security measures to protect leadership and maintain organizational

# stability.

What makes this new breed of intruder particularly diﬃcult is that

unlike previous routine market or organizational challenges, they’re

precedent setting. That means leadership teams will naturally fumble a

bit as they ﬁnd their footing in unchartered terrain, and that fumbling

can cause conﬁdence in the team to dip further. Meanwhile, your

stakeholders are desperately trying to make sense of the unknown. Valid

or not, they expect you to know things you don’t know.

While you may not have answers—and new information is likely to

change your mind—leadership teams must be prepared to adapt and

share your thinking about decisions as things unfold. Here are six things

your leadership team can do to maintain and strengthen conﬁdence in

the team’s ability to lead amid turbulence.

Align decisions with your organizational values and communicate them that way.

The polarizing geopolitical climate ampliﬁes scrutiny on leadership

actions. Leaders who consistently align decisions with organizational

values and ethical principles sustain credibility.

In response to a previous HBR article that I co-authored, a reader

recently wrote me describing an executive team whose practice of

“backroom horse-trading” belied the company’s stated value of the

“importance of teamwork and supporting one another.” He said he

realized “how destructive it is to our culture when we ask people to act

in ways that our own behavior contradicts.” He had come to conclude

that such hypocrisy was just normal at that level.

In times of volatile uncertainty, the temptation to retrench to

bolster your need for survival is understandable. But to the rest of

the organization, the resulting fragmentation appears as condoning

self-interest over the greater good. Remaining cohesively aligned

behind hard decisions is a vital component of sustaining credibility

as a leadership team. In today’s environment, self-protection and

entrenchment signal cracks in the team’s commitment to modeling

values—and thus reasons to withdraw conﬁdence.

In one organization I work with, the executive team’s initial panic over the impact of tariﬀs set oﬀ a blaze of short-sighted and self-protective ideas in an attempt to fend oﬀ feared threats. The CEO listened to her

team carefully, and without judging them, said: “The world is watching

us. On every wall in our building and on our website we say, ‘We do

the right thing, no matter what.’ What I’m hearing from you is the safe

thing for you personally, not the right thing for our consumers or our

shareholders. So, let’s try this again.” The team then proceeded to have

a hard conversation that took a longer view of their options and focused

on the needs of their stakeholders, including their employees.

To ensure your team’s decision-making is aligned with your values:

- Begin every strategic decision discussion by explicitly identifying

which organizational values are most at stake and use those as criteria

# for evaluation.

- When communicating decisions, start with “Here’s the value we

prioritized in making this choice,” followed by the rationale. Linking

action to principle builds credibility.

Model fast learning.

It’s no secret you’re facing things for the ﬁrst time, so don’t try

to hide it. A team that visibly evolves in response to change gives

others conﬁdence that they’ll stay adaptive, not defensive, when

# circumstances shift again.

Tell people what you’re learning, how you’re learning it, and what

you’re doing with the new knowledge. Stay ahead of industry shifts,

geopolitical risks, and emerging technologies as best you can. Those

who invest in continuous learning and upskilling maintain trust

in their ability to navigate complexity. Rapid cycles of learning

and unlearning demonstrate relevance and humility—both essential

## leadership qualities for today’s turmoil.

To model fast learning:

- Begin leadership team meetings with a “what I’m learning right

now” round, encouraging members to share something new they’re

exploring or struggling to grasp.

# HBR / Digital Article / Executive Teams Are Losing Stakeholders’ Confidence. Here’s H…

- Create a shared “leadership learning board” (physical or digital) where

executives can post articles, tools, or experiences related to current

challenges, promoting a culture of visible, continuous learning.

## Cultivate psychological safety among yourselves.

Encouraging dissenting views and open dialogue within teams

## strengthens decision-making, so create space for diverse perspectives

in order to avoid echo chambers, ideological “camps,” and groupthink.

Teams that normalize disagreement and curiosity signal emotional

maturity and openness—two characteristics others often interpret as

strength. Without this safety, individuals retreat into silence or passive

resistance, which erodes trust faster than disagreement ever could.

Another reader of our previous article suggested their executive team

didn’t have the level of trust “to call each other out.” They asked: “How

do we make it safe enough to normalize saying the tough things?”

The assumption behind the question seems to be that this is an

“orientation” issue—that saying hard things requires a level of comfort

and familiarity. But that’s not true. It’s not supposed to be comfortable,

but it does require skills many leadership teams lack.

My advice to them? Practice. Like any skill, you have to go to the

“executive team conﬂict gym” and work out until the muscles you need are strong enough to withstand whatever diﬀerences come your way.

To cultivate psychological safety:

- Dedicate regular team time (e.g., monthly or quarterly) to “conﬂict

practice” sessions, deliberately exploring tough issues to normalize

## dissent and practice non-defensive responses.

# HBR / Digital Article / Executive Teams Are Losing Stakeholders’ Confidence. Here’s H…

- Use a team norm like “disagree, then commit” to encourage full airing

of opinions while reinforcing uniﬁed execution post-decision.

Vent freely among yourselves and present a single voice to the world.

In addition to normalizing constructive dissent on your leadership

team, make it the safest place to be frustrated, anxious, and over your

skis. Others in the organization will try to put wedges between you to

get at their version of the truth or protect their own interests. Don’t take

the bait. The healthiest teams are often the ones that argue the most

internally, but they do it with respect, shared goals, and discipline.

Align on key messaging in every conversation, and make sure there

is no daylight between the message you agree on and how you each

represent that message to the outside world. Once a message leaves

the room, the team owns it together. Anything less invites speculation,

## division, and erosion of conﬁdence in leadership unity.

To ensure you’re presenting a uniﬁed front:

- Use a shared message template after each major leadership discussion

to align language and key points before communication cascades

# begin.

- Agree on a “private parking lot” where any lingering frustrations

or dissent can be brought back up internally without risking public

# misalignment.

## Strengthen cross-functional collaboration.

Intensiﬁed external forces will further entrench leaders into their own

## worlds/departments/regions. Siloed leadership breeds ineﬃciency and

erodes trust across the organization.

High-functioning teams break down barriers and align eﬀorts across

functions, fostering unity in times of external discord. When teams

operate as one unit rather than loosely aﬃliated ﬁefdoms, they

model the alignment they want others in the organization to follow.

Especially under stress, seamless collaboration signals shared purpose

and coordinated execution—two things people desperately want to

# believe in.

During one recent global transformation I worked on, three executives

leading critical adjacencies—data analytics and AI, cybersecurity,

and information technology—had been contending with signiﬁcant

boundary conﬂicts in their departments. The executives went on a

worldwide roadshow to meet with their teams, model alignment, and

help increase understanding of how the teams would collaborate.

Instead of presenting their own department’s contribution, they each

presented each other’s, signaling their shared ownership. It took

## four months, but in the end, collaboration and synergy dramatically

improved.

To strengthen cross-functional collaboration:

- Pair executives from diﬀerent functions to co-lead initiatives, with

shared ownership over outcomes and messaging.

- At the start of each leadership meeting, ask one function to brieﬂy

describe how a current enterprise-wide issue is impacting them. This

## keeps interdependencies visible and relevant.

Lead out loud with context.

Letting people into your own cognitive process allows them to learn

from you while learning about you—seeing you as human, vulnerable,

and therefore more worthy of their conﬁdence. “Leading out loud”

means saying things like, “Here’s what I’m still working out for myself,

but here’s what I know,” “Let’s step back and keep in mind that..,” or “I

know you may be tempted to interpret this in this way, but here’s what

I’d encourage you to think instead…”

Context-setting can help you get in front of people making up stories

to ﬁll information gaps. When people understand not just what you’ve

decided but how and why you decided it, their trust deepens, even if

they don’t agree. In the absence of transparency, made-up narratives

form quickly and often unfairly. “Leading out loud” is how you preempt

## misinformation and rumor with clarity and connection.

To let employees into your thinking:

- Build “framing statements” into all-hands meetings and emails—e.g.,

“Here’s what we were weighing,” “Here’s what we still don’t know,” or

“Here’s how we landed where we did.”

- Encourage leaders to narrate their thinking in real time by using

statements like, “I’m processing this as I go, but here’s where my head

is right now,” especially in live discussions or Q&As.

. . .

Conﬁdence in leadership teams doesn’t come from perfection—it comes from coherence, conviction, and visible eﬀort. In a time when so much

feels out of control, leadership teams that commit to showing up with

transparency, humility, and unity give their organizations something

rare: a steady hand. The world may not be getting easier to lead through,

but teams that embrace these practices will make it easier for others to

believe in and ultimately follow their leadership.
