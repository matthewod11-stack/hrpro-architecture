A number of factors can contribute to a team’s lackluster performance:

individual mistakes, strained interpersonal dynamics, a lack of

## communication between the leader and team members, or some

combination of all of these. If your team is underperforming and your

manager is pushing for a turnaround, you may feel at a loss — especially

if you feel like you’ve already been giving the team your all. Here’s what

to do if you’re responsible for a team whose work has been deemed not

# up to par.

Realize you’re not in this alone.

If you’re managing an underperforming team and receive a problematic

review, you may feel like you’re on an island — but you’re not. It’s time

to enlist help. First, elicit support from your peers by asking for advice

regarding what they’ve done with underperforming teams. Second, look

outside the organization for guidance. Check in with mentors or other

leaders and peers you respect and ask: “If your team underperformed

and you got a bad review, what would your next move be?”

# Accept the feedback with a caveat.

While you may feel defensive and angry about the feedback because you

were evaluated on factors outside your control, recognize that you are

accountable for the team and their actions or inaction. Accept the input:

acknowledge that now is the time for renewed eﬀort and a better plan.

Being defensive won’t help matters.

Moving forward, ask your manager for support for your team

wherever necessary. In addition, focus on your strengths. Ensure you’re

highlighting what is going right in conversations with your manager.

Remind your manager why you’re the right person to ﬁx the group.

Remember that your boss is extremely busy and may not spend time

recognizing things that are going well; remind your manager of the

## positives in an authentic, meaningful way.

Don’t spiral with negative thoughts.

It can be easy to get caught up in the narrative of self-blame,

thinking that you should have turned things around more quickly. But

ruminating won’t help transform the situation. First, consider what you

can control: then make an action plan and move forward.

## Ask for more clarity and support from your manager.

Remember: You aren’t in this alone. If you feel embarrassed or defensive

about your review, take a beat and then consider: “What do I need from

my manager?” When your head is clear, email and schedule a follow-up

meeting. Create space for your manager to give you feedback in person

or over video call rather than over email or Slack; that way, you can

pay attention to nonverbal communication, like body language. Also,

asking for help face-to-face will take you further because it’ll be more

challenging for your manager to say no or punt oﬀ the request.

Take a fresh look at your leadership style.

After your review, assess how you can shift your leadership. Ask yourself

# these questions:

- How is the current way I’m leading the team working? If I need to make

a shift, what would that look like?

- How am I holding each team member accountable for speciﬁc

# deliverables?

- Am I being transparent with leadership as to the seriousness of the

# situation?

# Co-create a team goal.

Don’t let your team oﬀ the hook and take on the full burden for the

group’s success yourself. When the team makes mistakes, it’s your

responsibility to address them and help the team move forward. But

it’s just as important to proactively co-create goals with your team

members. Try this: in individual status meetings, ask each person to

come prepared to discuss their goals and how they’re tracking toward

them. As the team leader, ask yourself:

- Have I explicitly shared feedback so that each team member knows

where they need to focus?

- Have I shared how I’d like to see goals developed and written?

- How will I keep on top of each team member?

As you’re setting goals, you as leader will need to be even more

hands-on. Don’t leave anything to chance; overcommunicate and meet

# regularly, especially as a group.

Think about your future.

While it’s easy to get completely wrapped up in the teams’ development

and how you will help them perform better, you must also think

about yourself. Your manager may only care about you achieving a

successful turnaround. To keep moving forward in your career, co-

create individual goals with your manager. Your renewed focus on your

own performance can only help the team. Carve out 30 minutes a week

and keep a standing meeting with your manager so you can have the

space to think about your goals moving forward.

It’s frustrating and challenging when your team is underperforming,

especially if you’ve been coaching and pushing them to meet their

goals. Trust that you can handle the responsibility of turning things

around. Examine your leadership style, overcommunicate, and work

toward collaborative solutions with your team members; remember that

you’re not alone. Make sure you’re focusing on your goals, too.
