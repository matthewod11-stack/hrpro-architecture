Personal health should be a private matter. But when you need to take time off work due to a mental health condition, often it isn’t possible to

maintain that privacy. As a board member at the National Alliance on

## Mental Illness (NAMI), and a former managing director at two global

banks (UBS and Deutsche Bank), I’ve been approached by hundreds of

colleagues and clients over the past 30 years seeking advice for themselves

or a colleague, friend, or family member on how best to manage

professional life while dealing with a mental health condition themselves

or caring for a loved one who is. Here is what I usually tell them.

First off, this is a common situation. Just because you don’t know of anyone else at your company who has taken time off for mental health

reasons doesn’t mean there isn’t precedent. Diagnosable mental health conditions impact one in ﬁve Americans in any given year. Treatment for the most common conditions (namely depression) is effective 80% of the

time, but fewer than half of the people who need help get it, often because

of social stigma, the fear of repercussions at work, or lack of access to quality, affordable care.

While workplace culture is not the cause of an illness, certain cultures,

especially those that require employees to work long hours in sedentary conditions, can make an illness difficult to manage. Lack of adequate sleep,

an inability to maintain an exercise routine, loss of time with friends and

loved ones, or substance misuse can lead to deteriorating mental health,

which can make it hard to keep up at work.

If you need to take a leave of absence, ideally you’d be able to calmly

inform your manager or HR department that you need to go on leave,

while sharing only a minimal amount of information and keeping your

diagnosis private. For a longer-term disability leave, as opposed to a

normal sick leave, your doctor will likely need to provide documentation to your ﬁrm’s disability insurance provider. The disability provider acts as

an intermediary between you and your employer and does not share your

diagnosis with your employer. The provider would then evaluate

information about your health status and make recommendations

regarding when you can return to work.

It’s important to know your rights and your company’s policies. In the

U.S., the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA) makes it illegal to

## discriminate against an employee with a mental health issue. Many

## conditions, such as bipolar disorder, major depression, and post-traumatic

stress, are covered under the ADA, but it does not provide blanket

## protection. The federal Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

(EEOC) provides guidance on the rights and obligations of employers and

employees and can be a good source of information for those in the U.S.

Once you’ve negotiated your leave and gotten the help you need, a big

question is how to return to work: What do you tell coworkers? Your boss?

How do you get back into the swing of things without compromising your

health? Of course, no two paths will be the same.

Start by weighing the pros and cons of being open about a diagnosis. Many

people have physical or mental health issues and opt not to tell their

coworkers or employers about them. The law is on your side here. The

EEOC says the returning employees may keep their diagnosis private in

most situations. But, of course, your manager may already know about

your condition if you involved them in taking the leave of absence.

In my experience, there are typically two types of people who will disclose, despite the fear of prejudice or discrimination at work. The ﬁrst group is

those who want to bring their whole selves to work and don’t want to

hide. The second group includes leaders, either in title or in practice, who

understand that openly acknowledging their diagnosis can shed a positive

light on what it means to work with someone with a mental, or invisible,

# disability.

Regardless of whether you disclose, prepare for colleagues’ questions

about your absence. A brief and consistent narrative will help you stay

focused on readjusting to work. You might say something like, “I took time off for health [or personal] reasons, but things are ﬁne now and I’m happy

to be back to work.”

Consider whether you should go back full-time right away or part-time at ﬁrst. Dealing with a mental illness can be exhausting, so give yourself the

time you need. Reintegrate into your larger social circle with the same

measured pace. And consider the impact of any medications you might be

taking. Some might make you drowsy, so see if you can shift your hours to

avoid working at your most tiring periods. Over time, your psychiatrist

may want to adjust your medications to optimally manage your brain

chemistry. It can be days, weeks, or months before you and your doctor

can tell if the medication and dosage are right for you. During this

transition time, you may experience physical reactions or mood swings.

Develop a personal mantra to help you transition back: “Be compassionate

to myself.” “I’m on a learning curve.” “Take it a few hours at a time.” Rely

on your support system — an empathetic family member, a close friend, a

## doctor or therapist, and perhaps a trusted colleague at work. They can

provide insight into your behavior that can prevent the onset or reduce the

# seriousness of your illness.

Stick to a routine, whenever possible. Find a quiet place where you can

take short breaks, or even meditate, during the day. Before you go home,

make a brief list of the next day’s priorities. Think through how you will

manage business travel that involves crossing time zones; jet lag can cause

# backsliding.

In the evening, jot down a few positive things that happened during the

day. Journaling can help you track your moods and behavior and can help

your psychiatrist calibrate your medications.

To prevent setbacks, learn to recognize the early warning signs. Are you stressed, anxious, or getting into conﬂicts at work? Keep in mind that there is a difference between a bad day and relapsing.

Finally, if you want to have a conversation with your boss or colleagues

about your health, do it on your terms, when work is going well and you

are in an unemotional state. You might make yourself more vulnerable

with those you trust, but being able to share your diagnosis can help to

dispel myths and reduce stigma. Talking about mental health, just as one
