Manager-employee relationships are particularly important.

Research shows that when employees get along with their bosses,they’re more motivated and productive, while those who don’t aremore likely to perform poorly. These relationship dynamics caneven impact an employee’s

health.Traditionally, managers have been able to build relationshipswith their direct reports in person. But those days are gone. Fifty-eight percent of 25,000 Americans

surveyed by McKinsey saidthey have the option to work from home at least one day a week,and 35% are permitted to do so full-time. What’s more, whenpeople are allowed to work flexibly, 87% of them do. This meansthat managers, new and seasoned, need to find new ways toconnect with their teams — not just on a professional level, but ona personal one as well.As the chief revenue officer at my organization, I used to count ontraveling to our offices to build these connections. During thepandemic when work travel came to a halt, I needed to find a newway to avoid “ivory tower syndrome.” When leaders come acrossas too busy and are unreachable to their employees, people don’tcome to them with the problems that need to be solved — andthose problems fester.Through trial and error, I developed a video meeting system that’shelped me sustain meaningful relationships with my teammembers. I’ve received positive feedback from participants aboutthe value these spaces provide.

If you’re a manager overseeing remote employees, you can use asimilar strategy.1) Keep it small.At least once a quarter, add a new meeting to your calendar — orpotentially two or three, depending on the size of your team. Onthe invite, break down your team into groups of eight to 10 people,or fewer. Just how small will be a matter of how many people youoversee and how many meetings you have time to schedule. If yourun a small team and can include everyone at once, that will beideal. I invite a maximum of 10 people, a small enough size to helpeveryone feel included.This isn’t a brainstorming or strategy meeting. Its sole purpose isto forge deeper connections with and among your team members.2) Choose a theme.Giving your meeting a theme, I’ve found, helps disarmparticipants. In my meetings, invitees are welcome to wear, bring,or do whatever they want in keeping with the theme. For example,one was, “Everything’s coming up roses.” I wore a flower on myshirt. Some participants brought plants, while others had hatswith flowers in them. Another theme was, “Bring a favoriteanimal.” I brought my dog Josie. Some participants brought theirpets as well, while others had stuffed animals or wore animalmascots from their universities. It can be a Zoom background, aphotograph, or anything else.The key is to choose a theme broad enough that everyone canrelate to it, such as music, travel, or food.3) Do a round robin.

Ask each employee to share anything they wish about what theybrought. Go first. As the leader, you set the tone. You can openwith something meaningful, funny, or insightful depending onthe mood you want to convey. Typically, I try to keep it upbeat atthe start, while also sharing something personal that myemployees haven’t yet learned about me.When your teammates share, it’s helpful to follow up with aquestion to move the discussion along. As an example, if someoneshare that they enjoy swimming, you might ask, “Oh you’re aswimmer? Do you prefer outside or inside?”By giving people this safe space to share with no judgment, youhelp your employees bring forward more of themselves. This willstrengthen your bond and make them feel safer sharing moreserious concerns with you in the future.4) Be an open book.After each participant has had a turn, explain that this is anopportunity for them to ask you questions or to bring up anytopics they wish. They might ask about your previous jobs or howyou plan to handle a challenge the team is facing. They mightshare something they recently achieved, an idea they have, or aproblem that has been nagging at them.Emphasize that in this meeting, no one is there to impress you oreach other. Answer their questions as best you can, while avoidingunnecessarily stressful details about work — you want to keep themood relatively positive and forward-thinking, while alsoshowing compassion and validating people’s feelings andconcerns.As an example, if someone brings up a problem within yourorganization, you might say: “I hear you, and your concerns are

totally valid. This is what I know the company is doing to addressthis right now, and I’m happy to check in on that and follow up.Thanks so much for bringing this up. I’m also happy to discuss itfurther one-on-one.” By doing this, you’re demonstrating thatyou’re ready to listen, show empathy, and help tackle theirchallenges.Some people tend to be more introverted, and may be lesscomfortable speaking. That’s fine — they don’t have to say much.But these meetings can be helpful for them to

practice speaking infront of colleagues. And by giving them positive feedback, youcan help them build the confidence to

speak up more in thefuture.Of course, this doesn’t negate the need for one-on-one casualconversations at times. But with managers under

great pressure,you may not have as much time as you’d like for individual get-togethers. Through these small group conversations, you’ll notonly develop bonds with your employees and stay in touch withtheir experiences and concerns, you’ll also help employeesestablish greater bonds with each other — building a workplaceculture in which everyone is more apt to thrive.
