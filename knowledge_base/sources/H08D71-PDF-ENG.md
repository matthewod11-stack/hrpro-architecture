In 1978, Deng Xiaoping launched his “Reform and Opening” policy to

## leverage Western technology and know-how for China’s development.

It was a politically risky move: Ideological hardliners in the

Communist Party resented the implicit assumption of China’s economic

## backwardness under socialism — and the superiority of the capitalist

West. But Deng recognized that China’s modernization required both

# pragmatism and humility.

Today, the roles are reversing. Although it’s too early to say whether

China’s hybrid “state capitalist” system will outmatch Western models,

it has undeniable strengths. China leads in 53 out of 64 critical

technological ﬁelds, according to the Australian Strategic Policy

Institute. This success is built on centralized planning and control, but

also features ruthless competition that produces global winners able to

compete on price and quality in developed and emerging economies

alike. No other country can match China’s market scale, or consumer

# enthusiasm for the latest tech wizardry.

Leaders of multinational corporations must adopt a certain Deng-like

pragmatism and humility to achieve success in China today. Those who

do will see proﬁtable global growth and will have a leg up in their home

markets, provided they seize opportunities in the four key strengths of

# the Chinese economy:

- 1. Its Innovation Ecosystem

## China’s innovation ecosystem uniquely combines top-down

## government–industry coordination with the bottom-up drive of Chinese

entrepreneurs. Startups that align with government-picked growth

industries of the future can prosper through favorable policies,

## regulations, and centralized investment in scientiﬁc research.

## A “whole-of-nation” approach to innovation marshals almost unlimited

state resources. From 1995 to 2021, China’s total R&D outlay soared

from $18.2 billion to $620.1 billion — a 3,299% increase compared

to America’s 277%, according to the Netherlands’ Rathenau Institute.

China has become a leading global hub for advanced scientiﬁc research.

According to The Economist, Chinese scientists now lead the world

in producing high-impact papers and contributing to famous scientiﬁc

publications selected after rigorous peer review.

No segment better illustrates China’s technological prowess than clean

tech. China now accounts for over 80% of global production capacity in

11 essential technologies, including solar wafers and lithium-ion battery

components. Moreover, China dominates the rare-earth supply chain,

accounting for 70% of global rare earth ore extraction and 90% of rare

# earth ore processing.

Just as Chinese companies once beneﬁted from decades of Western

## investments in traditional industries like autos and chemicals, U.S.

## and European companies should now cash in on China’s colossal

# expenditures on clean tech.

In the solar sector, for example, there’s virtually no point in Western

companies trying to compete. China’s investment in large-scale solar

panel manufacturing over the past two decades drove down prices by

85% between 2010 and 2020, leading to exponential global growth —

# and signiﬁcant climate beneﬁts.

Invenergy, the largest U.S. independent renewable energy developer,

has seized the opportunity to beneﬁt from China’s investment in

solar. This year, the company opened the biggest solar factory in

the U.S. through its newly formed subsidiary Illuminate USA, a 51/49

partnership with LONGi Green Energy Technology, a leading Chinese

solar photovoltaic company. As part of the deal, Invenergy acquired

LONGi’s advanced solar technology. The Ohio facility is expected to

eventually produce 5 GW of solar panels annually and create more than

1,000 new jobs. As of the end of 2022, the U.S. had only 8 GW/year of

module production capacity yet needs to install over 60 GW annually

by mid-decade to meet U.S. climate goals. Invenergy’s partnership with

LONGi enables it to leverage LONGi’s scale, advanced technologies,

and supply-chain advantages to help meet that target while achieving

## sustainable competitiveness in U.S. manufacturing.

Ford is another U.S. company that has recognized that Chinese

technology is indispensable to its green ambitions. To make the diﬃcult

transition from gas-guzzling SUVs and trucks to electric vehicles (EVs),

the Detroit giant has teamed up with CATL, China’s dominant EV

battery manufacturer. Ford is investing $3.5 billion into an EV battery

factory in Michigan that will use licensed CATL technology to cost eﬀectively produce lithium-ion batteries for Ford’s F-150 Lightning

# trucks and other EVs.

- 2. Its Investment in the Global South

China’s strength in emerging markets is reshaping global business

dynamics. Traditionally, Western multinationals have focused on

mature markets with highly engineered products at high price points,

while China conquered growth markets.

China excels at tailoring aﬀordable, innovative solutions to local

needs. For instance, Chinese smartphone companies, led by Transsion

Holdings, Xiaomi, and Huawei, captured 76% of the smartphone

market in India and more than 60% of the African market by 2021.

## Similarly, Chinese EV manufacturers dominate Latin America, holding

an impressive 86% market share. Moreover, Huawei supplies around

70% of Africa’s 4G network infrastructure.

China’s dominance in the Global South is supported by its trillion-dollar

Belt and Road Initiative (BRI), an infrastructure initiative that has

signed up more than 150 countries and 30 international organizations.

BRI-driven demand is a huge advantage for Chinese companies, and

## a large opportunity for Western multinationals willing to partner with

# those ﬁrms.

Cummins Inc, a global leading power solutions provider, recognized

early on the value of such tie-ups. While many U.S. companies were

hesitant to invest in China due to the then mandatory 50-50 partnership

with Chinese-owned entities, Cummins saw this requirement as an

opportunity, establishing six joint ventures with leading Chinese truck

and construction machinery manufacturers, such as DongFeng, Foton,

and LiuGong, between 1995 and 2018. Cummins contributed engine

technology and manufacturing know-how, while the Chinese partners

shared the investment risk and purchased a signiﬁcant portion of the

output. “We’re the engine people. They are the truck people,” said Steve

## Chapman, then Cummins vice president for East Asia and Southeast

# Asia.

Today, China represents the largest overseas market for Cummins,

and Cummins China’s partnerships have been pivotal in Cummins’

successful journey. “The economy of scale we have developed through

our partnerships has allowed Cummins to develop a localized supply

chain and build up our engineering capabilities in China. This in turn

has helped Cummins develop robust and innovative ‘ﬁt-for-market’

solutions that are required to compete and win in China,” shared

## Nathan Stoner, Cummins vice president and chairman of Cummins

# China.

Crucially, the technology innovations pioneered in China have allowed

Cummins to expand in other developing markets such as India, South

## America, and Southeast Asia, where performance, quality, and cost

requirements are more similar to China than to the U.S.- or Europe-

designed products. Complementary strengths and collaboration with

Cummins contributed to Chinese truck OEM’s exporting over 300,000

heavy- and medium-duty trucks in 2023, which is approximately 30%

## of total domestic production and roughly equivalent to the entire North

# America heavy duty market size.

- 3. Its Ultra-Competitive Markets

Companies that survive the life-and-death struggles of China’s markets

— often described as a “Gladiators Arena” — often emerge as global

## champions. Think of CATL (batteries), BYD (batteries and electric

## vehicles), Tongwei (solar), Goldwind (wind), or Huawei (information

# and communications technology).

Once Beijing decides to develop a new industry, regional governments scramble to oﬀer subsidies and other support programs. Hundreds of

companies jump in. This necessitates a “lean startup” mindset and

fast product iterations where companies use data from real-world

experiments to get ahead of competitors. It is a colossally wasteful process, but also devastatingly eﬀective.

Tesla should know. Elon Musk became part of this dog-eat-dog

competition after it began selling vehicles in the China market in 2014.

In fact, Beijing encouraged Tesla’s arrival precisely to trigger such a

contest. As Tesla scaled up operations, local manufacturers like NIO,

Xpeng, and BYD began producing high-quality EVs at competitive

prices, challenging Tesla’s market position. Within six years, some 500

Chinese EV companies sprouted up, yet after ﬁerce competition only

100 remained in 2023. Of these, BYD surpassed Tesla as the world’s

largest EV manufacturer in total number of cars sold in 2023.

Initially, Tesla’s premium pricing strategy led to a loss of market share as price-sensitive consumers opted for more aﬀordable alternatives.

Tesla responded to the rapidly growing competition by leveraging

China’s supply-chain opportunities to reduce costs of car parts. Tesla

cut its prices four times in 2023. More importantly, Tesla’s reduced cost

structure turned Tesla’s Model Y into the number-one selling car in the

# world in 2023.

German car manufacturers are on a similar journey in China. Mercedes

and other German automakers that once transferred combustion engine

know-how to Chinese partners are now learning from Chinese EV

makers, reversing the teacher-student relationship. In October 2023,

Audi and Chinese automaker FAW announced a joint project to build

## a $4.87 billion new energy vehicle production facility in Changchun

China. In April of 2024, BMW invested $2.76 billion to update its

Shenyang plant to produce its Neue Klasse series of EVs starting in 2026.

In response to Mercedes’ billions of dollars of EV investment into China,

Ola Kaellenius, chair of the management board, told Reuters: “You have

to be here and you have to be part of that innovation cycle.”

- 4. Its 1.4 Billion Consumers

Despite all the talk about companies “de-risking” and “decoupling” from China, the country still oﬀers a market of unmatched scale with

sophisticated consumers that push companies to continually improve.

## Accounting for almost 17% of global GDP — equal to the economic

## output of the European Union — China’s economic trajectory poses

signiﬁcant implications for global commerce. Should China’s GDP

ascend at its growth target of 5% — a benchmark it achieved in 2023

— its incremental growth this decade alone would match the combined

2021 GDP of India, Indonesia, and Japan. Moreover, China already

constitutes 25% to 40% of global revenues in key industries such as cars,

# luxury goods, and industrial equipment.

China’s large tech-savvy consumer base, bolstered by an expanding

middle class and increasing disposable income, has driven substantial

demand for consumer purchases ranging from tech-laden EV cars to the

latest luxury products. A report from Bain suggests China is expected

grow to as much as 40% of global luxury spending by 2030. In 2022,

the Chinese luxury e-commerce market was valued at approximately

$74 billion. Before Covid, which restricted Chinese foreign travel and

consumer expenditure, tourists, a majority from China, made up 40% of

## 2019 spending in Europe’s then €89 billion luxury market.

# The Perils of Not Being in China

Amazon entered China in 2004 by acquiring Joyo.com, an online

retailer, for $75 million. By 2011, Amazon held a 15% market share in the

China e-commerce market. While Amazon’s two primary competitors

in China at that time, Alibaba and JD.com, rapidly built out extensive

courier networks to enable almost-instant delivery and direct relations

with local suppliers to provide the lowest pricing possible, Amazon

adapted slowly. By 2019, with a market share of less than 1%, Amazon

## shut down its domestic China marketplace operations.

Meanwhile, the Chinese e-commerce landscape dynamically evolved.

Pinduoduo (PDD), with its formula of “super-cheap goods shipped

from the factory gates,” emerged as a disruptive force, challenging

both Alibaba and JD. PDD, having built scale, proﬁtability, and honed

strategies in China, aggressively launched their innovative e-commerce

model Temu in Amazon’s home market. Temu entered the U.S. market

in September 2022 and achieved over 90 million unique monthly

visitors in less than 12 months, compared to Amazon’s 221 million

unique monthly visitors built over nearly three decades. As of October

2023, the total number of Temu app downloads reached almost 235

million, surpassing the Amazon Shopping app. Amazon’s withdrawal

from China left it vulnerable to competitive threats internationally and

# domestically.

It is time for multinationals to ﬂip the paradigm. Companies like Tesla,

Cummins, Invenergy, and Ford have all adjusted a worldview shaped

be capitalized. Multinationals that fail to understand and follow their
