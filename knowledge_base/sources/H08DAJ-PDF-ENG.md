Effective delegation is critical to managerial success: delegating

properly can help empower employees, and those who delegate can

increase their earnings. Delegation can also be a way for managers to

give employees experience and control, especially when they delegate

decision-making responsibilities, which allow employees to exhibit

agency over important stakes. Yet, some of our recent research has

shown that employees can view delegated decision-making as a burden

that they would prefer to avoid.

Given the managerial importance of delegation, we wanted to better

understand the costs employers incur when they pass decision-making

tasks to their employees. To examine this, we conducted a series of

studies in a paper recently published in Organizational Behavior and

Human Decision Processes. We looked speciﬁcally at the interpersonal

costs of delegation — how delegation impacts the delegator-delegate

## relationship — as well as potential remedies for the negative impacts of

passing responsibility.

Across our studies, which included 2,478 U.S. participants in a mix

of controlled experiments and surveys, we found that delegating

decision-making responsibilities, compared with asking employees for

advice and maintaining decision-making responsibility, had signiﬁcant

interpersonal costs for delegators. But we also found material ways

that managers can alter how and when they delegate decisions, so that

employees feel empowered rather than burdened.

## The Interpersonal Costs of Decision Delegation

To better understand how delegation impacts employees’ desire to

work with delegators in the future, we asked 181 employees to recall a

time they had either been asked to make a decision or been asked for

advice. Then we asked participants how willing they would be to help

the requester with a decision in the future. Those who recalled being

delegated to were less willing to help the same person with a future

decision – even controlling for whether the outcome of the decision was

likely to be positive or negative.

In another study of 195 participants, we asked people to decide between

two candidates for a managerial role, but ﬁrst they interacted with the

candidates through an online chat. One candidate asked participants

for advice and the other delegated a choice to them. Participants were

signiﬁcantly more likely to hire the advice seeker, rather than the

delegating candidate.

We found the same pattern in another experiment involving 173 online

workers. The participants were instructed that they would be working

on a team and were connected with a teammate in a chat. In the chat,

half of the teammates asked the worker to make a decision and the other

half asked the worker for advice on the same decision. After ﬁelding this

request – to either make or provide advice on a decision – workers had

the option to continue working with the same teammate or to end their

## relationship with the teammate and work with someone else. Workers

who had been delegated to, compared with those who were asked for

advice, were signiﬁcantly more likely to end their relationship with the

# teammate.

Given how detrimental decision delegation can be, we wondered: Are

there any factors that can oﬀset these negative eﬀects and improve how

employees view delegators?

# How to Delegate Decisions

It turns out that the people in our studies thought being asked to

make a decision was less fair than being asked for advice, and that

this sense of unfairness made them view delegators more negatively. It

may seem unfair when someone asks a colleague to take on decision

responsibility – and its potential burdens – when the colleague views

that responsibility as rightfully the requester’s to shoulder.

So how can managers delegate decisions without seeming unfair? Our

## research oﬀers three important considerations:

# Delegate choices with positive outcomes.

In a controlled experiment, we asked 578 participants to imagine

either being asked to make a decision or to give advice. For half of

the participants, this decision concerned layoﬀs (a negative outcome),

## and for the other half, it concerned bonuses (a positive one). The

participants then indicated how fair they felt the requester was.

When the decision concerned layoﬀs, we again found that decision

delegation (versus advice seeking) was interpersonally costly, yielding

a lower willingness to provide help with future decisions. Yet when the

decision concerned bonuses, there was no cost of decision delegation;

those who were delegated to were equally willing to provide future

decision support as those asked for advice. We further found this

diﬀerence related to people’s perceptions of fairness: delegating a

positive decision seemed fairer than delegating a negative one.

Give employees responsibility for decisions that fall within their roles.

Managers can also avoid the interpersonal costs of decision delegation

when there’s a contextual reason why it may make sense to transfer

# decision responsibility.

We hypothesized that when a potential decision lies squarely within

someone’s wheelhouse, the request to make it would seem more

legitimate and be viewed as more fair. For example, in one study we

asked participants to imagine that they worked in a bank, and that their

manager was delegating the decision for a location for a new branch. We

found that participants perceived such delegation as fairer when their

assigned role was responsible for real-estate decisions compared with

when their role was in charge of employee beneﬁts.

Limit the potential consequences to colleagues.

Finally, managers may be able to avoid the interpersonal costs of

decision delegation when the decision primarily aﬀects the delegate

alone. We tested this idea in a study where 981 participants imagined

being asked about a work-from-home schedule for either themselves or

# their team’s administrator.

When the decision concerned their own schedule, the interpersonal

costs of decision delegation, as compared to advice seeking,

disappeared. People may be more willing to take responsibility when

only they — rather than their colleagues — may suﬀer any potential

# consequences of the choice.

. . .

Our research suggests that one-size-ﬁts all guidance exhorting leaders

to delegate may miss important nuance. Delegating decisions can carry

signiﬁcant negative interpersonal costs that managers would be wise to

weigh alongside the potential beneﬁts of freeing up time and energy.

Our work provides insight into the decision contexts in which these

costs are more and less likely to accrue: When the decision outcome

has a high potential to have negative consequences, is outside of

the employee’s scope of responsibilities, and primarily aﬀects others,

there are likely to be interpersonal costs of decision delegation, and

managers looking to utilize their employees’ knowledge should ask for

advice instead. When these elements are reversed, transferring decision

responsibility is likely to be less interpersonally costly and might

provide employees a better venue to test out their decision-making

# skills.

Finally, our work suggests that those seeking to delegate decisions may

beneﬁt from pursuing strategies that make their requests seem fairer.

For example, delegators could consider framing a decision within the

scope of their colleague’s responsibilities or could articulate how they

will take active responsibility for any fallout from an employee’s choice.

Notably, our study does not directly consider the potential motivational

quality of delegated decision-making. For example, it is possible that

employees may react more positively if they view making the decision

# as a path to promotion or advancement.

While delegation may be critical to managerial success, knowing when

and when not to delegate may be even more important: Managers who

can navigate this eﬀectively can enjoy the beneﬁts of delegation without

paying an interpersonal price.
