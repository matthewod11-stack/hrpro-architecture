This month marks the ﬁve-year anniversary of the Covid-19 pandemic

upending life in the U.S. Those early days were marked by uncertainty,

fear, and a scramble to adapt to an unprecedented global crisis.

Businesses shut their doors overnight, supply chains were disrupted,

and employees faced massive upheavals in how and where they worked.

Business leaders had to make rapid, consequential decisions using

incomplete information, all while maintaining trust and stability in

# their organizations.

Five years later, it’s clear that major disruptions are no longer rare

events. Whether sparked by global health crises, geopolitical conﬂicts,

or technological upheavals, leaders now operate in an environment

where signiﬁcant change can emerge at any moment.

Consider how the pandemic didn’t simply accelerate existing trends—it

transformed how organizations operate and how leaders must think.

Remote work has evolved from experimental to standard practice.

Supply-chain vulnerabilities have shifted from theoretical concerns

to strategic priorities. Technology continues to redeﬁne how work

gets done and value gets created. Perhaps most signiﬁcantly, the

employer-employee relationship has fundamentally changed, with

workers expecting greater ﬂexibility, purpose, and support from their

organizations amid the institutional pressure to prioritize growth,

# eﬃciency, and proﬁtability.

Through our work coaching executives across industries, we’ve

observed that successful leadership today demands more than just

crisis-management skills—it must embrace change as a constant and

transform disruption into growth opportunities. In this environment

of increasing uncertainty and complexity, leaders must develop ﬁve

essential skills that together create a new leadership approach capable

of transforming disruption into fuel for innovation and growth.

- 1. Proactively engage with uncertainty.

The pandemic sparked a fundamental shift in how successful leaders

approach uncertainty. While some organizations focused solely on

weathering the crisis, others began identifying future possibilities amid

# the turbulence.

Amid massive disruptions to supply chains, manufacturing, and

shifting consumer habits, PepsiCo CEO and chairman Ramon Laguarta

saw an opportunity to rethink the company’s future. Building on the

forward-looking strategies introduced by former CEO Indra Nooyi,

Laguarta embraced scenario planning to navigate uncertainty. In 2021,

he launched pep+, a bold initiative that put sustainability and people

at the center of PepsiCo’s business strategy. The plan taps into key

trends—consumers’ growing preference for healthier options, the need for sustainable farming practices, and eﬀorts to cut carbon emissions

across the supply chain—ensuring PepsiCo stays ahead in a rapidly

evolving market.

Developing a more proactive and integrated stance toward uncertainty requires leaders to take a diﬀerent approach to strategic and business

planning. First, they can shift from annual business planning cycles to

more regular forecasts that include strategic foresight practices—such

as “outside-in” early signal and trend scanning—to proactively identify

emerging patterns and potential disruptions before they become

obvious. Leaders can also practice scenario planning by exploring

various “what if” situations to anticipate potential external shifts and

# prepare adaptive responses.

Finally, they can strengthen organizational adaptability by building

cross functional-teams that are incentivized to identify and act on

unexpected or emerging opportunities, fostering a stronger culture of

learning and ﬂexibility. These practices help transform uncertainty

## from a threat into a source of strategic insight and organizational

# resilience.

- 2. Balance employee and company needs.

The post-Covid workplace has shown that rigid, one-size-ﬁts-all

workplace policies don’t work. Companies need to understand their

workforce and develop models that balance ﬂexibility with business

# goals.

Airbnb’s approach to hybrid work illustrates how an organization

can create a system that meets both employee needs and

company objectives without defaulting to strict oﬃce mandates.

CEO Brian Chesky has said that while there is value in in-person

collaboration, requiring employees to be in the oﬃce all the time

is unnecessary. Instead of focusing on physical presence, Airbnb

## prioritizes performance, with clear goals and rigorous milestones to

ensure accountability, no matter where employees are working.

Rather than mandating a set number of in-oﬃce days each week,

Airbnb has structured its hybrid model around intentional in-person

gatherings. Employees work remotely most of the time but come

together for one week each month at the company’s San Francisco

headquarters. These gatherings foster collaboration and connection,

ensuring that teams have dedicated time to align on key priorities while

maintaining the ﬂexibility of remote work.

## This focus on clarity, structure, and trust instead of in-oﬃce attendance

demonstrates that hybrid models can be both employee-centric and performance-driven. This model has also proven cost eﬀective, reducing

the company’s real estate footprint while justifying the investment in

bringing employees together periodically.

Leaders looking to master this balancing act must take a thoughtful,

multifaceted approach. First, design work environments with clear

intention, recognizing that productivity isn’t about physical location.

Next, develop a deep understanding of your speciﬁc workforce by

gathering systematic feedback and assessing what truly enables

teams to perform at their best, then construct a framework that

simultaneously supports business goals and employee engagement.

Finally, fully embrace the principle that performance matters more

than presence by establishing transparent goals, implementing robust

progress tracking, and providing regular, meaningful feedback. As

Chesky demonstrates at Airbnb, genuine accountability stems from

well-deﬁned milestones and thoughtful check-ins, not from monitoring

# physical presence in an oﬃce.

- 3. Test new ideas quickly.

In a world of constant change, the ability to quickly test and reﬁne

new ideas becomes crucial. Successful organizations have moved

beyond traditional planning cycles to create environments where

experimentation is continuous and learning from failure is valued. This

approach requires a fundamental shift in how leaders think about risk

# and innovation.

Starbucks’ Tryer Center exempliﬁes this mindset. The innovation lab

was created in 2018 to serve as a rapid prototyping facility where teams

can quickly test new product ideas, service concepts, and store designs.

More importantly, it embodies a culture where experimentation is

expected and iteration is constant. Since the pandemic, the Tryer

Center has been focused on rebuilding the in-store experience to meet

increasing customer demands from mobile ordering while also making

it an easier place to work. More recently, Starbucks developed more

sustainable cold cups, designed speciﬁcally to use 10–20% less plastic

while maintaining durability. Ideas like this move from concept to

testing in days rather than months, allowing the company to respond

quickly to changing customer preferences, market conditions, and

# sustainability goals.

The key isn’t just running experiments—it’s creating systems that

can quickly scale successful tests while learning from failures.

Organizations that excel at rapid testing have developed clear

frameworks for evaluating ideas, managing risk, and implementing

# learnings across their operations.

Leaders can cultivate this experimental mindset through several

deliberate practices. Begin by establishing low-risk pilot programs that

test new concepts with limited audiences before committing to full-

scale launches, creating safe spaces for innovation. Simultaneously

foster a genuine culture of experimentation by actively rewarding

learning from failures rather than penalizing inevitable missteps,

signaling that thoughtful risk-taking is valued. Additionally, transform

organizational rhythms by shortening decision cycles, moving away

from rigid quarterly planning toward more responsive, rolling

improvements that allow for continuous adaptation. These practices

collectively build the organizational muscle needed to thrive in rapidly

changing environments.

- 4. Make smart decisions with limited information.

## The unprecedented nature of the pandemic also fundamentally

changed how organizations approach decision-making. Prior to 2020,

leaders often sought comprehensive data and analysis before making

major strategic moves. But as Covid-19 unfolded, waiting for complete

information was no longer an option. Organizations had to make

## critical decisions about employee safety, supply-chain adjustments, and

## business model changes with limited visibility as to how the situation

would evolve.

Microsoft demonstrated this adaptability when they rapidly shifted

150,000 employees to remote work in early 2020. Rather than waiting to

develop perfect solutions, they adopted an iterative approach, regularly

gathering employee feedback and adjusting their policies based on

emerging needs and challenges. Similarly, when Airbnb’s business

model was upended virtually overnight, they made quick but signiﬁcant

decisions: cutting their workforce by 25%, pausing marketing, and

refocusing their platform on long-term stays and local travel—all before

knowing whether travel patterns would ever return to pre-pandemic

# norms.

These companies showed that eﬀective decision-making in uncertain

times requires a balance of speed and prudence, supported by strong

feedback mechanisms and the willingness to adjust course as new

# information emerges.

Leaders can strengthen their decision-making capabilities under

## uncertainty through several strategic approaches. Start by

systematically identifying elements that are relatively “pre-determined”

## in your environment and building decision models around those

established constraints, recognizing that not everything about the

future is equally uncertain. Then, create detailed playbooks for rapid

responses to recurring challenges, allowing teams to act decisively even

when information is limited. Additionally, implement clear “design

criteria” that explicitly articulate organizational values and priorities,

providing consistent guardrails for decision-making when complete

information isn’t available. This structured approach transforms

uncertainty from paralyzing to actionable.

- 5. Communicate to build trust and confidence.

Clear, consistent, and authentic communication has never been more

critical for leaders. In times of uncertainty, people look to their leaders

## not just for information but for reassurance and direction. Leaders

must be able to convey complex information with transparency while

inspiring conﬁdence, ensuring that their messaging is both honest

and constructive. This requires an ability to navigate sensitive topics,

acknowledge challenges without creating panic, and maintain strong

## connections—even in virtual environments.

## Arne Sorenson, the late CEO of Marriott International, exempliﬁed

this approach during the pandemic. In a heartfelt video message to

employees in March 2020, Sorenson acknowledged the devastating

impact of the crisis on the hospitality industry while reassuring

employees that Marriott was committed to weathering the storm

together. He balanced honesty about the ﬁnancial hardships with

gratitude for his workforce, delivering a message of resilience and

unity. His transparent and compassionate communication reinforced

Marriott’s values, demonstrating that trust is built not by avoiding

diﬃcult truths but by addressing them with clarity, empathy, and

a commitment to collective action. Notably, Sorenson walked the

walk, publicly announcing in the same video that he would not be

taking a salary during this period, reinforcing his commitment to

Marriott’s values and showing solidarity with employees who were

facing economic uncertainty.

Developing exceptional communication skills during uncertainty

requires leaders to master several interconnected practices. Begin

by embracing radical transparency—being honest even when you

don’t have all the answers, acknowledging uncertainty while clearly

explaining how decisions will be made and information shared.

Diversify your communication approach by utilizing multiple channels

—town halls, emails, videos, and informal check-ins—recognizing that individuals process information diﬀerently, especially during stressful

# periods.

Practice authentic communication that refuses to gloss over diﬃculties

## with vague positivity, as employees consistently value honest

assessments over empty reassurances. Perhaps most crucially, ensure

## complete alignment between your verbal messages and nonverbal cues

—what we call “making sure the audio matches the video.” People

instinctively trust what they see over what they hear, so consistency

## between your words, body language, tone, and actions builds profound

credibility that reinforces conﬁdence in your leadership during

# turbulent times.

# Looking Ahead: The Future of Leadership

As we move further into the post-Covid era, the distinction

between normal operations and crisis management continues to blur.

Tomorrow’s most successful leaders will be those who can maintain

organizational stability while simultaneously driving innovation and

change. These leadership imperatives aren’t temporary adaptations —they represent a fundamental shift in what eﬀective leadership

means in the modern world. Organizations that embrace this new

paradigm, developing leaders who can thrive in uncertainty, will be best

positioned to succeed in an era where disruption is the only constant.
