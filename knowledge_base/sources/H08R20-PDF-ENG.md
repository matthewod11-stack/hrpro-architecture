Last year, I worked alongside a major airline’s cleaning crew at a busy

airport. In the airline business, turnaround time is everything. When

you deplane, these workers begin sanitizing the bathrooms, seats, and

ﬂoors. They’re under constant pressure. The team I observed that day

had some of the highest cleanliness scores at the airline, and it didn’t

take me long to ﬁnd out why.

Tanya is the cleanliness support coordinator who audits the planes and

is responsible for the team. When I met her, she took me to the agent at

the ticket counter to get my pass for the day.

“Isn’t her smile the best?” Tanya said before explaining how long the

ticket agent had been with the company and pointing out her favorite

things about working with her. Next, as we went through security, Tanya

found a TSA oﬃcer and asked how his vacation went and about his kids

# by name.

We descended into the cramped hallway at the tarmac level. It was

bustling with workers moving in and out to meet ﬂights. Tanya stopped

and asked a cleaner we passed how his daughter was. He pulled up a

photo on his phone, beaming. Then, she asked him a question she asked

everyone that day: “Is there anything you need from me?”

Tanya’s supervisor told me she’s in the top 10% of leaders in the

organization. In an occupation often rendered invisible, Tanya makes

everyone feel seen. She notices—an overlooked but foundational

leadership skill that’s increasingly needed today.

# The Power and Urgency of Noticing

In January 2025, Gallup reported employee engagement hit its lowest

point in a decade. During that same timeframe, services to improve

engagement became a $1 billion industry and organizations invested

millions in well-being programs and perks. Yet seven in ten people are

still disengaged. Why?

One data point stands out: Just 39% of employees in the sample

strongly agreed that someone at work cares for them as a person. That

## data mirrors 2023 ﬁndings from the human capital management ﬁrm

Workhuman, showing that 30% feel “invisible” and 27% feel “ignored.”

It’s hard for people to care if they don’t ﬁrst feel cared for. Feeling seen is

essential to fulﬁlling our fundamental need to matter—a prerequisite

for motivation, well-being, and lasting engagement. Noticing is the

deliberate act of paying attention to the details, ebbs, and ﬂows of

# someone’s life and work.

When I asked Tanya how she developed her approach, she told me that

## her supervisor—a director-level leader—is “always there for me.” He

makes her feel seen. Tanya then does the same for her team. When

leaders model the behaviors of truly seeing everyone in their everyday

interactions, the people they serve are more likely to do it for those they lead. This is a critical reminder of the cascading eﬀect of noticing

# people, especially for senior leaders.

# How Leaders Notice

So, how do we become better noticers? Here are three ways leaders—

whether you manage a small team or lead an entire organization—can

do just that.

Know the barriers to seeing others

Leaders are always crunched for time, and the ﬁrst barrier to truly

seeing others is hurry. While researching my book The Power of

Mattering, an employee named Sonia shared this story: “[My manager

and I] would have a weekly check-in, and almost every time my boss

would show up with ﬁve minutes left in the meeting and leave right

when it ended. She’d say, ‘Sorry, I was busy again.’”

Sonia was new to her role, a new mother, and needed support. “It was

terrible. Absolutely terrible. It came to the point that I’d journal and cry

and then keep going,” she said.

Hurry and care can’t coexist. Noticing others takes time, but when

leaders rush, it becomes too easy to cancel a one-on-one meeting, forget

to check in on an employee who’s struggling, or answer a few more

emails instead of connecting with a team member.

Noticing also requires attention, and the erosion of our ability to pay

attention is another barrier to seeing others. Research by psychologist

Gloria Mark shows that our average attention span for a single activity

has decreased from over two minutes in 2004 to just 47 seconds today.

The decrease is due to increased distractions and information overload.

One result of the strain on our attention is that interactions become

automatic. Our one-on-ones start the same. Performance evaluations

become robotic. The weekly team meeting becomes habitual. Walks

down the hall turn into a rush to a meeting room, avoiding eye contact

with those we’re passing by. This attentional autopilot can cause us to

miss signals: An employee starts sharing less, a colleague’s voice takes on a diﬀerent tone, or someone seems less energized than they used to

be.

The good news is we can get out of attentional autopilot through

“articulated intention”—being deliberate in setting goals for how we

want to show up in our interactions to ensure we’re making people feel

seen. This starts consciously deciding to slow down, make space, and

use our time to pay deeper attention.

# Make space and use time for connection

Leaders need to proactively make space and use their time to connect

more deeply. This doesn’t mean adding more meetings. Tanya is a busy

leader in a busy job, but she practices something I’ve seen many beloved

leaders do: She optimizes the interactions she already has.

Here are some ways to start:

- Use real-time interactions for relationship-building. The adage

“most meetings could be emails” is popular because most meetings

and interactions at work are information transactions. Save those

for email and other text-based platforms. What can’t be an email is

checking in on how someone is doing on a project they were struggling

with, seeing how an employee whose parent is in the hospital is

doing, or supporting someone who’s been overloaded. Make space

for discussing how people are doing, not just what they do, in your

# real-time interactions.

- Leverage in-between moments. The composer Claude Debussy

wrote, “Music is the space between the notes.” It’s in that space that

the sounds are heard and felt. The same is true in an organization.

The “notes” are the formal meetings, evaluations, or other scheduled

touchpoints. Culture and connection are built in the in-between

spaces—the few minutes before a virtual meeting starts, running into

a colleague on the elevator, or the couple of seconds after you’re

wrapping up a phone call. Use these transitions as checkpoints.

- Pay attention and use noticing language. When you create space

and start using time to connect, pay deep attention. One way to

immediately improve your attentional skill is to write down what you

observe. I worked with a lead nurse in an emergency room who uses a

memo pad to keep track of positive patient outcomes. She then starts

her team huddles sharing a positive story and recognizing their role

in it. As you share back what you note and observe, use noticing

language: “I saw that…” “I wrote down that…” or “I remembered that…”

These are all signals to people that they’re seen.

Gather the data to notice others

As Tanya passed by employees, she asked, “Is there anything you need

from me today?” As a result, the team shared details about their work,

asked questions about future scheduling, and discussed challenges they

were having. If she asked, “How’s your day going?” or something just

as mundane, it’s unlikely she would have had the details she needed to

address their concerns.

To gather better information so you can truly see others, try the

# following:

- Ask meaningful questions. Go beyond the greetings like “How are

you?” or “How’s your day?” Ask questions that reveal the details of

people’s lives and work. Your questions should be clear, open, and

exploratory. For example, “What has your attention today?” or “What’s

been most meaningful today?” or “What is challenging you right now?”

Ask questions that allow for more than a “yes” or “no” response.

Instead of, “Did the meeting go well?” you might ask, “What was

most interesting to you in that meeting?” Finally, be exploratory, not

evaluative. Instead of, “What’s the status on the project?” you might

ask, “What’s been working well on that project? Any roadblocks I can

# help with?”

- Check-in on energy and emotions. Energy and emotions are also

data we need to lead people better. One well-researched practice is to

do a green, yellow, or red check-in to get a sense of people’s energy

(green means you’re able to be present, yellow means you’re somewhat

stressed, red means you’re overloaded). Or you might ask: “What’s

giving you energy today? What’s taking away energy today?” What’s

important is to not jump in to “ﬁx” what you observe—awareness is the

goal. Later, you might say, “I noticed you were a ‘red’ today, what can I

do to help?”

- Monitor recurring struggles and oﬀer “proactive compassion.”

The more you start to see others, the more you’ll learn about what

people struggle with. One way to build the skill of compassion is to

regularly reﬂect on the diﬃculties you notice. Are they tied to certain

season? A particular project or objective? Then, think about the signs

you may look for to anticipate that struggle. Finally, identify the

resources you have or actions you can take to alleviate that struggle.

This type of “proactive compassion” signals to someone that you see

them and are there to support them.

## Leadership Happens in Your Next Interaction

“Relationships are my job,” Tanya told me at the end of the day.

“Everything else, including quality, follows.”

For leaders at all levels, the quality of the outcomes you get from people

is usually determined by the quality of your relationships with them.

Quality relationships start with quality interactions, and feeling seen

in these interactions can predict feelings of trust, the foundation of

high-performing teams. Take the time to ensure every interaction you

have begins and ends with noticing the people around you.
