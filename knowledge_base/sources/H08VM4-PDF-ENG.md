## Get Ready to Lead an Emotionally Charged Meeting

Leading through tension is part of being a manager, but you don’t have

to go into emotionally charged meetings unprepared. Here’s how to

stay grounded and guide high-stakes conversations with clarity and

# composure.

Visualize the meeting in advance. Picture the setting, the people

involved, and how you want to feel walking out. Mentally rehearse how

you’ll open the discussion, handle tension, and steer toward resolution.

Anticipate challenges and plan calm, conﬁdent responses.

Reframe your mindset. Focus on the positives. Before the meeting,

reﬂect on what you appreciate about the individuals involved or what

good outcomes could come from the conversation. This small shift

builds emotional resilience and helps you approach the interaction with

# empathy and clarity.

Adjust the setup. Use the “Five W’s”—who, what, where, when, and

why—to ﬁne-tune the logistics. Who needs to be there? Should you

bring in resources to support the conversation? What needs to be shared

and what doesn’t? Where should the meeting take place, and what is the

optimal time? Finally, why is this discussion important?

Build in buﬀer time. Give yourself 10 minutes before the meeting to

get focused and 10 minutes after to reset. A short walk or quiet moment

can help you stay composed and avoid carrying stress into your next

# interaction.

# Will Run High,” by Dina Denham Smith.

# Prevent Meeting Hangovers on Your Team

A bad meeting doesn’t end when the call drops—it lingers, draining

your team’s productivity and morale. To prevent these “meeting

# hangovers,” focus on ﬁve key strategies.

Don’t dominate, facilitate. Encourage participation by letting team

members lead relevant agenda items. Use interactive tools like polls,

and structure discussions to ensure everyone has a voice.

Cut the guest list. Only invite those essential to the discussion. If

someone doesn’t need to be there, oﬀer them alternatives, like asking

them for pre-meeting input or sending them a follow-up summary.

Fewer attendees mean more-focused conversations—and ultimately

# better outcomes.

Turn agendas into action plans. Frame agenda items as speciﬁc

questions that drive decisions. Instead of “Product Launch Update,”

ask, “What are the critical risks to our product launch timeline, and

how can we mitigate them?” Clear, action-oriented topics keep meetings eﬃcient.

Make every minute count—and don’t run over. Set meetings for the

## shortest time necessary, not by default increments like 60 minutes.

Sticking to the agenda and ending on time helps people sustain focus

# and reduces frustration.

## Demand accountability. Assign owners to every action item and

clarify next steps before the meeting ends. Use project management

tools or shared documents to track follow-ups and ensure nothing falls

# through the cracks.

# Boost Team Participation in Meetings

Low participation in meetings can harm your team’s productivity by

reducing collaboration, hampering decision-making, and eroding unity.

How can you encourage more fruitful engagement?

Start by clarifying expectations. Outline the supportive behaviors you

want to see in your meetings. For example, you could say, “As a team, we

support each other, we tackle challenges together, and we communicate

constructively.”

Model these behaviors yourself, and be sure to celebrate when your

team members do the same. For example, you might say, “I would

like to recognize something. Alex, the way you just acknowledged

Jordan’s contribution embodies the supportive culture we want to have

on our team—one where every team member’s input is recognized

and appreciated. Alex, thank you for demonstrating this and setting a

positive example for us all.”

It’s also helpful to oﬀer team members diﬀerent ways to contribute—for

example, allow for written input before, during, or after meetings. And

consider rotating the meeting facilitation among all team members to

give everyone a chance to lead. Giving those who are typically less vocal

a structured role can help empower them to speak.

## Meetings. Here’s What to Do.” by Luis Velasquez.

# Fix Your Team’s Broken Hybrid Meetings

Hybrid work has changed meetings. Despite many companies’ recent return-to-oﬃce eﬀorts, teams are relying on virtual meetings more than

ever, and participation is down. As a manager, how can you improve

## your team’s meetings in this hybrid world?

## Treat meeting culture as an important part of company culture.

What meeting culture do you want for your team? Determine best

practices and deﬁne roles and responsibilities. This can also include

expectations on when not to meet, such as scheduled focus hours and

# meeting-free days.

Identify and invest in meeting leaders. Running eﬀective meetings

is a skill, and like any skill, it can be cultivated and strengthened.

Recent research shows that 54% of all meetings are hosted by just 10%

of employees. Targeted training for this group of “power users” can help

promote a healthier meeting culture on your team.

Leverage data. One of the advantages of virtual meetings is that

they produce data that provides meaningful insights into productivity,

engagement, and even retention—so make use of it. For example, if a

speciﬁc department has a particularly high no-participation rate, you

could monitor how that number changes as you roll out trainings within

# the department.

## Use Curiosity to Keep Your Meetings on Track

Are your meetings chronically disengaging—or worse, easily derailed?

It may be time to introduce curiosity into the agenda to keep people

focused and things on track.

First, direct the team’s attention to identifying the problem you’re

there to solve. Rather than doing this for them, ask everyone in the

room to deﬁne the goal of the meeting in one sentence. Clarifying

a collective mission at the outset will help align team members and

reduce confusion or irrelevant sidebars.

Then let your employees do the talking. Just because you’re leading

the meeting doesn’t mean you have to dominate it. Show curiosity, ask

others for their opinions before sharing your own, and actively listen.

This is a powerful way to engage and empower people.

Finally, oﬀer feedback—but avoid judgmental language. Judgment is

the opposite of curiosity and can discourage and demotivate your team,

leading to stilted, unproductive meetings. If you’re unsure how you feel

about an idea, probe it. Simply saying “say more” is a nonjudgmental

way of expressing curiosity and maintaining meeting momentum.

# Team—Better,” by Sabina Nawaz.

# Making Bad Meetings Better

We all have those recurring meetings that feel ineﬃcient, unproductive,

or aimless. How can you make them better when you’re not the one

running them? Here’s how to get involved before, during, and after to

# nudge things in the right direction.

The best time to intervene is often before the meeting even takes place.

Reach out to the organizer to ask if there’s an agenda, relevant materials

they can share in advance, or anything you can do to help prepare.

During a meeting that’s veering oﬀ topic, you can take initiative and

steer the conversation back on course. Refer back to the agenda if there

is one. If there isn’t one, you can speak up to clarify the goal of the

meeting, then point out when the conversation feels oﬀ topic.

After the meeting, reach out to the organizer to compare notes and

clarify next steps and who’s responsible for them. This will ensure

## follow-through—and that the meeting wasn’t ultimately pointless.

## Charge),” by Tijs Besieux and Amy C. Edmondson.

# Executives: Rethink Your One-on-Ones

If you’re a senior leader, your calendar is likely packed with one-on-one

meetings. But instead of fostering alignment, an overload of one-on-

ones often creates fragmentation, siloed thinking, and trust issues. It’s

time to shift how you use your meeting time.

## Use one-on-ones for development, not operations. Make these

meetings quarterly and dedicate them to career growth and feedback—

not tactical updates. Block 90-minute sessions that focus on leadership

# goals, not project status.

Shift decision-making to capability meetings. Identify ﬁve to seven

## core capabilities in your organization—like innovation or customer

experience—and hold standing meetings with the relevant cross-

functional leaders. This ensures strategic clarity and faster, more

aligned execution.

Put the right people in the room. Avoid the work of brieﬁng others

after the fact. Capability meetings bring the decision-makers together

at the right moment so that alignment happens in real time, not

# retroactively.

Free up executive team time. When capability meetings handle cross-

functional work, your full executive team can focus on enterprise

strategy and long-term priorities instead of replaying decisions made

## elsewhere. Center executive meeting agendas around questions like

“What are the few issues that require the full weight of this team?” or

“Where does our system need realignment?”

# Many One-on-Ones,” by Ron Carucci.
