leaving Lauren to manage confusion, stalled progress, and arestless team.This scenario is all too common. During periods of economicuncertainty or transformation, executive indecision erodesmomentum,

weakens credibility, and drives high performers todisengage. While competitors move forward, stalled organizationslose time, trust, and market relevance. According to

McKinsey,slow decision-making is a major driver of organizationalunderperformance and employee burnout.

Gallup adds thatunclear expectations are a leading cause of employeedisengagement.While Lauren and her peers were expected to deliver on ambitiousgoals, direction from above was vague or delayed. Her team beganto lose steam, unsure whether to push forward or pause. “We’redriving in circles,” one team member said. “What’s the actualdestination?”In

keynote speaker), we’ve identified four key strategies to leadeffectively when the C-suite can’t decide.

Executives often hesitate and push back when faced with ideasand proposals that feel large, final, or irreversible. The hesitationusually isn’t about the idea itself, but the perceived risk of sayingyes.

Reframing a

request as a low-risk, time-bound experiment isa powerful way to reduce that friction. This gives decision-makersthe chance to approve something small, get feedback, andreassess—without committing to the full plan up front.Instead of saying: “We need to approve the full plan now.”Try: “Let’s launch a 30-day pilot to gather insights before scaling.”We coached Lauren to use this exact approach when her customerretention proposal was met with executive resistance. Heroriginal pitch felt too high stakes, so she repositioned it as a short,insight-driven pilot. That subtle shift lowered the

# psychological

barrier and unlocked faster alignment.To guide this shift, we leveraged Amazon’s Type 1 vs. Type 2

decision-making framework, a tool designed to accelerateprogress while managing risk:

Type 1 decisions are high-stakes, irreversible “one-way doors”that require careful deliberation due to their lasting impact.

Type 2 decisions are low-risk, reversible “two-way doors” thatcan be made quickly, often by individuals or small teams,because they’re easy to revisit or revise.

The mistake many organizations make is treating the reversible asirreversible—

overanalyzing, overprocessing, and slowing downunnecessarily. That’s when innovation stalls and

agility dies.Shifting the narrative from “this is a commitment” to “this is alearning opportunity” reduces the perceived risk, restoresmomentum, and allows you to move forward without fear of long-term consequences.

Indecision has a cost, and it’s often higher than the perceived riskof moving forward. According to

McKinsey, slow decision-makingwastes over 500,000 manager days annually, costing Fortune 500companies around $250 million in lost wages annually.Thus, one of the most effective ways to overcome hesitation is tomake that cost visible. Use real data to demonstrate how delaysare affecting business performance,

employee morale, orcompetitive advantage. When you tie stalled decisions tomeasurable risks like missed revenue, rising attrition, or timelineslippage, you shift the conversation from fear of failure to fear offalling behind.Instead of saying: “This delay is frustrating the team.”Try: “Every month of delay costs us $200K in lost productivityand pushes our launch timeline out by six weeks.”We helped Lauren put this strategy into action. As a result ofshifting priorities, approval kept stalling on the high-impactcustomer retention plan her team had developed. Rather thanescalate frustration, she came to the executives’ table with hardnumbers: $180K in monthly churn losses and a 12% drop inengagement linked to the delay. By reframing the cost of inaction

as the greater risk, she shifted the executives’ mindset andsecured the green light within a week.

When things are stuck at the top, your job is to keep your

# team

energized and focused on what’s within reach. Don’t letindecision at the executive level create

paralysis on the frontlines. Shift your team’s attention to progress they can own.Prioritize operational wins, celebrate

small victories, and betransparent about what’s delayed and why. In these moments,your role becomes translator, motivator, and shock absorber.Help your team turn frustration into progress by setting clear,achievable short-term goals that connect to broader outcomes.Offer stretch assignments to challenge high performers and showtrust in their growth potential. When roadblocks arise, use themas learning opportunities, encouraging experimentation,reflection, and upskilling. This approach keeps teams engaged,builds momentum, and turns uncertainty into meaningfuldevelopment.When the budget is frozen or projects are in limbo, pivot theteam’s focus to low-resource efforts that can have big impacts. Forexample, a marketing team might boost engagement andretention by increasing the frequency of customer emails frombiweekly to weekly, or an operations team could audit existingworkflows to improve efficiency and readiness once companyresources are more robust.Momentum isn’t just about moving forward; it’s about findingmeaningful ways to make progress even in uncertain times. Keepreinforcing the “why” behind your team’s work, and

To accelerate decisions, start managing sideways and

upward.Clarify how you’re positioned to influence behavior, even withoutfinal decision-making authority. Build coalitions with trustedpeers and cross-functional stakeholders who share your concernsand may already have the ear of your boss or target leader. Alignyour messaging, elevate shared priorities through consistent,constructive communication, and avoid delivering open-endedproblems. Instead, offer well-framed options with clear trade-offs,timelines, and resource implications.Lauren rallied her peers in product and finance to align on aproposal before bringing it to the CMO. By showing unifiedsupport and presenting a single recommendation with data-backed rationale and clear resource implications, they acceleratedbuy-in and avoided another month of back-and-forth.Your goal is to equip others ahead of

key meetings so they canspeak on your behalf and reinforce your point of view. Influencescales when you’re not the only voice in the room.

# Upward

influence isn’t about control; it’s about clarity, credibility, andconsistency. You may not own the final decision, but you canshape the conversation.

Strategic indecision at the top is a leadership stress test but also aproving ground. In these moments, your ability to stay focused,reframe risk, and keep the organization moving becomes yoursuperpower. To lead through executive paralysis without losingmomentum, you must do more than wait. You must connect thedots between commitments, actions, and outcomes. Help otherssee not just what’s stalled, but what’s still possible. Because
