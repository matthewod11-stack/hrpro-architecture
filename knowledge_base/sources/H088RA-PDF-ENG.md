During the pandemic, companies around the world explored new ways

of working that challenged long-held assumptions and beliefs about

where work gets done. Many companies, including Microsoft, saw the

beneﬁts of ﬂexible work and wanted to oﬀer employees a chance to

continue to work in a hybrid environment, while balancing the needs of

# the organization.

## HBR / Digital Article / Onboarding New Employees in a Hybrid Workplace

One aspect of work that changed during the remote era, and continues

to evolve, is onboarding: a key moment for new employees to build

connections with their manager and team. Many companies adapted

to remote onboarding and continue to welcome new hires in this

manner, while others are moving back to in-person programs. We

wondered: What’s the ideal way to onboard new employees today? And,

speciﬁcally, how can we ensure that new hires thrive — which we deﬁne

as being energized and empowered to do meaningful work — while also

supporting ﬂexibility?

Our recent research based on anonymized Microsoft employee data

suggests that new hires succeed when they feel supported to work in

the way that works best for them in terms of when and where they

work. Onboarding is a key moment for building connections with a new

manager and team and doing so a few days in person provides unique

beneﬁts, but just requiring newcomers to be onsite full time doesn’t

# guarantee success.

In an eﬀort to help leaders establish norms and best practices for

onboarding, we found three key insights from our own research on what

fosters a positive employee experience and facilitates learning during a

hybrid onboarding process.

A few days in person has benefits for onboarding

Our data show that compared to new hires who never saw their manager

or team in person, new hires who spend one or two days a month with

## their manager and teams within their ﬁrst 90 days:

- Say their managers play a more active role (+ 6%);

- Take on more meaningful work (+ 4%);

- Are more satisﬁed with their onboarding experience (+ 5%)

These results indicate that in-person time during onboarding is

beneﬁcial. Providing an opportunity for the new hire to meet

their manager and teams can help build relationships, improve

communication, develop a sense of task competence, get stronger

support from team members, and add value to the overall onboarding

# experience.

## And a positive onboarding experience matters for retention, as our data

shows that the new hires who are satisﬁed with their onboarding at 90

days are two times more likely to stay with the company 1.5 years down

# the road.

However, being in the oﬃce most of the time (more than 60% of

workdays) brings no additional value for short term (the ﬁrst 90 days)

or long-term (the ﬁrst year) onboarding outcomes. In fact, the new

hires who saw their teams often (more than 30% of workdays) reported

## signiﬁcantly lower scores on two important 90-day onboarding markers

## — alignment with job expectations (- 5% points) and contributions

to the team’s success (- 6%). What’s more, during their ﬁrst year, new hires who came into the oﬃce regularly (more than 60% of

workdays) reported less opportunity to learn (- 5%) and less self-

reported productivity (- 9%), indicating that being onsite most of the

time can take away from the focus time that’s critical for learning and

# knowledge acquisition in the long term.

Our data shows no diﬀerence in sentiment for those who onboard

remotely or those who onboard onsite regarding their career

experiences, building new skills, and energy they draw from work, as

well as support they receive from managers in the ﬁrst year.

However, some groups may benefit from more in-person time

New hires vary in their needs and can require diﬀerent things from

their onboarding experience. According to our research, the beneﬁts for

onboarding onsite look diﬀerent across experience levels of new hires.

Compared to the early-in-career new hires who onboard oﬀsite, those who regularly go into the oﬃce:

- Get more energy from work (+9% pts);

- Find their work more meaningful (+7% pts);

- Feel more included in their teams (+5% pts).

These results indicate that new hires who are starting out in their career

may need more in-person interactions as part of their onboarding to

learn what’s expected, experience the culture, and understand how to

succeed in the new environment. In contrast, the new hires who have

more industry experience do not see the same beneﬁts from going into the oﬃce often.

To help set up early-in-profession new hires for success, Microsoft

designed the Aspire Experience program, which consists of a two-year

journey of learning and development that focuses on growth, building

networks, and discovering career opportunities within the company.

These experiences are delivered through a combination of in-person

and hybrid events. Using our research, we’ve adjusted where, how, and

when Aspire Experience programs and events take place. As an example

of our data driven approach, we’ve invited our global year one Aspirers

to visit our main campus as part of their year one Microsoft Aspire

# experience.

Providing these curated opportunities for early-in-career new hires to be

onsite helps create a sense of meaning and connection to their work and

teams, while giving more experienced new hires the ﬂexibility to decide

where they work best helps foster productivity and mastery of the new

# role.

What adds the most value is a more intentional approach to onboarding

While tailored approaches across diﬀerent new hire groups are useful,

to maximize return on investment for an onboarding program, it is

important to provide some resources that all new hires universally

beneﬁt from. The top factors that make the most diﬀerence are clarity

about role responsibilities, feedback on how they are doing, and

resources to help them answer questions. The new hires who are set

up with these critical elements of onboarding are:

- Three to four times more likely to contribute to their team’s success

# during the ﬁrst 90 days;

- Five to seven times more likely to be satisﬁed with their onboarding

# experience.

What’s needed is for managers to be intentional, provide structure, align

on job expectations, set up their new hire with an onboarding buddy,

establish onboarding milestones, give frequent actionable feedback,

and provide a list of resources. New hires whose manager plays an

active role in their onboarding are 3.5 times more likely to be satisﬁed

with their onboarding experience and 1.5 times more likely to feel

they’re contributing to their team’s success. In a hybrid world, the

manager’s role in onboarding is a key driver in new hires’ satisfaction

# with their onboarding experience.

At Microsoft, alongside our onboarding materials, we developed a

Flexible Work Toolkit to equip our managers with information and

resources to help meet the needs of individual work styles and oﬀer

as much ﬂexibility as possible. The toolkit includes resources on how

to support employees in a hybrid world, leverage team agreements to

balance individual with team needs and set clear expectations on how

to work together allowing new team members to acclimate quickly,

identify moments that matter to be intentional about when to bring

people together in-person, and leverage tools to run eﬀective and

# inclusive hybrid meetings.

. . .

Bottom line, employees beneﬁt from the best of both worlds: ﬂexible

work and in-person connection. Our research shows that some in-

person time matters, but more time spent onsite beyond that does

not necessarily yield more beneﬁts. Instead, to create the most

value for onboarding, be intentional, create structure, and provide an

opportunity to meet in person, while giving new hires the ﬂexibility to

choose what works best for them to thrive in our hybrid world.
