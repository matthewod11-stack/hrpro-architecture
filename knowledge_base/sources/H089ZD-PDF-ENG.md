The last two decades have seen South Korea emerge as a cultural

powerhouse on the global stage. K-pop groups like BLACKPINK and BTS

have become worldwide megastars, with the latter’s overall contribution

to South Korea’s economy estimated at US$5 billion, while TV series

Squid Game drew more than 111 million views worldwide within 30 days,

the biggest launch in Netﬂix’s history. The country steadily churns out

award-winning K-movies and K-dramas, boasts a shiny contemporary

art scene, and has the world’s fourth-largest gaming industry. And the

K-beauty market is expected to hit US$18.32 billion in revenue by 2030.

But make no mistake – the success of what has become a key

geopolitical asset is not the result of luck. It is the result of two decades

of eﬀective strategy and execution that have given birth to some of the

## most attractive brands in the world: the K-brands.

In 1994, a presidential advisory report noted that one single blockbuster

ﬁlm — Jurassic Park — had realized proﬁts equivalent to selling 1.5

million Hyundai cars. President Kim Young-sam decided to lead his

country on a massive transformation, moving away from the production

of functional mid-range goods, upon which South Korea had built its

competitive edge, to become a global cultural player.

Massive eﬀorts over the years saw the culture ministry’s budget grow

to US$6.05 billion in 2022, a third more than the equivalent ministry

in France (about US$4.6 billion in 2022). New governmental agencies

such as the Korea Creative Content Agency (KOCCA) encouraged foreign

investments — Netﬂix alone announced a US$2.5 billion investment in

Korean content — and further boosted the country’s soft power.

## Besides the sheer size of investments, K-brands share a common recipe

for success that oﬀer unique lessons for entrepreneurs, brand managers

and marketing executives:

- 1. They encourage fun and fast consumer discovery.

To explain South Korea’s innovativeness, observers often point to the

country’s massive R&D investments (4.9% of GDP in 2021) or to the

country’s high urban population density. They argue that these create

a competitive environment in which showing oﬀ the latest product and

“being ﬁrst” are highly valued.

But K-brands have also built a key asset that matters in cultural

marketplaces where primacy and visibility are essential: fun and fast

# consumer discovery.

Digital conglomerates such as Kakao, whose services span messaging,

gaming, mobility, and media, oﬀer a wide range of social-ﬁrst

approaches to the marketplace. Consider KakaoTalk Gift, a service

enabling users to instantly buy and deliver gifts to one’s online

friends and connections, making new brand discovery more exciting

and accelerating adoption. From Starbucks to Amorepaciﬁc, brands

increasingly leverage this more than $2 billion market to boost product

discovery through the gifting lens. In addition, shaping consumer

conversations early on gives K-brands an edge in the competition for

consumer attention and helps them to embed new products in everyday

life, a tendency boosted by astute product placement in K-drama.

Besides digital solutions, K-brands also excel at using concept stores

as powerful discovery tools. They frequently use art exhibitions and

unexpected installations to trigger highly Instagrammable product

discovery and stand out from competition. Consider eyewear Korean

brand Gentle Monster, whose revenues jumped from $140 million

in 2017 to $306 million in 2020. Inspired by CEO and co-founder

Hankook Kim’s conviction that “retail is driven by humans’ curiosity,”

its dazzling retail stores feature catchy, short-lived art installations to

trigger consumer discovery by captivating visitors.

Finally, it is worth pointing out that the Korean ecosystem itself makes

discovery faster. Take Naver, one of the top two online search engines

in Korea. Its algorithm places greater weight on how recent content is,

which means new pages show up higher on the list of search results.

This design increases the visibility of innovations, making it easier

and faster for users to discover new products or brands. This in turn,

## supports a faster adoption cycle in daily life.

Abroad, Korean governmental agencies strongly facilitate discovery by

pushing products amenable to local tastes and thus more likely to be

quickly adopted (e.g. transposing Korean food to Indian taste).

- 2. They elevate brands through immersive experiences.

It’s said that the act of cheering wine glasses was introduced to add

the only sense that was absent — sound — and help turn it into

a cultural habit. Similarly, K-brands strategically create sensory value

through immersion to boost customer desire. Indeed, the ability to

become immersive and speak the language of the customer oﬀers two

new competitive advantages: It increases customers’ willingness to pay

through richer brand engagement, and it facilitates brand extension by

expanding the range of experiences through which consumers interact

# with the brand.

This approach is perhaps most obvious in retail, where Gentle Monster’s

unique strategy is not an isolated case. Consider fast-growing fashion

brand Ader Error, which opened a pastry shop Tongue Planet next to

their stores to augment the brand’s sensory universe through taste, or

cosmetics company Amorepaciﬁc’s move to open an art museum to

boost the brand’s visual identity.

Beyond retail, K-brands often look to add sensorial value to the products

or services themselves. For instance, Korean webtoons reshaped the

comic reading experience by including sound eﬀects as part of their

short stories. Coupled with the possibility to personalize characters

(e.g., the potential to create a character resembling the reader),

webtoons rapidly won over the comic industry by making reading

more sensory, and therefore more immersive. The webtoons market was

valued at US$3.9 billion in 2022, accounting for around a quarter of the

# global comic industry.

Another striking example of blurring sensory lines comes from K-pop.

The genre is known for its choreography and visual performances that

appeal to touch and sight respectively, and boost fans’ experiences

and brand appeal. Online, K-pop stands out with respects to its high

visual value compared to other musical styles. For instance in 2023,

K-pop triggered more than twice image searches than Web searches

globally, compared to a 1 to 1 image to web search ratio for hip hop.

This explains why luxury and fashion brands have aggressively sought

out sponsorship deals with K-idols to gain traction among younger

# consumers.

- 3. They experiment throughout the product life cycle.

K-brands have distinctly embedded a culture of experimentation

across the product life cycle. At the product inception stage, this

typically involves co-creation or collaborations that utilize academic

and industry research. For example, Ader Error heavily relied on

## collaborations with other brands such a Puma, Converse, Zara, or

even East Pack to quickly expand its cultural footprint. In gaming,

## Netmarble, Korea’s largest mobile-gaming company, regularly hosts

events where developers answer queries from users during live

broadcasts on YouTube. They also communicate with users through

monthly online notes addressing user suggestions and progress

updates. This use of communities to select or co-create products both

boosts desire and helps reduce the risk of failure through early market

# buy-in and feedback loops.

Experimentation is also core to K-brands retail strategy. Indeed, Seoul

has become one of the global capitals with the highest concentration of

pop-up stores. In 2022 alone, more than 250 pop-up stores opened in

Seoul. Known as the “pop-up mecca,” the Hyundai Seoul, the largest

shopping mall in the city, attracted 100 million visitors in just 30

months. This form of short-lived retail is particularly attractive for

brands as it enables them to test new ways to interact with customers at

a fraction of the cost of creating a permanent store.

Finally, Korea is home to fast-paced brand experimentations. For

instance, Gentle Monster explicitly relies on a philosophy of “high-end

experimentation” to seek growth opportunities and expand outside

eyewear. In 2017, it tested whether its success could translate to the

cosmetics market by launching a new fragrance brand, Tamburins.

After introducing the perfume with an art exhibition hosted right next

to its ﬂagship retail store, Gentle Monster saw Tamburins sales jump.

The company rapidly scaled up, opening new Tamburins stores in

# Japan and China.

- 4. They promote their brands through content creation.

Finally, K-brands realized early on the importance of becoming content

powerhouses if they wanted to reach a global audience. The idea is

simple: The marketplace must be viewed as a screen. Creating your own

content and translating the brand DNA across markets gives you the

capability to eﬀectively tell the brand story and invite customers into

# the brand universe.

For instance, in 2017 Samsung produced a short ﬁlm, Two Lights:

Relúmĭno, that told the story of a romance between two young people

who met a photography club for the visually impaired. The ﬁlm also spotlighted Relúmĭno, Samsung’s visual aid application for people with

# visual impairments.

In another recent example, Korea’s leading convenience store brand CU

launched a short-form series drama Convenience Store Veterans in 2023.

Promoted on social media, the series featured the daily experiences of

convenience store customers and employees, and garnered 100 million

views in just 39 days, boosting CU’s brand image and customer loyalty.

These examples show how K-brands are embracing the shorter,

highly engaging, culturally relevant content that their customers are

# consuming.

. . .

Business leaders interested in applying the South Korean approach can

audit their brand strategy along four dimensions:

- 1. Discovery: What can be changed to make brand discovery faster and

more fun? When, where, and how do people discover your brand?

How does this compare to your competitors?

- 2. Experience: How immersive is your brand? How can you enrich your

brand’s sensory value during introduction, distribution, and use?

- 3. Experiment: What elements of your brand’s go-to-market strategy

can be subjected to experimentation? What aspects of the customer

journey can be optimized through AB testing?

- 4. Production of content: What are your brand’s media assets? To what

extent does your brand content overlap with your brand promise?

How can you make your brand message more vibrant and relevant to

# the individual user?

For entrepreneurs, marketers, and brand strategists alike, there is

an opportunity to apply and adapt South Korea’s approach to value

creation. This can help your brands grow its appeal and reinforce its

competitive advantage as you expand into global markets.
