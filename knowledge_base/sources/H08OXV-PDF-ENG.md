It’s Monday morning again. You’re sluggish, unmotivated, and already

longing for the weekend. Like the vast majority of working adults,

you spend your free time resting—maybe binging your favorite show,

scrolling on your phone, or catching up on sleep—but somehow when

the workweek arrives, you never feel as refreshed as you hoped. You

wonder: Is there a better way to recharge?

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: How “Leisure Crafting” Can Help You Recharge

Our research emphatically suggests that the answer is “yes.” Over

the past several years, we’ve studied “leisure crafting”—a proactive

approach to structuring free time that emphasizes goal-setting,

## human connection, learning, and personal development. Our research

has found that this method oﬀers greater beneﬁts for well-being,

## mental health, overall life satisfaction—and even work performance—

compared to passive activities, while also protecting against burnout.

And it doesn’t require any more time than resting—just a small shift in

# approach.

# What Is Leisure Crafting?

Leisure crafting is not about what you do in your free time, but how

you do it. It involves structuring things you already enjoy doing with

intentionality and a growth-oriented mindset. Crafting your leisure

means structuring activities so that they 1) help you set individual

## goals, 2) foster social connections, and/or 3) build skills or teach you

something. While broad, these guidelines can take many shapes in

# practice.

For example, someone who enjoys physical activity or being outside

might set a goal to run a half marathon. In addition to running a

few mornings before work, they may also join a running group that

meets together for a half hour each week to run in a local park. This

strengthens this person’s running skills, but also their social connection

to other nearby runners while enjoying the outdoors.

Similarly, someone who enjoys movies might decide that instead of

mindlessly watching whatever they happen upon on a streaming

service, they’ll watch one of the British Film Institute’s 100 greatest

ﬁlms each week and write a small review of it on Letterboxd, engaging

their critical thinking and written communication skills among a

# community of other movie watchers.

Or consider a fantasy football enthusiast who instead of doing the bare

minimum to stay involved, decides to enroll in a negotiation workshop

to improve their trade strategies while also learning predictive modeling

techniques to optimize their lineup decisions.

But are these models really better then vegging out? Here’s what we

# found.

## The Science Behind Leisure Crafting and Well-Being

To understand how leisure crafting compares to passive activities and

approaching leisure without this mindset, we conducted 11 ﬁeld studies

with more than 2,400 working professionals. Participants reported

how they spent their leisure time and the mindset in which they

approached their leisure. They also responded to a series of assessments

that gauged their energy levels, moods, and overall well-being. The

ﬁndings were striking. Individuals who reported engaging in leisure

crafting reported higher energy levels, more positive moods, and

stronger overall well-being compared to those who engaged primarily

in passive leisure. Moreover, leisure crafting was associated with greater

## feelings of personal autonomy, competence, and social connection, all

of which contribute to well-being. Participants approaching their leisure

in this manner were also more likely to say that they felt they had a

meaningful, engaging, and fulﬁlling life.

But because those studies examined what people were already doing,

we decided to run another experiment, asking participants who didn’t

previously craft their leisure to engage in these behaviors, and we tested

# the results.

In a four-week randomized trial, we divided 257 employee participants

into two groups: Half were assigned to a leisure crafting intervention,

where they completed a brief training on how to structure their free

time for self-development and were encouraged to do so for the next

month. The other half, used as the control group, were not assigned the

leisure crafting intervention. The intervention group saw an increase in

well-being—how meaningful they felt their life was and how satisﬁed

and fulﬁlled they felt—that was 1.6 times greater than the well-being

levels reported by the control group. The leisure crafters also reported

## larger increases in their beliefs about their overall abilities and general

# creativity.

Beyond enhancing personal well-being, we found that a growth-

oriented approach to leisure also fosters unique work-related beneﬁts.

Across our studies, we found that those who engage in leisure

crafting reported higher work engagement, work creativity, and work

performance. They also reported deriving a greater sense of meaning

from work compared to those who did not leisure craft.

In contrast to unstructured or passive leisure, which tends to be

## less restorative and generative, the growth-oriented nature of leisure

crafting can produce positive beneﬁts that spillover into work: making

individuals feel more invested—and perform better—at their jobs.

How to Craft Your Leisure to Make the Most of Your Free Time

Professionals looking to enhance their well-being—and their work—

should consider these actionable steps:

- 1. Identify Activities That Energize You

## Much of the advice around work-life balance and leisure time centers

on picking the “right” activity—meditation, exercise, creative pursuits,

or other structured hobbies. However, our research suggests that it’s

not about the speciﬁc hobby but rather the approach to it. The right

approach to gaming, cooking, or hanging out with friends can have

## restorative beneﬁts that spillover into the workplace.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: How “Leisure Crafting” Can Help You Recharge

Instead of focusing on how to set the “right” goals for the “right”

activities, focus on setting goals that you feel you can actually stick with

for activities you already enjoy and that energize you.

If you really like watching TV, ask yourself: what do you like about it? Is

it the social connection you feel with your peers talking about the latest

episode? How can you create a goal to help strengthen what you already

enjoy about this activity? Perhaps hosting a monthly watch night, where

you and your friends watch something none of you have seen will help

you to expand your horizons while deepening your friendships.

- 2. Be Speciﬁc

The size of the goals doesn’t matter. But it does matter that you stay

committed to them. When goals are loose or unstructured (for example,

“I want to be a more knowledgeable baker”), they can be hard to pursue.

Make sure to set tangible, trackable goals (like, “I will bake one new loaf

of bread from the Tartine cookbook each week until I’ve gone through

# all the recipes”).

Spend a little time at the outset asking yourself speciﬁcs about the goal,

like: How much time can I commit to? Do I want to set one overarching

goal (like running a marathon) and then set smaller goals to help me

achieve it (like joining a running group)? What days will I work on this

goal? What will “success” look like to me in this context?

While many assume that the self-development in leisure means taking

on time-consuming hobbies, even small adjustments (e.g., setting a

distance intention before a walk or deciding to engage more socially

in a hobby) can yield beneﬁts. But do not let your approach to leisure

become so serious that you create a scenario in which both work and

non-work activities make you feel burnt out. Start small and set a goal

that makes sense for you.

- 3. Hold Yourself Accountable and Be Willing to Adjust

Setting timeframes or journalling can be a useful way to track your

progress toward your goals, reﬂecting on what’s worked well and what

hasn’t gone as planned. Reviewing old journal entries can also be a

good way to stay inspired when progress feels slow: looking back at how

incremental actions have moved you toward an accomplishment can

help reignite your commitment.

That said, goals are only useful when you’re working toward them. If

a goal is starting to feel like a slog—and you feel yourself dreading

it or blowing it oﬀ—it’s probably a good time to adjust and look for

something that feels energizing and possible.

# A Few Caveats

Although leisure crafting is highly beneﬁcial, it is important to keep a

few key considerations in mind. While this approach to one’s leisure

time requires commitment and goal-setting, it is still simply that:

leisure. The goal is not to turn hobbies into obligations or a second

job. Instead, it is about engaging in leisure activities with a deliberate,

growth-oriented mindset. In the end, leisure is a time to enjoy oneself.

Additionally, while crafting one’s leisure in this manner is beneﬁcial, we

are not suggesting that every moment of free time should be structured

in this way. Balance is key here. Leisure crafting should complement—

# not replace—other forms of relaxation.

. . .

In a world where burnout and stress are on the rise, leisure crafting

oﬀers a fresh, research-validated approach to recharging and making the most of your time—both in and out of the oﬃce. By shifting

your perspective on leisure from passive recovery to proactive self-

development, you can unlock a powerful tool for personal and

# professional growth.
