In August 1940, as his country prepared for waves of attacks by German

planes, Britain’s prime minister, Winston Churchill, set out to address

a diﬀerent enemy: lengthy reports. In his 234-word “Brevity” memo,

he implored the members of his war cabinet and their staﬀs to “see

to it that their reports are shorter.” Churchill urged them to write

“short, crisp paragraphs,” to move complex arguments or statistics to appendices, and to stop using “oﬃcialese jargon.”

We devoted eight years to learning about how leaders like Churchill

serve as trustees of others’ time—how they prevent or remove

organizational obstacles that undermine the zeal, damage the health,

and throttle the creativity and productivity of good people. We call

our work “The Friction Project.” It consists of our own research, case

## studies, workshops, and classes; interviews with 22 guests on our

Friction podcast; hundreds of interactions with our sprawling network

## of leaders, researchers, and other savvy people; and an analysis of the

# academic and practical work of others.

Along the way, we learned that friction can be both bad and

good: Not everything ought to be quick, easy, and frictionless.

Activities that involve good friction include developing deep and

trusting relationships, making complex and irreversible decisions under uncertainty, and doing creative work that’s messy, ineﬃcient, and

failure-ridden (if you’re doing it right!). Skilled leaders are bent on

eliminating unnecessary obstacles, in large part because doing so gives

them more time to focus on those many things in organizational life

that should be slow, hard, and complicated.

In this article we focus on addition sickness: the unnecessary rules,

procedures, communications, tools, and roles that seem to inexorably

grow, stiﬂing productivity and creativity. We show why companies are prone to this aﬄiction and how leaders can treat it. The ﬁrst step is to

do a good-riddance review to identify obstacles that can and should be

removed. The next step is to employ subtraction tools to eliminate those obstacles or make it diﬃcult for people to add them in the ﬁrst place.

This article unpacks both steps.

## What Ought to Be Easy or Hard in Your Company?

Not all inefficiencies are bad. Many challenges in organizational life

accomplishing creative work, deciding to adopt measures that would heap

yet more burdens on employees and customers—often are best dealt with

slowly and by difficult and sometimes complicated methods. Eliminating

friction in those situations can be soul-crushing for the people who do the

work and can undermine productivity, safety, innovation, and commitment.

Answering the following five questions can help you decide where to

remove versus inject organizational friction.

- 1. Are you certain or uncertain about the right things to do? In his book

## Thinking, Fast and Slow, the Nobel Prize–winner Daniel Kahneman argues

that when people are in a “cognitive minefield”—when they are confused

or overwhelmed, or when things are falling apart—it’s wisest to pause and

assess the situation rather than do something rash. When you find yourself

in such circumstances, implore your people to slow down and think about

the right thing to do. (continued)

A CEO who led an impressive turnaround at a multinational explained to us

that when a leader takes charge of a troubled company, “you have to assess

the situation rather than act quickly.” The CEO continued, “Everyone wants

you to do something, so the first thing you say, very calmly, is, ‘We’re not

going to do anything today.’”

- 2. Are you doing routine or creative work? The best routine processes,

such as getting an expense request approved or canceling a magazine

subscription, are so frictionless that, to paraphrase the IDEO cofounder

Bill Moggridge, you notice that you don’t notice using them. In contrast,

creative work requires constant struggle, frustration, confusion, and failure.

There are ways to make creativity less inefficient—such as pulling the plug

on bad ideas faster. But piles of studies show that streamlining creativity

too much will kill it. (continued)

As the psychologist Dean Keith Simonton has noted, geniuses such as

Picasso, da Vinci, and Richard Feynman had far more successes and

failures than their unheralded colleagues. In every occupation Simonton

studied, including composer, artist, and inventor, “the most successful

creators tend to be those with the most failures!”

- 3. Will the fast eat the slow, or is it better to pause and learn from

others’ mistakes? Sometimes life is like a mousetrap: The first mouse

gets crushed and the second (or third or fourth) mouse gets the cheese.

Research on launching new businesses and products, for example, shows

that the so-called first-mover advantage is sometimes a myth. When

markets are treacherous and uncertainty is high, first movers often flounder

because consumers aren’t ready for their ideas yet or are put off by flawed

early offerings. (continued)

Companies that launch their products or services later win, in part, because

they learn from the missteps of antsy early movers. Amazon, for example,

wasn’t the first online bookstore; the defunct Books.com and Interloc were

# earlier entrants.

- 4. Do people have the bandwidth to take on more work, or are they

overextended or burned-out? Too much of a good thing can be terrible.

One exasperated service rep showed us that to serve just one customer,

she had to switch among at least 15 applications and 20 windows on the

13-inch screen of her laptop. Her company had adopted so many efficiency

tools to “help” its workers that it rendered them inefficient. Making it

harder for that rep’s IT team to add apps would have reduced her digital

# exhaustion.

- 5. Is your goal to develop quick but shallow or deep and enduring

working relationships? Teams of strangers with well-trained members who

understand their roles can develop “cognitive trust” swiftly, which enables

them to do good work—such as flight crews on commercial airlines and

teams of doctors and nurses in emergency departments who have never

met but perform complicated tasks together. Yet the best work happens

after collaborators develop deep “emotional trust,” which requires working,

talking, and failing and succeeding together over long stretches of time.

That’s why teams and networks of people who start new companies,

develop products, do surgery, and put on Broadway musicals perform

better when they have worked together again and again. Sure, old teams

can become stale and need injections of fresh blood. But it may take

years before that becomes necessary. And some enduring relationships

never lose their spark. Warren Buffett, the “oracle of Omaha,” and Charlie

Munger, his partner at Berkshire Hathaway, produced a remarkable record

## of financial performance for more than 50 years.

## Why Companies Are Plagued by Addition Sickness

Our project uncovered three forces that fuel these behaviors. First, we

humans default to asking, “What can I add here?” and not “What can I

get rid of?” Studies by Gabrielle Adams and her colleagues discussed in

a 2021 Nature article found that this “addition bias” shapes the solutions

that people generate to improve universities, edit their own and others’

writing, modify soup recipes, plan trips, and build Lego creations. When

one university president asked students, faculty, and staﬀ members for

suggestions to improve the place, only 11% of the responses entailed

# subtraction.

Second, organizations often reward leaders for additions: Kudos, cash,

perks, and titles are heaped on those who implement new technologies,

launch initiatives, or build bigger ﬁefdoms. In contrast, people with

the wisdom and discipline to avoid adding unnecessary stuﬀ are rarely

noticed or rewarded. These incentives help explain why, although many

of us believe that other people need to engage in subtraction, we object

to eliminating our own pet projects or reducing our own budgets. As the

late, great comedian George Carlin put it, “Have you noticed that their

stuﬀ is shit and your shit is stuﬀ?”

Third, leaders often have a limited grasp of their “cone of friction”—

how their actions and decisions burden others. Part of the reason for

such friction blindness, as Dacher Keltner’s book The Power Paradox

documents, is that when people feel powerful, they tend to focus

more on what they need and want and less on the challenges and

inconveniences faced by others (especially people who are less powerful

than they are).

So leaders may not realize how their failure

to remove, or to avoid adding, unnecessary

impediments makes life harder for “the

## little people.” At Stanford University, for

example, a senior administrator sent a

# 1,266-word email with a 7,266-word

# attachment to more than 2,000 faculty

members, inviting all of us to devote a

Saturday to brainstorming about a new

## sustainability school. Apparently it never

occurred to her that the email could have

been trimmed by at least 500 words and

# the attachment by thousands of words.

Such edits would have saved time for

## thousands of people in her cone of friction.

The good news is that leaders can do much to reverse addition sickness.

They can begin by turning attention to identifying what can be removed

(or not added). Gabrielle Adams’s team found that when people paused

to consider solutions or were reminded to think about subtraction,

they were less likely to default to addition. Venture capitalist Michael

Dearing ﬁres up this way of thinking by urging leaders to act as editors

in chief of their organizations. He explains that, like skilled text and

ﬁlm editors, the best leaders relentlessly eliminate or repair things that

## distract, bore, bewilder, or exhaust people.

# Good-Riddance Reviews

Savvy friction ﬁxers assess what they should and can remove from their

organizations and identify where and how to create mechanisms such

as rules, review processes, and ﬁnancial penalties that make it harder to

add unnecessary stuﬀ. Here are some methods they employ.

Ask colleagues and customers to identify unnecessary obstacles. When Melinda Ashton was the chief quality oﬃcer at Hawaii Paciﬁc

## Health, the largest nonproﬁt health care system in the state, she

was troubled because clinical staﬀers were devoting too much time

to updating patients’ electronic health records and too little time to

examining, treating, and comforting patients.

To address the problem, Ashton and her team launched the Getting

Rid of Stupid Stuﬀ program in 2017 (yes, the acronym is GROSS). As

Ashton reported in the New England Journal of Medicine, one of the

ﬁrst steps was to ask nurse assistants, nurses, and doctors to nominate

anything in the system that “was poorly designed, unnecessary, or

just plain stupid.” Hawaii Paciﬁc employees identiﬁed 188 subtraction

targets, which sparked 87 improvements. Subtracting all that stupid

stuﬀ freed up a lot of time. In response to one nomination, Ashton’s

team eliminated a mouse click that every nurse and nurse assistant was

required to make for every patient during hourly rounds. That saved

24 seconds per click—which, Ashton reports, “consumed approximately

## 1,700 nursing hours per month at our four hospitals.”

You can also ask clients to identify subtraction targets. Our

students Saul Gurdus and Elizabeth Woodson spent 10 weeks helping

## administrators at a California social services agency identify and

remove pain points for clients—especially obstacles that caused

unnecessary delay and despair among applicants. Gurdus and Woodson

used client interviews to identify junctures in the application process

—usually handoﬀs between silos—where clients reported “waiting”

and “still waiting” and feeling “invisible” and “this is too hard.”

Then they worked with administrators to remove impediments to

communication across silos, which, in turn, reduced waiting times and

# clients’ frustration.

Calculate the burdens of performance measurement. Are you spending

so much time evaluating one another that you don’t have time to do

## your work? When Marcus Buckingham and Ashley Goodall crunched

the numbers at the global services ﬁrm Deloitte, they discovered that

the 65,000 employees were collectively spending nearly 2 million hours

a year on performance management—completing the forms, attending

meetings, and creating the ratings (see “Reinventing Performance

# Management,” HBR, April 2015).

Assess the burden imposed by meetings. As part of the Friction Project,

we worked with Rebecca Hinds, the head of Asana’s Work Innovation

Lab, on a “meeting reset” intervention with 60 Asana employees. We

asked participants to rate the value and importance of each recurring

meeting on their calendars. They assessed 1,160 standing meetings

and identiﬁed more than 500 that were of low value. Hinds guided

those colleagues to remove or revamp those meetings. As a result,

on average, each employee saved more than four hours a month.

Canceling meetings had the biggest impact (37% of total minutes saved).

Making adjustments to format, such as scheduling meetings less often,

shortening them, and relying more on written communication and less

on presentations and conversations, accounted for the other 63%.

Catalog email overload. A 2019 Adobe survey of the email usage of 1,002

U.S. adults found that they spent, on average, more than ﬁve hours a day

reading and responding to work email (three-plus hours) and personal

email (two-plus hours). As John Lilly, the former CEO of Mozilla, put it

to us, “After all these years, email is still the internet’s killer app, and

keeping up with it crushes productivity and creativity in every company

I know.” You can begin to ﬁght back by reviewing the number, length,

recipients, and timing of the emails that people send and receive and

by developing solutions to lighten the load. A policy like the “zzzMail”

rule instituted at the consulting ﬁrm Vynamic might help: Employees

are asked not to send internal emails between 10 PM and 6 AM Monday

## through Friday, on weekends, and on all Vynamic holidays.

Count how many people report to each leader. An unfortunate side

eﬀect of ﬂat structures is that executives sometimes have so many

people reporting to them that their jobs become impossible. In Beyond

## Collaboration Overload, Rob Cross describes “Scott” as an executive

who was “ﬂying up the hierarchy” of a large company until he took

charge of three big units—some 5,000 people. Scott had had just a few

direct reports in past roles; he had 16 this time. He wanted to be “less

hierarchical,” so he urged people “to bring him problems and concerns

or to include him in discussions.”

# College Football Campus Tour

By the time Cross was called in to help, Scott was working 16 hours a day,

seven days a week, and still falling behind. When Cross examined the

networks of the company’s top 10,000 people, Scott “was the Number 1

most overloaded person.” Some 120 people came to him every day for

information. Cross found that 78 of the 150 top managers in one unit

Scott ran “felt they couldn’t hit their business goals unless they got

more of Scott’s time.”

Interview and observe users. Leaders at the nonproﬁt Civilla conducted

## more than 250 hours of interviews and observations with residents, civil

servants, and leaders to identify needless and confusing questions on a

beneﬁts form. More than 2 million Michigan residents had to complete

the convoluted document each year to apply for childcare, food, and

health care support from the state. It contained 18,000 words and more

than 1,000 questions—many of which were unnecessary and intrusive.

A turning point in Civilla’s Project Re:form came when leaders met

## with executives from the Michigan Department of Health and Human

Services (MDHHS), the organization responsible for the form, and asked

them to ﬁll it out. As a Civilla cofounder, Adam Selzer, told us, only one

of the executives had attempted to complete the 42-page form before.

Terry Beurer, the department head at MDHHS, got no further than page

eight before giving up. Beurer told Civilla’s CEO, Michael Brennan, that

it was among the most humbling experiences of his career. To Beurer’s

credit, rather than getting defensive and making excuses, he signed

up for the project on the spot and provided his time and department

## resources throughout the challenging, but ultimately successful, two-

year eﬀort to drastically shrink the form.

# Subtraction Tools

During our research for The Friction Project, we discovered an array of

tools that help leaders rid their organizations of unnecessary burdens

—and make it harder to add needless impediments in the ﬁrst place.

Savvy leaders experiment with diﬀerent combinations of tools to

develop the right portfolio for tackling their company’s particular

# friction troubles.

Simple subtraction rules. Crisp constraints help people remove

unnecessary impediments from organizations. One example is the

rule implemented by Laszlo Bock when he led people operations at Google, which is “dedicated to staﬃng, development, and a distinct

and inclusive culture.” Bock told us that tremendous burdens had been

heaped on employees and job candidates by the company’s tradition

of conducting eight to 12, and sometimes 25, rounds of interviews with

a candidate before making an oﬀer (or not). Bock responded with a

simple rule: If more than four interviews were to be conducted with a

candidate, the request for an exception had to be approved by him. It

worked like a charm. The excessive rounds of interviews that exhausted

employees and drove away good candidates disappeared instantly.

The “rule of halves” is another simple subtraction tool. We ask people

to imagine how they could reduce each work burden by 50%—such as

the number of standing meetings they attend, the length of the emails

they send, the number of recommendations they require for new hires,

and the number of digital collaboration tools they use. People rarely cut

50%, but they do reduce their workload.

That’s what happened when Rob Cross coached Scott, that deeply

overextended executive, and suggested that he cut back his direct

## reports, meetings, and emails by about 50%—targets that Scott actually

hit. His direct reports felt more empowered (and less overloaded)

because they made more decisions without checking and coordinating

with him. And because Scott had fewer people to deal with—

and resisted jumping into every decision—his unit operated more eﬃciently. He worked fewer hours, his health improved, and, Cross tells

us, he saved his troubled marriage.

The subtraction game. We have played this game with more than 100

organizations. It starts with solo brainstorming. We ask people, “Think

about how your organization operates. What adds needless frustration?

What scatters your attention? What was once useful but is now in the

way?” Next, people meet in small groups to discuss the impediments

identiﬁed and name additional subtraction targets. Then they select two

## or three targets and outline rough implementation plans—who might

lead the charge, whose support they would need, and which people or

teams might quash the change. Some groups pick a practical idea (one

CEO vowed to keep his emails under 500 words) and an impractical one

(engineers proposed to disband HR). Others select something easy to

subtract (one team reduced the number of communications apps it was

using) and something tough (the members of a top team agreed that

their company would run better and their mental health would improve

if they removed two micromanagers from the board of directors).

One companywide effort saved thousands of hours: changing the default meeting length on Outlook software from 30 minutes to 15 minutes.

Groups sometimes act on the spot. While playing the game with 25

colleagues at a software ﬁrm, one vice president disbanded a troubled

project and shifted his weekly team meeting to every other week.

The CEO of a ﬁnancial services company jumped up and told his

top 80 people that within a week he wanted an email from each of

them with two subtraction targets. Within a month he wanted the

changes implemented—and he oﬀered each person a $5,000 bonus for

making that happen. Nearly all 80 managers earned the bonus. Their

changes included ending poorly performing product lines, eliminating

meetings, and terminating contracts with unreliable vendors.

Subtraction specialists. Not all friction ﬁxers tackle all problems.

Zeroing in on one category of challenges can yield big results. The

Friction Project focused particular attention on people who take

responsibility for identifying, removing, and repairing what we call

“jargon monoxide,” the hollow, convoluted, and incomprehensible

language that undermines workplace communication, collaboration,

# and coordination.

Take the team of seven workers from New Zealand’s Nelson Hospital

who replaced medical jargon with plain language in letters from

physicians to patients. According to an article in Internal Medicine

Journal, the team ran an experiment with 60 patients suﬀering from

chronic health conditions. All 60 received the usual jargon-ﬁlled letter

from a doctor that described their condition and suggested treatment,

but the team randomly selected 30 patients to get a “translated”

letter two weeks later—with common terms substituted for technical

terminology. For example, “peripheral oedema” was translated into

## “ankle swelling,” “tachycardia” into “fast heart rate,” and “idiopathic”

# into “unknown cause.”

Patients appreciated the clarity: Seventy-eight percent preferred the

translated letter to the jargon-ﬁlled one, 69% said it had a positive

impact on their relationship with their physician, and 80% reported that

it increased their “ability to manage their chronic health condition.”

Patients were also asked to circle any terms in their letters that

they didn’t understand. Patients with untranslated letters circled eight

terms, on average; those with translated letters circled two. The team’s

eﬀorts to banish jargon monoxide eliminated unnecessary friction for

# patients.

Subtraction networks. Savvy friction ﬁxers build, join, and activate

networks to help them subtract obstacles. Civilla’s leaders worked

with numerous residents, community leaders, civil servants, and government oﬃcials during Project Re:form. Selzer told us that at ﬁrst he made the mistake of stereotyping civil servants and oﬃcials

as uncaring and unimaginative. But when he and fellow cofounders

Michael Brennan and Lena Selzer started working with them, they

found caring and conscientious people who despised that 42-page form —and were determined to ﬁx it. Once those civil servants and oﬃcials

realized that Civilla could help and had the wherewithal to stick with

the problem, they served as supportive partners.

They helped the Civilla team navigate through hundreds of pages of

government documents in order to develop a shorter and clearer form

that still complied with regulations and laws. Civilla then worked with two oﬃces of the MDHHS to test a prototype. After that successful pilot,

Civilla helped train more than 5,000 ﬁeld staﬀers in 100 department oﬃces. The new form is 80% shorter than the old one, and the end-

to-end processing time for frontline staﬀers has dropped by 42%—

partly because they have 75% fewer errors to correct. Applications

from residents have increased by 12%, yet because fewer need help

completing them, lobby visits have dropped by 50%.

Subtraction movements. Sometimes eﬀorts to reduce friction coalesce

to become something greater than a series of activities—they become a

movement. These enduring initiatives draw on the ideas and eﬀorts of

many people in an organization. Our case study on how pharmaceutical

giant AstraZeneca scaled up simplicity is one example. It started when

senior executives oﬀered the senior director Pushkala Subramanian an

intriguing job: to head an eﬀort to simplify how the multinational’s

60,000 employees worked. Subramanian couldn’t resist the challenge,

and in 2015 she launched the Simpliﬁcation Center of Excellence. Her

team was small, only four other employees, but their ambitions were

big: The “million-hour challenge” aimed to give back 30 minutes a week

to each employee in order to free up more time for clinical trials and

serving patients.

Subramanian’s team knew that a purely top-down approach would

backﬁre because AstraZeneca is a decentralized company, where local

leaders have substantial authority to accept, modify, or ignore orders

from on high. So her team took a two-pronged approach. They

made some companywide changes. In many parts of AstraZeneca,

for example, it took days for new employees to get their company

laptops. Subramanian’s team worked with HR, hiring managers, and

IT leaders to launch a program to ensure that every new employee

had a functioning laptop and access to technical support on day one.

Her team also led an eﬀort that saved thousands of hours: changing

## the default meeting length on Outlook software from 30 minutes to 15

# minutes.

At the same time, Subramanian’s team waged a campaign to entice

employees throughout the ﬁrm to make changes in their jobs,

teams, and units. These eﬀorts included identifying and recruiting

“simpliﬁcation champions” in major units who volunteered to lead

local, grassroots changes. The simpliﬁcation team provided websites,

workshops, and coaches to help champions and other employees

identify obstacles that frustrated them and their customers and

supplied tools to help them implement local repairs.

In Brazil, for example, the simpliﬁcation champion Roberto Uemura ran

a two-week “waste hunters” contest that garnered 52 suggestions. One

winning idea entailed streamlining a complex form and redesigning the system so that employees could more eﬃciently input information

concerning patient safety issues from calls received through their

## unit’s 1-800 number into a single database, rather than into diﬀerent

## systems for transmission to headquarters, the local health agency, and

other relevant parties. In Mexico the IT team cut paperwork in half,

saving 690 hours a year. Meeting-free days were introduced in Taiwan

and Thailand. Each employee in Japan simpliﬁed one thing, saving a

# collective 50,000 hours a year.

## On May 17, 2017, AstraZeneca held World Simpliﬁcation Day to celebrate

saving two million hours in less than two years (twice the original goal!)

and to spread time-saving practices throughout the company.

Bad friction is a plague that undermines productivity and creativity,

raises costs, and frustrates employees, customers, and other

stakeholders. It happens in large part because we default to asking,

“What can I add here?” instead of “What can I get rid of?” But this
