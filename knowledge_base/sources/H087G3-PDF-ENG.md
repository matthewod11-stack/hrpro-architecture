sleep issues. (Myalgic encephalomyelitis/chronic fatigue syndrome, or

## HBR / The Big Idea / Survey: How People Experience Chronic Illness at Work

like to work while experiencing one of these conditions? And how much

do people’s colleagues and managers know about how to accommodate

employees who have them?

## Our new Big Idea feature article, “Long Covid at Work: A Manager’s

## Guide,” shares a framework for ﬂexible work options that organizations

can use to ensure that people with chronic illnesses can contribute and

thrive. But we also wanted to hear directly from HBR readers and people

from the chronic illness community to get a sense of how their work

lives have been impacted — and speciﬁcally, whether employers were

missing the mark.

So, we invited people to share their perspectives on chronic illness in

the workplace via an online survey. More than 200 people responded,

almost equally divided between people who identiﬁed as having a

chronic illness that impacted their day-to-day activities and people who

did not (whom we call “non-ill respondents” throughout this article).

After reviewing responses to our questions, a few key ﬁndings stood

out. (Note that the below represents only the views of the 200-plus

## respondents, not the broader population.)

Most non-ill people who responded said that their organizations were supportive of chronically ill workers, but those directly affected disagreed.

When asked if their employers were understanding of employees with

health issues, 60% of non-ill respondents agreed. Only 36% of people

who identiﬁed as having chronic illnesses agreed that “my employer is

# understanding of my illness.”

As one chronically ill respondent said, “Long Covid is not yet

understood as a chronic illness…My boss was understanding for the ﬁrst

year, but then told me she’d been ‘patient’ while I ‘recovered’ and now

it’s time for me to get back to work.” Another wrote, “Not enough people

understand the toll of it, or the extent of it, and it is exhausting to have

to ﬁght the disease and educate people at the same time.”

“My company has not communicated with me since taking leave. It’s

like being thrown in the trash when your usefulness is less than their

productivity ratio,” shared a third respondent. “I have more than 20

years of experience with this ﬁrm, but I’m only 45…I’m angry and

frustrated and sad.”

A fourth put it succinctly: “Most employers aren’t gonna believe you.”

Part of the problem, according to some, is that long Covid symptoms

— and how “ill” someone appears — can vary day-to-day. “Long Covid

means that one day I can work at almost full capacity and the next I

can barely get out of bed. Because of the unpredictable nature of the

illness, it is supremely diﬃcult to manage not only your own but the

expectations of managers and co-workers,” said one person. “You want that report Friday? Sure thing! [I’ll] get oﬀ to a great start and then

Wednesday through Friday the brain fog hits and you can’t remember

the last sentence you read and you have a migraine from staring at a

screen too much. Your cortisol level shot through the roof because you

were excited…to be working on something fun and important again,

but now you’ve got a raised heart rate of over 140 whilst sitting down.

By Thursday you slept 11 hours and woke up tired and [felt] like you’re

getting the ﬂu. You can barely move. You call in sick. You feel like s—.

You’re not going to ﬁnish the report. You let people down, you feel guilty

for being sick, [and] people don’t understand how you were perfectly

ﬁne Monday and Tuesday but now you’re not.”

## HBR / The Big Idea / Survey: How People Experience Chronic Illness at Work

Three-quarters of chronically ill people who took the survey are still working, but many had to make signiﬁcant changes and sacriﬁces to do so.

We asked people with chronic illnesses how their medical conditions

impacted their work. At some point during their illness:

- 30% had to reduce the hours they worked.

- 27% had to take a medical leave of absence.

- 13% had to ﬁnd a new job.

- 17% had to stop working altogether.

Currently, 75% of respondents say they still work but that they had to

cut back on other activities in order to do so. “It really stinks when every

break and lunch is spent resting, so all your awake, productive time is

spent at work. [There’s] no free time to manage the rest of your life,”

one respondent said. “It’s not sustainable long-term unless someone

else in your life is…cooking, doing the dishes, taking out the trash,

doing the laundry, etc.” Another noted, “The little things take so much

energy it takes everything out of you, and any personal time is just spent

recovering.”

A quarter of chronically ill respondents had disability accommodations, but many others reported barriers to access.

Twenty-seven percent of chronically ill respondents said that they

had disability accommodations for their medical conditions. The most

common were the ﬂexibility to work from home and ﬂexibility around

working hours (total hours worked, speciﬁc times worked, and the like).

Examples included:

- “Work[ing] from home, accessible training, a special keyboard, extra

days to recover from work travel, [closed] captions.”

- “WFH during ﬂare, virtual option (hybrid), chair for sitting available,

## HEPA [high-eﬃciency particulate air ﬁlter] in room.”

- “More time to complete projects. Shifting deadlines when appropriate.

Time oﬀ work when symptoms ﬂare. Work from home is #1.”

- “Later start time due to sleep disorders and fatigue.”

Some respondents said they didn’t need formal accommodations due

to the nature of their job (for example, a job that is already remote) or

because they had informal agreements with their managers (such as keeping their camera oﬀ during meetings).

However, other respondents cited barriers to accessing accommodation.

The most common was fear of disclosing health status due to stigma or

concern about repercussions. “It’s too embarrassing to ask and I think

the management team will think less of me if they know how sick I am,”

said one respondent. Another wrote, “Bringing this up to an employer is

risky due to not knowing how they might react to having an employee

that might be ill…Most working professionals have a reputation at stake,

and to let our employer know about our condition might put us in a bad

spot and potentially not have opportunities for professional growth and

# promotions.”

One employee talked about the tension between needing support and

wanting to appear “well”: “Because long Covid is an invisible disability,

I am often stuck between wanting to pass as non-disabled so I am not

excluded from various activities, projects, etc., and needing people to

understand that I can’t function the way I used to. I end up feeling like

I need to read as simultaneously sick and well.”

These concerns may not be unfounded. Some respondents who had

disclosed their condition shared that they had experienced challenges.

“Once people get wind of my disabling condition, they begin to

infantilize me and really put more focus on what they think my

limitations are rather than what I actually state as my limitations,”

noted one person. And from another: “When my employer learned

about my illness, I was trusted less and given fewer opportunities

for development. Nothing about my performance changed other than needing time oﬀ to recover.”

An additional barrier to accommodation access was the challenge of

getting a diagnosis or conﬁrmation of disability. As one person said,

“Few doctors know anything about long Covid. Getting one to even

acknowledge that you have it is at best months of irrelevant tests to ‘rule

out’ everything else under the sun.” A second shared, “My employer

didn’t recognize long Covid and expected that I was ﬁt to work on my

return,” while a third wrote, “Employers do not understand the impact

of my disability on my day-to-day life, and they are not willing to trust

# my word either.”

Some non-ill people who took the survey also shared their thoughts on the best approaches to accommodation. Many focused on organizational culture and communication.

In addition to highlighting speciﬁc accommodation practices (for

example, remote or hybrid work and allowing ﬂexibility around hours worked, schedules, and time oﬀ) — which generally aligned with the

accommodations that chronically ill respondents pointed to — many

non-ill respondents spoke about the importance of an organization’s

## culture, approach to inclusivity, and openness of communication.

“I think companies should create environments where employees feel

safe enough to be honest about their capacity and where they might

need help,” said one person. Another stressed that “a cookie-cutter

approach or policy may not achieve the objective of accommodating

health condition and results. Compassion and a shared interest in

achieving results should be the way.”

“I think the most important is culture: manager [sensitivity] and psychological safety,” reported a diﬀerent respondent. “People with

chronic illnesses may just need ecosystems that are supportive, where

they feel safe and heard by managers and peers and that they will not be reprimanded for calling out their needs, which may be diﬀerent for each

# individual.”

Other non-ill respondents spoke about the need to think more inclusively about how to deliver against organizational priorities.

“There should be space for individuals to choose how they do their work

and deliver results,” said one person. “If the role allows, performance

should not be linked to aspects like hours worked, breaks taken,

## and check-in and checkout timing and rather to actual deliverables.”

Another noted the importance of job tailoring as an option, “by ﬁrst

listening to and understanding the needs of the employee’s illness and

then co-creating a plan with the employee and a third-party expert in

the particular condition. From the organization’s perspective, the goal

should be what can that person deliver particularly well, how much of

it, and in what way and then putting in place a system that can support

and supplement this delivery for required results.”

Several chronically ill respondents left us with a ﬁnal thought: They can

still achieve as much at work as they did before they became ill — just

not in the same way they did before.

“[It’s] possible to achieve the same results even with my health

limitations,” noted one person. “However, the way I work and number

of hours I work must change to within my energy capacity (e.g., working

from home instead of the oﬃce, ﬂexible time of day, fewer meetings,

time for rest periods at home during day, etc.).” Another emphasized

the importance of pacing, or “the ability to move forward when I’m

doing all right and scale back activity or stop when I’m feeling worse.

This allows me to maintain my productivity long-term, and many of my

healthy friends say I get more done in the average day than they do. This

requires employers to be understanding of my health limitations and

not make workplace attendance into a lever of control, but make semi-

ﬂexible deadlines to reach particular goals and objectives or ﬁnalize

products instead.”

A third person perhaps said it best: “I just work diﬀerently now.”
