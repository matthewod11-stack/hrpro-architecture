Leaders are under enormous pressure to address societal issues,

maintain an active DEI strategy, and keep employees connected to each

other and to the company’s mission. And since employees rightly expect

to be able to bring their feelings — big and small — to work, supporting

employees during cultural trauma and strife is every leader’s job. It’s not

always obvious how to address these issues at work, especially when

leaders aren’t necessarily trained or experienced in navigating such

sensitive, emotional topics. One important way to provide the support

employees expect is through rituals.

I’ve studied the impact of workplace rituals on individuals, teams, and

## the bottom line for many years for my book, Rituals Roadmap. This

research has helped me deﬁne rituals using two important benchmarks.

First, rituals go beyond their practical purpose, moving participants

beyond transaction and into meaning. For instance, lighting a candle

when the lights go out isn’t a ritual, but turning oﬀ the lights and

lighting a candle at sundown is. Second, rituals are sorely missed when

they’re taken away.

What follows is one case study from a company that took a risk in real

time and created a successful response to a tragedy, and over time, that

response became a ritual. Here’s how they did it, and how rituals can

improve psychological safety, purpose, and ultimately performance.

# Time to Connect

In 2022, I met Judith Harrison, EVP, global diversity, equity & inclusion

at global communications ﬁrm Weber Shandwick. After George Floyd’s

murder, Harrison oﬀered a time for employees to come together to

process their grief. Ever since, the company has held the gathering once

## a month, and sometimes more often in response to traumatic events.

Harrison calls this simple circle “Time to Connect.”

Time to Connect is considered a ritual for two reasons. First, the

gatherings aren’t directly related to the company’s stated mission —

their professional communications work. When I asked Harrison what

inspired her to bring people together, she told me, “I thought having

cadenced opportunities to talk through these events, all of which have

mental health impacts on many people, made sense.”

Second, as the company’s EVP head of brand impact, Lewis Williams,

told me, “I’m a fan [of Time to Connect] and I think it can’t go away now…even if we come back into the oﬃce. Especially with the young

employees coming in, it’s just a new world when it comes to the

employee relationship and what we expect from our employers.” In

other words, the employees at Weber Shandwick have come to depend

on these regular gatherings and would miss them if they stopped.

## The Three P’s of Supportive Company Rituals

Through my research, I’ve also discovered why rituals mean so much

to us. Time and time again, when it wasn’t clear to me why a group

or team was so determined to maintain a shared behavior, I discovered

that rituals support psychological safety and purpose, which leads to

increased performance. I describe this simple formulation as the “Three

# P’s of rituals.”

By applying the Three P’s to Time to Connect, leaders can better

understand their own rituals — both current ones and those that have

yet to be discovered.

# Psychological Safety

When employees come together for Time to Connect, Harrison begins

with some prepared remarks about the world event and then asks the

same question each time: “So, how are you doing?”

In order to give employees permission to answer this question honestly,

she opens the conversation with her own perspective on the issue

at hand. Leading by example provides people an opportunity to be

real themselves. As a result, employees feel safe to respond to the

conversations in whatever way works for them — live, in the chat, or

# via email after the fact.

## For instance, after the shooting in Highland Park, Illinois, earlier this

year, Angela Salerno-Robin, SVP media relations, responded with “I am

# not okay”:

These sessions are a time for us to support one another and talk in

a safe space. This time was different. This time, I was the one who

personally needed the support. Highland Park is my home. We moved

our family here from Chicago to give our children a “safer” place to

grow up. It’s hard for me to put into words how we are feeling, but I

can tell you that as a family, as a community, and as a nation — we

are not okay!

It’s not uncommon for participants to cry and share out loud or via the

chat function. They engage in whatever way is comfortable for them.

Not only do they appear to feel psychologically safe enough to do so, but

their raw participation creates more safety for others. As chief of staﬀ

Jill Tannenbaum put it:

I didn’t expect to get emotional on that call, but I was so moved by

the humanity and the openness. With a topic that is debated with so

much passion and vitriol outside our walls, inside our walls feels safe,

enabling a conversation in a way that is immensely supported and

# always kind.

Ultimately, creating psychological safety starts with leaders’ willingness

to model it.

# Purpose

Helping employees ﬁnd purpose in an organization is critical to

engagement and innovation. One way to do this is to ensure that a

company’s values are clear, actionable, and widely distributed. Tying

those values to key rituals is the perfect way to incorporate purpose into

employees’ shared experiences.

## Weber Shandwick’s values of courage, inclusion, curiosity, and impact

lend themselves particularly well to making this connection. The ritual

of Time to Connect is the ideal way to bring personal and professional

purpose together in one very powerful, shared experience based on the

company’s values. The creation and endurance of this ritual speaks to

## the courage and curiosity of the employees and company leadership. To

be brave enough to take the leap into the unknown and open up these

challenging conversations is by deﬁnition courageous. And to create a

forum for people to listen to one another is an expression of curiosity.

Employees have expressed gratitude that Time to Connect creates

## a safe, inclusive space for everyone to share, not only those most

obviously aﬀected by the events discussed.

# Performance

When I asked Harrison about the business results of Time to Connect,

she told me, “Based on people’s comments about how much they look

forward to the calls and how ‘therapeutic’ they are, I think the business

impact is in engagement, with belonging and trust being subsets of this

category.” What’s more, studies show that community co-creation, a

feeling of genuine care, and solidarity have been found to be closely tied

# to retention.

The numbers speak for themselves. Each month, over 200 people show

up, and keep showing up — as themselves, bringing their whole selves

to work. Daryl Drabinsky, EVP head of digital health, North America,

was so inspired that she initiated “Time to Connect: West” for West

Coast employees to connect after Roe v. Wade was overturned by the

# U.S. Supreme Court.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Hidden Power of Workplace Rituals

Time to Connect is a powerful example of a simple way leaders can

provide the kind of response and support employees are expecting from

their companies. Enlisting regular rituals helps leaders oﬀer healing

from speciﬁc traumas and disturbances while at the same time aligning

their workforce with their values and increasing psychological safety

and belonging. At a time when the call for authenticity has moved

way beyond any brand buzzword, rituals are good for people and for

# business.
