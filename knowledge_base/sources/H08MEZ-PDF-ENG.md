But where federal regulation ebbs, state actions often ﬂow. For

to eliminate DEI initiatives in the government and discourage them in

## private employers. However, states like California and Illinois already

have laws on the books requiring employers to collect and report race,

gender and pay data to the state. These states are likely to oppose

federal attempts to curtail race and gender-based data collection and

continue to push companies to focus on diversity and equity, placing

# employers squarely in the crosshairs.

It’s not just about DEI. With Congress unwilling or unable to pass

## federal laws in other areas of employment, and federal agencies unlikely

to issue broad regulations, the states will take over. The result will

be a fragmented legal landscape that will pose signiﬁcant challenges

for businesses as they grapple with a mix of diﬀerent and even

contradictory policies in states where they operate.

Although companies have always had to deal with multiple state

laws, there is a big diﬀerence in impact in having two state laws to

contend with versus 25 state laws. The patchwork of state law becomes

exponentially harder to deal with the more it proliferates. Companies

will need to plan carefully to ensure compliance, mitigate risks, and

# maintain trust with their people.

## Four State Laws Companies Should Prepare For

We expect state policies in four areas will prove especially challenging

for companies to navigate: the use of non-compete agreements, paid-

## leave policies, pay-transparency requirements, and regulation of AI.

Companies have had to contend with a patchwork of laws in these areas

for years, but we expect this trend to worsen in the absence of federal

## rules and the intense political polarization of the states.

Restrictions on the use of non-compete agreements exist today in just

over half the states. Yet there are wide diﬀerences in the industries and

employee-pay thresholds that are subject to these rules. For example,

when it comes to non-competes in health care, Louisiana restricts

them only for primary care physicians; Kentucky only restricts them

## for temporary staﬀ of healthcare service agencies; Montana for mental

## health professionals; Oregon for home healthcare workers; and South

Dakota has a long list of speciﬁc practitioners excluded. Unfortunately

for employers, almost none of these state laws overlap, creating a true

patchwork that requires multiple compliance approaches.

Similarly, employee leave policies also diﬀer greatly across the country.

States set diﬀerent standards for paid family and medical leave,

including the reason an employee is allowed to take leave, the number

of paid weeks employers must provide, and whether costs are funded

by employer or employee payroll taxes, or both. The number of rules

are so burdensome, and the risks of non-compliance so great, that many

companies are forced to hire third-party administrators just to stay in

# compliance.

When it comes to pay transparency laws, state policies typically fall into

two main categories: salary history bans and requirements to include

pay ranges in job postings. Speciﬁc requirements can vary widely across

## states, however. For example, the strictest of salary history bans, such

as in California, prohibit employers both from seeking compensation

history and from using any information they already have about an

individual’s prior compensation when making employment decisions.

Emerging rules on artiﬁcial intelligence (AI) are following a similar

path, with states stepping in to ﬁll the void left by federal inaction. In

## the 2024 legislative session, at least 45 states, Puerto Rico, the Virgin

Islands and Washington, D.C., introduced AI bills that ranged from

prohibitions on algorithmic discrimination to informing applicants of

# the use of AI in the hiring process.

# Key Steps for Preparation

To navigate this labyrinth successfully, companies should consider the

following three key steps:

- 1. Create a centralized compliance framework.

This is essential for mitigating legal risks and ensuring consistent

adherence to state-speciﬁc requirements. Without it, organizations face the possibility of redundancies, ineﬃciencies, and costly non-

# compliance penalties.

To build such a framework, companies should establish a cross-

functional compliance team that includes representatives from legal,

# human resources, and operations.

Investing in technology to track state-level changes, such as paid leave

accrual systems, is also vital. Additionally, the company’s leadership

must be regularly updated on emerging trends to align strategy with

# regulatory developments.

Some companies are already moving in this direction. One national

retailer uses compliance management software to monitor non-compete

enforcement laws, updating its hiring practices as laws evolve. This

proactive approach ensures the organization remains compliant while

minimizing operational disruptions.

- 2. Standardize policies while keeping ﬂexibility.

Organizations must strike a balance between standardization and

ﬂexibility when managing diverse state laws. Standardized policies promote fairness and eﬃciency across company locations, while

ﬂexibility allows for compliance with state-speciﬁc nuances. A

successful strategy involves developing a core set of policies aligned

with the strictest requirements across states while creating addendums

tailored to local laws.

This approach also fosters agility and responsiveness by empowering

regional teams to adapt policies within this broader framework. Using

this model, a technology company has aligned its remote work AI

monitoring policies nationwide to comply with California’s stringent

data privacy laws but creates state-speciﬁc addendums to deal with

## other unique state requirements (such as Illinois’ Biometric Information

Privacy Act for facial recognition tools). This approach ensures both

# compliance and operational consistency.

- 3. Actively communicate with employees about state differences and their impact. Eﬀective internal communication is an essential but often overlooked

## part of managing policy diﬀerences across states. Good communication

prevents confusion, builds trust, and ensures employees understand

how policies apply to them and aﬀect the company’s performance.

Best practices for communication include: training managers to explain

policy variations, using easy-to-access tools like intranet updates to

keep people informed, and hosting regular Q&A sessions to address

concerns or recent changes. A leading healthcare organization conducts

quarterly webinars for managers to address updates in paid leave laws,

fostering consistent messaging across the company.

. . .

Managing complex state employment laws requires strategic

preparation. Companies should begin with these steps to help ensure

they are ready for the challenges ahead.
