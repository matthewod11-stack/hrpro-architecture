We all know that great leaders tend to be great communicators. Think

Winston Churchill, Nelson Mandela, Oprah Winfrey, Steve Jobs. But what, exactly, do followers ﬁnd so compelling about the way these

people speak?

As someone who has taught management communication as well as

helped startup teams pitch and raise hundreds of millions of dollars, I’ve found that one important but often overlooked hallmark of eﬀective

speakers is their ability to convey power not through presence but with

# their words.

Mastering the language of power—diction, phrasing, topics, and

patterns—can dramatically enhance our success in managerial roles,

secure resources for our projects and initiatives, and win the admiration

# of followers.

In this article, I highlight ﬁve techniques you can use to level up your

speaking by communicating your power.

# Focus on Action

Powerful leaders must deliberate on important decisions, weighing pros

and cons with input from others. But when they communicate, they

# focus on action.

For example, take the following two statements:

Neutral: There are several options in front of us. If we go with option

A, we may secure our reputation with existing customers. On the other

hand, if we go with option B, we may have an opportunity to expand our

# market share.

Powerful: While option A would help secure our reputation with existing

customers, Option B is the clear choice to strengthen and expand our position. Now let’s plan execution. First, we must hire staﬀ to ﬁll the

necessary roles. Then we will reach out to media.

Research suggests that both statements convey equal competence, but

the second statement is seen as more powerful, more managerial, and

more likely to gain status.

# Think Big

Today’s leaders are buried in metrics. Engagement rates, KPIs, and

conversion charts bombard us. These facts inform, but they don’t

# illuminate.

Research shows that leaders are perceived as more powerful when they

think and speak more abstractly, stepping back from the data to present

the bigger picture. For example, one study found that startup founders

who describe their ventures in more concrete terms are less likely to get funded than those who use oﬀer abstract descriptions.

Let’s contrast a common concrete (neutral) message versus an abstract

# (powerful) one:

Neutral: Customer retention has increased by 2.5% this quarter,

meaning 1,250 more customers have stayed with us.

Powerful: More customers are choosing to stay with us. This isn’t just

about growth—it’s trust. If we build on this momentum, we can turn satisﬁed users into lifelong advocates.

Data informs, but abstraction elevates. That’s why we label visionaries

as great leaders. When you speak, whether you include data or not, your

power arises from presenting a broader perspective.

# Take the Hit

It can be tempting to claim credit for wins and deﬂect failures. But this

is a mistake. Consider BP CEO Tony Hayward’s decision to attribute

## the Deepwater Horizon oil spill to Transocean, the rig’s operator, rather

than accept full accountability. Or Boeing CEO Dennis Muilenburg’s

criticism of Lion Air’s maintenance and pilot training in response to

the ﬁrst 737 Max crash, rather than acknowledging aircraft design ﬂaws.

Both were ousted from their positions.

Blame and deﬂection signal weakness because they convey incapability to inﬂuence a situation. The fault (and therefore power) is with someone

# else.

Owning failure signals power. When we take responsibility, we signal our ability to ﬁx the problem and better manage future scenarios.

In July 2024, cybersecurity company CrowdStrike faced a crisis when

a faulty software update led to widespread IT disruptions. CEO George

Kurtz quickly took responsibility, stating:

I want to sincerely apologize directly to all of you for today’s outage. All

of CrowdStrike understands the gravity and impact of the situation. We quickly identiﬁed the issue and deployed a ﬁx…

His prompt ownership of the situation and transition to corrective

action showcased strong leadership and helped defuse further backlash.

# Assess Others

Studies show that powerful people don’t necessarily aim to impress.

They aim to assess.

In business, the person with more power evaluates the person with

less. Recruiters rate job candidates. Buyers vet sellers. VCs scrutinize

# startups.

Those who feel they have a strong position in negotiations ask more

questions to learn whether the other person will be valuable to them.

Conversely, those in the weaker position aim to prove themselves.

Proving is the low-power behavior.

But assessment can ﬂow both ways in any discussion. A highly skilled

job candidate might probe recruiters to determine if the role will be a good personal ﬁt. Or a seller may be selective about which customers

they work with. Companies like Gulfstream and Feadship vet buyers

before allowing them to purchase high-end jets and yachts.

To convey power, ask questions of your conversational counterparts or

audience. For example, an executive candidate in an interview might,

after answering a few questions to demonstrate their value to the

organization, turn the tables with a query like:

How does leadership support innovation here? What’s the long-term

# vision for this role?

A startup with strong prospects may ask a VC:

What’s your track record in helping companies scale? How do you add

# value beyond capital?

Questions that vet the other party signal conﬁdence and power over

your choices, balancing out the power dynamic.

Curiosity is your superpower. The aim is not arrogance or dominance.

The aim is to convey respect for your own goals through asking

# questions.

# Direct the Spotlight

Meetings are the public venue during which status dynamics are on

display and people jockey for position. How you show up within the

team is how the team will see you. You might think the best way to show

up is to add your own perspectives and value, but that’s not exactly

# right.

## The most powerful person in the room doesn’t stand in the spotlight;

they control it. They are the ringleaders. They set the agenda, moderate

discussions, and distill ideas into action.

For example, you might open a strategy meeting with:

Let’s start by reviewing last quarter’s performance to establish context,

then move into key challenges and opportunities, so we can end with a

# clear plan of action.

As the meeting unfolds, you can ask exploratory questions that

## encourage meaningful contribution from everyone, such as:

If we had to make this decision today, what would each of you

# recommend?

Let others deliberate and then synthesize their input into a decisive

plan. The aim of the ringleader is not to speak the most, but to steer

the most. Do this by focusing on the big picture, asking questions, and

organizing input into action.

Power shows up when you speak. Research shows that when you use

these techniques, you’ll be seen as a stronger, more compelling leader.
