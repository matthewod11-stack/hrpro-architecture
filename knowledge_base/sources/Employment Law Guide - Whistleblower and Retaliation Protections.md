# the public.

Other Department of Labor agencies, such as the Wage and Hour Division, the Employee Beneﬁts Security

Administration, and the Mine Safety and Health Administration, enforce the anti-retaliation provisions of numerous other statutes and Executive Orders. Information concerning many of these additional anti-

retaliation protections is available in other sections of the Guide.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

Generally, the employee protection provisions listed above prohibit covered employers from discharging or otherwise discriminating against any employee because the employee engaged in certain activities protected

# by law.

The protected activities typically include:

Initiating a proceeding under, or for the enforcement of, any of these statutes, or causing such a proceeding

to be initiated; Testifying in any such proceeding;

Assisting or participating in any such proceeding or in any other action to carry out the purposes of these

# statutes; or

Complaining about a violation.

Many of the statutes speciﬁcally protect an employee's internal complaints to his or her employer, and it is the Department of Labor's position, as set forth in regulations, that employees who express safety or quality

assurance concerns internally to their employers are protected under all of the whistleblower statutes

administered by OSHA.

# Employee Rights

Any employee who believes that he or she has been discriminated or retaliated against in violation of any of the statutes listed above may ﬁle a complaint with OSHA. Complaints must be ﬁled within 30 days after the

occurrence of the alleged violation under the OSH Act, CAA, CERCLA, SWDA, FWPCA, SDWA, and TSCA;

within 60 days under ISCA; within 90 days under AIR21 and AHERA; and within 180 days under ACA, FSMA,

## SPA, MAP-21, SOX, STAA, ERA, PSIA, FRSA, NTSSA, CFPA and CPSIA.

If the Secretary of Labor has not issued a ﬁnal decision within 180 days of the ﬁling of a SOX complaint, one year of the ﬁling of an ERA complaint, or 210 days of a ACA, SPA, FSMA, MAP-21, STAA, FRSA, NTSSA,

CFPA or CPSIA complaint, and there is no showing that there has been delay due to the bad faith of the

employee, the employee may bring an action at law or equity in district court under those statutes.

Posters. Although there is no speciﬁc Whistleblower Poster, the Whistleblower Protection provisions have the

following poster requirements under the Occupational Safety and Health Act (OSH Act) and the Energy

# Reorganization Act of 1974 (ERA):

All employers covered by the OSH Act are required to display and keep displayed the OSHA "Job Safety and

Health: It's the Law(http://www.osha.gov/Publications/poster.html)" poster. The poster is also available in

Spanish(http://www.osha.gov/Publications/osha3167.pdf). There is a separate poster for Federal

agencies(http://www.osha.gov/Publications/fedposter.html). This poster informs employees of their right to ﬁle a

retaliation or discrimination complaint with OSHA for making safety and health complaints or for exercising rights under the OSH Act.

The poster must be displayed in a conspicuous place where employees and applicants for employment can

see it. Reproductions or facsimiles of the poster shall be at least 8 1/2 by 14 inches with 10 point type.

Posting of the notice in languages other than English is not required.

Employers covered by the Energy Reorganization Act of 1974 (ERA) must display the poster, "Your Rights Under the Energy Reorganization Act," where employees can readily see it.

Notices. There are generally no notice requirements for employers under most of the Whistleblower

Protection provisions administered and enforced by OSHA. For other notice requirements under the OSH Act,

## see the OSHA Injury and Illness Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements.

# There are generally no recordkeeping requirements for employers under most of the Whistleblower Protection

# provisions administered and enforced by OSHA. For other recordkeeping requirements under the OSH Act,

## see the OSHA Injury and Illness Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements.

There are generally no reporting requirements for employers under most of the Whistleblower Protection

provisions administered and enforced by OSHA. For other reporting requirements under the OSH Act, see the

## OSHA Injury and Illness Recordkeeping and Reporting Requirements.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Upon receipt of a timely complaint, OSHA notiﬁes the employer and, if conciliation fails, conducts an

investigation. Where OSHA ﬁnds that complaints ﬁled under the OSH Act, AHERA, and ISCA have merit, they

are referred to the Solicitor's Oﬃce for legal action. Complaints under these three statutes found not to have merit will be dismissed. Where OSHA ﬁnds a violation after investigating complaints under the other statutes

listed above, it will issue a determination letter requiring the employer to pay back wages, reinstate the

employee, reimburse the employee for attorney and expert witness fees, and take other steps to provide

necessary relief. Complaints found not to have merit will be dismissed.

Parties who object to OSHA's determinations under the other statutes listed above (except for the OSH Act, AHERA, and ISCA) may request a hearing before the Department of Labor's Oﬃce of Administrative Law

Judges (OALJ)(http://www.oalj.dol.gov). Administrative Law Judges' decisions are reviewed by the Department

of Labor's Administrative Review Board(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/arb), which the Secretary of Labor has

designated to issue ﬁnal agency decisions.

Under STAA, if OSHA ﬁnds in favor of the employee, litigation ordinarily is conducted by the Solicitor's Oﬃce, but sometimes by the private party. Under the other statutes, litigation generally is conducted by the private

parties themselves. Employers and employees may seek judicial review of an adverse Administrative Review

# Board decision.

Under the AIR21, SOX, PSIA, FRSA, NTSSA, CPSIA, ACA, CFPA, FSMA, and MAP-21, employees who ﬁle

complaints frivolously or in bad faith may be liable for attorney's fees up to $1,000.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

The Supreme Court has held that the employee protection provisions of the ERA do not preempt existing state

statutes and common law claims. The other statutes listed above should be consulted separately to determine

whether or not their employee protection provisions are supplementary to protection provided by state laws.
