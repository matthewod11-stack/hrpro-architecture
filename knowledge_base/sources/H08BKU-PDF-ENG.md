As organizations seek to be more inclusive in their recruitment and

hiring practices, one area they can improve upon is expanding their

talent acquisition playbook to include refugees.

According to the U.N. Refugee Agency, the number of global refugees,

## asylum seekers, and others in need of international protection

surpassed 50.3 million people at the end of 2023 — and that

number is expected to rise as geopolitical conﬂict, violence, and

humanitarian crises continue to roil many parts of the world, with 73%

of humanitarian migrants coming from Afghanistan, Syria, Venezuela,

Ukraine, and South Sudan. With the refugee crisis comes the rise

## of anti-immigration sentiments in Europe, the U.S., Australia (where

we’re based), and top refugee host countries such as Iran, Turkey,

and Colombia. These trends result in increasingly hostile attitudes and

restrictive policies towards resettling individuals, including their access

# to employment.

In three studies over the past ﬁve years, we’ve researched how

businesses could better understand and engage with refugees as a

## valuable, and often misunderstood, source of untapped talent. Refugees

represent people from all paths of life and occupational backgrounds,

## with engineers, lawyers, carpenters, and IT specialists among this

diverse cohort. They share the determination to rebuild their lives

and regain a sense of stability through employment. But the path to

secure employment is far from easy, despite tight labor markets in many

developed economies. Through our work, we have come to believe that

most companies would beneﬁt from doing more to tap into this talent

pool, and we oﬀer six recommendations for companies to start.

# The Research

In our ﬁrst study from 2019, we surveyed 118 employers and interviewed

29 managers of Australian organizations. We compared a group of

managers who had never hired refugees to a group who had hired

from that cohort. Those who have never recruited from this group

tend to undervalue the beneﬁts of this talent pool, and hold various

## misconceptions and biases around recruiting and hiring refugees. For

example, many employers expressed concerns that refugees lacked

necessary skills, or that their integration into the workplace would be

# too cumbersome and costly.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: Why Inclusive Hiring Must Include Refugees

Our study, and evidence from across the world, demonstrates that

these negative assumptions stand in contrast with the experience of

employers who have recruited refugees and raved about the beneﬁts

they provided to the workforce, including outcomes like increased

## employee satisfaction, higher retention rates and productivity, better

market positioning, and a boost in creativity. Yet, refugee recruitment is

not without challenges and even those managers who overcome biases

face hurdles when trying to hire from this talent pool.

## On this note, in our second longitudinal study from 2023, we

interviewed 35 Australian employers across various industries (from

## construction and manufacturing to IT and ﬁnance) with little to no

experience in hiring refugees to understand what resources and support

they need to succeed in this endeavor. We found that traditional

recruitment processes often prevent managers from tapping into non-

traditional talent pools, with refugees being just one example of those excluded. Most conventional staﬃng approaches are built around

mainstream talent-sourcing avenues, use a pre-deﬁned list of criteria

## (e.g. local experience, domestic qualiﬁcations, and references), and rely

# on interviews as a screening tactic.

We supplemented the studies of employers with an investigation

focused on the perspectives of refugees. In the research project we are

currently pursuing, we interviewed 26 skilled refugees from numerous

countries, including Afghanistan, Syria and Ukraine, among others,

about their experiences ﬁnding work.

So, learning from the experiences of refugee jobseekers, how can

employers implement a truly inclusive recruitment process?

Scrutinize your hiring criteria.

Before you decide to cast the net, take a careful look at exactly what you ask for in a candidate. What oﬃcial certiﬁcations are really necessary

to perform the job, and is local experience a must? Most people from

a refugee background do not have credentials or references local to

your company, preventing them from ever being shortlisted. Inclusive

managers understand this limitation and are open to revising their job

descriptions and selection criteria to make them more open to those

who would otherwise never be considered among local candidates. For

example, employers could include desirable criteria such as a second

## language or international work experience as signals that international

job candidates are welcome, as well as encouragements for applicants

to apply even if they only meet some of the listed criteria. They could

also consider whether local degrees and professional credentials could

be replaced with demonstrated experience in a given domain.

## Be proactive and creative with recruitment.

Inclusive recruitment needs to be proactive and innovative. If you

cast your net in the same pond, you are likely to catch the same

ﬁsh. Instead, consider widening your outreach to a wider diversity of

groups and pipelines, and think outside the box. For example, using

a variety of platforms to advertise positions can be an easy avenue to

start the inclusive recruitment process. These could include posting

listings on the websites of organizations that advocate for various

## communities, as well as job newsletters and advertisements through

## support organizations (such as not-for-proﬁts and social enterprises)

that support the recruitment of disadvantaged jobseekers.

Reevaluate your selection processes.

The traditional interview process often relies on the candidate’s ability

to describe their prior experiences, qualiﬁcations, past work duties, and

skillsets — an approach that creates a larger barrier to recruitment

and selection for most non-native speakers. Managers should consider

whether candidates should be tested on their ability to talk or write

about their skills, or on their ability to demonstrate these skills in

practice. To this end, rather than testing oral or written communication

aptitude, companies can adopt innovative ways to test practical and

technical on-the-job skills, in which candidates are asked to perform

a task and are evaluated on their proﬁciency in execution rather than

# language ﬂuency.

For example, speciﬁc skills assessments such as coding tasks in IT,

## computational challenges in ﬁnance, or portfolio reviews in creative

professions or construction would allow candidates to demonstrate

their potential contribution to the role. Additionally, some employers

work with bilingual managers and assigned mentors who can support

refugees in their work transition when needed. Others rely on

technology, using language apps designed speciﬁcally to teach workers

the technical vocabulary required for a given job. In the long term,

the investment in language development could allow companies

to capitalize on the skills of their multicultural and multilingual

workforce, who can better serve their increasingly diverse customer

# base.

Consider utilizing external support.

## Across the world, multiple not-for-proﬁts and social enterprises

specialize in supporting employers in recruiting marginalized

jobseekers, including people from a refugee background. Many of

these organizations provide a broad suite of services that could help

businesses advance an inclusive recruitment strategy. This support

ranges from ﬁnding and screening suitable candidates, to onboarding,

to ongoing support. It could also include training for the local

# workforce.

## In the context of refugee employment, the most prominent support

organization is the Tent Partnership for Refugees. This globally

operating not-for-proﬁt mobilizes the business community to advance

sustainable employment outcomes for refugees. Tent and LinkedIn

both maintain online databases of numerous certiﬁed NGOs and

social enterprises worldwide. For example, in Australia, Community

Corporate works directly with hiring employers such as Accenture,

IKEA, and Woolworths to recruit refugees to their workforce while also

collaborating with companies like Cisco, AWS, and ServiceNow that

oﬀer dedicated upskilling programs across a range of high-demand

# industries like technology.

Reach out to industry peers.

Beyond direct contact with NGOs, employers can learn from their

peers. Many companies have shared their ﬁrsthand experience of

refugee recruitment. IKEA’s ﬂagship Skills for Employment initiative

has provided upskilling and employment opportunities to hundreds

of people from a refugee background. The multinational corporation

is committed to sharing its inclusive recruitment model with other

corporations that are keen to take action. Reaching out to industry

peers is a great way to learn about speciﬁc considerations and best

practices while establishing your own path to inclusive recruitment.

## Online resources, such as the global edition of our “Employers’ Guide

to Refugee Employment,” which features corporate examples, or this

video guide to inclusive employment that we created are a great starting

# point.

## Think of inclusive recruitment beyond direct recruitment.

There are numerous actions managers can take to support refugees,

even if they are not presently hiring. The refugees we interviewed told

us about their struggles to rebuild their lives. Wars, natural disasters,

and persecution forced them to leave their homes. They had no

opportunity to collect documents, strategize about their future career

paths, or learn about the rules of the local job market. To this end,

resettlement agencies and support organizations across the world are

always searching for corporate mentors who can help guide refugees

through the maze of local recruitment practices. Most importantly,

there are multiple local organizations across the globe supporting

refugees resettling in your neighborhood. Like many leaders who

talked with us, employers and HR professionals might be surprised

by how much they will learn about resilience, culture, and leadership

# throughout the mentoring experience.

. . .

Inclusive recruitment, in this sense, should be seen as a long-term

process of building cross-cultural competencies and learning to

## better understand and work with people of diverse backgrounds.

This includes increasing emphasis and training on trauma-informed

business practices, and involves a long-term outlook, openness to

learning, and going beyond business as usual. In the increasingly

pressing competition for global talent, refugees highlight the gaps in

inclusive recruitment. Businesses need to rethink how they can become

part of the solution to the world’s most pressing humanitarian crises.

## Our research and extensive immersion in the corporate domain

show that change champions in refugee recruitment come from all

organizational levels. We ﬁnd that all it takes is one person to raise an

interest to drive organizational momentum toward more inclusive work

# environments.
