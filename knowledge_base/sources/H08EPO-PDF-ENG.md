Emily, a product manager at a video gaming company, had recently

been tapped to lead a new AI workgroup. Incorporating machine

learning into their game development was a major strategic direction for

the ﬁrm and she felt honored to spearhead such a crucial initiative. But

colleagues from other departments were slow to respond to her emails,

often missing meetings or deprioritizing AI-related tasks. She told me,

“My boss keeps saying to give it time. That new projects take a while to

gain traction.” When Emily did manage to gather her stakeholders, she

sensed a lack of urgency and buy-in. “They see this workgroup as just

another burden,” Emily said. “I know we’d move faster if there was more

## visible support from my boss and the rest of the leadership team.”

Maybe you’ve been in Emily’s shoes, wishing your manager would

advocate for you, whether through the public endorsement of an idea,

introductions to key stakeholders, publicizing team achievements, or

positioning you as a subject matter expert. Your leader’s support can

lend credibility, open doors, and rally resources in a way that’s hard to

do on your own — but it’s often up to you to ask for it.

## In an ideal world, higher-ups would instinctively and unquestioningly

champion your eﬀorts. But the truth is, your supervisor is busy juggling

multiple priorities and your project may have slipped their mind. If

they’re new to their role, they might be hesitant to throw their weight

around. In some cases, your boss may intentionally wait and see how

you go about getting buy-in on your own. Most of the time though,

leaders simply don’t recognize when their advocacy is needed, how

impactful it can be, or the obstacles you’re facing.

Regardless of the reason, waiting for support to magically materialize is

a sureﬁre way to aggravate yourself and potentially derail your project.

So, how do you manage up and ask for the help you need? Here’s how to

convince those above you to champion your cause.

Highlight what’s in it for them

Your boss, like everyone, is tuned into their personal “radio station,”

WII-FM (what’s in it for me?). To gain their support, you need to

broadcast on their frequency. In other words, connect your ask to how it

not only meets your needs, but also aligns with their priorities.

Emily knew from past one-on-ones that her manager was concerned about eﬃciency and his own workload. So, she highlighted how

increased visibility for the AI workgroup could speed up project

timelines by reducing back-and-forth communication and limit the

number of meetings he’d need to attend.

# Offer specific ideas

Don’t leave it to your leader to ﬁgure out how to support you.

Instead, come prepared with concrete suggestions. Identify speciﬁc

## stakeholders, meetings, presentations, or company communications

where your boss could advocate for your work. They’re more likely to

say “yes” because you’ve done the thinking for them — and it also shows

## your understanding of the organization’s politics.

When Emily approached her manager, she pitched an idea: “What if you

gave us a shoutout in the next all-hands meeting or in the company

newsletter? I believe a mention from you would really highlight the

importance of our work — especially since AI is a key focus area now —

and would solidify my role as the group’s leader.”

Give your boss a spiel

By providing your boss with ready-made language they can share, you

remove barriers to action and control the narrative, ensuring that your

eﬀorts are presented in the way you want them to be. For example, you

might give your manager:

- Concise talking points about your project that they can easily

## incorporate into conversations or presentations

- A brief, polished script they could use to introduce you at company

# events or meetings

- Customizable email templates for connecting you with diﬀerent

stakeholders or promoting your work

- A set of frequently asked questions with clear, concise answers to help

them ﬁeld objections or defend your ideas to senior leadership

- Pre-written social media posts they can share on professional networks

to highlight the progress or impact of your work

# Implement a weekly win routine

Once a week or twice a month, send a brief, bulleted email to your

boss highlighting your team’s achievements, challenges overcome, and

upcoming milestones. By doing so, you’re handing them a neatly

packaged “cheat sheet” of information they can use to impress their

boss and peers. It’s a win-win: your manager appears on top of things —

and your hard work gets the spotlight it deserves.

This simple routine also gets you into the habit of articulating and

documenting your achievements which is a powerful way of boosting

your conﬁdence. Plus, come time for your performance review, you’ll

have concrete examples at your ﬁngertips and won’t have to scramble

for data to make a case for resources or advancement.

# Leverage reciprocity

The psychological principle of reciprocity says that when someone does

something for us, we feel naturally inclined to return the favor. So,

look for opportunities to highlight your boss’s leadership, priorities,

strengths, and successes. By showing that you value and promote

their work, you make it more likely they’ll do the same for you. This

isn’t meant to be a quid pro quo, but rather about managing up in a

supportive way that builds trust and goodwill.

Sincerity is key. Don’t force praise where it doesn’t ﬁt naturally. Just

be on the lookout for little moments to acknowledge your boss’s ideas

and contributions. This could be as simple as sending a quick note

to thank them for their guidance on how to deliver tough feedback

to an employee or being an active participant when they’re leading a

# workshop.

Remember, your success at work goes beyond doing a great job. It relies

on making sure your value is seen, understood, and appreciated. By

taking the initiative to ask for and enable advocacy from your boss,

you’re taking control of your professional narrative.
