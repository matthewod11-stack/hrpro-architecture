Pirates have kidnapped six crew members off a ship operating in the

Gulf of Guinea, near the west coast of Africa. The corporate owner of

the vessel and employer of the victims has called me in from England

to help negotiate their release. My ﬁrst step is to calm everyone down.

We can’t navigate this situation from a place of agitation and high stress.

My second is to choose someone from the corporate crisis team whom

I trust to interact with the bad guys—a person who can communicate

in the right language and dialect, who seems emotionally stable and

resilient, and who, most important, will be able to listen to and connect

with the people holding his colleagues. I quickly decide on John.

Over several weeks he and I sit side-by-side in a corporate oﬃce, 16

hours a day, with a mobile phone in front of us on the table. Of course,

we take breaks to sleep and eat, especially when we’re not expecting a

call. But our focus is on that phone. And when the kidnappers do reach

out, or we’re told to make contact, we turn our attention fully to it.

They initially demand $5 million in ransom. I know from experience

and training that if we agree to pay it immediately, they’ll ask for more;

or they’ll take it and then hit another of the company’s ships next week.

So with my coaching, John begins communicating with the kidnappers.

“That is a lot of money, which we don’t have. We need time to see how

much we can raise. Let’s speak again in two days.”

Later, “You seem upset that we can’t move faster, but I assure you we are

trying our best. Please look after the hostages.”

Later, “OK, let me make sure I’m understanding you. If we deliver

the cash as agreed, you promise to release and return the hostages

unharmed? And no further demands or delays?”

Our aim is not just to stall for time but also to build rapport and trust

with the other side. This is critical to success in high-stakes situations.

## With open-minded, curious, and nonjudgmental conversation, John

can ascertain what the kidnappers’ real needs are, beyond their surface-

level demands, in order to end this crisis. Those needs include respect

and a sense of control along with reassurance that they won’t be

ambushed, arrested, or killed during the handover of the ransom.

Eventually, because he has kept his own ego in check, refrained from

hostility, and demonstrated empathy and deep listening, John earns

their conﬁdence, and with it the right to inﬂuence them and seek

cooperation. So they believe him when he says the company can pay

only $300,000 and not a dollar more. The deal is struck, the hostages are

safely returned, and no repeat attacks occur.

Over a decades-long career as a kidnapping and extortion negotiator,

I handled many similarly sensitive cases all over the world. If I

wasn’t helping secure the release of hostages in Africa, Latin America,

or the Middle East, I was confronting extortionist cyberattackers

in the United States, Europe, or Asia. Through my experiences,

observations, and conversations with other experts in the ﬁeld, I’ve

developed a deep understanding of what works and what doesn’t in

## high-stakes negotiations. More recently, as an adviser to executives and

corporations, I’ve learned that the same rules can be applied to yield

better outcomes in everyday business negotiations—whether you’re

asking for a higher salary, lobbying for additional team resources, or

hammering out the details of a contract with a client or a supplier.

No matter the situation, negotiators must remember one golden rule:

It’s not about you. The only way to move someone else in your direction

and ﬁnd a solution on which you can agree is to listen deeply and

empathetically, ensuring that the other person feels seen, heard, and

understood. That is particularly powerful when the two sides are in

disagreement. It allows you to build trust, manage expectations, and

ﬁnd ways to meet the other party’s key needs. It’s what I call level-ﬁve listening, and it is fundamental to eﬀective negotiation.

As Ernest Hemingway once said, “When people talk, listen completely.

Most people never listen.” Negotiators who do set themselves apart.

But it takes discipline of mind and body to accomplish, particularly

when emotions are running high. The right mindset and a tool kit of

techniques can help.

# The Level-Five Mindset

Many people listen only long enough to get the gist of what the other

side is saying before they begin formulating a reaction or tune out to

check a text or wrestle with another issue in their heads. This level-one

listening might be described as “intermittent listening,” and it won’t

help you understand your counterpart well enough to yield a successful

outcome. It’s also disrespectful.

Level-two listening involves doing so only to rebut. You pay attention to

the incoming message until it hits a trigger, at which point you jump in

to argue a point. Such an interjection undermines communication and

rapport, because you’re clearly focusing on your agenda at the expense

# of your counterpart’s.

In level-three listening you’re looking for logic: using inference to pin

down the substance of and reasons for what the other person is saying.

This is an improvement, because you’re trying to understand that

person’s argument, but since it’s happening only in your head, it’s not

enough. The goal is to shift your full attention to your counterpart and

# gather more information.

That happens with level-four listening, when you begin to tune in to

the emotions as well as the logic behind the other person’s position

and respond in ways that show you’re aware of them. You also begin to

prompt more dialogue with a comment such as “It sounds like you’re frustrated with our counteroﬀer” or “You seem passionate about this

proposal.”

Level ﬁve takes that empathetic curiosity a step further. Now you’re

listening to better understand and interpret your counterpart’s self-

perception and perspective. That allows you to ask questions that

promote discovery and insight on both sides and establish rapport

so that you can begin to exert inﬂuence and achieve cooperation or

collaboration, which should be the outcome of all negotiations.

Some call this “active listening,” a term coined by the psychologist Carl

Rogers and his colleague Richard Farson to describe a process whereby

we “get inside” the minds of our counterparts and truly grasp what

they’re communicating. “More than that,” the two wrote in their 1957

book Active Listening, “we must convey to the speaker that we are

seeing things from his point of view.”

# Tools of the Trade

But how, exactly, can you prove to negotiating partners that you’re

paying this level of attention to their logic, emotions, perspective,

and, ultimately, wants and needs so that they begin to see you as

a collaborator rather than an adversary? In my world we use the

mnemonic MORE PIES to remember the techniques for both ensuring

and demonstrating level-ﬁve listening. This is not a box-ticking exercise

but a way to train your focus so that you’re better able to understand and

empathize with your counterpart.

## Minimal encouragers, very short and simple vocal prompts such as

## “And?” “Really?” “Then?” “Mmm,” “Uh huh,” “Go on,” and “Interesting,”

are important ways to show that you are and remain tuned in to your

counterpart, particularly when you’re on the phone or the other person

has been speaking for a while. The aim is to encourage the other

person to keep talking and feel understood. Pace your interjections at

a reasonable rate (for example, one encourager for every few sentences),

and if it’s an in-person conversation, ensure that your facial expression

and body language match your tone of voice, whether it’s inquisitive,

neutral, or agreeable. Don’t get distracted and throw in a misplaced

## encourager or overuse words like “Great” and “OK,” because they

suggest that you understand or agree and can thus bring the person

# to a stop.

Open questions encourage people to speak freely and to share their

side of the story, thus revealing more about what’s important (or not) to

them, the lines they can’t or won’t cross, and areas where compromise

might be possible. They help you buy time, gather data, clear up

misunderstandings, and defuse emotions, because they force others to

really consider their answers and potential solutions, rather than give a

knee-jerk yes or no to an idea or unthinkingly choose between options

you’ve presented.

Good open questions start with “What” or “How”—for example, “What is the real issue?” “How will this aﬀect [the party or situation involved]?”

“What has to happen for you to [desired action]?” “What other options

do we have?” Avoid questions that begin with “Why,” because they can

sound accusatory and judgmental. For example, with a client who is

threatening to switch service providers, instead of asking, “Why do you want to leave?” consider “What are they oﬀering that we don’t?” or

“What could we do to make you stay?”

Keep it simple and focused on one topic at a time. Avoid jargon and

abstract words or ideas. And then, after you’ve asked your question, stay

quiet and give the person time to fully answer. Try also to encourage

an exchange of questions, rather than letting it feel like a one-sided

# interview.

I should note that closed questions, designed to elicit a yes or a no,

can be helpful too, particularly when you need speciﬁc information—for example, “Do you have another oﬀer on the table?” But too many of

them can sound like an interrogation. Leading questions—for example,

“Which of our competitors is trying to poach you?”—should be avoided

when possible, because they give the impression that you’re making

assumptions, judging, or rushing to an answer.

Reﬂecting back, or mirroring the last few words or key phrases used

by your counterparts, is another way to demonstrate that you’ve

heard them, keep them talking, and create rapport. In heated, fast-

paced negotiations, it can also give you time to calm your emotions

and formulate appropriate responses or open questions. Imagine a

cyberattacker threatening to unleash a virus unless he’s paid by

midnight (“A virus?”) or a supplier yelling at you that your company

should pay its bills faster (“Faster?”).

By carefully choosing which words to mirror, you can also steer the

conversation in the direction you’d like. For example, imagine that

you’re lobbying your boss to add another full-time employee to your

team, and he tells you there’s no room in the budget this ﬁscal year.

“Room in the budget?” would be a reﬂecting response that might

prompt him to elaborate and provide both of you with an opportunity to

# discuss other options.

Of course, the other person may misinterpret your repetition as a

challenge. But as an easy way to encourage elaboration, reﬂecting

should be part of your tool kit.

Emotional labeling is a way to help your counterparts rein in their

feelings (along with their actions and biases or entrenched opinions),

thus preserving their ability to think objectively and rationally. In my ﬁeld we call this “name it to tame it.” It involves oﬀering a

nonjudgmental observation about the emotions you think other people

are experiencing, the problems they’re facing, the way they’re acting, or

the views they have in a way that allows them to agree or disagree with

you. For example, “It feels like you’re annoyed with me,” or “It sounds

like the money is important to you.” (Other phrase starters include “It

seems like…,” “I sense that you…,” and “I get the impression that….”)

Even if you label the emotion, behavior, or view incorrectly, you’re

indicating that you’re paying attention and want to better understand

## your counterpart. Every shift in tone, body language, or argument

content is another opportunity to acknowledge what the person is going

# through.

Paraphrasing involves translating your understanding of what the other

person has said into your own words to ensure that you’re on the

same page. Focus on content rather than trying to use the exact same

language (that’s summarizing, which I’ll discuss shortly). Ways to start

include “So it seems like what you’re saying is…,” “Can I share with you

where I think you’re at with this?” and “What I’m hearing here is….”

In a kidnapping, paraphrasing would always be used in response to

ransom demands to ensure that there are no misunderstandings. It

has the same use in business settings. Just make sure to give others a chance to clarify or amend what you’ve oﬀered back to them by saying

something like “Correct me if I’m wrong here…” or “Do I have that

right?”

Most often you will wait for a pause in your counterpart’s speech to

insert your paraphrase. This can be another way to stall for time if

you’re unsure about where to take the conversation next, but it is

also one of those rare moments when it’s OK to interrupt to enhance

# understanding.

“I” statements allow you to explain how the situation or negotiation is aﬀecting you and encourage your counterpart toward change without

directing blame. Include three elements: behavior or situation (describe

what the person has done or what has happened); feeling (how it aﬀects

you); and consequences (what the result was). For example, you might

say, “When you dismissed my proposal immediately, I felt frustrated, because it seems like you don’t value what I have to oﬀer.” While

such messages aren’t confrontational, they do ﬂag misalignments and

potential negotiation derailers that will need focus, attention, and care.

Effective pauses give your counterparts space to collect their thoughts,

keep talking, or even vent in ways that can be informative for you.

All you need to do is refrain from responding after they seem to have

ﬁnished speaking until the pause begins to feel slightly uncomfortable,

and then hold it for a few seconds more. I’ve seen this used to great eﬀect when police oﬃcers interview suspects, witnesses, or victims,

because most people feel compelled to ﬁll the silence. Inexperienced

communicators often ﬁnd themselves jumping in. If you are one, try to

resist. To this day I keep a stress ball with the letters W.A.I.T. on my

desk; it stands for both “wait” and “Why am I talking?”

Summarizing, like paraphrasing, involves oﬀering your understanding of what someone has just said, but the diﬀerence is that you repeat

that person’s words rather than using your own, to help them see

their argument more clearly and build trust. This technique is best

used when your counterpart has delivered a lot of information or a

long, rambling narrative. You’re adding value by condensing it into a

manageable chunk and highlighting the key points. For example, to

the boss resisting your plea to expand your team, you might say, “If I

understand you correctly, you don’t have the budget in this ﬁscal year,

but a small personnel allocation might open up in the next cycle. So I

should write you a memo proposing a job description for a potential new

hire. Is that a fair summary?” This gives the boss a chance to correct

# you.

# From Rapport to Request

When you use these techniques to become a level-ﬁve listener, you

boost your capacity for empathy, your ability to ﬁnd common ground,

and your chances of gaining your counterpart’s cooperation. As the

## forensic psychologist and University of Liverpool professor Laurence

Alison explains in his book Rapport (written with Emily Alison), “When

we are able to extract someone’s core beliefs and values, we often

ﬁnd that they are more similar to ours than we imagine.” He adds

that even if they’re not, “we don’t have to agree but we should seek

to understand.” Alison recommends that negotiators hold themselves

accountable by asking themselves four questions: Am I being honest

or trying to manipulate the other person? Am I being empathetic and

seeing things from that person’s perspective or just concentrating on my

own point of view? Am I respecting and reinforcing people’s autonomy

and right to choose, or am I trying to force them to do what I want? Am

I listening carefully and reﬂecting to show a deeper understanding and

build intimacy and connection?

Ultimately, the most eﬀective among us eventually move beyond

## empathetic listening and the other elements of rapport building

to constructive assertions and requests. When you have done the

work to fully, unemotionally, and nonjudgmentally understand your

counterpart’s needs, interests, and perspectives—and to ensure that the

person knows and trusts that you’ve done so—you earn the right to state

your own needs, interests, and perspectives; make speciﬁc requests; and

# suggest solutions.

That’s what I helped John do with the kidnappers, and what I now do

ﬁve listening and more pies, they felt more comfortable negotiating and

were better able to achieve deals that worked for both parties. In another

case, this mindset and tool kit helped the head of a small banking and

investment company that had recently been acquired by a larger one to navigate discussions around layoﬀs and exit packages with his new colleagues and aﬀected employees.

Successful negotiation starts with managing your own emotions. But

that’s where your self-focus should stop. The rest is all about your

counterparts. Listen well and show them you’re doing so. That’s how

you build trust and ultimately ﬁnd mutually agreeable solutions.

# Barriers to Effective Listening

Advising: You jump in too quickly with solutions.

Analysis paralysis: You continue to gather information instead of moving

# to potential solutions.

Assumptions: You go in with strong opinions but few facts.

Avoidance: You shut down at any sign of tension.

Derailing: You abruptly change subjects.

Dreaming: You half listen to your counterpart.

Experience: You assume you understand the situation because you’ve

been in a similar one previously or have dealt with your counterpart before.

Filtering: You listen to some things and not to others.

Identifying: You link everything the other person says to your own

# experience.

Judging: You quickly form closed opinions of the situation and your

counterpart based on how you see things.

Mind reading: You try to guess what the other person is thinking and

feeling rather than simply listening.

Placating: You go through the motions of empathetic listening.

Position: You don’t feel that you and your counterpart are on equal footing.

Presentation: You put your own slant on everything.

Rehearsing: You focus on what you want to say next rather than what

you’re hearing.

Stress: You’re too distracted to listen effectively.
