“I have never felt so seen.”

This feedback — which I have received repeatedly since the publication

of my book, The Anxious Achiever, last year — makes me feel grateful. It

also makes me angry.

Every day, my inbox is ﬁlled with stories that would make your eyes

burn. I recently conducted an informal poll on LinkedIn in which 87%

of 1,228 respondents reported that a stressful coworker, client, boss, or

work situation was the catalyst for negative physical symptoms such as

## migraines, nausea, hair loss, sleep loss, weight changes, autoimmune

# outbreaks, and panic attacks.

And it’s not just my community. Headspace’s 2024 Workplace State of

Mind study found that work stress has negatively impacted physical

## health for 77% of employees and relationships outside of work for

71%. A March 2022 Gallup analysis found that fewer than one in

four employees felt their organization cared about their well-being —

nearly half the number who said the same at the start of the Covid-19

# pandemic.

What happened? While beneﬁts and conversations around mental

health have changed, workplace cultures haven’t caught up. Workplace

mental health expert Natasha Bowman also shared that while a high

level of empathy and compassion emerged during the pandemic, she’s

seeing a shift back to pre-pandemic habits, including rollbacks of DEI

and well-being initiatives. People are not responding well. “Today,

workers demand more than just a paycheck — they demand respect

for their mental health needs. It’s not just about ticking oﬀ boxes, it’s

about creating a culture where employees feel empowered to prioritize

self-care without fear of repercussions,” said Bowman.

I couldn’t agree more. To address this critical moment for companies

and employees, I wanted to share my state of workplace mental

health — culled from what I’ve learned from wise colleagues and from

## hundreds of keynotes and conversations on workplace mental health

## since the launch of my book — as a path forward.

# Start with the Work

Today, improving workplace mental health involves tackling how, why,

and where we work. Pat advice on putting your phone away in the

evening or scheduling your emails feels so 2020.

So, get speciﬁc and focus on the work product you need and how you

can better support the employees involved. For example, imagine a

## large hospital system: The workplace mental health considerations of

ER clinicians are going to be very diﬀerent from those of the billing

department because their work product is totally diﬀerent. Advice from

ﬂexible workplace expert Cali Yost should be the cornerstone of any

well-being initiative: When you start with what needs to get done, Yost

says, teams can “reimagine how, when, and where work is done to

perform eﬀectively as an organization, and help people be their best

as well.” Consider new research from JAMA, which ﬁnds that greater

job ﬂexibility is associated with decreased odds of serious psychological

## distress and lower odds of weekly anxiety.

## Like return-to-work mandates, blanket policies for employee mental

health rarely succeed and aren’t realistic given the varied ways we work

today. Jim Mortensen, president of R3 Continuum, a leading workplace

behavioral health provider, says: “Just as a general practitioner can’t

handle every physical medical issue that an individual has, a single

behavioral health solution won’t address all the problems that an

employee base has. You have to both recognize the diversity of issues

within a company and also understand the speciﬁc stressors of that

organization, because they do diﬀer. If you aren’t tailoring the solutions

to the problems that people are experiencing, you won’t get the results

you need.”

## Don’t Rely on Outsiders to Drive Behavior Change

Too often, companies rely on outside experts or a designated well-being

consultant without also engaging internal champions who are managers

and leaders in business units. Or, a company conﬁnes the work to

human resources or an internal wellness team. Either way, if you’re

asking teams to change how they work to achieve better mental health

outcomes, you need buy-in from day-to-day decision-makers within

# business units.

Newton Cheng is an example of one of these decision-makers. He

is a former engineer who serves as Google’s director of health and

performance, and he is one of the most powerful advocates I’ve seen

for improving mental well-being in large, complicated organizations.

Cheng is both public about his own mental health issues — which

helps him connect to the wider employee base — while also working

to change a large system, navigate red tape, and meet business goals.

In a conversation I had with him, Cheng reﬂected on why his mental

health workshops around Google are successful: “I’m sitting in the

same shared stigma they are. I’m modeling what it looks like to lead

vulnerably in the same organization they are. It gets really hard to do

anything about mental health until you see someone who’s doing it

right in front of you.”

Don’t get me wrong, outside clinicians and practitioners help leaders

develop crucial mental health literacy and learn to talk about and model

healthy practices. But experts don’t get it like managers do. And yet

Newton is the ﬁrst to admit that becoming this leader took time and

a lot of trial and error, plus a comfort with risk. Organizations that

want to create mentally healthy cultures need to recruit well-respected,

successful insiders who are willing to step out and take the lead. Others

will follow!

## Foster Conversations Across Generations and Genders

There are two elephants in the room that need to be addressed. First,

every generation at work struggles with their mental health; it’s not just

young people who want to talk about their feelings. Second, men want

to share their emotions at work but might feel more stigma than women.

How can workplaces tackle these biases?

To start, increase mental health literacy across the organization. When

there’s no shared language or baseline of knowledge, biases and stigma

ﬂourish. Younger people may talk more openly about mental health

simply because they grew up talking more about it than previous

generations, though overusing and misusing terms (e.g., “OMG I had

a total panic attack”) can make comments easier to diminish and ignore.

Invest in training for everyone to learn the mental health basics.

It’s also crucial to make sure men are visible and talking. If your mental

health programs skew too female, invite men in! I joke that having

“manvangelists” talk about mental health is crucial to decoding the

# gender bias of emotions at work.

Finally, give generations their own spaces to share: Mental health is an

inclusive conversation but it can be helpful to oﬀer people who share

lived experiences — generationally or otherwise — the space to connect.

## Be Patient and Prepare to Invest in What Matters

There’s no magic app to make people happier at work. Becoming a

more mentally healthy organization is a commitment to change the

fundamentals, and it starts with leadership. Psychologist Emily Anhalt

says organizations must embrace this reality: “This will not be a quick

and easy thing. This is a forever journey that you have to decide is worth

your while.”

There are two key aspects of this journey that I’ve come to see as most

# important.

First, recognize that technology will not ﬁx our mental health issues;

technology is part of the problem. Every conversation I have includes

feelings of utter hopelessness that we have lost the battle with our

phones and attention spans. The hyper-responsive cycle of always

being online exacerbates anxiety at work. We need strategies to address

mental health that acknowledge the outsized role technology plays in

our work lives and the damage it does to our mental health.

Second, consider that work is about people, and people are messy and diﬃcult. “Pretty much every mental health struggle a person is having,

at its core is a struggle of relationships, Anhalt notes. “Companies have

to be willing to get in there and help people actually feel met and heard

and seen and connected.” Here’s the wonderful thing: When employers

invest time, curiosity, and thoughtful strategy as they develop mental

health programs, people do feel met and heard and seen and connected.

It’s a win!

In the end, Anhalt recommends that leaders who care about mental

well-being need to invest in the long game and build trust with employees over time. This approach is diﬃcult to justify for businesses

beholden to short-termism and shareholder pressure, but there is

growing interest in the ﬁeld of human sustainability and models like

## the U.S. Surgeon General’s Framework for Workplace Mental Health and

Wellbeing. These give me hope and feel like the mindset shifts we need.

Whether any of these ideas will gain “juice” inside companies remains

TBD.

# Walk the Talk

Mental health is core to everything we do at work. Protecting it will take

# all of us.

No matter what level you are in your company, if you’re passionate

about mental health, be persistent. Anhalt notes that the reason why

there are more mental health beneﬁts now is that enough people said,

“I’m not going to work here if that’s not part of it.”

Those of us in the workplace mental health ﬁeld look forward to the

day when we don’t have to try so hard to convince organizations

to invest in this work. “What is keeping me up at night is that we

are currently in a state of ‘pushing’ our trauma-informed corporate

transformation work with companies and leaders,” says Susan Schmitt

Winchester, former CHRO at Applied Materials and author of Healing

at Work. “My dream is that in the future, leaders are ‘pulling’ for our

work because they deeply understand the connection between leader

and employee well-being to everything they care about — culture,

## performance, productivity, employee experience, etc.”

Leaders also need to “do the work” of getting in touch with how their

own emotions color their work lives. And they carry immense power

to destigmatize mental health conversations by sharing what they

are doing to preserve their mental health and how those actions are

impacting them.

Magic in service of workplace mental health can happen at all levels of

## an organization and some of the simplest, human-centered tactics can

be incredibly powerful. Have a candid conversation with a coworker.

Find strength in numbers by asking for policy change with colleagues.

Be the team leader who reaches out to encourage a more reasonable

sign-oﬀ time after seeing midnight email timestamps from your staﬀ. Be

the CEO or VP who shares a personal story so others who struggle can

feel seen.

One thing I am reminded of time and again is that being anxious and

being an achiever are not mutually exclusive. We all have issues to work

through because we’re human. But we can thrive at work when our

needs get the air time and support they need and deserve.
