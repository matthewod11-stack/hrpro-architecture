Getting Over Overwork We know it’s bad for us. Here’s why we can’t stop doing it—and what might help. by Gretchen Gavett

It’s 1 PM on a beautiful Saturday afternoon. A few months back

you told your editor you would write an essay on overwork for an

upcoming issue of the magazine at which you’re employed. However,

you’ve been slammed with other assignments and projects and are

## preparing, physically and mentally, for a medical procedure and time

oﬀ to recover. The clock is ticking, and your draft is on the verge of

being late.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Getting Over Overwork

Do you interrupt your weekend to write the essay or wait and do it on

Monday? And does your decision—and rumination about it—determine

whether you’ve got a problem with overwork?

Disclosure: It’s me. I’m the person who is torn about how to spend my

day oﬀ. But I suspect that I’m not alone. As an American who was raised

to value head-down hard work, I know I’ve been consumed by tasks at

all hours of the day and night. But over the years I’ve also developed

hobbies that I prioritize, and my editor explicitly told me not to write

# this essay over the weekend.

Too often our attitudes and behaviors about work are dichotomized:

Either we’re overcommitted to our jobs or we’re quiet quitting or quiet

vacationing or whatever the phrase of the moment is. I suspect it’s more

nuanced, however, and ﬁnding the right balance involves more than

willpower. Four new books provide evidence of this.

## Over Work: Transforming the Daily Grind in the Quest for a Better

Life, by Brigid Schulte of Better Life Lab, starts by detailing how its titular aﬄiction causes chronic stress, high blood pressure, and more,

## especially for people with precarious, unpredictable work schedules.

She notes, however, that most of us don’t stop, because “just the thought

of losing one’s job [also] creates stress,” and our employers might not be

interested in changing the status quo. As one interviewee, Stanford’s

Jeﬀrey Pfeﬀer, explains, “You have a system that ’s running along.

There’s enormous amounts of inertia. And…to overcome inertia, you

need a force that is larger than the inertia.”

You know what isn’t larger than inertia? “Lunchtime yoga, a

## mindfulness app, a basket of healthy snacks, or a sympathetic

employee assistance program,” Schulte writes, “[r]ather than, say, hir[ing] suﬃcient staﬀ to manage the workload, pay[ing] them well, and

streamlin[ing] processes to focus on getting the most important work done rather than the hours spent at the oﬃce or worksite.”

Some organizations do try to do those things, of course, but they’ve had

mixed success; Schulte oﬀers the sobering case study of a pilot program

at Intel that was successful but nevertheless no longer exists.

If this is what we’re up against, layer on top of it a second theme: the

role that upbringing plays in how we value and engage in work. Jennifer

## Romolini’s page-turner Ambition Monster: A Memoir, will resonate with

those of us from less-than-privileged backgrounds who came of age

during the “girlboss” era of the 2000s and early 2010s. She recounts how

messages about the importance of professional success wormed their

way into her brain and her career: “I am told, again and again, that

a good work ethic is the highest form of exaltation, and that working

hard is what makes you worthy; it keeps you safe. My nuclear family

occasionally went to church, but we had no religion. We prayed to the

God of work.”

She enters the worlds of New York City and Los Angeles media and

## ascends in rank and responsibility to the detriment of her well-being

and relationships, only to be unceremoniously ﬁred at age 45. “I was

in new and unfamiliar territory now,” she writes. “I had to relearn how

to be.”

If that sounds philosophical, it’s for a good reason: Work isn’t simply

something we do; it’s something that matters to us and to society. No

wonder overwork tendencies are hard to shake.

The cultural anthropologist Claudia Strauss digs into this phenomenon

## in her book What Work Means: Beyond the Puritan Work Ethic. More

## academic than Schulte’s and Romolini’s books, but in many ways more

intricate, it includes both theory and conversations with people of

varying racial backgrounds and economic classes who were laid oﬀ

during the Great Recession. The way Strauss frames “work centrality”

in our lives is instructive, particularly when her interviewees try to

make sense of their jobless selves. She explores the diﬀerences between

those of us who live to work and those who have a 9-to-5 mentality and

points out that “these two productivist work ethics may not be ﬁxed

orientations.” We learn and change according to our experiences, and “it

is also possible for social and cultural values to change.”

There’s a lot I’d love to see change about overwork, but one big thing

has stuck in my mind as I’ve navigated some health challenges over

the past year. In her book The Rest Revolution: How to Reclaim Your

Rhythm and Conquer Burnout When Overworking Has Become the Norm,

the executive coach Amanda Miller Littlejohn has a wonderful chapter

on what happens when we “repeatedly skip winter,” which is “the act

of not taking periodic breaks and getting rest after regular periods of

working.” We fear these breaks, thinking, “I can’t…disappear or else I’ll

be forgotten” or “I can’t aﬀord to be invisible.” But they’re vital and

should be embraced without consequence.

## Laura Morgan Roberts’s 2023 HBR.org article “Where Does DEI Go from

Here?” has a version of this, which she describes as “the freedom to

## fade”: “In a dominant culture of hustle and perfectionism, employees

need a way to take a break from the performance pressure.” Indeed, why

can’t we oﬀer people the time and space to step back for a bit so that

when they’re ready and able to shine, they can do so brightly?

I ultimately decided to wait until Monday morning to write this. On

Saturday I exercised, watched sports on TV, and spent time with my

family and my cats. I probably would not have made that decision at a

job I held a decade or so ago, and I credit a supportive work environment

and a keener sense of what I value—and under what conditions I can do

# my best work—for this decision.

I’m not always as disciplined, however, and I know that the hardest

thing to tame is how I’ve thought about work since I was a young child.

I still worry that I’ll be punished for taking a deep breath and a pause,

and that not pushing through will signal a moral failing—or worse, that

I’m not of use. But as Littlejohn writes, “it’s hard to bloom year-round.”

So here I am, on a weekday morning, taking that risk.
