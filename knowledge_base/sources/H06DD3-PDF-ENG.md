Over the many decades my company has been studying the link between

people practices and performance, we’ve seen a common trait among low-

performing, non-agile, slow-to-change companies: talent hoarding. This is

the practice of allowing managers to keep their top performers from

moving anywhere else in the company.

Of course, it’s human nature to want to hang on to the superstars in your

group, department, or division. But ultimately, that’s detrimental to the

organization, and to the individuals involved. Multiple studies on talent

mobility show that actively moving employees into different roles is one of

## the most underutilized, yet most effective, development and cultural

enhancement techniques in companies today. In fact, research conducted

by our colleagues at i4cp revealed that high-performance organizations (as

measured by revenue growth, proﬁtability, market share, and customer

satisfaction) are twice as likely to emphasize talent mobility versus low-

# performance companies.

Building a culture of mobility is a trait of very healthy organizations, and

the beneﬁts are clear: Cross-functional collaboration increases,

departmental cooperation is enhanced, innovation improves, and

companies begin working more as one cohesive team instead of separate

# ﬁefdoms.

Despite the beneﬁts, too few companies place a priority on moving talent

or have a formal talent mobility program in place. As companies emerge

from the pandemic, this will be critical to retaining top performers and

upskilling the workforce to be more agile in the future.

# How Companies Perpetuate Immobility

Talent mobility is not merely moving people from one department to

another. Top organizations view the practice as the ability to identify,

develop, and deploy talent to meet the needs of the business. During the

pandemic, “meeting the needs of the business” took on new meaning, and

the companies that embraced talent mobility — such as 3M, which quickly

redeployed resources to manufacture and distribute PPE (personal

protective equipment) — did just ﬁne in 2020. The ability to deploy

needed skill sets rapidly and strategically, to staff at a minute’s notice, to

accommodate for the unexpected — these are all traits that deﬁne

organizations that thrive during times that require great agility.

While talent mobility is often pictured as promotions for high performers,

in practice it can cover a lot of movement types. It might mean moving

someone laterally to another business group or division. Or a subsidiary.

Or another geography. Or even to another company for a while. It might

even mean having someone transition down so they can eventually

transition up. All of this helps with recruiting and retention. An abundance

of new career opportunities is a trait that both attracts and retains top

talent in any organization and should be appealing to any manager of

# people.

But should be appealing is the elephant in the room. The main impediment

to talent mobility is almost always the manager. Our research found that

half of companies (and 74% of low performers) reported that managers’

failure to encourage movement was their top obstacle to mobility.

Managers are so careful to hold on to the stars on their teams that they

often play games to keep them. We’ve probably all heard stories about

managers who intentionally keep their top performers in the shadows so

no one discovers them.

It’s hard to blame them for that. In fact, most companies incentivize them

to do that. When managers are having success in metrics the organization

recognizes and rewards — typically pure business metrics — they want to

keep the talent that made them successful. If you’ve ever managed people,

you are likely guilty of this.

# Creating a Culture of Mobility

Give managers incentives. The ﬁrst key to changing this dynamic is to

reevaluate how an organization recognizes and rewards its managers. In a

select percentage of some of the best companies in the world, it’s

understood that to consistently rotate talent — especially high-potential

talent — they need to build it into a manager’s performance objectives and

make this part of the performance review process. These organizations

often loudly provide internal recognition and compensate managers for

their ability to both develop people and provide them opportunities for

further development. In short, they build a culture where mobility is

expected, and an environment that relies on this movement.

When this occurs, a funny thing happens to those former hoarders: they

become talent magnets. Everyone wants to go work for the person who

has a reputation of advancing employees’ careers.

Reduce bureaucracy and stigma. Another impediment is the

bureaucracy companies often create to ﬁll an open position from the

inside. Managers would rather search externally because the hiring

process is usually much (much!) easier and avoids conﬂict. “Poaching”

talent internally is often frowned upon in many organizations, and we

make hiring managers go through signiﬁcantly more steps if they want to

bring an internal employee into their group or department instead of

hiring someone from the outside.

From the employee’s perspective, it’s the same phenomenon. Outside

opportunities don’t come with managerial rules of engagement. There is

very little stigma attached to looking at roles externally, whereas doing so

internally can come at a great political price. “I’m a dead man walking” is

a comment I’ve heard from several friends when it was discovered that

they applied for another role internally. Employees aren’t locked into a

salary band or job level when they search externally, but that often still

applies internally. And ﬁnally, when looking externally, they can free

themselves of any labels that have been applied to their role, rank,

compensation, department, etc., which often hinder internal movement.

To combat this, progressive companies are taking a talent ecosystem

approach internally and are staffing projects based on matching the best

## skills to the work at hand, versus proximity or even where someone

resides in the hierarchy. They key to this is cataloging the skills and

capabilities of the workforce to be more agile and ﬁll positions from the

inside. Often, the best person for an open role is already in the

organization, but lack of data on the workforce keeps hiring managers

from discovering them. An active talent ecosystem makes it acceptable to

have employees frequently moving in the organization and reduces the

perception of poaching or the stigma of applying for open roles internally.

Think of talent mobility as a lattice, not a ladder. In the former,

employees are encouraged to move across the organization to stretch their

## capabilities under the management of key decision-makers. Our research

shows that supporting lateral mobility and encouraging relocation

assignments have a strong correlation to market performance. So does

transparency about the process. High-performance organizations are four

and a half times more likely to make the criterion for talent mobility clear

# to the workforce.

Celebrating lateral movement also addresses one of the risks associated

with mobility — hitting a glass ceiling. When companies only view

mobility in terms of upward movement, it’s important to have positions

available. If organizations lack positions to move people into or have

limited opportunities for upward mobility, they often leave employees

feeling stuck. We found that 39% of employers cited lack of positions to

# move into as an obstacle to mobility.

Crisscrossing the organization as a lattice can also create a more inclusive

culture and improve diversity. Cliques and insider versus outsider feelings

are minimized when movement is plentiful. It also helps retain diverse

talent who might otherwise get discouraged about slow-to-open senior

roles if mobility is only viewed as upward.

Get comfortable with change. One last reason talent mobility often

doesn’t take hold: it requires frequent change. While most companies

discovered the importance of agility during the pandemic, top companies

have always recognized its importance. If employees describe change as

overwhelming, wearing them down, or destabilizing to what they do

normally, it’s likely they are working within a low-performance

organization. Employees at top-performing companies are not only more

likely to say change is normal and in fact part of the business model, but

they usually describe it as an opportunity. Several of these organizations

even induce change on a regular basis under the theory that consistent

change actually boosts productivity.

An active culture of talent mobility can help minimize complacency and

create an environment of healthy change — and with it an agile

environment that can handle the unexpected. If you are interested in

improving agility, it’s time to include some healthy internal mobility and

create more talent magnets throughout your organization.
