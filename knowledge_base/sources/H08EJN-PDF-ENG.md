A client of mine, Rudi, works in marketing for a technology ﬁrm. His

team had a goal to increase inbound leads via social media. Rudi, his

boss, and some of their colleagues had a long brainstorming session,

eventually reaching the conclusion they should be shooting more short-

# form videos to share on social channels.

Rudi worked all week on a project plan for how their team could create

and share more videos. The stakeholders were identiﬁed, the metrics

were deﬁned, and the aggressive publication timeline his boss wanted

was laid out. He was excited to dive in.

That Friday, he walked into his one-on-one eager to share the project

# plan with his boss.

“Huh,” his boss huﬀed, after taking a passive glance at a very thorough

deck. “I wonder if we should be going in a diﬀerent direction. Did

you see what our competitors put out yesterday? Maybe we should try

inﬂuencer marketing instead of making our own stuﬀ. Can you look into

it?”

“Sure,” Rudi replied, defeated.

Internally, Rudi was shrieking. At the start of the week, his boss was

gung-ho about the team creating their own videos, and now, because of

## a stupid inﬂuencer TikTok from their competitor, the time Rudi spent

making the project plan was a total waste.

And this wasn’t the ﬁrst time Rudi’s boss had a seemingly random

change of heart. It happened with the SEO overhaul project. It

happened with the “Let’s get interns this summer!” idea. From design,

to copy, to budget allocation, Rudi’s boss was constantly un-doing their

# own decisions.

Working for a leader who always changes their mind is a maddening yet

# common experience.

When the strategy is perpetually changing, it’s challenging to be

enthusiastic about the strategy du jour. When rework is viewed as inevitable, high eﬀort is diﬃcult to justify. A leader who constantly

changes their mind will often leave behind an emotional wake of

# resentment.

Reporting to an indecisive boss is an unquestionably “challenging

and frustrating situation,” says Sydney Finkelstein, the director of the

## Leadership Center at the Tuck School of Business at Dartmouth College.

If your leader is easily inﬂuenced by whoever talked to them last, what

other organizations are doing, or the TikTok they saw this morning,

it shouldn’t sentence you to a constant state of ﬂux. While you can’t

control their behavior, you’re not powerless.

Here are ﬁve strategies I’ve used with my clients in this situation:

# Give Your Leader a “Tee-Up”

Before you present something for your boss to respond to, lay some

groundwork and set the stage for them to engage eﬀectively. Proactively

explain the context of the project, why it matters, who is involved, and

what the expectations were (because they probably forgot).

Let’s say you work in customer success, and you’ve found your

team is often missing out on valuable pieces of customer feedback.

Customer comments left on social media stay in marketing, feedback

given directly to a sales rep stays in sales, and customer-survey data

is unorganized. You and your boss agree that better collecting and

theming customer feedback would be a high-value project for your

# organization.

Over a few weeks, you create a project plan to tackle this challenge. You

know you’ll need to work cross-departmentally, get into the weeds of

existing data, and create sustainable systems to ensure lasting success.

And now you’re ready to present your plan to your boss.

Instead of diving into the weeds, and asking, “What do you think of

this project plan?”, be proactive by teeing up the conversation with

# something like:

Earlier this quarter, we discussed how valuable it would be to better

collect and theme our customer feedback. We’re missing valuable

insights that could improve our products. To make this happen, we’ll

need to engage marketing, sales, and IT and create a system that sticks

going forward, so we don’t run into this again. Knowing that’s our end

goal, I wanted to share a project plan I created with you.

Which approach would result in a more thoughtful conversation? Which

is more likely to create a lasting agreement? Which conversation would

leave you and your boss feeling better?

When you’re busy, taking the time to craft a tee-up feels laborious. Yet,

if your leader has a history of back-pedaling, the few minutes you spend

crafting a tee-up could save you hours or weeks down the road.

# Be Specific with Your Questions

If you work for a leader who always changes their mind, asking “What

do you think?” will put you on the fast track to a mountain of rework.

When asked for general feedback, most bosses will come up with

something to change or add. It’s your job to point them to where they

can be most helpful. Deﬁning the feedback scope is crucial.

Let’s go back to our example of the customer feedback project plan.

After you do a tee-up, make a speciﬁc feedback ask, such as: “I’m

interested in your thoughts on the timeline I’ve laid out. Do you think

it’s realistic or too ambitious?”

Asking for feedback on something speciﬁc gives your boss’s racing mind

a place to land. The clearer you can be about what feedback you’re looking for, the more eﬃcient and eﬀective your conversation will be.

When you’re thinking about the speciﬁc questions you may want to ask

your boss, it can be helpful to consider prompts like:

- What is my boss good at? How can I leverage their strengths?

- What’s the most urgent component of what I’m discussing?

- What could potentially derail success?

- When considering all the elements of my plan, which will have the

# biggest impact on my success?

The intent is not to manipulate your boss. Being speciﬁc with your

questions enables your boss to be eﬀective with their feedback, by

leveraging their strengths, zooming in on high-stakes elements, and

supporting you in the most impactful way possible.

# Define the “Editing” Phase

In some industries, like video, manufacturing, or publishing, there is a

deﬁned deadline until which you can make changes. In others, there

isn’t a speciﬁc cutoﬀ point. You can change things again … and again

…. and again. It’s expensive in the long run, but in the near term, there

# often isn’t a consequence.

Here’s some language you can use to deﬁne a “weigh-in period” with

# your boss:

In our initial conversations, we agreed the timeline of X was our goal.

That means we need to have all feedback collected by Y. Otherwise, we

will not hit our target, and that will result in Z.

Your boss likely has a plethora of projects and timelines in their brain.

A simple reminder of when the “editing” phase is ending, and what’s

at stake if you linger, is often all a seemingly indecisive boss needs to

# conﬁdently close the loop.

# Politely Push Back

You don’t want to be thought of as someone who refuses change, but

constantly bending to the whims of your boss’s last-minute muses

doesn’t serve you well either.

If you greet perpetual pivots with “no problem!” you are a willing

partner in this very frustrating dance. There’s a middle ground, between

toddler-level stubbornness and staying awake until midnight to rework

# your deck for the tenth time.

Consider politely pushing back with language like:

I understand your feedback. I know both of us want this (product,

project, etc.) to be successful. I appreciate you taking the time to

weigh in. I want to circle back to our objective of X. We’ve changed

# this several times.

- Do you think the current version won’t accomplish the objective?

- Will the change you’re requesting alter the outcome?

- What’s the cost of waiting to move forward?

- Is the change worth the investment of (X amount of time) or would

that time be better served prioritizing Y?

Tone is everything. You must ask these questions from a place of

genuine curiosity. Perhaps, something has really changed.

# Examine Your Own Reluctance to Change

The elusive certainty our brain so desperately craves is unlikely in

today’s business environment. Recognizing a baseline level of ongoing

change as inevitable is crucial for leading yourself. More importantly,

being able to operate in the face of change is imperative for your

# personal happiness.

Some bosses constantly change their minds because they don’t think

through their directives, don’t value the time of their team, or aren’t

# clear about the end game.

But many leaders change their minds because, even though it might be

frustrating and create more work for you, the circumstances warrant it.

You don’t want to work for a leader who never changes their mind. Good

bosses are willing to try something diﬀerent, chart a new course, or

clean up a misstep. Change comes with the territory of progress. If every

small “edit” is triggering a ﬁght or ﬂight response for you, it’s worth

exploring the root of your reluctance.

. . .

High performers lead up. You have the power to rein in your boss’s

endless ideas and decrease the number of unwelcome pivots.

Bosses who are always changing their minds often fall into that pattern

because they’re creative, enthusiastic, and always want to improve.

Those are excellent qualities in a leader. With intentionality, you can

reap the beneﬁt without paying a never-ending rework price.
