Imagine a novice gardener looking for a single solution to a pest

problem. They step into a gardening store, hoping for some guidance.

## Instead of a straightforward recommendation, the store assistant

## presents them with a myriad of sprays, traps, and organic concoctions.

Overwhelmed by the array of choices, the gardener leaves more

confused than when they entered.

## HBR / Digital Article / When Designing Employee Learning Programs, Less Is More

This is precisely how many employees feel when looking to upskill —

adrift in a sea of content they can’t begin to wrap their heads around

that feels, at best, loosely related to the speciﬁc challenges they‘re

# facing.

We’ve come to think of this phenomenon as the “kitchen sink problem.”

Too often, employees are barraged with a huge catalog of learning

programs, many of which are saddled with so much content that it’s

diﬃcult for them to know where to focus. And in connection with these

programs, employees are provided exhaustive lists of resources, rather

than carefully curated ones. Here are 100 courses! 70 hyperlinks! 35

toolkits! Dozens of internal sites, all looped together like a Kafkaesque

nightmare. Plus…videos from thought leaders! Random blogs from the

# internet! Book recommendations!

We now expect personalized experiences from websites, apps, and

social media, yet organizations’ approach to learning programs and

related content typically feels overwhelming, indiscriminate, and,

above all else, impersonal. Since this overabundance of learning options

seems to be the norm, we need to pause and reﬂect on something

behavioral scientists have known for decades: Less is more. In this article, we’ll unpack why that is and outline some strategies for oﬀering

## employees higher-impact learning content.

# Why Less Is More for Learning Programs

Business leaders, learning designers, and program sponsors all want the

same thing from learning programs: performance improvement, as well as justiﬁcation for the investment of eﬀort, money, and (perhaps most

valuable) their employees’ time.

## HBR / Digital Article / When Designing Employee Learning Programs, Less Is More

There are many reasons why giving your people too much content leads

to lesser impact, and to their consuming little-to-none of it at all. Here

are a few:

You’re asking for too much change.

You want to become a better leader? Well, you should be more

empathetic, creative, inspiring, strategic, inclusive, execution-focused,

purpose-driven, agile, resilient, and so on. These are all undoubtedly

good and important qualities, yet recommending that people change

everything in response to a challenge inevitably leads them to changing

nothing. We’ve all sat through a program on an important topic and

wondered: What is the most important thing for me to focus on right

now? Too often, it’s impossible to discern.

If everything is important, nothing is.

In recent years, there’s been an even greater expectation that when

something is served to us, it’s been vetted and is relevant. When

a program increasingly reveals more and more things that are

“important,” employees begin to lose faith in their ability to adapt

to the overwhelming amount of change that’s needed. This leads to

# disengagement and deﬂated motivation.

You’re presenting too many choices.

Decades of research from noted behavioral economists shows that when

it comes to choice, more is distinctly not better. Yes, people like to

have choices, but they vastly prefer a small set of carefully curated ones

(e.g., three ways to improve your presentation skills, not 30). Too much

choice quickly becomes aversive. (If you’ve ever stared at a diner menu

that seems to have all the foods, you know what we mean.)

People lose trust. If you came to us with a new problem and we oﬀered you the same

massive catalog of things we’re always pushing, how would you feel?

As learning professionals, we often preach the importance of active

listening and being responsive to needs, yet the kitchen-sink approach

doesn’t make us look like we’re listening or responsive.

It takes too much time and effort to navigate.

It’s typical to hear that learning systems are clunky, outdated, and hard

to navigate. People have come to expect easy search and ﬁltering, yet

the zeal to bring more to employees makes it hard to ﬁnd the one thing

they really want and need. Making it harder to ﬁnd that one thing

causes employees to squander time that could be spent on building

# their skills.

People can lack the expertise to make good choices.

How, exactly, are non-experts supposed to decide which of the options

available to them are useful for their speciﬁc problem? Giving the novice

gardener the responsibility of ﬁguring out the best combination of pest

solutions certainly isn’t sensible — yet isn’t that exactly what we’re doing when we take the kitchen-sink approach to learning oﬀerings?

# How to Avoid the Kitchen Sink

To provide employees with learning content that’s relevant, curated,

and ﬁndable, try these two strategies:

Understand why learning gets unwieldy.

Most L&D professionals have a seminal story about when they said

something like: “I can’t believe this is where this program ended up!”

They certainly don’t set out to throw everything but the kitchen sink

at their people, so how does it happen? Mostly this is the result of

## a few unconscious biases, along with some other understandable and

# well-intentioned motivations:

- The risk-aversion bias. Human beings are wired with a desire to

avoid mistakes and loss. This leads to an inclination to not leave

anything out, because it feels dangerous and wrong.

- The “what you see is all there is” bias. As Daniel Kahneman noted in

Thinking Fast and Slow, we have a diﬃcult time seeing any perspective

other than our own. Consequently, people often see their priorities in

everything and jump at the chance to include their priority topic and

content whenever they can — which leads to including everything, for

# everyone, all the time.

- Nonoptimal inclusiveness. When every group has a seat at every

table, the result can be a hodgepodge of ideas. Seeking out other

perspectives is essential and helpful — and requires a decider (or small

set of them) to make the tough calls on when to say no.

- A lack of understanding of what employees really need and want.

If employees don’t clearly understand what’s in it for them — i.e.,

if the learning content you’re providing doesn’t address a pain point

they have — they aren’t going to engage with the learning. That said,

people often don’t know what they really need, and it can take time, eﬀort, and expertise on the part of learning providers to understand

the needs and how to frame the content so it’s appealing.

- Deference to business leader requests. Although last on the list,

this is highly common. The desire to have this or that covered in a

forthcoming program because the leader’s gut intuition (rather than

objective evidence) tells them it’s a good idea very often results in

# unnecessary content.

We expect most L&D professionals are nodding as they review these

motivations. Dealing with each of them takes a unique skill set and

is rarely quick and easy. It requires understanding behavior-change

dynamics and related timelines. It requires patience. It requires

conﬁdence to push back and to leave things out. With so much on our

plates and virtually no free time, it’s easier to throw whole boxes of

spaghetti at the wall and hope that something sticks, rather than ﬁnd

the one strand best suited to solve the problem.

# Use impact as your guide.

Armed with one simple rule and a small set of critical questions, you can change the perception of your oﬀerings from overwhelming and

irrelevant to carefully curated, relevant, and personal.

Let this rule be your guide: Anything we include in our learning

program is aimed at achieving the one impact we want to have. Not

- 10. Not ﬁve. Not three. A laser focus on the one impact.

Then continually ﬁlter all content and design decisions through these

# questions:

- 1. What is the evidence that this content has impact? Do we know it

actually does something? Is there research or data to back it up? Who

are the experts this comes from, and are they credible?

- 2. Does this directly address the problem? If we don’t include this

content/resource, is it likely that the impact won’t be achieved?

- 3. Is this what our employees want? Does it feel responsive to their

need? Do they want conversation guides, team experiences, a skill-

building workshop, or a short video with tips? Delivering guidance in

the way your people want it is as important as getting the content

# right.

From a practical point of view, three things are better than many things.

One thing is even better. That applies to learning program options and

## the content in each one, as well as any accompanying resources.

. . .

Many point to generational diﬀerences to explain the nuances of

learning preferences. The truth is, we all have limited time, and we all

want eﬃcient, well-curated, and thoughtfully framed learning programs

and related resources. Instead of throwing in everything but the kitchen
