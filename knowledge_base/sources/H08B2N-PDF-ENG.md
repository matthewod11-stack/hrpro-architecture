From business leaders to athletes to everyday employees, passion is

often cited as a key ingredient in the success of high achievers. Consider

Elon Musk, whose passion is undeniable. He followed this drive and

went on to popularize electric cars through Tesla and reinvigorate space

# transportation via SpaceX.

But Musk has also been called “galactically arrogant,” often

overpromising on timelines for new technologies and product features

(e.g., fully self-driving cars), as well as his ability to lead an

organizational turnaround in an industry where he has little experience

# (e.g., Twitter/X).

This duality is not uncommon, suggesting a link between passion and

overconﬁdence — a link that may undermine the potential of passion

to boost performance. Studies have shown that in some cases, feeling

passionate can lead to burnout, frustration, and worse performance.

What’s at the root of these inconsistent eﬀects of passion? And what can

we do to reap the beneﬁts of passion at work, without falling prey to its

# downsides?

# Passion Skews Self-Views

To explore how passion relates to overconﬁdence, we conducted a series

## of studies with more than 1,000 employees from the U.S. and China.

Our ﬁndings suggest that the overconﬁdence that so often goes hand

in hand with passion may help explain why feeling passion doesn’t

(always) lead people to perform better.

- 1. Passionate people rate themselves higher than their colleagues do.

In our ﬁrst study, we asked more than 800 employees at an engineering

company in China to rate their own passion and performance, as well as

## the performance of their teammates, every morning and afternoon for

# 20 consecutive workdays.

We found that when employees reported higher levels of passion in

the morning, their coworkers evaluated their performance higher that

afternoon — but the more passionate employees were, the more they

rated their own performance even higher than their coworkers did. In

other words, in line with prior research, passion was related to higher

# performance.

However, also in line with prior research, employees’ perceptions of

their performance were inﬂated beyond their actual improvement.

Thus, the passionate employees in our study may have been even more

overconﬁdent than our data indicates, as their outward expressions of

passion may have biased their coworkers to rate them even more highly

# than their actual performance justiﬁed.

- 2. Passionate people rate themselves higher than performance data indicates they should. In our next study, we asked nearly 400 full-time U.S. employees to

imagine they were either highly passionate or highly punctual in a

hypothetical job. We told them all that their performance had been

rated as “average” by their colleagues, and then we asked them to rate

how well they thought they’d perform in their role.

We found that despite all participants being told that their performance

was only middling, the participants who we led to think of themselves

as highly passionate predicted that their future performance would

improve more than those who were told they are highly punctual.

People who were led to feel more passionate about their job expected

that they would also be more engaged at work, that they would work

longer and harder, and that their performance would improve as a

result, despite knowing that their performance had been rated as only

# so-so.

While this study is limited in its reliance on a hypothetical context

rather than real-world data, this experimental design enabled us

to ensure a level of consistency between participants that can be

challenging to replicate in real-world environments and oﬀers helpful

insight into the extent to which feeling passionate may inﬂuence our

# perceptions of our own abilities.

- 3. When we feel passionate about someone else, we rate them higher, too. Finally, in an additional study, we looked at how passion inﬂuences

people’s perceptions not just of their own abilities, but also the abilities

of those they feel passionate about.

We recruited more than 200 fans of the eight American football teams

that reached the playoﬀs in the 2023 U.S. National Football League

(NFL) and showed them expert forecasts of the chances that their

favorite team and another team would win the Super Bowl, utilizing

the statistical analysis website FiveThirtyEight. After they had a chance

to review the forecasts, we asked them to report how likely they thought

their favorite team was to win versus another, randomly selected ﬁnalist

# team.

So, what did we ﬁnd? Participants were consistently overconﬁdent

about the chances that their favorite team would win, guessing that

the team they were most passionate about was more likely to win than

the statistical model suggested. In other words, feeling passionate about

a team was associated with inﬂated perceptions of that team’s future

# success.

# Beware the Pitfalls of Passion

On the one hand, in roles that beneﬁt from a bit of healthy

overconﬁdence, managers might be wise to embrace passion. For

example, overconﬁdence can be helpful in roles that require a lot of

persistence, as it can prevent people from giving up when they hit

bumps in the road. Research also shows that people who express high

levels of conﬁdence are perceived as higher status, so for roles in

which success depends on being seen as having high status (such as

entrepreneurs, consultants, and salespeople), overconﬁdence may be

# more of an advantage than a detriment.

On the other hand, in roles where being overconﬁdent is more

dangerous — that is, where an accurate view of one’s own abilities

is crucial, such as surgeons, pilots, or ﬁnancial traders — managers

should be especially aware of the association between passion and

# overconﬁdence.

To be clear, we are not arguing that managers should discourage

passion. Instead, we need to account for the overconﬁdence that

so often accompanies passion. For example, managers may beneﬁt

from building in what we refer to as “passion slack” by encouraging

passionate employees to add buﬀer time to an ambitious timeline,

to pause and evaluate their bandwidth before saying yes to a new

project, or to think proactively about the potential hurdles to which

their passion may be blinding them.

In addition, more passionate employees may be less open to negative

## feedback and more resistant to objective information about their

performance, as their rose-colored glasses may inﬂate their perceptions

of their performance and make it harder for them to set realistic

expectations. As such, it may be especially important for managers of

passionate employees to help them set more realistic expectations for

themselves, and to provide feedback regularly to help them develop

# better self-awareness.

. . .

At the end of the day, passion has a lot to oﬀer, but it can also come

at a cost. Our research doesn’t suggest that organizations shouldn’t hire

passionate people, or even that managing them is inherently harder.

It just shows that managing passionate people requires proactivity and

# vigilance.
