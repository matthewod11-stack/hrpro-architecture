## Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA)

# (38 USC §§4301 through 4335)(https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/USCODE-2011-title38/html/USCODE-2011-

# title38-partIII-chap43.htm)

Who is Covered

# The Uniformed Services Employment and Reemployment Rights Act (USERRA) is administered by the

# Veterans' Employment and Training Service (VETS). USERRA applies to persons who perform duty, voluntarily

or involuntarily, in the "uniformed services," which include the Army, Navy, Marine Corps, Air Force, Coast Guard, and Public Health Service commissioned corps, as well as the reserve components of each of these

services. Federal training or service in the Army National Guard and Air National Guard also gives rise to rights

under USERRA. In addition, under the Public Health Security and Bioterrorism Response Act of 2002, certain

disaster response work (and authorized training for such work) is considered "service in the uniformed

# services."

Uniformed service includes active duty, active duty for training, inactive duty training (such as drills), initial

active duty training, and funeral honors duty performed by National Guard and reserve members, as well as

the period for which a person is absent from a position of employment for the purpose of an examination to

determine ﬁtness to perform any such duty.

USERRA covers nearly all employees, including part-time and probationary employees. USERRA applies to virtually all U.S. employers, regardless of size.

USERRA prohibits employment discrimination against a person on the basis of past military service, current

military obligations, or intent to serve. An employer must not deny initial employment, reemployment, retention in employment, promotion, or any beneﬁt of employment to a person on the basis of a past, present, or future

service obligation. In addition, an employer must not retaliate against a person because of an action taken to

enforce or exercise any USERRA right or for assisting in an USERRA investigation.

The pre-service employer must reemploy servicemembers returning from a period of service in the uniformed

services if those servicemembers meet ﬁve criteria:

The person must have been absent from a civilian job on account of service in the uniformed services;

The person must have given advance notice to the employer that he or she was leaving the job for service

in the uniformed services, unless such notice was precluded by military necessity or otherwise impossible

# or unreasonable;

The cumulative period of military service with that employer must not have exceeded ﬁve years; The person must not have been released from service under dishonorable or other punitive conditions; and

The person must have reported back to the civilian job in a timely manner or have submitted a timely

application for reemployment, unless timely reporting back or application was impossible or unreasonable.

USERRA establishes a ﬁve-year cumulative total of military service with a single employer, with certain

exceptions allowed for situations such as call-ups during emergencies, reserve drills, and annually scheduled active duty for training. USERRA also allows an employee to complete an initial period of active duty that

# exceeds ﬁve years.

Employers are required to provide to persons entitled to the rights and beneﬁts under USERRA a notice of the

rights, beneﬁts, and obligations of such persons and such employers under USERRA.

# Employee Rights

USERRA provides that returning servicemembers are to be reemployed in the job that they would have attained had they not been absent for military service, (the "escalator" principle), with the same seniority,

status and pay, as well as other rights and beneﬁts determined by seniority. USERRA also requires that

reasonable eﬀorts (such as training or retraining) be made to enable returning servicemembers to qualify for

reemployment. If the servicemember cannot qualify for the "escalator" position, he or she must be

reemployed, if qualiﬁed, in any other position that is the nearest approximation to the escalator position and then to the pre-service position. USERRA also provides that while an individual is performing military service,

he or she is deemed to be on a furlough or leave of absence and is entitled to the non-seniority rights and

beneﬁts accorded other similarly-situated individuals on non-military leaves of absence. The time limits for

returning to work are as follows:

Less than 31 days service: By the beginning of the ﬁrst regularly scheduled work period after the end of the calendar day of duty, plus time required to return home safely and an eight hour rest period. If this is

## impossible or unreasonable, then as soon as possible.

31 to 180 days: The employee must apply for reemployment no later than 14 days after completion of

military service. If this is impossible or unreasonable through no fault of the employee, then as soon as

# possible.

181 days or more: The employee must apply for reemployment no later than 90 days after completion of

# military service.

Service-connected injury or illness: Reporting or application deadlines are extended for up to two years

for persons who are hospitalized or convalescing.

Health and pension plan coverage for servicemembers is also addressed by USERRA. Individuals performing military duty of more than 30 days may elect to continue employer sponsored health care for up to 24 months;

however, they may be required to pay up to 102 percent of the full premium. For military service of less than

31 days, health care coverage is provided as if the servicemember had remained employed. USERRA pension

protections apply to deﬁned beneﬁt plans and deﬁned contribution plans as well as plans provided under

Federal or state laws governing pension beneﬁts for government employees. For purposes of pension plan participation, vesting, and accrual of beneﬁts, USERRA treats military service as continuous service with the

# employer.

## Recordkeeping, Reporting, Notices and Posters

Employers are required to provide to persons covered by USERRA a notice of the rights, beneﬁts, and

obligations of the employees and employers under USERRA. To do this, employers may post the notice

entitled "Your Rights Under USERRA" where employer notices are customarily placed, mail it, or by

# distributing it via electronic mail. There is no size requirement for the poster version of the notice.

There are no recordkeeping requirements under USERRA.

There are no reporting requirements under USERRA.

# Penalties/Sanctions

A court may order an employer to compensate a prevailing claimant for lost wages or beneﬁts. USERRA

## allows for liquidated damages for "willful" violations.

USERRA does not preempt state laws providing greater or additional rights or beneﬁts, but it does preempt

state laws providing lesser rights or beneﬁts or imposing additional eligibility criteria.

# Compliance Assistance Available

Compliance assistance information is available on the VETS Web site(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets). Speciﬁc compliance assistance materials available include: the Department of Labor USERRA regulations (20

## CFR Part 1002)(https://www.ecfr.gov/cgi-bin/text-idx?

SID=2cd11f170ae3875e6bd2fa46cec6402e&mc=true&node=pt20.4.1002&rgn=div5), which implement the law for non-

the notice/poster(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/programs/userra/resources) to employees of their rights, beneﬁts, and obligations under USERRA. Copies of VETS publications, or answers to questions about

USERRA, may also be obtained from a local VETS oﬃce(https://www.dol.gov/agencies/vets/about/regionaloﬃces).
