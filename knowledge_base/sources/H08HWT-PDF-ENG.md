There are countless articles on how to use generative AI (gen AI)

to improve work, automate repetitive tasks, summarize meetings and

customer engagements, and synthesize information. There are also

scores of virtual libraries brimming with prompting guides to help

us achieve more eﬀective and even fantastical output using gen AI

## tools. Many common digital tools already feature integrated AI co-pilots

to automagically enhance and complete writing, coding, designing,

creating, and whatever it is you’re working on. But there is so much

more to generative AI beyond enhancing or accelerating what we

already do. With the right mindset shift, or mindshift, we can train our

brains to creatively rethink how we use these tools to unlock entirely

new value and achieve exponential outcomes in what’s becoming an

# AI-ﬁrst world.

When most people prompt, they do so within the paradigm of how

they think about what could or should come next. For example, when

searching Google, users may ask a question, search for the best Thai

restaurant “near me,” or insert speciﬁc criteria based on ﬁltered output,

## such as “best downhill mountain bike for intermediate riders.” That

approach is often carried into prompting. The results build on a linear

path of thinking, research, and decision-making based upon the world

as we know it. This is perfectly normal and eﬀective. In fact, it’s how

today’s generative AI models largely work.

## Generative AI relies on natural language processing (NLP) to

understand the request and generate relevant results. It’s basically

pattern recognition and pattern assembly based on instructions to

deliver output that completes the task at hand. This approach aligns with our brains’ default mode: pattern recognition and eﬃciency-

seeking, which favors short, straightforward prompts to get immediate,

# predictable results.

If most people use gen AI in this way, then no matter how powerful

the tools, we inadvertently create a new status quo in how we work and

create. Training our brains to challenge our thinking, our assumptions

## of AI capabilities, and our expectations for predictable results starts

with a mindshift, to recognize AI not as just a tool, but as a partner in

innovation and exploring the unfamiliar.

## AI Enhances Today’s Work While Also Unlocking Tomorrow’s Opportunities, Today

## My friend Dharmesh Shah, co-founder and chief technology oﬃcer of

HubSpot, once shared online that “you’re competing with A.I.”

“That’s right,” people agreed. They went on to share other reactions

including, “AI is going to take jobs,” with some harboring more

dystopian outlooks, such as: “AI is going to destroy us.”

However, that wasn’t Shah’s intended meaning. He challenged people

to read the statement from a diﬀerent angle: “You’re competing with

A.I.” His point was that you can enhance, amplify, and even augment

your potential by doing so. In other words, AI can make you more

# competitive.

There’s a saying that you’ve probably heard many times and will

probably hear many times more, “AI won’t likely take your job, but

people who use AI will.”

AI empowers you to take what you do today and make it more eﬃcient, more scalable, less expensive, and more automated. More so,

AI supercharges your capabilities to do what you couldn’t do yesterday

to augment your performance. It’s this part that requires imagination,

creative and repetitive training, and a willingness to step beyond your

comfort zone and explore the unknown (and have fun while you’re at it).

## Break Free from Linear Transactions to More Creative Outcomes

Where AI starts to “come alive” is when you create something unique,

something that wouldn’t have been achieved without that human and

# machine collaboration.

For example, you may have an idea for a speciﬁc pasta dish to cook

for dinner, but you don’t have all the ingredients at home and don’t

feel motivated to visit the grocery store for everything else you need.

A creative human/AI collaboration could look at new outcomes that

would not have been considered otherwise.

One idea is to share the ingredients you do have with gen AI: “I have two

red tomatoes, chicken breast, olive oil, salt, and white onion. What are

some recipes I can consider for making dinner for two tonight?”

The alternatives sound appetizing:

- Chicken Breast with Tomato and Onion Sauté

- Tomato and Chicken Stir-Fry

- Chicken and Tomato Salad

- Tomato Chicken Skillet

Not only did alternative ideas come up in the moment, but easy-to-

follow recipes were also included.

You don’t have to stop there. If you’re not 100% satisﬁed with the

results, you could ask it to regenerate ideas or guide it with more

speciﬁc details or nuances, i.e., provide recipes under X number of

calories, only recipes for baking or air frying, etc.

You can also experiment in fun ways by adding your personality into

the mix and exploring unconventional, radical, or previously impossible

requests. This makes the output more creative, surprising, and mind-

blowing. For example, add details like country or region, style, cooking

time, or lifestyle preferences. Or take it to the next level by asking for

recipes to help you cook in the style of your favorite celebrity chef, from

any century (just as long as they’re in the LLM!). Then, ask it to provide

a personal note from the chef to motivate and guide you, and voilà, the

chef’s kiss. Suddenly gen AI becomes your personal cooking coach.

The idea here is to think about your interactions creatively, to practice

by challenging your own conventions around how you think gen AI

should work, and also the outcomes you think are expected or possible.

## Rethinking Collaboration with AI for More Creative, Innovative Outcomes

Changing your mindset to more creatively and openly collaborate with

AI is about the willingness to explore the unknown and the capacity to

learn, unlearn, and experiment. Plus, it’s a lot of fun.

I often say that using AI delivers its best potential and results when I,

along with my cognitive biases, step aside. I ask myself, with a smile,

“WWAID?” or “What would AI do?” I acknowledge that my unconscious

manner of using gen AI tools might default to predictable inputs and

outputs. But by asking WWAID, I open myself up to new exchanges and

experiences, which can yield unexpected results.

Tapping into AI’s creative and transformative potential and training

your brain for an AI-ﬁrst world requires us to mindshift our prompting

style, engaging AI as a collaborative partner, rather than just a tool.

## 12 Exercises to Train Your Brain to Work More Creatively With AI

Here are a dozen ways to train our brains to achieve broader, more

# innovative outcomes with gen AI:

- 1. Set a daily “exploratory prompting” practice

Begin each day with an open-ended prompt that pushes you to think

big. You might try, “What trends or opportunities am I not seeing in my

industry?” or “How might I completely redeﬁne my approach to a key

# challenge?”

- 2. Frame prompts around “What if” and “How might we” questions

Instead of asking direct questions, prompt with open-ended

possibilities. For instance, instead of asking, “How can I improve

productivity?” try, “What if I could approach productivity in an

unconventional way — what might that look like?”

- 3. Embrace ambiguity and curiosity in prompts

Training ourselves to prompt without a precise endpoint in mind allows

AI to generate responses that might surprise us. Prompts like “What

might I be overlooking in my approach to X?” open doors to insights we

hadn’t considered.

- 4. Use prompts to explore rather than to solve

Many prompts focus on solutions. Shifting toward exploration allows

for deeper insight generation. For example, “Let’s explore the future

of leadership if AI had a seat on the board or in the C-Suite — what

changes might we see in our work, roles, and in corporate culture?”

- 5. Chain prompts to develop ideas iteratively

Rather than stopping at the ﬁrst answer, ask follow-up questions that

deepen the response toward more complex and visionary responses. If

AI suggests an idea, build on it with questions like, “What would this

look like in 5 years?” or “How might this approach change the future of

how companies operate?”

- 6. Think metaphorically or analogically

Training our brains to use metaphor or analogy in prompts open up

creative pathways. For instance, instead of asking for productivity tips,

## prompt AI with, “Imagine productivity as a dance — how might my

# approach change?”

- 7. Prompt for perspectives, beyond facts

Ask AI to take on diﬀerent perspectives to broaden the creative capacity

for unpredictable results. For instance, “How might an artist, a scientist,

and a philosopher each approach the challenge of leading in a tech-

driven world?” prompts AI to combine diverse viewpoints, oﬀering a

richer pool of ideas, and inspiring you in ways not possible before.

- 8. Experiment with “role-play” prompts

Train yourself to consider multiple perspectives by asking AI to

## generate responses from the mindset of the world’s best experts from

any industry or genre — you can even include ﬁctional personas. For

instance, try prompting AI with, “How would an innovative CEO, an

artist, and a futurist each solve this problem?” Personally, I’ve interacted

with the AI’s take on two of my favorites — Steve Jobs and Walt Disney

# — on many occasions.

- 9. Ask for impossibilities and involve experiential scenarios

Open new avenues to reimagine the problem itself, uncovering

solutions that others might overlook. Prompt AI for ideas that would

“completely eliminate the need for [whatever you’re working on],” or

“solutions that solve problems we haven’t even imagined yet.” And go

further by prompting AI to create “a day-in-the-life scenario where this

[solution or eﬀort] becomes indispensable in every moment of [insert

person]’s life.”

- 10. WWAID — Reimagine AI’s role in the solution itself

Ask questions that treat AI as a partner in innovation: “How would you,

as an AI, design this service or solution to [accomplish A, B, or C] in

ways only an AI could perceive?”

- 11. Establish a weekly “future-driven prompt” session

Devote one session per week to focus on large-scale, future-oriented

prompts, such as “What will my industry look like in 10 years, and

how can I stay at the forefront?” or “What radical shifts might cause

## disruptions or redeﬁne success in my ﬁeld?”

- 12. Keep a journal of “breakthrough prompts”

Though AI tools retain a history of your prompts, document those

## that yield surprising, innovative, or particularly valuable insights and

results. Reviewing this log regularly can inspire new ways to phrase

# future prompts.

. . .

Generative AI is not just a tool; it’s a catalyst to rewire our thinking

patterns, break free from the constraints of linear logic, and unlock

creative insights we didn’t know we were capable of. A mindshift rewires

us to abandon outdated thinking, embrace curiosity, and activate

exponential potential by asking better, more audacious questions. To

harness its power in innovative ways, the ﬁrst step is to adopt what I call

“exponential curiosity,” which allows us to move from merely using AI

to actively co-creating with it.

A mindshift paired with Generative AI rewires our brains to work toward

an alternate future that we can scarcely imagine — a future that’s ﬁlled

with awe-inspiring, meaningful breakthroughs that redeﬁne industries,

## experiences, and the very nature of human potential.

By asking AI questions that challenge assumptions and venture into the

unknown, you not only get creative responses but develop a mindset

that primes you to see possibilities that others miss. Leaders who foster

these mindshifts within their teams will ﬁnd themselves cultivating

a culture where “the impossible” becomes a daily challenge — and

# achievement.

Give yourself permission and space to excel in an AI-ﬁrst world.
