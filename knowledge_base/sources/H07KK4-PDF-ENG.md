A recent Washington Post article highlighted a seemingly obvious, yet

critically important ﬁnding from research conducted by Maureen Perry-

Jenkins: When parents work in more supportive environments, they are

able to be more eﬀective in their parenting roles. This, in turn, leads

to better developmental outcomes for their children. It’s no surprise

that this news article quickly made the rounds across social media for

parents — it articulates what so many working parents have felt: that

## our experiences at work shape the experiences of our home lives.

## HBR / Digital Article / The Ripple Effect of a Bad Boss on Dual-Career Parents

While writing Parents Who Lead, one of us (Alyssa) heard countless

examples of dual-career parents who described the invasive, negative

impact that an unsupportive work environment (think micromanaging

boss, lack of family-supportive policies, presenteeism culture) can have

on the entire family. It was common to hear one parent complain about

their partner’s work and how carrying the resulting extra burden at

home meant that they couldn’t fully engage at work themselves. And,

happily, we also heard the positive ﬂip side of this story. When one

parent was meaningfully supported at work, their co-parent felt better

able to fully show up as a parent and in their own career.

As a team of researchers and working parents ourselves, we set out

to investigate this question: How does our co-parent’s support (or lack

thereof) in the work environment inﬂuence our ability to thrive at home

# and at work?

To answer this question, we identiﬁed 100 dual-career couples with

children and surveyed them at multiple time points over a year and a

half during the pandemic. We asked each parent to tell us about the

extent to which their work environment was supportive of their lives

outside of work. We asked these questions about several facets of the

work environment — their direct supervisor, their coworkers, and the

broader organizational culture. We also asked both parents about their

home lives, including the extent to which their partner was a supportive

co-parent. Finally, we asked them to describe the degree to which they

felt that they were thriving at work and at home. From an academic

perspective, thriving is deﬁned as two distinct but related psychological

states — vitality and learning. When you thrive, you feel energized,

## enthusiastic, and a sense of continuous growth and learning. Beyond

merely surviving, we wanted to know why some working parents were

able to thrive (especially during the pandemic, which placed immense

# pressure on the family system).

What we found supported our initial supposition that when one co-

parent has a supportive work environment, it makes it signiﬁcantly

more likely that their co-parent will be able thrive both at home and in

their own careers. Diving deeper into the data yielded some fascinating

# ﬁndings.

First, we found that not all types of support at work are equally

important. The supportiveness of one’s supervisor was signiﬁcantly

## more impactful on both the co-parent and their partner than other

## forms of support at work (either from coworkers or the organizational

culture, more broadly). In other words, even after controlling for the

## supportiveness of your own boss, the supportiveness of your co-parent’s

boss aﬀects how likely you are to thrive at work and home.

Second, as organizational psychologists, we wanted to understand how

this process unfolded. We found that partners who had supportive

supervisors were, in turn, more supportive of their co-parent at home.

Having a supportive supervisor allowed individuals to bring more time

and energy to their home lives. They were able to take on more of

the parenting and domestic responsibilities, as well as be a more

focused, engaged, and patient co-parent. Simply put, when you have an

unsupportive boss, it’s hard to show up fully for your family. As a result,

the demands of managing the home domain fall disproportionately to

your co-parent, which drains them of the capacity to fully thrive in their

home and work lives. This eﬀect held true regardless of parent gender

# and number of children.

While there is still much to untangle about how the work environments

of the couples in our study aﬀect their children and partner, these initial

ﬁndings present signiﬁcant takeaways for working parents.

- 1. Recognize and manage spillover.

While we may want to believe we can “turn oﬀ” work stress when we’re

oﬀ-the-clock, our research suggests that this frequently isn’t the case.

Work-family scholars refer to this as “spillover”— when experiences at

work impact your ability to fully engage at home, both positively and

# negatively.

After a great day at work, you’re more likely to be an energetic parent

and partner. But, after a draining and frustrating one, negative moods

don’t necessarily dissipate right away. By becoming more aware of this

process, you can develop tools for capitalizing on the positive energy

and minimizing the transfer of negativity. For example, developing a

commute ritual (even if it’s just from the desk to the couch) may be a

useful tool for managing spillover.

- 2. Practice mindful division of labor.

When we dove into the research on how one partner’s boss aﬀects

their co-parent, one of the key drivers was the extent to which

unsupportive bosses were associated with less equal co-parenting.

While demanding work roles may mean that not every chore or task

can be shared 50/50, it does highlight the importance of consciously

and collaboratively determining how family responsibilities will be

distributed. Experimenting with new ways to divide and manage

responsibilities is an important strategy for dual-career parents to

improve both partners’ satisfaction and performance at work and home.

- 3. Prioritize having the right boss.

While we may not have control over who we work for and with, there

are times of career transition when we do have the capacity to prioritize

diﬀerent facets of our future roles. In those instances, recognize the

potential impact that a supportive supervisor will play in your life, and

seek out a supportive boss.

- 4. Manage up.

Since choosing your direct supervisor isn’t always an option, it’s

important to be proactive in managing the relationship with the boss

that you do have. Research suggests that you can manage up to facilitate

## greater alignment, communication, and support in your relationship

with your direct supervisor. And, if your co-parent feels trapped, you

can help them identify strategies for doing so, as well.

- 5. Cultivate communities of support.

While our research focused on the supportiveness of the workplace,

it’s only one dimension of our lives that aﬀects our immediate family.

Yet, many of us focus only on work and immediate family as potential

levers of support, overlooking our wider community. By cultivating

a broader network of support around you — whether from extended

family, neighbors, friends, community or school resources — you may

ﬁnd that you become less reliant on the supportiveness of your direct

supervisor to facilitate wellness in your career and home. By creatively

building and leveraging support in other domains of your life, you

bolster your ability to thrive in challenging circumstances.

It’s no secret that a supportive boss can play an instrumental role

in your ability to thrive both at work and at home. Our research

takes this ﬁnding one step further by highlighting how your boss can

also indirectly inﬂuence your co-parent’s ability to thrive, as well.

While it may not always be an option to choose the ideal supervisor,

by understanding how this process unfolds, you can take steps to

## more consciously navigate complex work, parenting, and partnership

decisions to maximize opportunities for both you and your co-parent to

# thrive in all facets of life.
