Much like the many digitization efforts that have come before, AI

brings tremendous potential to help transform how work is done, and

even access work that we didn’t think was possible. Consider that ER

doctors hit an average of 4,000 keystrokes in a 10-hour shift — imagine

all the good that could be accomplished from repurposing that eﬀort,

time, and mental energy by not just replacing some of this work, but

also augmenting intelligence to help improve eﬀectiveness and speed.

Organizations have already launched dozens (if not hundreds) of eﬀorts

to harness the power of AI. In fact, PwC’s 2023 Emerging Technology

Survey found that 54% of companies have implemented generative AI

in some areas of their business, and our ﬁrm has identiﬁed more than

# 3,000 use cases for AI.

In PwC’s June 2024 Pulse Survey, 84% of executives said achieving

measurable value from new technology was a challenge. Typically,

organizations have to spend signiﬁcant time and resources trying to

## correct massive amounts of “technical debt” — all the layered eﬀorts

to help upgrade your organization’s technology infrastructure and the

resulting complexity.

Our experience working on tech-enabled and digital transformations

with hundreds of companies across industries and processes across front, middle, and back-oﬃce areas has led us to believe that simply

trying to manage technical debt is often a misguided and incomplete

eﬀort. Until organizations can tackle their often undiscussed “process

debt” — which we deﬁne as the buildup of often antiquated,

functionally isolated, and customer-disconnected ways of doing work

— they cannot realize the massive potential of technologies like AI and

## the suite of digitization tools at their disposal.

## For example, at one Fortune 50 consumer products company, the

reporting and analytics activities were being done manually across

several functions (e.g., human resources, procurement, supply chain,

ﬁnance) and lines of business (e.g., commercial, sales, marketing,

pricing, promotions). More than 100,000 reports were produced across

these businesses and functions, with 70% of the time spent on

data gathering, analysis, and producing reports. This was further

exacerbated by follow-ups from end users that required additional data

and analysis. These reports were of course layered through multiple

well-intended eﬀorts, each of them trying to address a unique business

need but creating not only more technical debt, but tremendous process

# complexity.

The good news is that because AI inspires us to rethink the very nature

of what we’re able to do with our customers and alliance relationships, it

can give organizations a fresh chance to get out from under antiquated

process debt. And even better, we can now redesign these fundamental

processes with the power of AI and many other tools ready to help

transform how we can work.

This consumer products company decided to initiate a global program

to help tackle their process debt. Instead of rushing to use technology

to automate existing reports, they asked fundamental questions about

what reporting is needed, why, and how they could pivot this set of

activities to growth while reducing costs. This meant the company

revisited what work is being done, how it was being done, and

how technologies, including AI, could radically transform the overall

# process.

This approach led to a much more business and value-focused reporting

capability, including:

- A 70% reduction in the number of reports produced

- The use of multiple technologies to automate data, analysis, and

report production (directly linked to the source system)

- The establishment of a center of excellence for reporting focused more

# on value-add insights and related work

- A 50% reduction in costs for reporting activities across functions

- On-demand reporting via an interactive tool (as compared to the

# previous static spreadsheets)

- The introduction of a conversational AI tool to provide on-demand

# answers to questions.

Put simply, the company established a new process that’s much simpler

and focused on insights for running — and adding value to — today’s

# business.

# Tackling Process Debt

So how do we recommend organizations take on their process debt in a

holistic way that can add value? Through these ﬁve levers:

- 1. Map your organization’s end-to-end processes, and identify clear outcomes. The ﬁrst step is to identify and then categorize your organization’s end-

to-end processes based on discrete products or value streams. Next,

assess each value stream. Do you still need to do the activity? Is it

delivering business value? Is it meeting the end user or customer’s

# expectations?

The above consumer company categorized its enterprise into 50

end-to-end processes, which were translated into digitized products

with clear outcomes. For example, the human resources value

chain included processes for hiring, onboarding, job evaluation, compensation, and retirement/offboarding. Its supply-chain value

stream included order processing, invoice processing, and import/

export. The commercial function included pricing, store shelf

## enhancements, promotion management, product route planning and

# implementation/distribution.

- 2. Determine who is better equipped to help deliver in each major process area. This step is often overlooked. Many companies rarely challenge what

work they should drive themselves and what can be driven by external collaborators, particularly when it comes to critical front-oﬃce

# capabilities.

At the consumer company we worked with, many critical areas like how

insights are generated, who is better equipped to merchandise shelves,

and where innovation ideas come from were given to critical ecosystem

collaborators who had stronger capabilities and more scale. Instead

of classic “outsourcing,” these capabilities were highly integrated into

the end-to-end processes that the company owned. In this way, the

company was able to access subject-matter specialists who excelled in

speciﬁc areas, and it could leverage the technology investments those

specialists had already made.

- 3. Stand up a “digital factory” to reimagine end-to-end processes.

Just like manufacturers have factories for product assembly, we

recommend companies create a “digital factory” — a team staﬀed with

capabilities such as product strategy, product design, data engineering,

data science, and automation — to help bring to life their reimagined

processes. By applying these methods consistently across each process

area, this team can develop tools, training, and a governance model

that can help the company prevent years of business process debt. For

example, a digital factory can stitch together emerging technologies

(AI, machine learning, and intelligent automation) with other tools,

such as ServiceNow, Salesforce, and SAP, to replace or augment existing

# processes.

This consumer product company used its digital factory to help

generate revenue by reimagining the end-to-end commercial and go-

to-market processes. This included pricing, promotions, and customer-

discount allowances, as well as streamlining shared services activities,

## such as procurement, supply chain, reporting, and analytics.

- 4. Reskill employees to help support your new processes.

With new processes that are increasingly critical to business outcomes,

organizations must staﬀ them with highly skilled talent who can unlock

their power. This will likely mean changing the operating model —

how you are organized to deliver on the work — as well as reskilling

or upskilling employees and redeploying talent around your new value-

# added activities.

For example, the consumer product company needed to redeﬁne

roles so they were focused on more speciﬁc outcomes from the

new processes. They automated some activities around promotions

## management, such as data gathering, ingestion, and analysis, which

required upskilling some employees’ technical skills. Other employees

were tasked with managing retailer relationships and received

# additional training in necessary skills.

- 5. Adopt an iterative and learning mindset by architecting the change in short sprints. Make no mistake that getting value from these eﬀorts will likely not

be easy, so organizations must manage these programs closely to both

conﬁrm proper adoption of the changes and course correct as needed.

The consumer products company redesigned their processes in 12- to

16-week sprints. This created momentum and an iterative mindset to

learn and help create value.

. . .

Organizations are anxious about tackling the burden of their

technical debt, increasingly focusing on the growing and seemingly

insurmountable budgets required to move forward and hoping that

better, faster, and ideally cheaper new technologies can help save

the day. But that approach may only increase the debt, with endless

incremental new technologies creating a deeper and more complex web.

Start instead by remapping and reprioritizing the way your company

does work, with a focus on clear outcomes your customers are

demanding and where you can meaningfully diﬀerentiate. Rethinking

how that work can be created and delivered is a much needed and

freeing exercise. Such an approach can lead to startling results — we’ve

seen 50% to 80% improvements in value — and will greatly focus your

organization on the activities that it’s better equipped to deliver.
