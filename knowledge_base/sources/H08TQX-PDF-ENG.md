Everywhere you look in today’s workplaces, you’ll ﬁnd organizational

## rituals. From a quick daily morning team cheer to an elaborately

planned annual celebration, companies invest signiﬁcant time, eﬀort,

and money into establishing and maintaining shared customs in

order to strengthen social bonds and drive employee engagement and

performance. The eﬀectiveness of organizational rituals is backed by

research ﬁndings and is advocated by thought leaders, creating the

impression that the eﬀects of rituals on employees and teams are

# straightforward and uniformly positive.

The problem is, this rosy depiction of organizational rituals doesn’t

always match reality. Take the company holiday party, for example.

Anecdotal accounts indicate that workers often experience them

negatively, and many would like to see this particular ritual cancelled

altogether (honestly, did you really want to attend your company’s

holiday party last year?). These employee reﬂections suggest that the

eﬀects of workplace rituals are not as uniformly positive as previously

# thought.

Investigating the existing literature, we found that most research

highlighting positive aspects focuses on simple rituals (like a morning

cheer), rather than complex ones (like a holiday party). But what eﬀect

do rituals have on your team when they become more complicated and

# time-consuming?

In our forthcoming study, we found that complex rituals can unleash a

host of experiences that impact employee engagement and behavior.

We walk you through our ﬁndings and oﬀer a checklist to help

organizations drive strong ROI for rituals, while planning for and

addressing those experiences that might bar some employees from

reaping the beneﬁts of these events.

# The Research

In a series of studies, we examined the dynamics of complex

organizational rituals—those that take place over extended periods

of time and involve extensive social interaction. Think holiday

parties, team-building retreats, annual meetings, award ceremonies,

onboarding or leaving events, and company-speciﬁc celebrations. In

one study, we asked employees to describe how they felt at these

events. In line with previous work, we found that complex rituals can

make employees feel more connected to their colleagues and have more

positive feelings about their company. But we also found that they can

make employees feel excluded, inauthentic, underappreciated, and like

they’re making a personal sacriﬁce.

To examine how these positive and negative responses to complex

rituals impact subsequent employee engagement and behavior, we

conducted two additional studies in the U.S. and Germany. Both studies

examined the eﬀects that complex rituals had in the weeks and months

following the ritual event. Consistent with prior research, we found that

when employees reported having more positive experiences at the event

(such as having meaningful social interactions or being recognized by

leaders for their work), they were subsequently more engaged, more

## helpful toward coworkers, more likely to share positive feelings about

the organization, and less likely to search for a new job. However, when

employees encountered a greater share of negative experiences at the

event (stating that some groups of employees were excluded or that they personally felt insuﬃciently appreciated, for example), these beneﬁts

disappeared.

The takeaway is clear: for workplace rituals to eﬀectively drive

positive outcomes, the presence of positive experiences is necessary, but not suﬃcient. When planning a complex ritual event, like the

annual holiday party, it may be easy to focus on a great location,

awesome food, and a fun atmosphere—and all of this is important.

But it is equally important to make sure that negative experiences

(such as asking employees to make personal sacriﬁces to attend and insuﬃciently expressing appreciation toward them) are prevented.

Otherwise, organizations risk getting zero return on their investment

# of time, energy, and money.

# The Ritual-Planning Checklist

So how do you ensure that your upcoming retreat or future onboarding

event maximizes all that employees enjoy about complex rituals, while

mitigating common negative experiences? We’ve created a list of do’s

and don’ts, based on our research, to help you plan a great event that

will ensure you get the most out of it.

The Dos 1. Do provide opportunities to strengthen your company’s social fabric.

While examining why many of the employees we studied felt more

connected to their colleagues after attending rituals, we found two

themes. First, employees especially appreciated connecting with

colleagues whom they didn’t normally see in person, like those who

work on other shifts or in other locations. Second, they took pleasure in

talking to their coworkers about the non-work (personal) sides of their

lives. Allowing time at the start of the event for employees to greet and

connect with those they haven’t crossed paths with for a while—before

other structured activities take place—creates space to leave the work

## talk behind reconnect and share about other matters.

- 2. Do offer meaningful perks.

Employees in our study reported feeling appreciated and rewarded

when their organizations provided meaningful perks at events. Quality

food and entertainment, and small but thoughtful gifts, can signal that

employees are valued. Not sure which perks are best? Take an evidence-

based approach. We spoke with one leader who conducted a survey,

informing employees of the budget and providing them with options for

how to spend it, including a formal sit-down meal, highly interactive

# activities, and casual mingling.

- 3. Do bring the positive energy.

Employees who feel energized after a ritual tend to leave feeling

more motivated about their work. Devote thought and preparation to

selecting energizing and inspiring speakers for the event and crafting

their messages. If it’s an onboarding event, think about ways to get new

employees excited about all that your company oﬀers and how it might

help them grow. Also, don’t underestimate the power of simple games to

put people in a good mood, especially if a prize is involved. On multiple occasions, employees mentioned that raﬄes were one of the highlights

# of their ritual.

- 4. Do set a relaxing atmosphere.

Create space and time for employees to unwind and savor their

experience at the ritual. If it’s a holiday party, allow people to come and

go at will or show up for just a short while. Don’t create an event that’s

so highly structured that it becomes stressful to be involved or requires

# advance preparation.

The Don’ts 1. Don’t minimize employees’ personal sacriﬁces.

The event’s timing and the demands that it places on attendees can

sour their experience. While you can’t eliminate all inconveniences for

everyone, do your due diligence to identify aspects of past rituals that

have been cumbersome and seek to reduce them (e.g., timing, dress

code, faraway location, or the need to bring items). Consider ways to

reduce the personal time and resources employees need to invest, such

as scheduling events during work hours, compensating for transit costs,

or providing childcare so all employees can fully engage.

- 2. Don’t go overboard.

Employees may view excessive spending as wasteful and feel that

resources could have been better spent elsewhere. Especially during

times of cost-cutting or worse (e.g., layoﬀs), avoid events that are

unnecessarily expensive or could be perceived as wasteful. At the same

time, don’t take cost savings too far. We spoke with one employee who

lamented that their annual party was held in the company parking lot,

with no seating. Try to ﬁnd that sweet spot between meaningful yet

# cost-eﬀective activities.

- 3. Don’t waste an opportunity to show appreciation.

Findings from our research showed that employees who felt

underappreciated during rituals often disengaged from work

afterwards. Use your rituals as an opportunity to recognize

## accomplishments and express gratitude to employees for their

contributions. If it’s an award ceremony, can you also include a

gratitude wall that allows people to publicly share how other teammates

have meaningfully contributed? If it’s an annual meeting, can you

devote time to thanking individual units for speciﬁc accomplishments?

As a leadership team, can you create a plan so that every employee

at the party is personally thanked by at least one executive? Be sure

to publicly acknowledge the accomplishments of all units so that all

attendees are reminded that their eﬀorts and achievements are noticed

and valued.

- 4. Don’t make it hard for employees to be themselves.

Employees react poorly to rituals that create pressure for them to

show “fake” enthusiasm. Allow employees to engage authentically

without requiring participation in activities that may feel contrived

or uncomfortable. This includes forcing employees to attend in the

ﬁrst place. Where possible, make attendance optional, with this policy

explicitly communicated by leaders. This is especially critical if the

ritual takes place during personal time.

# Limitations

While our research provides insights into the potential countervailing

## eﬀects of complex organizational rituals, several limitations of our

research warrant mention. First, while we examined general complex

rituals such as workplace holiday parties and team-building events,

there may be other unique or idiosyncratic rituals—for example,

those speciﬁc to certain industries or organizations—that were not

included in our analysis. These rituals may have distinct positive and

negative experiences beyond those we identiﬁed. Second, while our

data spanned multiple countries (U.S., U.K., and Germany), cultural

diﬀerences in how rituals are perceived and experienced remain

an important consideration. For instance, collectivistic cultures (e.g.,

India, Indonesia) may place greater emphasis on group cohesion and

inclusivity, potentially altering the eﬀectiveness and impact of rituals

like holiday parties or team-building retreats. Employees in such

cultures may be more tolerant of the negative experiences we identiﬁed

compared to those in more individualistic cultures, such as those where

our studies took place.

. . .

Organizational rituals can be powerful tools for fostering engagement

and driving positive workplace behaviors—but only if designed

thoughtfully. Poorly planned rituals risk undermining their beneﬁts.

The checklist we’ve developed oﬀers leaders an evidence-based

framework for designing more eﬀective organizational rituals. By

systematically addressing both sides of the ritual experience—

maximizing positive elements like social connection and meaningful

recognition while minimizing negative aspects like inauthenticity and

personal sacriﬁce—organizations can transform events into meaningful

experiences that genuinely enhance engagement.
