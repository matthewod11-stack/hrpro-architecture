We’ve all been told the importance of ﬁnding a mentor as you build

your career. Among other beneﬁts, it can lead to higher job satisfaction

and better professional prospects. According to one report, employees

who had mentors were promoted ﬁve times more often than people who

did not. But the truth is that senior leaders with the time and interest

to support you are in short supply, so it can be hard to know where to

start. If you don’t already have a mentor, how can you actually get the

guidance you need?

# HBR / Digital Article / You Don’t Need a Mentor to Get the Career Advice You Need

Through our work advising companies on developing emerging leaders

(Dorie as a consultant and keynote speaker and Alexis as an academic

researcher and professor), we’ve discovered that young professionals

often have abundant—but easily overlooked—opportunities for what

we call micro-mentorship: short, actionable advice that can make a

# tangible diﬀerence.

Here are four ways you can expand your sense of possibility and gain

the career clarity you need using the micro-mentoring approach.

# Identify “Hidden Mentors”

We often have more “light connections” with relevant professional

experience than we realize. Professors, former teaching assistants,

## family friends, colleagues from past internships, and loose

acquaintances can all provide one-time advice that may prove

# transformative.

For instance, a colleague who does social impact work assumed that

a successful path after grad school meant ﬁnding a job in a major

metropolitan area. Without a mentor to ask for advice, he reached out to

a professor who did not know him well. In a short conversation during oﬃce hours, he received an unexpected suggestion: “Why don’t you

go back to your hometown, where you said your passion for this work

began, and start your career there?” He followed the advice, and this

approach let him maximize his impact while developing a robust skillset

that ultimately helped him get hired for a leadership role in a national

# organization.

# Crowdsource Advice

Finding ways to gain broader insights from interesting, thoughtful

strangers can be just as pivotal as interactions with the hidden mentors

you already know. Using your extended network on LinkedIn or your

school’s alumni database can allow you to ﬁnd a range of people to ask

for targeted input about your career goals. It’s also useful to stay open-

minded to spontaneous interactions. One colleague of ours received

life-changing career advice from a woman he was seated next to on an

# airplane.

Not everyone you reach out to will say yes, but it’s certainly not

an imposition to ask someone for a discrete piece of advice (“I’m

considering getting an MBA or an MPP. Given your experience in the

ﬁeld, which do you think would be most useful?”), a query about their

experience (“What are the best and worst parts of working in M&A?”),

or―depending on logistics and their availability―a one-time coﬀee meeting.

It can feel daunting to reach out to ask a stranger for advice, so it is

also worth remembering that many people appreciate being asked for

their input. In fact, your micro-mentoring request may enable them to

broaden their impact and feel a sense of professional accomplishment

without having to add an ongoing commitment to their already stuﬀed

# calendars.

# Embrace Self Reflection

Micro-mentors can ﬁll the mentorship gap, but when you’re taking

advice from someone who doesn’t know you as an individual, their

guidance may be helpful in general (“Deﬁnitely go back to graduate

school!”) but not appropriate for your personal situation (for instance,

needing to work full-time to help support your family). So, it’s important

to balance out the advice with your own self-reﬂection.

When you build a network of micro-mentors, you have to rely on your

gut and self-knowledge, rather than simply taking the word of someone

more experienced. You’re forced to actually listen to yourself and learn

to trust your own instincts—important skills to cultivate early in your

career. Over time, the ability to understand what’s right for you—and

discard what’s not—can become a critical competitive advantage when

making career decisions. For instance, you might feel pressure to simply

accept the highest-paid job oﬀer that you receive, but understanding

where your long-term professional interests lie can help you choose

a position that, while it may pay less initially, is a better ﬁt over the

# duration of your career.

# Seize Digital Opportunities

Just as we learn a lot from people we don’t know in person—such as

by reading their biographies and observing the way they think and

approach problems—we can also glean advice from thought leaders we

admire through digital technologies. Ideas and stories they share in

their social media feeds may help spark useful questions or insights. If they’re doing an online oﬃce hours or Ask Me Anything session, you

might have an opportunity to engage with them directly—or view their

answers to questions posed to them.

We’ve also found that AI technology, such as ChatGPT, can help you

conceptualize how a person you admire might think through or respond

to a challenge. For instance, “What are 10 ways MrBeast might think

about how to stand out in a job interview?” (Of course, in using any

generative AI technology, it’s important to double-check its assertions,

but it can serve as a useful starting point for brainstorming and

# inspiration.)

. . .

It may feel challenging if you don’t have a mentor guiding your career

development on an ongoing basis. But micro-mentoring can be just as

beneﬁcial as cultivating a single mentor who—despite being able to

oﬀer more targeted advice based on your long-term connection—may
