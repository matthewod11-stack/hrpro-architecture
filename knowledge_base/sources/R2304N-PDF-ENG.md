About a year ago, a friend suggested that I enroll in an adult tap-dance

class held at our town’s community center. The suggestion wasn’t as

random as it might seem. For nearly two decades in my youth, I had

loved tapping in classes and onstage. And when I laced up those black

leather shoes after a nearly 20-year hiatus, I felt instantly at home.

What surprised me most about my tap renaissance wasn’t how quickly

the steps came back to me. It was how the language of tap, the utterance

of words I hadn’t voiced in decades, energized me: triple-time step, riff

walk, cramp roll, back essence. The teacher would say the words, and my

feet would tap into action.

The Power of Language, written by Viorica Marian, a psycholinguistics

researcher, helped me understand what was going on. At a young age I

had become ﬂuent in tap. Tap is a code of communication that changed

my brain, opening me up to new knowledge and new experiences. I

hadn’t used that language in a long time, and now I was reactivating it.

Marian explores the power of multilingualism like mine and the more

typical type—being ﬂuent in, say, English, Korean, and JavaScript. She

## explains that although the majority of people in the world speak more

than one language, most research to date has been on monolingual

populations, so we’re only beginning to understand the power of the

# multilingual mind.

When you know multiple languages, you understand that meaning

is assigned, not inherent. You extract and interpret information

diﬀerently, and you’re more attuned to how words make you feel.

All of that yields beneﬁts, she notes. People who are multilingual

develop critical-thinking and other higher-order skills more quickly

as children. They perform better on executive-functioning tasks like

following multistep directions and staying focused despite distractions.

They draw more novel connections and are more open and accepting

than monolinguals. “If you can appreciate ﬁrsthand the utility and

beauty of another language and worldview, it is not hard to imagine

you are less prone to bigotry, to demonizing things or people who are

# diﬀerent from you,” Marian explains.

The lauding of linguistic diﬀerence continues in A Myriad of Tongues.

Author and language researcher Caleb Everett notes that more than

7,000 languages exist today, although most people struggle to name

more than a few dozen. Historically, academics have looked for

commonalities among languages and focused mainly on those used

by Western, educated, industrialized, rich, and democratic (WEIRD)

societies. But, Everett says, the tide is shifting. Recent research has

focused on how languages diverge—and what those diﬀerences can tell

us about how we think and behave.

His book synthesizes his own and others’ research that brings in data

from non-WEIRD languages and broadens our understanding of how

words aﬀect cognition, including how we process the concepts of time,

space, color, and kinship. In the indigenous Karitiâna language spoken

in northwestern Brazil, for example, the terms used to refer to a relative

depend on the gender of the person speaking, not just the gender of

the person referred to. There’s a sense of symmetry and reciprocity in

Karitiâna that doesn’t exist in English.

Once leaders understand the power of language, they can harness

both diﬀerences and similarities to wield inﬂuence. As Jonah Berger, a

Wharton professor and natural-language-processing expert, explains in

Magic Words, there are speciﬁc words that, when used in the right way

at the right time, are more impactful than others—at changing minds,

engaging audiences, and driving action.

For example, in the workplace, a shared organizational language

(such as start-up founders’ use of the word “pivoting,” retailers’

use of “omnichannel,” or entire teams’ use of more personal

pronouns like “we” or “I” instead of the more distanced “they”) “can

facilitate conversation, make people feel connected, and increase their

perception that they are part of the same tribe,” Berger writes. This can increase feelings of trust and aﬃliation—and even the likelihood of

# promotion.

But when we seek creativity or memorability, a common vernacular

isn’t always a good thing. Tired marketing copy or predictable slogans,

for example, are easy to forget. When unexpected words are assembled

in a distinctive way, they stick. That’s why the musical Hamilton was

such a hit, Berger notes; its style diverged from what theatergoers were

used to.

Berger’s book reinforces my belief as an editor—and should remind

us all—that there’s value in thinking deeply about each word we use:

how it expresses a particular concept or nuance and how people from

diﬀerent geographies, cultures, and backgrounds might experience it.

## And yet, amid so much admiration for the power of words, the

screenwriter and journalist Dan Lyons reminds us in STFU that

sometimes our best move is to stop using them. When you sit back

and let people talk, he explains, you get more and better information.

Listening is a leadership superpower.

Lyons’s book brims with speciﬁc suggestions for how to shut oﬀ—on

social media, at work, at home, in love. We can delete apps from our

phone, keep meetings small and short, stop nagging about chores, and

pause and breathe before saying something that we’ll regret. “All of us,

not just overtalkers, stand to gain by speaking less, listening more, and

communicating with intention,” Lyons writes. We can appreciate words

and language but realize that our sparing and intentional use of them is

# a pathway to happiness.

Lyons helped me pinpoint another thing I love about my tap class—it’s

60 minutes a week when I can let my shoes do the talking.
