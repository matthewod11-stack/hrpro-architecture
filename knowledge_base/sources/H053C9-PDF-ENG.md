As the rainbow ﬂags come down in New York City after the WorldPride

and Stonewall 50 celebrations, and as ﬂags go up for pride events in

other parts of the world, it’s worth asking: where do we stand on global

# LGBT rights?

This year has oﬀered a mixed bag. More jurisdictions, including

Ecuador and Taiwan, have achieved marriage equality while others have

stalled or regressed. Kenya’s High Court upheld a law punishing same-

sex intercourse with up to 14 years in prison, and Chechnya renewed a

## wave of persecution and human rights abuses against LGBT people.

## Across this inconsistent global landscape, multinational companies

with pro-LGBT values face a challenge: How to advance LGBT inclusion

when it conﬂicts with local law or culture. The NYU School of

Law’s Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging team conducted

## interviews with 30 individuals from Dow, EY, and Microsoft to

understand how three major global organizations approached this issue

## in a variety of countries, from Brazil to Japan to Saudi Arabia.

We learned how leaders in these companies move between diﬀerent

models for upholding pro-LGBT values — from simply following local

norms to creating an inclusive environment for their own employees to

advocating for change in the wider society. The interviewees showed

that by cultivating internal pro-LGBT champions and acting with

subtlety and creativity, businesses can promote LGBT inclusion —

not just in locations where legal protections are robust and social

acceptance is high but also, and perhaps especially, in the many

countries where they are not.

# Three Models

## Previous research by the Center for Diversity, Inclusion, and Belonging’s

## faculty director Kenji Yoshino, along with the Center for Talent

## Innovation, reveals that in anti-LGBT countries, global organizations

tend to choose from, and move between, three models of engagement.

In the “When in Rome” model, companies adhere to local norms by

creating exceptions to their pro-LGBT policies. They might, for example,

## avoid LGBT issues in diversity and inclusion programs and refrain from

establishing an LGBT employee resource group (ERG) chapter. This

approach is common in locations where LGBT people face signiﬁcant

legal or safety risks. The model allows companies to avoid potential

backlash from local governments or entities but by deﬁnition does

nothing to foster a sense of inclusion for LGBT employees.

In the “Embassy” model, companies create an inclusive workplace

internally for their LGBT employees without seeking to change laws or

social attitudes. For instance, they might adopt a non-discrimination

## policy, oﬀer training on LGBT topics, and sponsor social activities for

LGBT employees. This approach is common in more moderate locations

where the legal or cultural climate is unwelcoming to LGBT people

but not overtly hostile. The model enables companies to support LGBT

talent, but it doesn’t address the conditions that lead to LGBT exclusion

in the ﬁrst place. When employees step outside the walls of the embassy,

they continue to face discrimination.

In the “Advocate” model, businesses go beyond internal LGBT inclusion

and strive to inﬂuence the local climate. This means engaging in

activities such as lobbying the government, participating in Pride

events, and supporting activists. The Advocate approach is common

in moderate-to-friendly places — like when hundreds of companies

lobbied for marriage equality in the United States — but it’s

## also possible in more challenging locations, like when businesses

successfully lobbied for marriage equality in Taiwan or when Deutsche

Bank boycotted Brunei-owned hotels after the country introduced anti-

# gay laws.

The Advocate model is not without risk: It can provoke governments

## and communities and upset current or potential customers. However, if

a company wants to be a market leader on LGBT inclusion — to recruit

and retain LGBT talent, to appeal to LGBT consumers and allies, and to

help create vibrant inclusive economies — it should strive to become an

# Advocate globally.

The interviewees in our study represented businesses using all three

models. Yet most of them had witnessed encouraging progression

toward Advocacy over time. When we asked how they each moved the

needle in their respective locations, they shared both the successes and

the challenges. Based on that interview data, we suggest three actions

to help companies move from When in Rome to Embassy and three

additional actions to help them move from Embassy to Advocate.

## Three Actions to Move from When in Rome to Embassy

Focus on the concept of allyship: By framing LGBT initiatives as “LGBT

ally initiatives” organizations can leverage the straight and cisgender

majority and build a coalition of pro-LGBT champions at all levels of

## the organization: the grassroots, local leadership, and global leadership.

This can be wildly successful: In the ﬁrst month that the EY Global

Delivery Services business launched its LGBT ally network in India, it

saw 4,000 of its 21,000 people sign up as allies. Allyship also beneﬁts

LGBT employees directly. It allows individuals in hostile locations who

might want to stay closeted to be involved as “allies” and then come out

only if and when they feel comfortable.

Raise awareness: In trying to implement pro-LGBT programs, our

interviewees sometimes encountered pushback from colleagues who

wanted a “don’t ask don’t tell” approach or did not understand why

LGBT inclusion was important. Raising awareness helps overcome

that opposition. Start with the basics: Dow Brazil oﬀered “Diversity

101” education to introduce employees to foundational LGBT concepts

and, in China, the company gave explanations of every word, such as

“How do you deﬁne bisexual? How do you deﬁne queer?” Similarly,

EY provides access to a “Trans and Gender Diversity Toolkit,” which

includes education and resources on leading trans-inclusive practices.

In raising awareness, companies need to customize approaches to the

local culture. One interviewee got minimal turnout in Singapore for

a “lunch-and-learn sharing session” on LGBT rights; the format had worked well in other oﬃce locations but did not ﬁt with Singaporean

culture. To ensure that such initiatives are culturally relevant, involve

# local leaders in the planning process.

Use technology: Where permitted, send e-newsletters or intranet articles

about LGBT initiatives to employees in tougher LGBT locations. Amplify

LGBT content through social media. One interviewee noted that when

EY launched a rainbow version of its logo, its dissemination through

social media “has probably given us more visibility in many of those

tough countries that we never thought we would have visibility in.”

Companies can also use technology for LGBT events to build comfort

levels among participants. At Microsoft in India, employees attended

## an initial LGBT inclusion event primarily via an anonymous Skype call.

Soon after, the company held another ﬁreside chat, which one of our

interviewees proudly noted had “more people in person in the room

than on Skype, willing to ask questions fearlessly.”

## Three Actions to Move from Embassy to Advocate

Strengthen the Employee Resource Group. In most large organizations,

the ERG is the primary vehicle for internal champions to advocate for

LGBT inclusion. Boost its power by providing leadership development

support to its leaders and connecting the group to the company’s

broader diversity and inclusion strategy — including recruiting,

## community engagement, supplier diversity, and marketing. A Microsoft

manager in the United Kingdom observed that one of his biggest

challenges was ﬁnding people to maintain the ERG, which makes

leadership succession planning critical.

Forge external coalitions. Join other companies and non-governmental

organizations to create task forces, host LGBT inclusion events, and sign

## onto global LGBT frameworks, such as the UN Standards of Conduct for

Business. One interviewee took it upon himself to bring 14 companies together at Dow’s oﬃces in Turkey to hold a conference on LGBT

inclusion and share best practices. Once forged, such coalitions can

then engage in advocacy at the country level. Dow, EY, and Microsoft

recently joined more than 200 businesses by signing onto a U.S.

Supreme Court amicus brief to show support for protecting LGBT

people from discrimination under existing federal civil rights law.

Engage in “Embassy-Advocacy.” Identify internal actions that drive

toward the Advocate model without fully embracing it. For example,

after Singapore prohibited foreign companies from funding the local

## LGBT “Pink Dot” festival, Dow hosted its own internal “Pink Dot Day.”

Find small, symbolic ways to indicate support for LGBT rights, such

as providing employees with Pride ﬂags or pins or oﬀering options to

add inclusive language or even preferred pronouns to email signatures

— an eﬀort EY began rolling out in the U.S. last month. Such eﬀorts

allow people to “come out of the closet” as more proactive allies, while

also making the company’s support for LGBT rights visible externally.

In Hong Kong, some recent hires reported that they decided to join EY

because the partner interviewing them was wearing a rainbow pin.

It’s not easy for multinational corporations to move the needle on

global LGBT rights. Yet we need to move beyond the When in Rome

and Embassy models to achieve the goal of true global inclusion

and acceptance. Businesses have a tremendous opportunity to make

## positive change for their employees, communities, and economies.
