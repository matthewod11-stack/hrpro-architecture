## Despite recent calls from public- and private-sector companies to

return to the oﬃce, remote work continues to reshape the modern

workplace. By the end of 2025, 36.2 million Americans, or 14% of the

U.S. adult population, are expected to work from home, an increase

from the 22.5 million Americans reported to have worked primarily from

home in 2023. Organizations continue to wrestle with how to monitor

# out-of-sight employees’ performance.

Many have turned to highly invasive monitoring technologies that

## track productivity metrics, such as keystrokes, mouse movements, and

internet use; record and screenshot employees’ screens; scrape and

read employees’ emails and messages; and even use biometric smart

badges to track employees’ locations and movements. These tools —

now used by approximately 80% of companies — have introduced new

sources of stress for employees while blurring the boundaries between

performance management and digital surveillance, as well as raising

## serious concerns about privacy and trust in the workplace.

Yet, while monitoring tools promise to drive employee accountability

and eﬃciency, recent research casts doubt on these claims,

showing that virtual monitoring can undermine performance,

damage supervisor-employee relationships, and even promote

## deviant behaviors such as cyberloaﬁng, tardiness, time theft, and

inattentiveness. These ﬁndings suggest that, rather than enhancing

productivity, remote monitoring may be stiﬂing your employees’

performance and eroding their trust.

Given the conﬂicting perspectives on the beneﬁts of monitoring — and

the reality that ﬁrms want to account for how their employees spend

their time — we sought to develop a more nuanced understanding

of remote employee monitoring by exploring how, why, and under

what conditions monitoring may yield positive or negative employee

outcomes. Our research suggests that not all monitoring practices

are created equal; their consequences depend on how monitoring is

conducted.

In two studies, we surveyed more than 1,100 U.S. and UK remote

workers, asking participants to answer questions about the actual

monitoring practices at their places of work. In particular, we studied

whether these practices encouraged or discouraged collaboration,

creativity, idea sharing, and trust. We found that some monitoring

methods can indeed foster openness, collaboration, and innovation,

while others lead employees to withhold ideas, disengage, and distrust their supervisors. The key lies in understanding the diﬀerence between

## two broad types of monitoring — observational monitoring and

interactional monitoring — and the impact they each have on employee

# behavior.

# Observational Monitoring

Observational monitoring is the traditional approach most people

associate with monitoring. It involves passively collecting data —

## often through electronic technology — without direct engagement with

employees; for instance, tracking work hours, online activity, or output

through software or using other electronic monitoring technologies

mentioned at the start of this article.

While this method provides managers with a wealth of information, it is

intrusive, often leaving employees feeling scrutinized and undervalued,

which can hamper employee innovation and creativity. Our research

found that remote workers experiencing observational monitoring

reported that they tended not to share ideas, voice concerns, or suggest

improvements for the organization or work unit. In fact, many noted

that they actively withheld these insights, contributing to a workplace

## dynamic that stiﬂes collaboration and communication.

# Interactional Monitoring

Interactional monitoring, in contrast, is rooted in direct, active

engagement. Managers using this approach prioritize regular,

meaningful check-ins with their teams and remote employees

## through virtual meetings, phone calls, and video conferences. These

conversations provide a space for remote employees to share updates,

discuss challenges, and align on goals. For example, a manager might

schedule weekly one-on-one video calls with each direct report to check

in and garner progress updates.

Our study found that remote workers experiencing interactional

monitoring reported that they tend to speak up and voice their

ideas and suggestions for improving the organization. By focusing on

## dialogue rather than data, interactional monitoring fosters trust and

# encourages innovation.

# What Drives These Effects?

Monitoring is a stressful workplace experience for employees, triggering

a range of reactionary responses, depending on how the stressor

is interpreted. Hindrances — often referred to as “bad stress” —

unnecessarily constrain employees and prompt them to withdraw from

their work. By contrast, challenges — often referred to as “good stress”

— promote personal growth and motivate employees to solve problems.

Our studies found that remote employees perceived observational

monitoring as a hindrance, leading them to actively withhold ideas

and suggestions. In contrast, interactional monitoring was viewed as

a challenge, motivating employees to participate and share ideas to

improve their work unit.

We also found that employees’ trust in their supervisors played a crucial

role. Remote employees under observational monitoring reported low

levels of trust their supervisors, which led them to keep their thoughts

to themselves. Conversely, employees experiencing interactional

monitoring reported high levels of trust in their supervisors and felt

more willing to be vulnerable and share new ideas.

Our research also uncovered an important nuance: the negative eﬀects of observational monitoring are ampliﬁed in complex jobs.

Remote employees in complex roles such as software engineering,

product design, or strategy consulting — jobs that demand creative

## problem-solving, ﬂexibility, and even the occasional norm violations

— are three times more likely than those in less-complex jobs to

perceive observational monitoring as a hindrance, and thus withhold

their ideas and insights to a greater extent than their peers in less-

complex positions. Because complex roles require employees to think

## independently and experiment with unconventional ideas, the constant

## surveillance of observational monitoring limits employee engagement

by adding unnecessary stress and eroding trust.

# Recommendations for Managers

Overall, managers should rethink their approach to monitoring their remote workforce. Based on our research, we oﬀer three key

recommendations to help leaders structure their remote monitoring practices eﬀectively:

- 1. Make monitoring a two-way street with interactional approaches.

Shift from relying solely on technology that passively provides data to

active engagement with employees. Regular check-ins — whether daily

## or weekly — provide opportunities for managers and team members

to connect. Use these meetings to gather updates, provide feedback,

discuss progress, align on goals, and understand employee perspectives.

Acknowledging the beneﬁts of interactional monitoring, many

organizations, such as Doximity, Mission Cloud, and SeatGeek,

have implemented interactional monitoring strategies through virtual

chat channels and one-on-one meetings. Other companies have

implemented virtual “open door” hours, which allow managers to

designate speciﬁc times during which employees can drop in for

brief discussions, mirroring the accessibility of an in-person open-

door policy. Blocking oﬀ time for such informal meetings reduces

miscommunication and allows you to keep in touch with your direct

## reports without the need for more-invasive monitoring practices.

- 2. Tailor monitoring to the complexity of the job.

Recognize that, for employees in dynamic and complex roles,

observational monitoring can be particularly detrimental. These roles

demand active dialogue, creativity, and collaboration, which are

hindered by passive oversight. For such employees, interactional

monitoring becomes even more critical, as it fosters the trust and open communication necessary for innovation and eﬀective problem-solving.

Ensure your monitoring approach aligns with the complexity of the job

to support, rather than stiﬂe, employees’ potential.

- 3. Communicate the “why” behind monitoring.

Transparency is critical. Managers should clearly explain the purpose

of monitoring practices and how they beneﬁt both the organization and

employees. Open communication fosters trust and ensures employees

feel respected rather than scrutinized. Keeping an active line of

communication open with your employees is important and helps

ensure they understand the extent to which observational monitoring

practices are being used and why. Employees are more likely to

accept monitoring when they understand how it beneﬁts them and the

# organization.

# Two Caveats

Although our research demonstrates the advantages of interactional

monitoring, one should not conclude that observational monitoring

has no value. Previous studies indicate that under certain conditions,

this type of monitoring can enhance performance and curb deviance.

Our argument relates not to eliminating observational monitoring but

to which types of monitoring organizations should prioritize. When

seeking to foster innovation, communication, and trust among remote

employees, interactional monitoring should take precedence.

That said, interactional monitoring is not without its challenges. Prior

research suggests that excessive and overly frequent virtual meetings

can lead to fatigue and disengagement among employees. Managers

should balance their approach by tailoring meeting frequency to

the actual needs of their team and individual employees, ensuring

that interactional monitoring supports productivity rather than detracts from it. Ultimately, the eﬀectiveness of remote monitoring

— whether observational or interactional — depends on thoughtful

implementation that aligns with the speciﬁc demands of the work and

# the workforce.

. . .

Monitoring is a powerful tool, but its eﬀectiveness depends on

how it is implemented. While observational monitoring can erode

## trust and suppress communication, interactional monitoring builds

relationships, fosters collaboration, and encourages remote employees

to speak up. In today’s remote work environment, managers have the

opportunity to rethink how they monitor their teams. By prioritizing

trust and dialogue over passive surveillance, they can create a workplace

where employees feel empowered to share their best ideas.
