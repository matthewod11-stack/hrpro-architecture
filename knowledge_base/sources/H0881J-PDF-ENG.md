As a leadership and team coach, I frequently encounter situations

where managers feel ill-equipped to give their team members negative

performance feedback. These conversations can be particularly

challenging because the stakes are high for both sides. Unfavorable

performance reviews and ratings come with tangible consequences for

an employee’s compensation and career progression. Further, if the

negative feedback is a surprise to them, it might prompt them to start

looking for a new job.

However, these challenging moments also present opportunities to

strengthen the manager-employee relationship. Here’s how to treat

## diﬃcult performance conversations not as fault-ﬁnding missions, but

instead as opportunities to work collaboratively to deﬁne a shared

# commitment to growth and development.

# Set the Stage for Collaboration

When there’s misalignment between what you expect of an employee

and the work they’re delivering, start by deﬁning what success looks

like and who will be involved in turning around their performance. This

must be a shared goal between you and your employee for them to feel

valued and supported. You can start by stating, “We should have an

honest and open dialogue. My goal is to give you clear feedback and

ensure we are collectively working toward your development.”

# Take a Look Back

During the conversation, take a moment to look back and understand the situation. You can kick this oﬀ by asking them to self-reﬂect and

assess their own performance. For example:

Let’s take a moment to understand how we arrived here and what

factors inﬂuenced our path. I’d like to invite you to self-reﬂect and

assess your own performance. Did you accomplish all your goals

and meet the expectations set? Can you share your perspective on

what’s working well and what isn’t? Looking back, if you had the

opportunity to change or improve anything, what would you do

# differently and why?

# Understand Their Values

Research has shown a strong link between employee engagement and

performance improvement. Employees often prioritize purpose, impact,

and meaningful work, which inﬂuences their sense of engagement and

commitment to the organization. Before initiating a conversation about

performance improvement, take the time to understand the employee’s

values. This helps ground the conversation in personal and professional

growth, aligning organizational goals with their individual aspirations.

During the feedback process, also discuss how their current actions and

performance connect to their long-term career aspirations. Consider

# these prompts:

- When you think about your long-term goals, how does your current

## role contribute to your professional growth?

- Which aspects of your work do you feel align most with your career

aspirations, and how can we build on those strengths?

- Could you talk about any experiences or skills you’re hoping to gain

soon to support your career path?

# Give Constructive Feedback

Deliver feedback with clarity and speciﬁcity. Provide clear examples,

not hypotheticals, to ensure the employee understands exactly how the

work they’re delivering isn’t aligning with what’s expected of them.

# Avoid ambiguity.

## Solicit insights from various stakeholders and cross-functional team

members in order to provide the employee with a more comprehensive

understanding of the situation. Doing so not only gives the employee

a broader spectrum of viewpoints to consider — it demonstrates your

commitment to fairness and inclusivity and fosters an environment of

# openness and transparency.

Moreover, when feedback comes from a collective of voices, it

becomes more diﬃcult for the employee to blame you. Instead, it

emphasizes that the feedback is a reﬂection of broader observations

and perspectives within the team. The focus shifts from assigning blame

toward collaborative problem-solving and growth, as everyone involved

is invested in helping them improve. This stakeholder-centered

approach empowers the employee to recognize the need for change,

take accountability, and assume ownership of their performance

# improvement.

It’s also critical that you leave judgment aside and approach the

discussion as an inquiry, acknowledging the emotional aspect of the

# conversation. For example:

You’re meeting your project deliverables, which is fantastic! However,

this success appears to come at the expense of your cross-functional

relationships. Several team members have expressed concerns about

your ability to perform your project management responsibilities.

They have had to step in and cover for your missed deadlines by

accelerating their work to meet the project delivery. In addition,

I’ve noticed that you seem distracted and aren’t engaging as much

as you could in virtual meetings. This behavior comes across as

disinterested and disrespectful to the rest of the team, and the 360

feedback you’ve received reﬂects this perception.

Create the space for a vulnerable conversation, keeping in mind that

non-work-related issues might be driving your employee’s lackluster

performance. It’s essential to display empathy and openness. You can

do that by sharing a relevant personal experience. For example:

I don’t know if you realize I’m an introvert. Large meetings are very

draining for me, especially when poorly organized. To self-manage,

I architect a well-structured meeting. I prepare a clear agenda and

assign sections of it to speciﬁc team members. Giving everyone a

role in how the meeting runs makes everyone feel involved, sets the

expectation that everyone is accountable for coming prepared, and

ensures no one dominates the conversation. It also allows me to lead

by example: The team sees what a well-run meeting looks like and

how they can adapt the structure for their own meetings.

Ask your employee to share their honest opinion about what is leading

to this feedback, then sit in silence and give them space to share their

thoughts. More often than not, they will take some accountability for

their results. If they don’t, they may not be coachable.

# Give Positive Reinforcement

Now that you’ve taken the time to look back and assess what’s

happening, reset the focus to the present state. Set the tone of the

conversation by acknowledging the employee’s strengths and desire to

do well. Emphasizing empathy and understanding will show them that

the discussion is about growth and development rather than criticism.

You want to communicate that you believe improvement is possible

and that you and the team are here to support them through their self-

improvement journey. As Charles Schwab said, “The way to develop the

best that is in a person is by appreciation and encouragement.”

# Provide an Actionable Path Forward

Consider providing feedback that’s focused on the future and allows

you as the manager to ask the employee to imagine “what if.” For

example, “How would you handle a situation if…?” This forward-looking

reframing of feedback helps remove the stigma of criticism and puts

your direct report in a state of mind where they’re able to accomplish a diﬀerent result; after all, we can’t change the past.

# Reset Expectations

Clearly communicate what your expectations are moving forward.

Ensure the employee understands the standards and is aligned with the

organization’s goals. As author, sales expert, and motivational speaker

Zig Ziglar said, “A goal properly set is halfway reached.”

To encourage dialogue, consider asking questions like:

- What speciﬁc actions or behaviors do you think are needed to align

## your performance with the organization’s goals and expectations?

- How can we collaborate to ensure a clear understanding of

performance standards going forward?

- How can I support you, and what resources do you require from the

## organization (such as training, continuous feedback, check-ins, etc.)?

. . .

Approaching a conversation about improving an employee’s

performance requires preparation, empathy, and a focus on

collaboration. Creating the space for self-reﬂection and an

understanding that change is possible can help the employee move

from feeling victimized to feeling empowered. Even though hearing the

truth about their current performance will be tough and potentially

hurtful, it’s a teaching moment managers must embrace to help them

become more resilient and adept at problem-solving and developing

# professional relationships.
