Conﬂict between generations is an age-old phenomenon. But at the

end of 2019, when the retort “OK, Boomer” went viral, the vitriol — from

both young people who said it and older people who opposed it — was

pointed and widespread.

The sarcastic phrase was coined by a younger generation to push

back on an older one they saw as dismissive and condescending,

and it became popular from Korea to New Zealand even though

the term “Boomer” is barely used outside of the United States. The

retort captured the yawning divide between the generations over

seemingly every issue: political activism, climate change, social media,

# technology, privacy, gender identity.

## With ﬁve generations together in U.S. workplaces for the ﬁrst time

(Silent Generation, Baby Boomers, Gen X, Millennials, and Gen Z),

and similar dynamics playing out in other parts of the world, tensions

are mounting. The anger and lack of trust they can cause hurt team

performance by limiting collaboration, sparking emotional conﬂict, and

leading to higher employee turnover and lower team performance.

And a lack of awareness and understanding of age issues can drive

discrimination in hiring and promotion, leading to lawsuit risks.

But many organizations don’t take steps to address generational issues.

While companies have recently renewed their diversity eﬀorts, only

8% of organizations include age as part of their DEI strategy. And of

organizations that do address it, the strategy has often been to simply

encourage those of diﬀerent generations to focus on their similarities or

to deny the reality of their diﬀerences altogether.

This is a missed opportunity. Age-diverse teams are valuable because

they bring together people with complementary abilities, skills,

information, and networks. If managed eﬀectively, they can oﬀer better

decision-making, more-productive collaboration, and improved overall

performance — but only if members are willing to share and learn

from their diﬀerences. Think of a multigenerational team of product

developers, merging the seasoned experience and broad client network

## of its older members with the fresh perspectives and up-to-date supplier

network of its younger ones. Such a group can use its age diversity to

build something no generation could on its own.

## Take the Open Sustainability Technology Lab at Michigan

Technological University, a multigenerational team that developed the

ﬁrst low-cost open-source metal 3D printer. Former director Joshua

Pearce credits the team’s success to members’ willingness to learn

from those of other generations. To develop their new product, they

needed the technical skills of Gen X faculty, the software wizardry of

## Millennial graduate students, and the experienced resourcefulness of

## Boomer researchers. For example, once when a younger team member

turned to Amazon to order an urgently needed mechanical component,

an older colleague intervened and built it from spare parts more quickly

than even Amazon could have delivered it. By combining abilities, the

team developed the ability to 3D print in aluminum and steel at a much

lower cost than had been possible.

That’s why papering over generational diﬀerences isn’t the answer.

Through our work with age-diverse groups in ﬁnance, health care,

sports, agriculture, and R&D, we’ve found that a better approach is to

help people acknowledge, appreciate, and make use of their diﬀerences

— just as organizations do with other kinds of diversity. Evidence

shows that when time-tested DEI tools are used to bridge age divides,

they can reduce conﬂict and generational stereotypes and improve

## organizational commitment, job satisfaction, employee turnover, and

# organizational performance.

In our book, Gentelligence, we lay out our framework for moving

## colleagues away from generational conﬂict and toward a productive

embrace of one another’s diﬀerences. There are four practices involved.

The ﬁrst two, identify your assumptions and adjust your lens, help

overcome false stereotypes. The next two, take advantage of differences

## and embrace mutual learning, guide people to share knowledge and

expertise so that they can grow together. Each practice also includes

an activity to apply its ideas. Teams experiencing generational conﬂict

## HBR / The Big Idea / Harnessing the Power of Age Diversity

should start with the ﬁrst two; the latter two will help groups move

beyond simply getting along and leverage the learning and innovation

that intergenerational teams can oﬀer.

To introduce the framework, let’s look at what makes a generation —

and what makes generations diﬀerent from each other.

# Generations Today

A generation is an age cohort whose members are born during the

## same period in history and who thus experience signiﬁcant events and

phenomena at similar life stages. These collective experiences — say,

## high unemployment, a population boom, or political change — can

## shape the group’s values and norms in a unique way. Because these

formative experiences vary from culture to culture, the speciﬁcs of

## generational makeup vary around the world.

But across geographies, the diﬀerent outlooks, attitudes, and behaviors

of cohorts can lead to conﬂict. For example, in many countries older

workers, who have dominated the workplace for decades, are staying in

it longer due to better health and longevity. Younger colleagues, anxious

for change and upward mobility, are often impatient for them to move

on. And when Boomers and digital natives work side by side, tensions

can arise about whose contributions are valued more. If the client

database that an older employee developed is replaced by automated

software suggested by a younger associate, the older employee may feel

that their contribution is being minimized.

These generational frustrations have become even more pronounced

during the pandemic. As people of all ages have left their jobs in the

so-called Great Resignation, older and younger workers are competing

for similar roles. While older workers have more experience, the 35-and-

under age groups, according to a recent survey of hiring managers,

are seen as having the most relevant education and skills and the best

cultural ﬁt for open positions. Even as people ﬂocked online during

the pandemic, diﬀerent generations tended to spend time on diﬀerent

platforms — older people scrolling Facebook, younger ones TikTok —

deepening the digital divide. Gen Z employees, meanwhile, have worked

remotely for most if not all of their professional lives, leaving many

feeling disconnected from coworkers and undervalued by their older

teammates. And older generations have adjusted to working from home

better than expected, ﬁnding the ﬂexibility energizing after a lifetime of long hours at the oﬃce.

Many of these tensions — and the media hype around them — have

led to a further decline in trust between the generations. The steps we

outline in the four practices and activities below are designed to help

bridge that gap and move toward better intergenerational cooperation.

# How Are Generations Defined?

In the U.S. there are currently five generations in the workforce: the

Silent Generation (typically considered to have been born 1928–1945), Baby

Boomers (1946–1964), Gen X (1965–1980), Millennials (1981–1996), and Gen

Z (1997–2012).

Each experienced different world events as members came of age, which

shaped their views on jobs and careers — and fueled the stereotypes that

people have about them. For example, members of the Silent Generation

had more prosperity in their adult years than their parents did; they earned

a reputation for doing what was asked of them without complaint and

building secure lives for their families. Boomers grew up amid economic

growth and possibility, relishing long hours at the office and becoming

known as workaholics. Gen Xers enjoyed more independence as children

than prior generations, leading them to crave greater autonomy and balance

in their careers, which then led to their being seen as slackers by their

elders. And Millennials, whose development was actively nurtured by their

parents from an early age, have come to be seen as expecting rapid career

# advancement.

Other parts of the world don’t necessarily label generations this way;

instead, specific age cohorts often acquire a name when their births or

childhoods coincide with events of particular culture relevance. Examples

include the “little emperors” of China, born during the country’s one-child

policy; the “born frees” of South Africa, who arrived after apartheid ended;

and Kenya’s Uhuru (“freedom”) Generation, born after the country gained

independence. In Sweden cohorts tend to be grouped by decade, but even

that can spark tension. Notably, a politician stirred controversy in the early

2000s by coining the name köttberg, or “meat mountain,” to describe

workers born in the 1940s, whom he saw as limiting youth employment.

Around the world, those born recently (such as late Gen Zers and

Generation Alpha in the United States) are being shaped by the Covid-19

pandemic. Their early experiences of life, school, and their parents’

jobs have mostly been in lockdown and on Zoom. So their ideas and

expectations of the workplace will almost surely differ — dramatically —

from those of the generations that preceded them.

# Identify Your Assumptions

The assumptions we make about generational groups (including our

own) can hold us back from understanding teammates’ true selves

as well as the skills, information, and connections they have to oﬀer.

Noticing that we’re making these assumptions is the ﬁrst step to

combating them.

Take headlines such as this one from 2019: “Why ‘lazy,’ ‘entitled’

millennials can’t last 90 days at work.” As is often the case, the

stereotype on display falls apart on closer inspection. Pew Research

Center has found that 70% of Millennials, who are currently aged 26 to

41, stick with their employers for at least 13 months; 69% of Gen Xers

## stayed that long during the same period of their lives.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Harnessing the Power of Age Diversity

Not all biases are blatant enough to make headlines. But even beliefs

that we hold at the subconscious level can inﬂuence our interactions

and our decision-making, often without us realizing it. For example,

imagine being asked to nominate a few teammates to lead an Instagram

campaign. Who comes to mind? Probably some of your 20-something

colleagues. Consciously, you may believe you are choosing those who

are the most qualiﬁed, most interested, and most able to beneﬁt from

the experience. Unconsciously, you may be falling back on deeply

embedded assumptions that older people dislike technology or are

uninterested in learning anything new.

When it comes to conﬂict on intergenerational teams, people often

rightly suspect there’s something age-related going on, but they

frequently assume it means something other than what it really

does. Let’s look at how this played out on one team we studied.

At the Fung Fellowship at the University of California, Berkeley,

leaders created teams of undergraduates and retirees to collaborate

on wellness products for older adults. Initially, these teams ran into

several interpersonal challenges. For example, when the retirees didn’t

respond quickly to texts sent by their younger peers, the students felt

that their counterparts weren’t taking them or the project seriously.

Meanwhile, the retirees resented their teammates’ assumptions and

seemingly haphazard communication. Work slowed as relations became

strained.

Such teams need a tool to recognize the speciﬁc age biases they may

hold, understand tensions that exist, and head oﬀ brewing conﬂict. We

recommend an assumption audit.

## HBR / The Big Idea / Harnessing the Power of Age Diversity

## A conversation with Miami University professor Megan Gerhardt on

benefiting from generational differences. To listen to or read a full

# transcript of this IdeaCast, click here.

Activity: Assumption Audit. Challenge employees to spend a week on

high alert for age-based assumptions in their daily work. Have them

pay attention to their own actions as well as others’. This might mean

noticing, for example, that a team leader dismissed a young employee’s

request for more responsibility as “entitled” behavior or that you left

## senior employees out of your meeting on innovation.

After the week has passed, schedule time with the group to discuss their

experiences, asking each person to bring at least one observation to the

table. These conversations can get charged or lead to defensiveness, but

clear ground rules can go a long way in preventing those outcomes.

Instruct people to speak about what they heard and saw but not

to assume intent: “Input from our younger teammates is dismissed

quickly” rather than “Senior leaders dismiss our younger teammates’

input because they don’t think they have anything to oﬀer.” Encourage

everyone to be open to feedback and to consider how age-based

assumptions — whether containing some truth or absolutely false —

might be aﬀecting team cohesion, engagement, and performance.

Plan a follow-up meeting for several weeks later to continue the

conversation, ensure accountability, and start building awareness into

# your everyday work.

When the Fung Fellowship program leaders did their own assumption

audit to uncover why the undergraduate-retiree teams were struggling,

they found that younger team members had assumed that texts sent

after hours would be deemed urgent and would get a quick reply.

But older peers thought it went without saying that a text could wait

until morning. Identifying these assumptions prompted the team to set

shared norms around communication.

# Adjust Your Lens

Recognizing assumptions is important, but teams also need to combat

them. Stereotypes often cause us to incorrectly attribute diﬀerences to

age or to assume ill intent where there is none. Adjusting your lens

means considering whether the assumptions that you’ve identiﬁed align

with the reality of the situation at hand, or whether you’ve been judging

someone’s actions and attitudes based only on your frame of reference.

Try to understand why colleagues from diﬀerent generations might

behave diﬀerently than you do. To expand your thinking in that way,

## use the describe-interpret-evaluate exercise.

## Activity: Describe-Interpret-Evaluate Exercise.

Developed in the 1970s to prepare employees to work

abroad, this exercise can also help members of age-

diverse teams broaden their understanding of one

# another.

First, have each employee describe a frustration they have with someone

of a diﬀerent generation. Next, ask them to think about their initial

interpretation of the person’s behavior. Finally, challenge them to come

## up with an alternative evaluation of your interpretation; they can also

# ask for contributions from the group.

For example, recently one of us (Megan) conducted a workshop with a

group of health care professionals. A nursing manager who identiﬁed

herself as a Baby Boomer described being annoyed with young patients

who used their mobile phones in the middle of a conversation with

a nurse or a doctor. Her interpretation was that the patients were —

rudely — not paying attention to their caregiving team. When prompted

to think of alternative explanations, she looked confused, unable to

come up with anything. But her colleagues — mostly younger doctors

and nurses — had plenty of ideas: The young patients might be taking

notes on the conversation or looking up the pharmacy’s hours to make

sure they could get their prescriptions before closing. As her teammates

oﬀered these insights, the nursing manager’s expression changed. She

was able to see the behavior in a diﬀerent light and better appreciate

the patients’ perspectives. At the same time, her younger colleagues

realized how behavior that felt natural to them — like checking a phone

mid-conversation — might oﬀend older peers.

# Take Advantage of Differences

Once you’ve tempered generational tensions by recognizing

assumptions and adjusting lenses, you can work on ﬁnding productive

## diﬀerences with your colleagues of other generations and ways to

## beneﬁt from each other’s perspectives, knowledge, and networks.

For team members to feel comfortable sharing in this way — bringing

up new ideas or conﬂicting information — they need to feel a certain

## amount psychological safety, as the research of Harvard Business

School’s Amy Edmondson shows. But, as we’ve seen, perceived

generational competition in the workplace, exacerbated by clickbait

headlines, has undermined trust. One good way to rebuild it is to hold a

roundtable where the team’s diverse perspectives can be acknowledged

and valued.

## Activity: Intergenerational Roundtable. Leaders of

intergenerational teams should set monthly or

quarterly meetings to elicit ideas for how to work

together more productively and smoothly. There are

# two stages to the process:

1.

- 1. Find common ground and similarities. While it may seem

counterintuitive to focus on commonalities when the goal is to

leverage diﬀerences, team members must ﬁrst see themselves

## as collaborators on a joint mission, rather than competitors.

Furthermore, research shows that having a common purpose

and goals are vital to team performance. Intergenerational teams

can struggle more than most to ﬁnd that shared ground. So at

your ﬁrst roundtable, ask teammates to work together to answer

questions such as “Why does the team exist?” and “What shared

goals do we want to accomplish?” This helps team members begin

to see themselves as uniﬁed in pursuit of the same interests and

builds psychological safety. At future sessions, remind them of

# these discussions.

- 1. Invite unique viewpoints. Next, have each team member respond to

# the following questions:

- What are we, as a team, doing well to accomplish these shared

# goals?

- What are we doing that is keeping us from reaching these goals?

- What opportunities should we take advantage of that we currently

aren’t?

- If you were in charge, what would you continue, stop, or start

doing?

Your aim is not to come to neat conclusions but to surface new ideas

that might have been dismissed or unvoiced in the past. Diﬀerent

views will inevitably surface, and some conﬂict may even erupt —

that’s all right. Just keep bringing the conversation back to the team’s

shared goals and emphasize that diﬀerences of opinion are valued

## contributions toward your common success.

Wells Fargo we’ve interviewed, holds monthly roundtable meetings

with his multigenerational team. At the beginning of each, Hornbrook

reminds everyone that their mission is to help customers with their

application- and account-related questions and that success will require

both trust and willingness to listen to the perspectives of the entire

group. His eﬀorts have borne fruit: For example, his Millennial and

Gen Z employees feel comfortable voicing their concerns about mental

health in the workplace — a subject previously considered taboo by

some of their older colleagues. These conversations helped Hornbrook

and other senior colleagues understand why paid-time-oﬀ requests

had spiked recently and prompted them to ﬁnd ways to reduce

employee anxiety, including by requiring supervisors to hold one-on-

## one meetings with direct reports in conference rooms rather than at

their desks. As a result, team members of all generations became more

supportive of people taking mental health days.

By creating a space for team members to discuss how the group

functions, managers demonstrate that all perspectives are valued.

# Embrace Mutual Learning

Finally, to fully reap the beneﬁts of intergenerational teams, members

must believe that they have something to learn from colleagues in

diﬀerent age cohorts. The ultimate goal is mutual learning: peers of all

ages teaching and learning from one another in an ongoing loop.

One way to encourage this is with formal mentoring initiatives. While

traditional mentoring programs (older colleagues teaching younger

ones) exist at many organizations, a number of top companies —

## including GE, Deloitte, PwC, Cisco, and Procter & Gamble — have

developed “reverse mentoring” programs, where younger people teach

older peers new skills, typically around technology. We suggest that

companies and even managers of small teams combine both approaches

into two-way “mutual mentoring.” Research shows that such programs

support employees’ development of competencies and skills and

increase both individual involvement and collective motivation.

Mutual learning can also happen organically when people of diﬀerent

generations have good relationships and are on the lookout for

opportunities. BuildWitt Media, a digital storytelling ﬁrm we’ve studied,

helps its clients in the construction and mining industries attract great

talent. Its founder and CEO is 26-year-old Aaron Witt; its president,

Dan Briscoe, is 53. While cross-generational learning was never an

explicit reason for their partnership, they have come to value how

Briscoe’s 30 years of experience in leadership, sales, and marketing

complement Witt’s impulsive energy, sense of business trends, and

lifelong immersion in mobile media. For example, Briscoe credits Witt

with teaching him to look beyond academic degrees and GPA when

hiring and to consider leadership potential and alignment with culture

and values in addition to a work portfolio. Witt says Briscoe is good

at relating to clients and putting deals together. This partnership, they

agree, has led to rapid growth and the opportunity to diversify their

# services.

Activity: Mutual Mentoring. To start building a

mentorship culture on your team, create an informal

mutual mentoring network. Begin by asking team

members of all ages what they want to learn and what

they want to teach. Potential teachers can be

surprisingly shy when it comes to their expertise; it

may help if you make suggestions about what you see as their strengths.

Identify where there are natural connections: employees who are versed

in TikTok and those who want to learn to create selﬁe videos, or

employees who have an established roster of clients and those who

want to expand their networks. While not all pairings need to be cross-

generational, make sure all generations are represented in both the

# learner and the instructor groups.

Once you have some pairings ready, hold a kickoﬀ meeting with the

entire team and ask four to six mentors to present brieﬂy on their area

of expertise. Encourage people to reach out to the mentors whose skills

they want to learn. Often the energy of the meeting itself will spur

connections, but you can also send monthly nudges to remind the team

to keep questions ﬂowing.

Even this kind of informal network can help to build a culture of cross-

# generational learning.

. . .

## “OK, Boomer,” “Gen X cynics,” “entitled Millennials,” and “Gen Z

snowﬂakes.” We have become so entrenched in generational name-

calling — or, conversely, so focused on downplaying the diﬀerences

that do exist — that we have forgotten there is strength in age diversity.

Especially at a time when we are wrestling with so many changes to the

way we work, it’s incumbent on leaders to embrace intergenerational

teams as a key piece of the DEI puzzle and to frame them as an

opportunity to be seized rather than a threat to be managed.
