In September 2016, Wells Fargo announced that it would pay $185

million to settle a lawsuit ﬁled by federal regulators and the city and

county of Los Angeles, admitting that employees had opened as many as

## 1.5 million accounts without customer authorization over a ﬁve-year

period. These unethical practices resulted in an immediate drop the

company’s stock prices and it continued to underperform by a signiﬁcant

# margin.

Wells Fargo’s CEO attributed the banking scandal to bad apples at the

company who were ﬁred (some 5,000). But former workers spoke out,

saying that they were ﬁred despite being “good apples” who had contacted

the company’s ethics hotline with concerns about fraud and an unhealthy

sales culture. Several employees said they were ﬁred after blowing the

# whistle.

This massive breach in ethics, one of the largest in recent years, stands in

contrast to the company’s then-publicly stated mission to “satisfy our

customers’ ﬁnancial needs and help them succeed ﬁnancially.” Sadly, even

authentic, high-purpose CEOs and their companies can succumb to short-

# term pressures for proﬁts.

Throughout my consulting work, I’ve discovered that honest conversations

are a crucial tool in helping leaders and their organizations successfully act

on their ethical ambitions. If you’re a CEO who aspires to lead ethically

and with high purpose, consider the following strategies.

# Start within.

The road to your higher ethical ambition starts with personal reﬂection

about your values and purpose in life. Take the time to have an honest

conversation with yourself to help ﬁgure out what matters to you, and

where your ethics lie.

To start, write down key decisions you made in your life (for example,

choice of job, spouse, and friends) and then ask yourself what motivated

these decisions and what they say about you. For example, a newly

appointed division manager, trained in accounting, reﬂected on why he

chose to work for his company despite better offers and realized that it was

the friendly, collaborative, and ethical culture. He then used this

information to help deﬁne who he wanted to be as a leader.

# Align your senior team.

Start a conversation with your senior team members. What are their

aspirations for the kind of company they want to create? This type of

discussion will allow you, the leader, to test your own advocacy, and then

lead your team to a consensus statement. Here’s how one CEO went about

developing his company’s statement of purpose:

In one of my ﬁrst meetings with the senior team, we talked about

what kind of legacy we wanted to leave. The team had a lot of energy

for this. Everyone had something to say about it, and we put all the

ideas up on the wall. We then looked for commonalities around what

kind of difference we wanted to make. All of the ideas had to do with

people, touching people in a positive way, and giving people a chance

to grow. Today, we don’t talk about vision, but about the legacy we

are trying to build.

Be prepared to be derailed.

Unfortunately, at some point, pressure to meet shareholder expectations

will derail your aspiration to lead with a higher purpose and values.

Research shows that there is an inevitable gap between what we humans

espouse and what we actually do. The same is true for CEOs and their

# companies.

Don’t let your organization get caught off guard when things don’t go as

planned. Schedule routine conversations to check-in on your

organization’s ethical ambitions. I’ll explain more about how to execute

# this in the next section.

Don’t wait for the whistle to blow.

In too many companies, lower-level employees fear speaking truth to

power about misalignments with purpose and values. To help combat this,

my colleagues and I developed the strategic ﬁtness process — a structured

process that allows senior managers to lead conversations that uncover the

whole truth about how their organization really works. It also helps senior

management rest easier, knowing that they are not just waiting around,

hoping the whistle doesn’t blow.

To understand what the strategic ﬁtness process looks like in action, let’s

look at a company that discovered that their practice of quarterly channel-

stuffing (shipping large amounts of unrequested products to distributers)

was inconsistent with their values and purpose, and was in turn, damaging

## distributer and employee trust, loyalty, and commitment, and not

# surprisingly performance.

To start the strategic ﬁtness process, the CEO and his senior team ﬁrst

developed a two-page statement of direction that communicated their

strategy and values. Then, a task force of eight was commissioned to

## interview 100 people in the organization — key leaders and individual

contributors two to three levels below the top — about the alignment of

the organization with their stated strategy and values. At this part of the

process, organizational strengths and barriers to executing their direction,

including channel stuffing, were identiﬁed.

They then held a structured meeting where they laid out ground rules —

no blaming, defensiveness, or emotional outbursts — that allowed the task

force to report honestly on the barriers they found. The structured

conversation helped the CEO and senior team truly listen and understand

the issues. As the CEO later said, “The truth was compelling, and it made

clear we had to act and on what to act.” Channel stuffing was suspended

immediately even though quarterly earnings for the year would not match

Wall Street expectations, and the stock price would suffer a decline.

Moreover, it stopped a practice that later became illegal and for which a

company in the same industry was ﬁned $800 million.

Consider what the CEO and senior leaders of Wells Fargo might have

learned if they wanted to. They would have had the chance to change

## unethical practices, instill pride in and commitment to the company by

employees and other stakeholders and avoid ﬁnancial and reputational

damage before the whistle was blown. If you aspire to lead ethically and

with high purpose, you must consistently have these honest conversations

## with yourself, your team, and your organization.
