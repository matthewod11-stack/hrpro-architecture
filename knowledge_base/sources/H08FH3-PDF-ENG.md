These days, many workers are experiencing strained or fractured

## relationships between themselves and their work, their coworkers, their

leaders, and their employers. This is evidenced by quiet quitting, the

Great Resignation, and the broken contract between employers and

# employees.

In a misguided attempt to stop the fracturing, many leaders are

demanding that employees physically return to the oﬃce. Whether it’s

three days a week or six days a month, their message is clear: We want

you back because we believe that’s how we can keep people connected.

The rationale is that when employees are connected with each

other, that connection drives greater innovation, collaboration, and

engagement. Although it’s true that strong social connections can lead

to these outcomes, return-to-oﬃce policies are not always having the

intended results. In actuality, we’re seeing that productivity can drop

when people are forced back, and many employees continue to reject

the return to oﬃce, sometimes resulting in organizations losing their

# most tenured employees.

An exploration of existing research suggests that critical evidence is

missing from the connections-at-work conversation, and this shortfall is

leading organizations and leaders astray.

# Four Kinds of Workplace Connection

Connection in the workplace is commonly thought of as a single

dimension that prioritizes interpersonal relationships with co-workers.

Indeed, research shows social connection is extremely important.

## However, in a recent interorganizational research collaboration, the

## research team at the NeuroLeadership Institute (NLI), along with

technology ﬁrm Akamai, identiﬁed that connection in the workplace is,

in fact, made up of four interrelated and essential elements: employee

## connections with their colleagues, leader, employer, and role (CLEAR).

## Above and beyond the return-to-oﬃce debate, this more accurate

and nuanced view of workplace connections has implications for

how organizations can design intentional talent strategies to create

workplaces where employees are committed, engaged, and performing.

Thinking about CLEAR connections is a step in the right direction to

stop fracturing and start healing in some organizations, or to maintain

and amplify what is already going well in others.

# Colleague Connection

Imagine a time in your career when you worked with people you truly

trusted and liked. More than simply enjoying each other’s company, you

worked together to give and receive support. What you’re remembering

is a strong example of colleague connection.

Colleague connection includes opportunities for collaboration and

interdependence with other employees, the social support that’s given

and received, and the inﬂuence of these factors on team performance.

This is arguably the one that most of us think about when we envision

workplace connection. While it’s important (strong social support at

work has many positive outcomes), it’s only one element in a larger

## conversation about workplace connections.

# Leader Connection

Think about the leaders you’ve had during your career. Hopefully,

you’ve had at least one leader who provided access to opportunities and

a reasonable degree of autonomy for how to complete your work. This

leader was likely a strong communicator, providing clarity around

expectations and giving useful and balanced feedback about your

performance and potential. Research has found that 70% of the variance

in team engagement can be attributed to a manager, making it clear that

leader connection is a critical component of the workplace connections

# conversation.

# Employer Connection

You may or may not have worked at a place where you felt like

your values aligned with those of your employer, your work richly

contributed to the goals of the organization, and you found meaning in

what you did. If you’ve had an opportunity to work with an organization

that met those needs, you likely felt a boost of employer connection.

When there’s low employer connection, going to work can feel like the

proverbial “clocking in.” Lack of employer connection can not only

inﬂuence an employee’s job performance, but it can also inﬂuence the

talent an organization attracts.

# Role Connection

Psychologist Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi researched and wrote about the

idea of “ﬂow”: the experience of being so absorbed in an activity that

other things seem to almost fade away. While most of us won’t ﬁnd a

role where we spend the majority of our time in a ﬂow state, we can

deﬁnitely gather insights about what motivates us and ﬁnd ourselves in

satisfying roles.

When we experience role connection, we have a clear understanding of

what our job is, we’re engaged in what we’re doing, and we have insight

into how we can advance. When we have role connection, we are lifted

up by the work we do.

# The Nature of CLEAR Connections

Akamai and NLI have been gathering and analyzing data to test

and reﬁne this framework using a combination of questionnaires and employee data. Early results suggest that diﬀerent employees have

unique needs surrounding each type of connection. One employee

might deeply value leader connection, spending a lot of time one-on-

one with their manager, not collaborating much with their peers, and

barely thinking about their organization’s mission. Their focus might be

on building a strong partnership with their leader and working together

to explore advancement opportunities. Motivating this person requires a diﬀerent path than the path for another employee who most highly

values colleague connection.

Our connection preferences can also wax and wane depending on

what’s going on in our lives. For example, an employee who previously

had a strong preference for colleague connection might get married,

take up an all-encompassing hobby, or experience some other life event

that materially alters their desire for partnership at work. While the

basic elements in each of the pillars are largely universal — meaning

that most employees expect the minimum requirements of working

with helpful peers and leaders, being respected in their jobs, and

working for a reputable company — the degree to which they want and

expect more will vary.

## CLEAR Connections and the Return to Office

Through the lens of CLEAR connections, let’s analyze what may be

happening when employers issue return-to-oﬃce mandates. Colleague

connection may increase, because employees are milling about

## the same oﬃce and beneﬁtting from random and serendipitous

interactions. But at the same time, leader connection might decrease,

because employees feel their supervisors don’t understand their

motivations or don’t care about the impact of the return-to-oﬃce

## mandate on their autonomy and their lives. Employer connections

can also take a dive as the desire to work hard to see the company

succeed is undermined by a feeling of betrayal. And without clear and

unambiguous links to why employees need to be back in the oﬃce, role

connection can be negatively impacted, as people believe they’re being

evaluated based on their attendance more than on their performance.

Focusing on only one pillar of the CLEAR connections model, therefore,

is clearly detrimental. When leaders are making a return-to-oﬃce

decision, they should keep in mind that there will never be a single

policy that’s fair for everyone. Instead, leaders may rely on the idea

## of the patchwork principle and strive for a portfolio of policies that

incorporate all four pillars of connection.

At this moment in work, when employers and employees are

contending with lagging engagement, rapid and constant change, and a

general lack of trust, getting workplace connections right is a business

imperative. As such, it’s crucial that business leaders move beyond a

one-dimensional view, and get clear on what workplace connections

really are and how to leverage them to create the best outcomes for their

employees and business. Having a conceptual framework for the type of

workplace connections employees value is a step in the right direction

## toward better motivation strategies, as well as better decision-making
