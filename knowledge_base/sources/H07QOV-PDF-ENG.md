It’s OK to Fail, but You Have to Do It Right Failing once at something new is an experiment, and experiments are crucial to success. Failing twice at the same thing might be more accurately called a mistake.

When you or your team try new things — and not all of them succeed —

that’s called experimentation. Learning from experiments is essential

for your company’s growth. On the other hand, when you deviate

from proven practice because of inattention or lack of training, that’s

probably a mistake. It’s critical to know the diﬀerence, and to create

a workspace where individuals feel psychologically safe to take smart

# risks.

For this episode of our video series “The New World of Work”, HBR

editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Harvard Business School

## professor Amy Edmondson, an expert in psychological safety and

author of the upcoming book Right Kind of Wrong: The Science of Failing

Well, to discuss:

- Productive, intelligent ways to fail

- Dangers of not experimenting enough

- Balancing individual employees’ needs with those of the team and

# organization

Edmondson says that leaders should do a thorough post-mortem after

every failure, whether it was productive or not, to ensure that it does not

repeat itself. “A failure, even an intelligent failure, in new territory, new

discovery, is no longer intelligent the second time it happens.”

“The New World of Work” explores how top-tier executives see the

future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for

success. Each week, Ignatius talks to a top leader on LinkedIn Live —

previous interviews included Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and former

PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. He also shares an inside look at these

conversations —and solicits questions for future discussions — in a

newsletter just for HBR subscribers. If you’re a subscriber, you can sign

AMY EDMONDSON:

Great to be here, Adi. Thanks for having me.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Your book is primarily about failure. I was under the impression that

we all understood that failure is noble and not shameful, and provides

useful learning lessons. But you’re writing a book that seems to be

saying that we need to think hard and maybe diﬀerently about failure.

What are you trying to accomplish with this book?

AMY EDMONDSON:

I was with you and then I poked around and realized that the truth is

many people were still confused about failure. There is a lot of happy

talk about failure out there. There’s the virtual mantra of Silicon Valley

to fail fast, fail often, failure’s good, let’s learn from failure, let’s have

failure parties, let’s have failure resumes and so forth. And the truth is,

the future of work will be riddled with failure. We can’t just wish it away,

even if we wanted to, we have to work with it.

But I think no one can really take to heart the happy talk about failure

unless they have a coherent framework. You could think of it as two

camps: the Silicon Valley fail fast, fail often camp. And then the other

camp, which is, “I live in the real world, failure’s not an option.” And

they’re both right or they’re both partially right, but neither is terribly

# helpful nor context speciﬁc.

So I think the happy talk, when it’s not qualiﬁed with a coherent way

of making distinctions between the good kind of failure and the not-

so-good kind, is possibly more destructive than helpful. It drives the

honest conversation underground. It’s important to talk about the kinds

of failure for which we really should be welcoming it with open arms

and the kinds where we maybe shouldn’t.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I think the best thing you can say about failure is if you have a culture

that permits failure, that tolerates failure, it means you’re stretching,

you’re pushing, you’re trying to innovate, you’re trying to do things that are diﬃcult. That’s part of the deﬁnition of what a digital company is. A

digital company experiments frequently and tries and fails, and is able

to tolerate failure. I would guess if you talk to most companies, they’d

say, “Yeah, we do that. That’s the culture we have. We didn’t used to, but

we do that.” So I want to push you a little bit more: the rhetoric, that’s

the happy talk, but in reality that’s not really how the world works?

AMY EDMONDSON:

First of all, it’s not how most incentives are set up. I’m not saying

uniformly that’s the case, but most of the time, failure is not rewarded in

organizations, and people would rather do anything but fail.

And you’re right, maybe a better way to talk about this is not as failure,

but as experimentation. We have to be very pro-experimentation. But

we have to be pro-smart-experiments. And I think smart failures are the

# result of smart experiments.

Smart experiments are ones that happen in new territory — honestly,

if you can look up the answer, ﬁnd the recipe, ﬁnd the blueprint,

please do, no need to experiment — new territory in pursuit of a goal

that’s consistent with the value proposition of the organization, with a

hypothesis you’ve done your homework on and importantly, as small as

# possible.

Those are the kinds of both experiments and failures we must welcome

with open arms. They are discoveries and they allow us to ﬁgure out

quickly what to try next. But a portion of the book is devoted to best

practices for failure-prooﬁng that which can be failure-proofed. The

activities, the operations in your company that are in known territory,

are ones that should be well set up to make failure extremely rare.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Are there industries that do not tolerate failure? Airline pilots? You

don’t really want them to fail. This isn’t a rhetorical question. Are there

industries that really don’t tolerate failure? And can you look at them

and say, “You actually can get interesting results if you have that kind of

# policy?”

AMY EDMONDSON:

Let’s start with airlines because clearly none of us want them to be

comfortable with failure. Yet I think the reason why airlines have an

extraordinary record of success and safety is because they’re willing and

able to talk about failure. The failures that they do tolerate happen in

the simulator. There’s training, there’s a lot of emphasis on speaking

up early to prevent something worse from happening. So their safety

record does not come from being intolerant of failure, but rather being

# intolerant of major accidents.

Therefore, we have to be very tolerant of the reality of human error so

that we can catch and correct, we can train, we can allow people to take

the kinds of risks and experiments we were just talking about in safe

## settings like the simulator, not in the execution of the real duties.

But I don’t think it’s possible to describe industries in the way your

question implies. I think there’s variation across companies. Pick an

industry like fast-moving consumer goods. It’s going to be not that hard

to ﬁnd diﬀerences in cultural failure tolerance within those industries

across companies. So a more sensible way to put that is that some

companies are doing better than others in having a healthy tolerance

# of intelligent failure.

ADI IGNATIUS:

What does a productive failure look like? You did mention that there are

good and bad failures. What’s the diﬀerence and how does one try to

make sure their failures are the good kind?

AMY EDMONDSON:

In known territory where we have a process or a formula for getting the

result we want, it’s best practice to use that process, use that formula

and get the result we want. So when a Citibank employee a number

of years ago accidentally made a small human error and accidentally

wired $800 million to a client that he shouldn’t have, that was a basic

unproductive failure. Turns out they were not even able to get the

money back. So, not celebrating that kind of failure.

A productive failure is one where we get new and useful knowledge,

new knowledge that helps us go forward in creating the kind of value

we’re trying to create in our market, for our customers. So we discovered

something that we could not have discovered without trying it, without

# the experiment.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Would you recommend that there be an elaborate postmortem? I think

the military is very focused on doing detailed postmortems: what

happened, what went wrong, why? Presumably to learn from that and

not have it happen again.

AMY EDMONDSON:

It is not the case that a postmortem has to take inordinate amounts

of time, but it should be thorough. It should be analytical, and look

carefully at the diﬀerent facets of the failure, to understand accurately

what happened and why, for the express purpose of preventing that

exact failure from happening ever again. So a failure, even an intelligent

failure, in new territory, new discovery, is no longer intelligent the

second time it happens.

ADI IGNATIUS:

I want to shift gears a little bit to talk more generally about the

workplace. The question really is: Are we OK? You wrote a recent piece

in Harvard Business Review that suggested maybe things are not so

## great, with relatively low levels of engagement and productivity, high

rates of burnout. We can speculate as to why that’s true, but is that

accurate? It’s hard to generalize, but you know, are we suﬀering? And if

so, how do we respond to that as managers?

AMY EDMONDSON:

Well, I don’t have a kind of systematic worldwide dataset from which I

can make solid inferences about how people are doing. My impression

comes from informal conversations, qualitative research, reading HBR

and so many other outlets, to see how people are doing. So really, in a

way, I’m commenting on the conversation in HBR and so many other

## business media contexts, maybe LinkedIn and elsewhere.

One thing I think I can say for sure is that the anxiety is real, and

people are worried about the future. They’re worried about it on so

many fronts. They’re worried about climate change. They’re worried

about AI. They’re worried about burnout, as you mentioned. I’ll come

# back to burnout.

But that anxiety tends to push us toward a retreat to our individual

corner, and people start to think, “Am I going to be OK?” They become

more focused on their own wellbeing than on the health of the team

or health of the organization. And that gives rise to a real potential for

erosion, even vicious cycles, where organizations ﬁnd themselves in the

trap of responding to requests and issues in isolation, one by one.

We need a more holistic way of thinking about it. And I see limited

evidence of companies being at least described as pausing to think

about the larger picture, their value proposition, what it implies for how

they must be structured and led, to get the necessary work done, and

how to organize that work, with all its variety and variable needs, in a

thoughtful way, and how to inspire and motivate people to do it well.

Let me just brieﬂy go to the burnout issue, because there actually has

been some recent data, some studies that have caught my eye, showing

that burnout is systematically higher when psychological safety is

lower, right? For instance, it seems to me that some portion of the

burnout is associated with loneliness and isolation. I think it’s fair to say

that we can endure many challenges when we feel genuinely that we’re

in it together, that we’re connected and engaged with our colleagues in

trying to sort of navigate these challenges.

ADI IGNATIUS:

One can’t help but think, “Okay, is some of this related to the

pandemic?” Which for many of us, broke up teams, created new work

environments with work from home, that in many ways is fantastic for

people who are balancing their work and life. It must take a toll on

maybe the teaming imperative that you’ve written about. Is that your

# hunch?

AMY EDMONDSON:

I do think the pandemic took a toll on us, on all of us. It created such

an obvious uncertainty. It was such an obvious disruption. It wasn’t the

gradual shifts that we’re normally used to. It was a very abrupt shift,

and it gave rise to wonderful—and I think productive—experiments on

# diﬀerent work arrangements.

Now it’s time for a very systematic assessment of what’s working and

what isn’t? And it can’t be incremental, right? And it also can’t be based

on what people say they want. Because oftentimes, what we say we want

is not actually what we need or truly want in the longer term, bigger

picture, to get where we need and want to go.

ADI IGNATIUS:

You talked a second ago about trying to have a comprehensive policy

and approach that, if I heard you right, is not dealing with people always

individually, but that’s sort of the nature of management now. Suddenly,

managers are expected to be, in addition to everything else, almost like

psychiatrists, that there’s an openness for people to share their personal

situations, challenges, problems, and that it’s the role of the manager,

increasingly, to engage with that in an intelligent way. So you end up

where management becomes hyper-personalized, but I think maybe

you’re already on to the risks in that, which is losing the sense of the

# teaming and the collective eﬀort.

AMY EDMONDSON:

It’s almost as if we’ve lost sight of tensions and trade-oﬀs. There will

always be a tension between me and we, right? There will always be a

## tension between my desires in the moment and my aspirations over the

long term. If you ask me what I want: pay me inﬁnitely and don’t ask

me to do anything, and let me eat ice cream all day, right? But that’s not

going to get me where I really, really need to go, and want to go. I want to

make a diﬀerence.

I think we’re in a moment of not helping people value the collective. As

human beings, we’re social creatures. That’s part of it, but it’s also that

we want to matter. We want to matter to others. We want to matter in

some way that’s larger than ourselves and our hedonistic desires.

You can think of an old-fashioned management theory of the ﬁrm,

right? If markets worked by themselves, we would just have only contractors doing tasks, and it would be eﬃcient, it would be sensible,

it would be logical. But it doesn’t work, because a lot of the work we

have to do is inherently collaborative, and dynamically so. And it isn’t

easily parceled out, dividing-and-conquering style. It requires us to

really work together in meaningful ways. The good news is, that can

be a very engaging, rewarding, exciting experience. The bad news is, it’s

not easy to manage.

But I think we can go down that rabbit hole of each person has to

be managed diﬀerently, each person, you’re almost a psychiatrist to

that person, versus let’s step back and rethink, how do we design our

activities, our operations, so that we create the most value for those we

# serve?

ADI IGNATIUS:

Yeah, I love that, and I have to say that I don’t think companies have

ﬁgured that out yet. The disruption of Covid opened our eyes to some

ﬂexibility. But I think the things you’re putting your ﬁnger on, we’re

trying to solve for that, and I think a lot of us haven’t yet and need to

keep experimenting.

So we’re in this age of anxiety, where there’s burnout. And then, you

throw on top of that generative AI, and a fear—possibly irrational,

possibly not—that generative AI will be able to do all of our jobs at

almost no cost. I assume you haven’t done quantitative research. But

qualitatively, what’s your advice for people as generative AI enters

the workplace at every level and the possibilities become clearer and

# clearer?

AMY EDMONDSON:

As you indicated, it’s a little outside my wheelhouse, except for the

eﬀects on people and culture. I speak from the perspective of someone

listening at the margins to the many conversations in work and social

gatherings alike, and I think you’re right. I think fear is the dominant

emotion, that certainly some are excited, some are super optimistic

about the amazing changes to come, but I think casually I hear more

# fear than optimism.

The truth is we need both. We need some positive, thoughtful, design-

oriented approaches to experiment and ﬁgure out what’s going to work.

## HBR / Digital Article / It’s OK to Fail, but You Have to Do It Right

But I don’t think they’re going to be simple solutions to the dramatic

shakeup of what’s possible.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Here’s a question from Omar from Monterrey, Mexico. What kind of

metrics can be used to measure smart failures?

AMY EDMONDSON:

My ﬁrst response is that it’s a good idea to have metrics. One of the

things that I’ve spent the most time studying is how many failures just

don’t even get the chance to be measured, because people don’t speak

up about them. This was how I got into this topic in the ﬁrst place: the

## discovery of dramatic diﬀerences across groups, even within the same

organization, and their willingness to speak up about things that go

wrong rather than just things that go right.

Here’s the challenge more broadly than just people not necessarily

speaking up: the category of intelligent failure covers vast territory.

I think the metrics have to be tailored to the context — and let me

illustrate vast territory. A well-run clinical trial on a new cancer drug is an intelligent failure when it turns out it doesn’t have the eﬃcacy that

we hoped. It was in new territory. There was no other way to ﬁnd out but

to do a clinical trial. It’s the right size, it’s no bigger than it has to be. It’s

# hypothesis-driven in pursuit of a goal.

But so is a really bad blind date. That’s intelligent failure. Maybe your

friend thought you’d like each other. You are willing to go out and have a

coﬀee. Smallest possible new territory in pursuit of a goal, all the rest. So

a bad blind date and a failed clinical trial are clearly apples and oranges,

yet they both qualify under the category.

## HBR / Digital Article / It’s OK to Fail, but You Have to Do It Right

I think the best way to answer the measurement question is, let’s make

sure the criteria are adhered to. And then, let’s think about what the

right frequency is, given the work we’re trying to do, of intelligent

# failures?

Another way to say that is: What’s the right frequency of

experimentation? How often should we be trying new things to push the envelope, to discover new possibilities, even to discover eﬃciencies?

And are we doing that often enough? The answer is usually no, because

most of us would rather succeed than fail, and most of us would rather

keep doing what we’re doing because we’re kind of good at it.

ADI IGNATIUS:

## So here’s another question along those lines from Mohammed in

Pakistan. Employees may be hesitant to oﬀer feedback that could be

perceived as negative, which can impede professional development,

hinder organizational progress. How does one tackle this situation?

AMY EDMONDSON:

Such a good question because it’s true. We are very reluctant to do things, to speak up with negative or diﬃcult information, because

frankly it will always be easier not to. It will always be easier to hold

back than to speak up candidly and forthrightly about something that

you hope could be made better.

The way to make this very diﬃcult thing easier is to set the stage by

pointing out how valuable it is. Periodically, I would say even frequently,

refer to the fact that “We need to do this hard thing. We need to do it

well if we want to be as good as we can as a team.”

But even individuals who have the ambition to grow and develop in

their roles and in their careers have to train themselves to be willing to

do this and receive it because of its value. So we’ve got to call attention

to its value. We’ve got to call attention to the fact that it’s hard and then

do it anyway and support each other.

ADI IGNATIUS:

This question is from Don from Calgary in Canada. If it’s true that

we learn acutely from mistakes, what are some ways to encourage

permission from our leaders who may be risk averse?

AMY EDMONDSON:

We’re all risk averse, and maybe leaders even more than others, maybe

not. But ﬁrst of all, I make a distinction between mistakes and failures.

I’m not anti-mistake because I’m a human being, and I make them, we

all do.

But a mistake is not the same thing as a failure. A failure is something

that went wrong that we wish were otherwise. A mistake is a deviation

from a known practice. Now, that could happen because of inattention,

because of lack of training, because of exhaustion, you name it.

But I think it’s helpful for leaders, and others for that matter, to talk

about the reality that we will make mistakes because we’re human. The

very best practice is not to never make a mistake. It’s to catch and

correct them quickly, and then also to make that distinction between

smart experiments in new territory that we also want to see more of

because it’s the secret to future value creation. And we welcome those,

# too.

ADI IGNATIUS:

Furthering that, here’s a question from Benny from California. What’s

the best way to speak to subordinates after a failure to boost morale and

communicate that, “This was a good failure. It’s OK”?

AMY EDMONDSON:

I’m going to say “honestly.” You can be honest about, “Wow, this was

disappointing for all of us, and let’s get everything we can out of it.

Let’s learn as much as possible.” And in fact, given that something

substantial that goes wrong nearly always has multifaceted aspects to

it, it’s helpful to have a thoughtful and data-driven conversation about

what happened. Not “Who did it?”, but, “What happened?”

We may go around the team and ask, “What did you see?” And we’re

really looking for what happened, what contributed to that, and that’s

both commission and omission, things that you did that may have

contributed, things that you didn’t do that may have helped. It’s

a thoughtful, deliberately learning-oriented conversation designed to

help us be better next time.

ADI IGNATIUS:

How do you reenergize your team these days? How do we reenergize our

team particularly now, in 2023, where it feels like there’s a lot of stuﬀ

swirling around?

AMY EDMONDSON:

It starts with personally taking the time to reconnect with your own

sense of purpose for doing the job, the role that you are currently doing.

And consider why it matters to you and why what you are doing or

leading matters to the world.

Having done that, share it. Share it often and then just as quickly invite

others in to help navigate the necessarily stormy waters that lie ahead. I

think it starts with you and then it’s an honest sharing of why you care,

why it’s challenging, why you very much need and are interdependent

with others. Because all of us want to be needed. We want to be needed.

We want to matter.

ADI IGNATIUS:

The last few years, with the pandemic, I’d say certainly in the U.S.,

there’s been increased attention to social issues, which on the one hand

I think felt right to people in the workplace. On the other, it brought

more challenges into the workplace. One imagines there’s a pendulum,

and it might swing between leadership needing to be very empathetic

to, I don’t know, the backlash if that’s the right word. Leaders need to

achieve productivity. That’s what it’s all about. Do you believe in that

pendulum or are we in a diﬀerent place? And if you do, where are we

# right now on that swing?

AMY EDMONDSON:

I believe in the pendulum. I believe that the pendulum happens and

I believe there may be a better way. It’s often thought of as empathy

versus productivity. And I looked this up actually: Productivity is

deﬁned as the eﬀectiveness of productive eﬀort as measured in terms

# of the rate of output per unit of input.

The ﬁrst problem is that not all work is easily measured for productivity.

The second problem is, often it’s not the right way to measure

excellence. Productivity is often a short-term measure, and it has

## limited predictive value for the future performance of the ﬁrm. For

example, one way to be really productive is to just push people to their

limits. But that has time constraints. Eventually they will burn out,

leave, etc. It’s like Buckminster Fuller used to say that it was foolish

to burn down the house to keep warm on a cold winter’s night. The

excessive pressure can be the equivalent of that error.

And also innovation work in particular, we have case study after case

study where the work actually suﬀers when productivity metrics are

brought to bear.

In a way, I wish the pendulum were more about excellence than

productivity, because I think productivity is really tricky and variable

# to measure.

I see the pendulum existing, but maybe it’s a false dichotomy. Maybe it’s

not empathy versus productivity. Maybe we need smart, caring leaders

who understand the importance of both. And given that that’s very

challenging, they’re open about it being challenging. They’re asking

for help. They’re sharing the burden of caring and excellence with

their teams and considering, again, the fundamentals of what it is the

organization must do well to stay alive in its market, to perform in its

market. And talk about it honestly.

I sometimes think we don’t talk often enough about the fact that work

is work. It’s supposed to be a little bit of work, but that doesn’t mean it
