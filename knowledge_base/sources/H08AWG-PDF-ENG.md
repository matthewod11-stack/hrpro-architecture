Workers — particularly those considered “knowledge workers” who are

able to do most if not all of their work with a laptop and an internet

connection — have been ﬁghting for the right to maintain control over

their time for years. While working from home in 2020 and 2021, they

demonstrated to their bosses that they are able to maintain, or in some

cases even increase, their productivity while working ﬂexibly. Their

bosses, on the other hand, have been pulling them in the opposite

direction; executives and managers have been ﬁghting to get workers

back into the oﬃces that companies are paying a lot of money to lease. This struggle has aﬀected workers and companies alike. Workers quit en

masse during a period that became known as “the Great Resignation,”

and employers who instituted return-to-oﬃce mandates have struggled

to hire and retain top talent. Now, especially with Gen Z making up

an increasing share of the working population and the conversations

around hybrid work and returning to the oﬃce stagnating, demands for

increased ﬂexibility in work arrangements are still top of mind for many

# employees and job seekers.

Although many of these dynamics have been in the headlines since

2020, they are not actually new. According to data from the Bureau

of Labor Statistics, resignations have been steadily increasing for more

# than a decade.

Part of the reason for this increase, it seems, is that workers have been

contemplating the kinds of lives they want and reﬂecting on the role

they want work to play in their lives. The reality is that people spend

a lot of their lives working, and because of that, people’s day-to-day

work experiences have a substantial impact on how satisﬁed they are

with their lives. The relationship between work experience and life

satisfaction has long been established, but given the recent struggles

between workers and employers, we wondered how factors related to work ﬂexibility might aﬀect that satisfaction.

Does having control over their time actually make workers happier —

and more likely to stay in their jobs? To ﬁnd out, we analyzed survey

## data from the National Study of the Changing Workforce, a nationally

representative sample of 1,516 workers in the United States. It contains

measures like whether people feel like they have enough time, how

much control they have over their work schedule, and how satisﬁed

they are at work and in life. These measures allow us to examine the

relationship between how people experience their time and their well-

being — both at work and overall.

Previous research has documented that how people experience time —

and in particular, whether they feel they have control over their time — aﬀects their motivation to work toward a variety of long-term goals.

We wanted to know whether those dynamics operated in a similar way in the modern workforce. We also wanted to understand the diﬀerence

between feeling like you don’t have enough time to do the things you

need to do (referred to in this line of research as a sense of time scarcity)

and feeling like you don’t have control over your time. These feelings

can go hand in hand, but they don’t always. For instance, you might feel

a sense of time scarcity when your schedule is ﬁlled with tasks you don’t

have time to complete, even if you have total control over that schedule.

We found a few key patterns that can help us to collectively understand

## the tension between employees and employers in the conﬂict over

whether (and how often) employees should be required to return to the

oﬃce. First, people who had greater control over their time — that is,

who had more ﬂexibility in their work schedules — had the highest job

satisfaction and overall satisfaction with their lives. Second, those who

felt a sense of time scarcity had less satisfaction with their jobs and were

less satisﬁed with their lives. These ﬁndings mean that feeling like you don’t have enough time and feeling like you don’t have control over the

limited time you do have are both negative predictors of well-being.

The third key ﬁnding — which is particularly important in light of

contemporary discourse — is that the number of hours people worked was not related to how satisﬁed people were with their jobs. Finally,

for those who had more control over their time, having scarce amounts

of time — that is, feeling time scarcity — did not undermine their job

satisfaction as much as it did for those who had less control over their

# time.

Taken together, these ﬁndings tell us a few key things about workers

and their experiences in the modern workplace. First, job satisfaction is

not just about how much work employees have to do. Some employers

(and too many pundits) have recently been arguing that “nobody wants

to work anymore.” Our analyses do not support that (cynical) view of

contemporary workers. It is not the case that employees who work less

are more satisﬁed than those who work more.

Instead, the driving factor behind worker satisfaction seems to be how

much control over their time workers feel they have. Employees are

not resisting the oﬃce because they don’t want to work or want to

work less; instead, they want to be able to control their time — to do

some chores between Zoom meetings, for instance, or get more regular

exercise instead of spending 10 days per year (or almost a year of one’s

# life) commuting.

To meet employees’ diverse needs, employers should engage in

continuous dialogue with workers to understand their desired degrees

of structure and autonomy. Employers can institute workplace policies

that create ﬂexibility and control for workers, including remote, hybrid, or asynchronous work options and leave policies that aﬀord employees

more time with their loved ones. In addition to helping employees be

more satisﬁed at work and potentially increasing retention, these types

of policies can also help organizations become more accessible and

# equitable.

There are, of course, some limitations to our ﬁndings. Our analyses

are correlational by nature — we did not randomly assign workers to

## diﬀerent work arrangements and track changes in their satisfaction over

time. (We do think more experimentation of that sort would beneﬁt

the research literature on the future of work.) Another limitation that

we mentioned earlier, but is worth repeating, is that the dynamics we

have written about do not generalize to all types of work. Some jobs

simply cannot be made ﬂexible; there are essential jobs that require

## in-person work for those workplaces (and our society) to function. We

have focused mostly on higher-wage jobs that can be made ﬂexible; that

ﬂexibility matters for those employees. Finally, while we have generally

discussed the beneﬁts of ﬂexible work arrangements, it is possible that

there is such a thing as too much ﬂexibility. Some employees beneﬁt

from more structured work arrangements and mentoring opportunities,

suggesting a need for both ﬂexibility and structured support even in

remote work environments, as can be the case with employees starting

## their careers. As workplaces navigate future work arrangements, it will

be important for them to ensure that their workers get all the support

they need.

As many organizations continue to wrestle with how to structure

work policies, now is the time to ﬁgure out how to grant employees

control over their time in ways that can motivate them to do their best

## work, and experience greater satisfaction in both work and life. In our

research we found that employees who have greater control over their

time tend to be more satisﬁed with both their work and their lives. This

suggests that work arrangements that grant employees more control

and ﬂexibility may not only improve employee well-being, but may also

help employers retain the top talent they’ve been struggling to keep.
