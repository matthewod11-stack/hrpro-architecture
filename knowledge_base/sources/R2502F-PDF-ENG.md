In a globalized world, businesses increasingly look to international

markets for growth. But cutting deals across borders is diﬃcult. Teams

of individuals from various cultures must negotiate in the face of diﬀering expectations about not only the outcome but also the process.

The parties may lack both a common language and shared working

norms, complicating an already complex endeavor.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

In bridging these gaps, negotiators are often left to fend for themselves,

relying on anecdotal or conventional wisdom that has little bearing

on the negotiation at hand. Or they may turn to academic or other theories that seem to explain cultural diﬀerences but generalize

about cultures as a whole, ignoring individual variances. All this may

encourage dealmakers to overascribe negotiation diﬃculties to cultural diﬀerences.

In one contract negotiation we studied, a German negotiator attributed

problems with his Chinese counterpart and the deal’s stalled progress to

his lack of understanding of Chinese culture. The Chinese negotiator repeatedly rejected terms oﬀered by the German, even when they

aligned with international standards. Instead, he pushed for terms that

he claimed met local Chinese standards. When asked for evidence, the Chinese negotiator seemed oﬀended and said that the German

negotiator should trust his word.

Later in the negotiation, after they had agreed on several points, the

Chinese negotiator kept reopening issues while presenting no legitimate

reasons for doing so. He consistently pushed to improve the terms of

the deal to his advantage and rejected counterbalancing suggestions,

slowly but surely transferring more value away from the German

negotiator. Whenever the German negotiator objected, his counterpart

stated that this was necessary to build a long-term partnership the

Chinese way. Only much later, after coaching by a negotiation expert,

did the German negotiator realize that his counterpart had been using cultural diﬀerences as a smokescreen for questionable and adversarial

# behaviors.

So how can negotiators successfully navigate the complexities of

culture? We’ve been researching, teaching, and advising on cross-

cultural negotiation and multicultural teamwork as well as conducting

negotiations ourselves for a collective ﬁve decades. Through this work,

we’ve come to realize that the secret to good outcomes in cross-cultural

contexts involves respecting four basic rules: First, look past cultural diﬀerences and focus instead on individual players. Second, work out

whether your counterpart is seeking to exploit a perceived advantage or

is interested in generating value for both parties. Third, create shared

norms for the negotiation (rather than adapting to the other party’s rituals). Finally, leverage the diﬀerences in preferences between parties

to improve outcomes for everyone. Following these four rules will help

you create a stable and lasting deal.

Let’s begin by looking at why it’s best to focus on the person rather than

# the culture.

# [ Rule 1 ]

## Negotiate with the Person, Not the Culture

Culture can be deﬁned as the operating system through which we make

sense of and interact with the world. Culture inﬂuences our behaviors

and perceptions as we go about our day-to-day business. A very strong

culture can foster ethnocentrism—an assumption that one’s own norms

are or should be shared by everyone. This is a recipe for conﬂict.

There are many dimensions along which cultures can vary, such

as tolerance for risk and how to handle conﬂict. Communication

is another obvious one. Israelis, for instance, are generally direct

and straightforward in communicating, whereas Mexicans tend to be

indirect in giving feedback, especially on sensitive issues. Of course,

individuals may hew to their cultures to a greater or lesser extent. Some

Mexicans are very direct, and some Israelis are far from straightforward.

In some contexts, the various dimensions can serve as a framework for

interpreting and for setting behaviors. For example, INSEAD professor

Erin Meyer advises that when adapting to a new culture, people should

strive to behave according to the midpoint of the local range on a given

# cultural dimension.

## But in a very speciﬁc context like a negotiation, knowledge of local

culture is of limited value because your counterpart may not represent

its norms. Imagine you are preparing to negotiate with an Angolan

executive, and you have read widely about Angolan cultural norms in

preparation. Unbeknownst to you, however, your counterpart was born

in Angola of foreign parents, educated in a British school there, traveled

to France to continue her studies, married an Indian partner, converted

to Islam, worked in sales for a U.S. company and then in procurement

for a Japanese corporation, and has been living in China for the past

11 years. This executive is unlikely to be prototypical of her national

culture, and thus you should be careful when using your research to

make assumptions about her behavior.

In a negotiation, you are trying to understand the individual in front of you. And in this context, a focus on cultural diﬀerences may encourage

unconscious stereotyping—that is, narrowly classifying and attributing

expected behaviors to others. This creates two risks:

Negative perceptions. Stereotypes may foster perceptions of cultural

superiority or inferiority, leading to a sense of entitlement or a lack

of empathy toward the other party. That can feed a rationalization for

# conﬂict.

Presumption of universality. Stereotyping disregards the individuality

and diversity present within any culture, which may blind negotiators

to opportunities for positive outcomes and learning from their

# counterparts.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

Another reason to focus on the individual rather than the culture in a

negotiation is the infeasibility of becoming an expert in the customs

and norms of all the geographies in which one might do business.

For example, an executive responsible for the EMEA region may have

morning negotiations with counterparts from Turkey and South Africa,

followed by lunch with her boss who is expatriated from South Korea,

then a meeting with executives from Ethiopia before closing a deal in

the late afternoon with UAE nationals. The agenda for the next day might involve an entirely diﬀerent set of nationalities. And even when

you are dealing with a single foreign country, teams may include people

# from multiple backgrounds and cultures.

All negotiations should begin with the question, “Does my counterpart want to work with me or against me?”

In such situations, it is nearly impossible to memorize and leverage

all the cultural dimensions relevant for each interaction. What’s more,

trying to be all things to all people only encourages your counterparts

to question your integrity. You will constantly be outside your comfort

zone, which makes you more vulnerable to ignorance, doubt, insecurity,

# and exploitation.

We believe that one key to a successful cross-cultural negotiation is, to

some extent, taking culture out of the equation. Business negotiators

often have much in common with their counterparts—maybe even

more than with their parents, partners, or children. After all, our

international counterparts may be closer to us in age, education level,

professional interests, the corporate world they operate in, or functional

expertise. For these reasons we advise negotiators in cross-cultural

settings to focus speciﬁcally on their counterparts, learning their own

## particular intentions, rituals, and preferences.

A British negotiator from a London-based family oﬃce negotiating with a Japanese executive oﬀers an instructive example. Instead of assuming

that his counterpart would exhibit common Japanese cultural traits

## such as a preference for indirect communication, formality, or long

investments in relationship building, the British negotiator observed

how she actually behaved.

From the start, he saw that she was extremely friendly, shook his hand,

greeted him in English with a slight American accent, and explained

that she valued quick decision-making and innovation, having worked

at a tech startup in Silicon Valley for many years prior to creating her

own venture in Japan. She was candid, quick to share ideas, and clearly

signaled her intention to collaborate. Noticing those traits, the British

negotiator reciprocated with an equally open, collaborative style, which

helped them establish a strong working rapport.

# [ Rule 2 ]

# Identify Your Counterpart’s Intentions

All negotiations should begin with the question, “Does my counterpart

want to work with me or against me?” The role culture will play in the

negotiation is largely determined by the answer to this question.

If the counterpart is a win-win or, better still, a value negotiator—

that is, someone who is ready to pursue his or her goals without the use of power—cultural diﬀerences become operational challenges to

be solved together. But if the counterpart is a win-lose or, worse, a

power negotiator—ready to use whatever power is in his or her arsenal

to secure negotiation success—the person will harbor adversarial

intentions and is likely to use cultural diﬀerences as a tool for

exploitation. That was the case for a Singaporean executive negotiating

with a Swedish counterpart. He intentionally drew out discussions

and withheld clear responses, capitalizing on the discomfort people

from the Swedish culture tend to have with ambiguity. The Swedish

negotiator fell into the trap and started to concede on certain points just

to move things forward.

In another deal we studied, one of the negotiators, perceiving a slight

power advantage, intentionally set tight deadlines and emphasized the

need for quick responses. Her goal was to pressure her Vietnamese

counterpart, recognizing that his preference, typical of his culture, was

for consensual decision-making and conﬂict avoidance. She justiﬁed

her moves by claiming that they were standard procedures in her

culture and that since they were negotiating in her country, the

Vietnamese executive should adapt. Through these power tactics, she

pushed the Vietnamese negotiator into operating outside his comfort

zone, which caused him to make mistakes and bad decisions. He

ultimately ended up making an unfavorable deal.

The best way to gauge your counterpart’s intentions is to make your own explicit, because this typically encourages reciprocal behavior.

No amount of cultural savviness will stop win-lose negotiators from

trying to use power-based moves—such as lies, threats, abuses,

manipulations, and ultimatums—to get what they want, often at the

counterpart’s expense. Win-win negotiators choose collaborative, non-

power-based strategies to reach a favorable deal with their counterparts.

They rely on enhanced communication, trust building, emotional

intelligence, rational decision-making, and creativity to help both

parties identify risks and opportunities and work together toward good

outcomes. This approach is easier to implement if your counterpart is

also a win-win negotiator, but it is often the best approach to get what

you want from a win-lose counterpart. Instead of ﬁghting ﬁre with ﬁre,

win-win negotiators change the game and use water so that no one gets

burned. That said, a win-win approach is not without its risks, because when poorly done you may come oﬀ as weak, desperate, or indecisive.

The ﬁrst eﬀort, therefore, of a cross-cultural negotiator is to cut through

the cross-cultural noise and zero in on intentions. Doing so will help you

anticipate and interpret your counterpart’s behavior and actions and

clarify your own. The best way to gauge intentions is to make your own

explicit, because this typically encourages reciprocal behavior. It can

also reduce your counterpart’s fears and resistance to the negotiation

and open a path for a more-collaborative process and superior outcome.

Throughout the negotiation, take care to explain your intentions and

continually probe your counterparts about theirs as well. It can help to

ask yourself two sets of questions:

What do my counterpart’s moves signal? Was that a win-win or a win-

lose move? Is it contradictory to or compatible with previous moves?

Does it make sense to me? Could I be misinterpreting it? Are any of my

counterpart’s moves unfamiliar or surprising to me?

What have my own moves signaled? When I say something I consider to

be positive, does my counterpart seem to appreciate it? When I raise a

sensitive matter, does the person seem to understand its gravity? When I

make a complex point, does the person seem to have grasped it? When I

say something negative, is my counterpart’s reaction appropriate to the

message? Is the person’s body language compatible with the discussion?

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

Is the person correctly interpreting and communicating back what I’ve

said or done so far?

Let’s look at how you might do that in a speciﬁc instance. When shaking

hands in a ﬁrst negotiation encounter, many people believe they should

shake hands ﬁrmly to signal their commitment to working together. But

in some cultures, a strong handshake may be seen as an attempt to

# intimidate or assert dominance.

If you go in with a ﬁrm handshake and see

a negative reaction, explain the intention

behind your gesture: “It seems that I

squeezed your hand unexpectedly hard. In

my culture, strong handshakes are usually

a way to show enthusiasm and an intention

to collaborate. Until now, I thought it was

something everyone did. I apologize if my

actions sent the wrong message.”

Heiko Hellwig photographed the complex choreography of Siamese fighting fish for his series Grand Ballet.

Conversely, if you were on the receiving

# end of such an unexpectedly strong

handshake, remember the heightened

potential for cross-cultural misunderstandings before reacting

negatively. Adopt a principle of charity in interpreting the behavior and

say: “That is a ﬁrm handshake indeed. I assume that you are signaling

your commitment to this negotiation. I appreciate your gesture.”

Casting people’s words and actions in a positive light may look naive,

but it is a best practice in cross-cultural negotiations—even if you are

facing a win-lose counterpart. If the gesture was indeed the expression

of a good intention, you’ve shown that you understood and have

validated the behavior. If the counterpart had a win-lose intention,

you’ve shown that the person’s power move did not faze you, thus

reducing the odds that the domineering behavior will continue. Even

if it persists, you’ll have given an early warning that you will not be

intimidated.

# [ Rule 3 ]

# Don’t Adapt Rituals, Co-Create New Ones

Cross-cultural negotiations are further complicated by rituals—the

established and sometimes symbolic actions, behaviors, or even

ceremonies through which people convey messages and meaning

within a social or cultural group. If all members in a group accept and

adopt similar rituals, social interactions become smoother, faster, more

pleasant, and automatic. In other words, rituals are culturally approved

shortcuts for communicating important messages eﬃciently within a

group. They facilitate the process of relationship building.

## But among people from diﬀerent cultures, variances in rituals may

expand the communication gap and cause misunderstanding and

conﬂicts. Unfortunately, people often express themselves or act without

thinking consciously about how others who are unfamiliar with their

rituals will interpret their words, behaviors, and moves. For negotiators, this can hamper eﬀorts to build a trusting relationship and increases the

chances that benign behaviors will be misconstrued as adversarial.

Note that diﬀerences in rituals have an impact not on what the parties

want but on how they prefer to achieve their goals. Some cultures—

and individuals—tend to be rigid with time or deadlines; others are

lax. Some like to tackle problems head-on; others like to go around

them. Some like to talk straight; others are more indirect and careful.

Some prize independence and empowerment; others prefer collective

# decision-making and consensus-building.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

Many negotiators attempt to show respect by adapting to their

counterpart’s rituals. That is a dangerous negotiation approach—even

more so if you face a win-lose counterpart intent on taking advantage of

you. As we saw with the German negotiator earlier, when you adapt to

your counterpart’s rituals, you cede the power to determine what is or

is not appropriate in your negotiation. Similarly, forcing counterparts

to adapt to your rituals is a win-lose move; the cognitive challenge

of negotiating outside their comfort zone will likely compromise their

# performance.

# Heiko Hellwig

Instead of adapting, cross-cultural negotiators should create a new set

of desired rituals together. They should engage in open conversations

to deﬁne what a good relationship means, decide how much time they

are willing to invest in building it, and lay out the process for working

# together.

This can be challenging. Negotiators should make their own rituals

explicit up front, share the intentions behind them, and discuss how

adopting each other’s rituals may introduce diﬃculties. In one instance

of this, two teams from Switzerland and Spain were starting a long-

term negotiation that would require regular meetings. Aware of their wide cultural diﬀerences, the teams jointly created a simple, shared

document, which they named hoja de ruta (road map), written in

Spanish because one of the Swiss team members was ﬂuent in the

language. In this document, they outlined the ﬁve positive behaviors

they expected from each other during the negotiations, codifying

collaborative intentions on both sides. Then they created a ritual

around it: At the start of meetings, each person would brieﬂy share

a positive hoja de ruta behavior performed by a member of the other

## team. Deviations from the desired behaviors or necessary updates to the

document were also discussed. This ritual allowed each negotiator to

connect with and feel appreciated by the other team, while explicitly carving out time to discuss their relationship-building eﬀorts and

direction. It helped set a positive, collaborative tone, which became

the foundation for mutual understanding—without team members’

needing to become experts in each other’s cultural practices.

In any cross-cultural negotiation, it is important for teams to have

ongoing conversations about their shared rituals and behavior. Skipping

or phasing out these conversations usually results in negotiators from

each side defaulting to their preferred ways of operating and increases

## the odds of misunderstanding and miscommunication.

If adapting to another culture’s ritual appeals to you, then go ahead and

enjoy the experience, but beware of the implications and the cognitive

toll it may take on your negotiation performance. Otherwise, negotiate

## new rituals for communication and relationship building that will

satisfy, not compromise, most team members’ preferences and avoid

forcing anyone to adapt or be at a disadvantage. For example, when

non-U.S. negotiators meet, they sometimes choose to build from U.S.

rituals (given their prevalence in the global business world) as a neutral

foundation that is somewhat familiar to both sides.

# [ Rule 4 ]

## Leverage Differences in Preferences, Not in Power

As we’ve seen, win-lose negotiators try to leverage power, often using cultural diﬀerences as a way to improve their position or

conceal predatory behavior. But in win-win negotiations, each side

leverages preferences: inclinations toward options, objects, experiences,

# or outcomes.

In the negotiation literature, there is a famous story about two sisters

ﬁghting over the last orange in the house. Their mother takes it, slices

it, and gives each daughter half an orange. Shortly after, the mother sees

the younger sister discard the peel and eat her half, feeling only half

satisﬁed. She later sees the older sister remove the peel on her piece and

discard the fruit, using the peel to bake only half of an orange cake. Had

the mother known about her daughters’ preferences before cutting the

orange, she could have given the younger sister the whole fruit, and the

older sister the whole peel. The younger sister could also have opted to

split her fruit with the older one and help her bake the cake, in exchange

for a slice of the cake once done.

In business negotiations, most people want the same things: to close

successful deals, make money, minimize risks, feel appreciated, and be seen as a good negotiator. The diﬀerences are not so much what

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Secret to Cross-Cultural Negotiations

negotiators want but how much each of those things matters relative

to one another. For example, most cross-cultural negotiation experts

point out that people from many Asian countries, which are often

more collectivist in their cultures, signiﬁcantly value saving face in negotiation and are willing to make extra eﬀorts to burnish their

reputations. We know of no culture that dislikes being respected, but

Asian negotiators generally put saving face higher on their preference

# list than people from other cultures.

It’s important to recognize that while intentions and cultural rituals

make negotiations harder as they diverge, the reverse happens with preferences. The more preferences diﬀer among negotiators, the easier

it is for them to make deals that create value for both sides. If I value

money and you value time, you can pay me a premium to expedite the

outcome. If I value risk and you value security, you can buy insurance from me. By leveraging diﬀerences in preferences—which are often

more abundant in cross-cultural negotiations—dealmakers may ﬁnd

more ways to increase value for both sides.

To return to the example of saving face, if a negotiator from an Asian

country values saving face in a deal, a counterpart from another culture who values that less could turn the diﬀerence into an equal exchange:

“I appreciate that you value saving face in this deal. I value stability

and predictability. Please let me know how I can help you, and please

share how you can help me so that we can both get what we want.” If you feel that this approach may be too direct, you can oﬀer a selection

of options—some that prioritize saving face and some that do not—and

observe the reaction to gauge your counterpart’s preferences.

. . .

No matter how faithfully you try to respect the rules we’ve outlined,

cultural mistakes may still stymie your negotiation. But if you have

honestly and fairly signaled your intentions and charitably interpreted

the intentions of your counterpart, the responsibility won’t be yours.

Nor will it be a problem of cultures clashing. It will be the actions

and agenda of your counterpart that will have sunk the deal. And

that suggests that the problem with the negotiation was less an issue of diﬀerent cultures and more of diﬀerences in the characters and

ambitions of the individuals involved.
