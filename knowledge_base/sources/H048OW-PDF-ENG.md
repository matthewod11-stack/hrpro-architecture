Does cultural background affect a leader’s decision making? There’s a

lot of research on how leaders living in different cultures behave, but little

on how cultural heritage shapes leaders — even though this would seem to

be just as meaningful for business performance as other factors like

# experience and education.

We sought to ﬁll this gap. We conducted a study speciﬁcally focusing on

## whether the cultural values that CEOs inherit from their parents and

grandparents affect their decision-making and their ﬁrms’ performance.

Our sample consisted of 610 U.S. bank CEOs who were born in the U.S.,

which we separated into three groups: those whose parents were

immigrants to the U.S., those whose grandparents were immigrants to the

U.S., and those whose parents and grandparents were born in the U.S.

(our control group). We chose this design as a way to isolate the effect of

cultural heritage: while CEOs born to immigrant parents or grandparents

are exposed to the same legal, social, and institutional inﬂuences as other

CEOs, they’re likely to possess a distinct cultural heritage. Research has

long shown that cultural values are deeply rooted and that immigrants to

the U.S. show a degree of cultural distinctness over several generations.

For instance, U.S. immigrants’ family living arrangements and beliefs of

the role of women in society have been found to parallel those found in the

# home countries of their ancestors.

The CEOs in our sample led 441 publicly-listed U.S. banks between 1994

and 2006. Among them, 293 were either children or grandchildren of

immigrants, and we called them our second- and third-generation CEOs.

We hand-collected data on the country of origin of a CEO’s ancestors from

ancestry.com, the world’s largest genealogy database, which covers nearly

20 billion family histories. We traced a CEO’s ancestors by searching his or

her name, birthplace, and birth year to identify parents, then used the

same technique to identify the grandparents, and so on. Looking at a range

of data sources — from census records to marriage certiﬁcates to

passenger lists on immigration ships that sailed from Europe to the U.S. —

we were able to map their family trees. We were able to accurately

determine the ancestors going back six generations for these 610 U.S.

bank CEOs. We identiﬁed the country that his or her ancestors immigrated

from, and how many generations ago the ancestors moved to the U.S. For

example, we found that Jamie Dimon, the CEO of JP Morgan, is a third-

## generation descendant of Greek immigrants to the U.S.

To make causal inferences about the effect of heritage, we had to make

sure that cultural background was what drove executives’ decisions and

## ﬁrm performance — rather than other skills and characteristics that may

have got them appointed to lead in the ﬁrst place. So we relied on a setting

where ﬁrms faced an unexpected competitive shock, one that directors

could not have anticipated and selected speciﬁc CEOs to manage it, and

one that forced CEOs to make complex, non-routine, and unstructured

decisions — decisions where CEOs’ characteristics are likely to affect how

they respond.

The banking industry experienced a series of profound competitive shocks

in the 1990s. The one we used was the Interstate Banking and Branching

Efficiency Act (IBBEA) of 1994 that legalized interstate branching in some

U.S. states, such as Michigan or North Carolina, which increased

## competitive pressures in these states but not in others.

Our idea was that if the cultural heritage of a CEO matters to corporate

outcomes, then we would observe systematic differences between ﬁrms led

by second- and third- generation CEOs and ﬁrms led by the control group,

following shocks to competition. And this is what we found. Our data

showed that banks led by CEOs who are the children and grandchildren of

immigrants were, on average, associated with superior performance —

measured by bank Return on Assets — following higher industry

## competition from the deregulation of interstate branching. This superior

ﬁrm performance was strongest for second-generation CEOs, and the

effect weakened with each later generation.

Intriguingly, the cultural heritage effects we uncovered were uniquely

linked to the CEO and could not be detected for other senior executives.

We replicated our analysis for the Chief Financial Officers (CFOs) of each

bank and other members of the top management team, but we did not ﬁnd

## a relationship between their cultural heritage and ﬁrm performance. This

conﬁrmed the role of the CEO as the most important decision-maker in a

bank. While we could not rule out that the cultural heritage of non-CEO

executives may shape decision-making in their particular areas of

responsibility, our results indicated that, should such effects exist, they are

## not traceable in aggregate Return on Assets.

Not all recent-descendants of immigrants outperformed under pressure.

The effect varied by the country of origin of a CEO’s ancestors. Our

ﬁndings implied that CEOs whose ancestors were from Germany, Italy,

Poland and Russia were associated with better bank performance under

competitive pressure. However, CEOs with British or Irish ancestors did

not display different performance from the rest of the sample. These

countries represented 90% of the foreign immigrants to the U.S. from our

sample, as most immigrants who came to the U.S. in the 19th century

came from Europe.

But is it really different cultural values that explains our descendants-of-

immigrants effect? We tried to answer this by identifying the cultural

values that prevailed in these ancestral countries. In particular, we looked

at how different countries compared on 16 cultural values developed by

psychologists Geert Hofstede and Shalom Schwartz, the GLOBE Project,

and the World Values Survey. These values include culturally prevalent

## attitudes towards individualism, long-term decision-making, and risk

# aversion.

We found that some of these cultural values are statistically linked to

better competitive performance, and some are associated with negative

performance. For instance, we found that banks with stronger

performance after this shock had CEOs whose parents and grandparents

came from Germany, Italy, Poland and Russia — countries that rate highly

## on the cultural dimensions of restraint, long-term orientation, uncertainty

avoidance, and harmony. By contrast, ﬁrms with weaker performance after

the shock had CEOs whose ancestors came from countries that rated

highly on individualism, performance orientation, importance of freedom,

## intellectual autonomy, importance of selﬂessness, and patriotism.

These cultural values can mostly be distinguished into two categories:

group-oriented vs. self-oriented cultures. When competition intensiﬁed,

we found that banks led by CEOs whose parents or grandparents came

from a group-oriented culture made more cautious but superior

investment decisions. On average, these CEOs (1) engaged in fewer

acquisitions, (2) realized higher acquisition announcement returns, (3)

displayed lower bank risk, and (4) were more cost-efficient.

Overall, our work is consistent with the view that the culture of a CEO’s

ancestors inﬂuences his or her decision-making, ﬁrm policy choices, and

ultimately the ﬁrm’s performance. We do not, however, interpret our

ﬁndings as showing that particular cultures are superior to others. The

strengths and weaknesses of all cultures are context dependent.

More broadly, our ﬁndings show that cultural heritage matters and that it’s

beneﬁcial for companies to be diverse and to recruit talents from various

backgrounds. At a time when the economic beneﬁts of immigration are

increasingly questioned, our study offers a glimpse of the positive and

lasting contribution that people of immigrant heritage make in the
