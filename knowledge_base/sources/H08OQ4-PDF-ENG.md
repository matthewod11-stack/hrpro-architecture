Leaders often ﬁnd themselves caught in the crosshairs of opposing

opinions, strong personalities, and the responsibility to manage

emotionally charged situations to a productive outcome.

Take my client Jason, a marketing executive who reached out in

distress. A simmering conﬂict between two key leaders on his team had

escalated to the point where they refused to speak to each other. Their

teams had followed suit, creating silos, ineﬃciency, and widespread

tension. Jason knew he needed to step in but was anxious and

uncertain about his ability to manage the strong opposing viewpoints

# and potential outbursts.

Managing sticky, emotionally loaded situations comes with the territory

of leadership. Beyond interpersonal issues, you sometimes must deliver

bad news to your beleaguered team, address a client’s frustration,

provide tough-to-hear performance feedback, or communicate a mistake or delay that aﬀects the business. These moments can be tense,

and even experienced leaders can feel stressed and unsure, worried

# about escalation or unintended fallout.

When facing a situation that will be emotionally challenging, people

## often default to one of two unproductive responses. Many avoid

thinking about it altogether, distracting themselves with low-priority

tasks like emails. Others do the opposite—ruminating and worrying

without taking meaningful steps to manage their anxiety or prepare.

Both approaches tend to backﬁre, making us feel worse and leaving us

less emotionally equipped when the moment arrives.

Fortunately, there are proven ways to prepare yourself for meetings

where emotions are bound to run high. As they say in sports, the best oﬀense is a good defense. Here are science-backed strategies to help you

## navigate these moments more conﬁdently and successfully.

Create a mental blueprint

Imagery, or visualization, is a proven performance improvement technique most commonly used in athletics but also eﬀective in

work contexts. It involves mentally rehearsing an event to enhance

# conﬁdence and performance.

Start with the end in mind: What does success look like for your situation?

How do you want to feel walking out of the room? How do you want others

to feel afterward? As it was for Jason, success might not mean instant

resolution but a productive conversation where people feel heard and

there’s a clear path forward.

Now, turn your upcoming meeting or interaction into a mental movie.

## Picture the details—the room, the seating, the body language—and walk

through the scenes moment by moment. Rehearse key moments, like

how you will open the conversation, navigate moments of tension, and

steer the meeting toward resolution.

Identify likely challenges and potential triggers and how you’ll respond.

Ask yourself, what could go wrong in this meeting? For example, Jason

was most worried about emotions escalating, so he imagined himself

calmly saying, “Let’s pause. We’re here to solve this, not escalate it” if

tempers started to ﬂare. He also worried about hitting an impasse, so he

envisioned stating, “Since we’re not aligned yet, let’s focus on where we

do agree and build from there.” Also, consider what they might say or

do that could trigger you and how you will keep your cool. For instance,

envision yourself taking three deep breaths or counting to 10 before

responding.

Don’t just see success—feel it. For example, try to experience in

your body the conﬁdence, composure, and control you want to bring.

Once you’ve mentally rehearsed, jot down key takeaways and talking

points. By visualizing success ahead of time, you can enhance your

mindset and improve your ability to guide the conversation toward a

# constructive outcome.

# Focus on the positives

Before heading into a diﬃcult meeting, take a moment to focus on

gratitude. It may seem counterintuitive, but doing so can boost your

emotional resilience and strengthen your sense of connection with

# others.

For example, if you need to deliver tough feedback to a team

member, take a moment to reﬂect on what you genuinely appreciate

about the person. One of my clients, Jane, dreaded an upcoming

meeting with Sorab, a direct report whose performance had been

slipping. Her previous attempts at constructive feedback had been

met with defensiveness, and she feared how he might react this time

—and whether she could keep the conversation on track. Before the

meeting, Jane deliberately reminded herself of Sorab’s creativity, fresh

perspective, and the positive energy he brought to meetings. This

mindset shift helped her take a more supportive tone and led to a more

# productive conversation.

Reframing challenges in a positive light also reduces stress and

depletion, leading to a more refreshed state of mind. Consider what

positive outcomes might emerge from the meeting—might you foster

growth, strengthen relationships, or create clarity for the future? If you

ﬁnd yourself wanting to avoid or disengage from the meeting, shift

your focus to what makes you a strong leader. Studies show that this

kind of “positive leader self-reﬂection” boosts energy and engagement,

improving how others perceive your leadership and, in turn, your

# inﬂuence.

Modify the situation

Handling emotionally loaded situations is an unavoidable part of

leadership, but you have more control over their impact than you might

think. One powerful tool is situation modiﬁcation: a proactive emotion-

regulation strategy that can help you reduce the emotional intensity

of an upcoming event. By purposefully adjusting the situation or your

approach, you can ease your anxiety and create the conditions for a

# more productive conversation.

One way to do this is by considering “the Five W’s” of the situation:

who, what, where, when, and why. For example, who needs to be there?

Should you bring in resources to support the conversation? What needs

to be shared, and what does not? Where should the meeting take place,

and what is the optimal time? Finally, why is this discussion important?

For example, my client, Jack, had to inform his exhausted leadership team about yet another round of layoﬀs. Understandably, delivering

this message weighed heavily on Jack, and so we worked through

the Five W’s. This exercise resulted in Jack inviting his HR business

partner to the meeting to provide additional support and answer

questions. He also reﬁned his message, eliminating certain elements

and acknowledging his team’s likely concerns more broadly. Finally, he

booked a more private, out-of-the-way conference room and scheduled

the meeting for midday Friday to give his team space for follow-ups or

an early departure. These intentional adjustments quelled his anxiety

and created a more supportive tone and environment for delivering the

# diﬃcult news to his team.

# Build in buffer zones

Leaders’ schedules are often crammed with back-to-back meetings,

but taking time to get into the right headspace before a challenging

interaction is essential. Set aside 10 minutes before your meeting to

mentally prepare so you can arrive focused and composed. You might

review key points, remind yourself how you want to show up, and get

grounded. Afterward, plan to take another 10 minutes to process and

reset. For instance, you might take a short walk to reﬂect and release

any built-up stress so that you don’t take it into your next interaction.

If this requires rescheduling a meeting or adjusting your arrival or

departure time, it’s worth it.

These buﬀer zones help you stay present and composed throughout

the day but require planning ahead. Get into the practice of looking

ahead at your calendar to identify important meetings, challenging

## conversations, and potentially contentious interactions so you can

schedule time to prepare and reset.

. . .

Not every emotionally charged moment comes with a warning—to be

sure, some take you by surprise. But when you do see one ahead, eﬀective preparation makes all the diﬀerence. By visualizing success,

focusing on the positives, deliberately modifying the situation, and building in buﬀer zones, you will navigate fraught meetings more

conﬁdently and successfully. Leadership will always involve some

intense interactions, but with the right strategies, you can turn them

into deﬁning moments that drive real progress.
