Mentoring high achievers can be one of the most rewarding yet

challenging aspects of leadership. These individuals have already

achieved signiﬁcant success, possess a wealth of experience, and have a

steady track record of accomplishments. But even the best-performing

individuals need guidance to avoid complacency, continue growing,

and reach new heights. What do high achievers need to ensure they

keep advancing? Mentorship catered to their precise needs.

## HBR / Digital Article / What High Achievers Need from Their Mentors

High achievers, while accustomed to success, still face failures and

setbacks. Their resilience can be tested if they encounter rejection

infrequently, making their conﬁdence armor a bit thin. It may take

them a bit more time and eﬀort to brush oﬀ the rejection, and they

need someone with greater perspective to help them see outside the

immediate situation and realize that failure is not the end of the world.

Helping them navigate through these bumps without wallowing in self-

pity is critical. They need mentors who can provide them with tools

to navigate these challenges, turning them into learning opportunities.

Eﬀective mentoring can help high achievers avoid stagnation, discover

new passions, and expand their inﬂuence, ultimately creating a culture

## of high achievement within their teams and organizations.

As a social scientist who studies extreme high achievers such as Nobel

## Prize winners, astronauts, Olympians, and other elite athletes (Ruth)

and a professional relationships strategist with a strong focus on the

role of relationships in career and talent development (Andy), we have

seen that mentoring high achievers requires a nuanced approach that

is often overlooked or even dismissed. These individuals need more

than just guidance; they require mentorship tailored to their speciﬁc

needs. High achievers need support in maintaining a growth mindset,

developing emotional intelligence, and expanding their networks. By

understanding and addressing these needs, mentors can help high

achievers continue to excel and make signiﬁcant contributions to their

# organizations.

# Cultivate a Growth Mindset

Successful individuals thrive on achievement and live for the

challenge of exploring the unknown. Maintaining a growth mindset

is crucial for their continued development. High achievers need

mentors who encourage them to embrace continuous learning and

improvement. They should be introduced to new ﬁelds, technologies, or

methodologies that can enhance their existing skills and push them out

of their comfort zone. For instance, a seasoned executive might beneﬁt

from insights into emerging digital trends or innovative leadership

# practices.

Pro Tip: High achievers often struggle with accepting failure because

they are accustomed to success. To help them embrace failure as part

of the growth process, mentors can emphasize the concept of “failing

forward.” This means viewing mistakes or failures as valuable learning

# experiences rather than setbacks.

One approach is to share stories of other high achievers who similarly

faced failures and used those experiences to propel themselves to even

greater heights. Mentors can also encourage high achievers to reﬂect

on past failures, identifying what they learned and how it contributed

to their growth. By normalizing making mistakes and framing it as an

essential part of the journey to success, mentors can help high achievers

build resilience and maintain their conﬁdence even when things don’t

go as planned.

Then, take it a step further. Challenge your mentee with thought-

provoking questions and scenarios that push them out of their

comfort zone. For example: What if your industry underwent a major

technological shift overnight? How would you adapt and lead your team

through it? Suggest they attend conferences or workshops that stretch

their thinking. Encourage them to embrace continuous learning and

improvement with the mindset of “It’s an experiment, something you

should try at least once.”

Reframe the outcome of their work by focusing on what success

will mean to them, rather than leaving them to worry about the

repercussions of a negative outcome. If they buy fully into the impact

they can make, potential failure becomes less of a brake on their

# possible progress.

## Develop Emotional Intelligence and Use Self-Reflection

Emotional intelligence (EQ) is a key diﬀerentiator for leaders, especially

those already successful in their careers. High achievers need mentors

who help them develop a deeper understanding of their own emotions

and those of others. This skill is critical for fostering better relationships

and decision-making, particularly when interacting with people who

have not yet reached the same levels of achievement.

Pro Tip: Establish regular, structured feedback sessions. High achievers

are often left to their own devices as they often don’t need much

oversight. But there is a beneﬁt to having regular check-ins to ensure

the individual is stretching their thinking, not getting complacent, and

thinking several steps ahead.

## During these sessions, focus on speciﬁc instances where the high

achiever’s emotional responses inﬂuenced outcomes and help them

consider how things might have gone diﬀerently – for good and

bad. Perhaps they got frustrated with a colleague who doesn’t think

as quickly and as a result, they had an outburst or took over the

situation. Or they missed a signal that a teammate was feeling excluded

from an important conversation. This practice helps them gain new

## perspectives on their leadership style and interpersonal interactions

and is particularly useful for those who don’t connect with meditation

# or journaling.

# Expand Their Network and Influence

High achievers often have strong networks, but there is always room for

growth and improved focus. They will know, at a high level, who to turn

to for help and support, but there will always be blind spots in their

network — people who could help them or relationships they should be

developing further, but who are not front of mind.

A mentor can provide increased focus on uncovering those key

relationships, one that will lead to even more impactful results.

Introducing them to new, diverse circles can provide fresh insights and

# opportunities for collaboration.

## Pro Tip: Facilitate introductions to thought leaders, industry

innovators, and professionals from diﬀerent sectors. Encourage them

to attend conferences, join professional associations, or engage in cross-

industry collaborations. Suggest the 24/7/30 model for following up with

new contacts: 24 hours after meeting, again 7 days later, and once more

after 30 days. This could be a quick email, a connection on LinkedIn, or

a comment on their social media post linking it to something previously

discussed.

Most importantly, sit down with them and analyze the support needed

to achieve their key objectives and where they can ﬁnd it within their

existing network or one degree away.

Mentoring successful individuals requires a nuanced and strategic

approach. By fostering a growth mindset, developing emotional

intelligence, and expanding their network, mentors can help high

achievers break through barriers and reach new heights. The impact

of such mentoring extends beyond the individual, driving innovation

and excellence throughout their organizations. As mentors, our goal is

to challenge, inspire, and support these leaders in their journey toward

# even greater success.

The best mentors don’t just teach; they inspire a perpetual quest

for knowledge and self-development. By embracing this philosophy,

mentors can guide their high-achieving mentees to not only maintain

their success but to evolve and lead strategically with renewed vigor and
