# Copeland Act

(18 USC §874 and 40 USC §3145; 29 CFR Part 3)

Who is Covered

# Updated: May 2024

# The "Anti-Kickback" provision of the Copeland Act applies to contractors and subcontractors that perform

# work on contracts for the construction, prosecution, repair, or completion of public buildings, public works, or

works which are ﬁnanced in whole or in part by loans or grants from the United States. This provision applies even where no labor standards statute covers the contract, but does not apply to contracts for which the only

federal assistance is a loan guarantee.

The Copeland Act provisions pertaining to payroll deductions, the submission of weekly payroll reports, and

the method by which contractors and subcontractors must pay their employees apply to contracts in excess

of $2,000 for the construction, prosecution, repair, or completion of public buildings, public works, or works which are supported by the United States, including buildings or works for which the federal assistance

granted is in the form of loan guarantees or insurance.

A public building or public work is a building or work for whose construction, prosecution, completion, or

repair a federal agency is a contracting party, regardless of whether title thereof is in a federal agency.

# Basic Provisions/Requirements

The Copeland Act's Anti-Kickback provision prohibits contractors and subcontractors performing work on

covered contracts from in any way inducing an employee to give up any part of the compensation to which he

or she is entitled. The Copeland Act and implementing regulations also require contractors and

subcontractors performing on covered contracts to pay their employees on a weekly basis and in cash or a negotiable instrument payable on demand and to submit weekly payroll reports of the wages paid to their

laborers and mechanics during the preceding payroll period. Additionally, the Act's regulations at 29 CFR 3.5

and 3.6 list payroll deductions that are permissible without the approval of DOL and those deductions that

require consent of DOL and prohibit all other payroll deductions.

## Submission of Deduction Requests to the Department of Labor

Deduction request letters may be submitted electronically by emailing a scanned a copy of the signed request

to dbadeductions@dol.gov. You may also send your request in by mail to:

# Division Director

## Division of Government Contracts Enforcement 200 Constitution Avenue, NW

The Anti-Kickback provision of the Copeland Act gives workers on covered Federal contracts the right to

receive the full pay to which they are entitled for the work they perform. The Act also protects workers on

covered contracts from payroll deductions that are not explicitly permitted under DOL's regulations or

# otherwise approved of by DOL. It gives such workers the right to receive pay on a weekly basis, and entitles

# them to receive their pay in cash or a negotiable instrument payable on demand. The Wage and Hour Division

accepts complaints of alleged Copeland Act wage violations. Local Wage and Hour Division oﬃces are listed on the DOL web site at: www.dol.gov/whd/america2.htm

There are no notice or poster requirements.

Contractors and subcontractors are required to keep payroll records for each laborer and mechanic on

covered projects, recording accurately and completely the following:

# Employee's name and address;

# Correct classiﬁcation and rate of pay;

Daily and weekly number of hours worked;

Deductions made; and

Actual wages paid

Contractors and subcontractors performing on covered contracts are required to preserve the weekly payroll

records for a period of three years from the date the contract is completed. Additionally, contractors and

subcontractors performing on covered contracts are required to make the payroll records available at all times

for inspection by the contracting oﬃcer or authorized representative, and by authorized representatives of the

# Department of Labor.

There are reporting requirements under the Copeland "Anti-Kickback" Act for contractors and subcontractors

performing on contracts in excess of $2,000 for the construction or repair of public buildings, public works, or

buildings or works supported by the federal government. Each covered contractor and subcontractor must provide the Federal agency contracting oﬃcer with a weekly payroll report of wages paid to each of its

laborers and mechanics during the preceding weekly payroll period. Each weekly statement of wages

submitted shall be a ccompanied by a "Statement of Compliance." Statements of Compliance are to be made

on the Form WH-347 "Payroll (For Contractors Optional Use)" or on any form with identical wording. The

weekly payroll report must be submitted within seven days after the regular pay date for the pay period.

# Penalties/Sanctions

Any contractor or subcontractor who induces an employee working on a covered contract to give up any part of the compensation to which he or she is entitled is subject to a ﬁne, imprisonment for up to ﬁve years, or

both. Willful falsiﬁcation of the Statement of Compliance may subject the employer to civil or criminal

prosecution and may be cause for contract termination or debarment. Contractors may challenge

determinations on debarment before an Administrative Law Judge. Decisions of Administrative Law Judges

may be appealed to the Administrative Review Board (ARB). ARB determinations on debarment may be appealed to and are enforceable through the federal courts. Civil and criminal sanctions are pursued through

# the federal courts.

## Relation to State, Local, and Other Federal Laws

The "Anti-Kickback" provisions apply to contractors and subcontractors that perform work on contracts for construction or repair to which a federal agency is a party or that are ﬁnanced in whole or in part by loans or

grants from the federal government, except for those contracts where the only federal assistance is a loan

guarantee. The provisions of the Act and the regulation pertaining to the weekly payroll reports and payroll

deductions apply to contractors and subcontractors performing on federally assisted contracts, including

contracts for which the only federal assistance is a loan guarantee or insurance, but only if the contractor or subcontractor is subject to federal wage standards.
