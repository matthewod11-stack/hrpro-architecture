A Meta-Analysis of the Role of Trust in the Leadership - Performance Relationship

Trust plays a critical role as a key mechanism through which the positive impact of

leadership can be elicited. This meta-analysis examines the incremental validity of eight

leadership styles (transformational, transactional, authentic, ethical, servant, abusive,

paternalistic and empowering) in predicting affective and cognitive dimensions of trust as

mediating mechanisms in the relationship between leadership and performance outcomes. To

counter issues of common method variance, we focus on the impact these mediated

relationships have on independently measured other ratings of outcomes; task performance

and organisational citizenship behaviour (OCB). We also test whether trust in the leader

differs from that of the broader construct of Leader-Member Exchange (LMX) quality. Using

185 independent studies conducted since 1988, we find that contemporary styles, particularly

# servant and ethical leadership, demonstrate incremental validity over transformational and

transactional (contingent reward) leadership in predicting trust in the leader. Meta analytical

mediation tests reveal that trust in the leader and LMX play unique roles in mediating the

relationship between leadership styles and performance related outcomes. Finally, evidence

suggests that affective and cognitive dimensions of trust play a differential role in this

mediating process and that affective trust in the leader is a more powerful predictor of

# performance and OCB.

# Introduction

Since the global financial crisis of 2007, trust in business has fallen to record lows. For

instance, public trust in CEOs has dropped to 31% in developed countries (Edelman Trust

Barometer, 2016). Engendering trust has been a central tenet of different organisational

leadership theories and robust relationships have been found between employees’ trust in

their leader and important outcomes (e.g., Ng, 2017; Podsakoff et al., 1990; Schaubroeck et

al., 2011). Research, for example, consistently shows that the trust which exists between a

leader and a follower is associated with increased follower job performance and

organisational citizenship behaviour and negatively related to undesirable outcomes such as

followers’ intention to quit (see Colquitt et al., 2007; Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). Trust, as a

willingness to be vulnerable and accept risk in relationships (Mayer et al., 1995), is therefore

a valued asset which leaders seek to foster and develop with their employees. An increasing

body of evidence suggests that trust-related characteristics are seen as being universally

important for leadership effectiveness (Den Hartog, 2018). The question then is, how can

leaders’ best harness that ‘willingness’ and what style of leadership is most suited for

facilitating trust?

Around two decades ago, Dirks and Ferrin (2002) first meta-analysed the primary

relationships of trust in leaders with antecedents, correlates and outcomes. However, due to

the relative immaturity of the literature at the time they did not capture, beyond

transformational and transactional leadership, how different leadership styles relate to trust.

In recent years, several new leadership constructs have emerged in the literature. Given the

frequency with which trust is proffered as an explanatory mechanism for the impact of these

styles (e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Den Hartog, 2015; Miao et al., 2014), our meta-analysis offers

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

an update of what is known and what remains to be studied in understanding this important

# relationship.

We synthesise the literature by providing meta-analytical correlations investigating the

# relative predictive validity of newer leadership variables over the more established full-range

# model (specifically the different transformational and transactional leadership components;

Avolio & Bass, 1991) in promoting trust and its associated performance outcomes. The core

focus of our meta-analytical investigations is on the construct of trust in relation to the leader

and a key aim is to identify which leadership style(s) are most critical for driving trust in the

leader and which might be redundant. In doing so, we answer the call for leadership research

to pay more attention to the comparative influence of different leadership models (e.g.,

Piccolo et al., 2012). Indeed, “pruning efforts, such as pitting competing theories against one

another can help to build a more parsimonious understanding of the contexts in which

theories are generalizable” (Banks et al., 2018; pg. 246). Thus, we aim to examine which

leadership styles(s) are most critical for facilitating (or hampering) trust and we explore

indirect effects of the different leadership styles on performance outcomes via trust in the

# leader.

Our paper goes beyond previous work (e.g., Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Hoch et al., 2018) and

# offers three significant contributions to the literature on trust, leadership, and Social

Exchange Theory (SET). First, we explore the relative effects of a broad range of established

and newer forms of leadership on our core variable of trust. Specifically, we examine how

authentic, empowering, servant, paternalistic, ethical and abusive leadership relate to trust

and whether these ‘newer’ leadership constructs explain variance in trust in the leader beyond

the longer established styles included in the full-range model. In doing so, our research

contributes to ongoing discussions within the leadership literature regarding construct

# (cid:32)(cid:52)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

redundancy (Banks et al., 2018) and serves to guide both future research efforts and

# leadership development practice.

Second, we assess whether trust in the leader as an underlying mechanism for the impact

of leadership is distinct from a broader assessment of the relationship between the leader and

follower. The quality of the relationship between a leader and follower is frequently

suggested to form an important mechanism through which leaders affect outcomes (e.g.,

Wang et al., 2005). We focus on Leader-Member Exchange (LMX), which represents the

quality of relationship between leaders and followers and can range on a continuum from

high to low quality (e.g., Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). Given that trust and LMX quality are

both grounded in principles of SET, addressing the possibility for overlap and redundancy is

warranted. Indeed, Liden and Maslyn (1998) questioned whether these two relational

constructs essentially capture the same thing. We offer an empirical test of this issue. Further,

in their review, Hughes et al. (2018) identified trust in the leader and LMX quality as the two

# most prominent social-relational mediating mechanisms for a host of different leadership

styles. By positioning trust and LMX quality as parallel mediators in our analysis, we

contribute to both the trust and LMX literatures and investigate the unique and differential

role played by each in the relationship between leadership and follower performance

# outcomes.

Finally, we extend previous meta-analyses (e.g., Colquitt et al., 2007; Dirks & Ferrin,

- 2002) by operationalizing trust as a multidimensional construct. Specifically, our analysis

differentiates between cognitive and affective trust and examines the extent to which these

are empirically distinct. We seek to determine if different leadership styles are more likely to

encourage the development of one of these forms of trust over the other as well as how each

base of trust relates to performance outcomes. This contributes to the ongoing debate about

the dimensionality of trust and how trust is best operationalised (e.g., Dietz & Den Hartog,

# (cid:32)(cid:53)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

2006; McEvily & Tortoriello, 2011; Rousseau et al., 1998). In our assessment of these three

competing mediators (cognitive trust, affective trust, LMX), we chose to focus only on

studies that operationalise performance as an other-rated outcome with the aim of minimising

# common method biases in our model.

# Literature Review

# Trust and Leadership

Trust plays a critical role in most work relationship theories (Ferris et al., 2009;

Fulmer & Gelfand, 2012). Yet, the conceptualisation of trust forms a topic of considerable

debate. Some scholars accept unidimensional definitions, describing trust as a psychological

state consisting of a willingness to be vulnerable due to positive expectations of another party

(e.g., Rousseau et al., 1998). However, multidimensional operationalisations distinguishing

between different trust bases are also widely adopted. The most popular describes cognitive

and affective forms of trust (McAllister, 1995). Cognitive trust refers to rational assessments

of qualities such as ability and reliability that are built on the outcomes of previous

# interactions and judgements about similarity and the professional qualifications of the other

party. In contrast, affective trust refers to the emotional ties in an interpersonal relationship

and is informed by perceptions of the other party’s motives, the extent to which they provide

help and support, and frequency of interaction. Another widely used model focuses on ability,

# benevolence, and integrity as dimensions of trustworthiness (Mayer et al., 1995). Trust

scholars have drawn parallels between these dimensions and affective and cognitive forms of

trust. Specifically, ability and integrity have theoretical similarities with cognitive trust, while

benevolence perceptions are more closely aligned with affective trust (Colquitt et al., 2012;

de Jong et al., 2016; van der Werff & Buckley, 2017).

# (cid:32)(cid:54)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

One context in which trust has received considerable attention is that of the leader-

follower relationship, where typically the role of trust is highlighted in the context of SET

(Blau, 1964). Essentially, exchanges occur as leaders’ express behaviours towards

employees, which result in a felt obligation to reciprocate. According to SET, actions tend to

be repaid in kind and this is likely to continue through a series of reciprocal exchanges

(Cropanzano et al., 2017). For example, a leader may empower an employee, granting

autonomy and discretion, and the employee may reciprocate through extra effort. These

interactions extend beyond simple economic transactions and create diffuse obligations which

can at times be unbalanced; this is when trust is particularly vital. Trust plays a key role in the

development and deepening of positive social exchanges as it encourages obligation and

# reduces uncertainty around reciprocation (Konovsky & Pugh, 1994). Trust therefore

facilitates SET and can be used to operationalise leader-follower relationships (Colquitt et al.,

2012). The facilitation of social exchanges through trust has become a prominent explanation

in understanding the link between many leadership styles and their outcomes.

Over the past three decades, the form of leadership most associated with trust is

# transformational leadership, drawn from the full-range model (Jung & Avolio, 2000).

Transformational leaders motivate their followers to perform beyond expectations and to

transcend self-interest in pursuit of group/organisational goals (Bass, 1985). The power of

transformational leadership in furthering trust relates to the capacity for these leaders to

inspire pride, admiration and respect and their ability to use social cues to evoke a sense of

being appreciated and valued in followers (Ng, 2017). Transformational behaviours are

argued to result in followers trusting leaders and being willing to reciprocate by going over

and above in their efforts. Transformational leadership consists of four dimensions; idealised

# influence, inspirational motivation, intellectual stimulation and individualised consideration.

All four have been theoretically linked to trust (see Table 1). For example, core aspects of

# (cid:32)(cid:55)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

transformational leadership include inspiring followers to believe in a vision and challenging

the status quo (Pillai et al., 1999). Trust is a well-established antecedent of risk taking in

relationships (Mayer et al., 1995) and when followers trust their leader they are much more

willing to accept such risk and show the effort needed to make the vision a reality.

Transformational leaders are persuasive role models who signal integrity (a defining feature

of cognitive trust) via their willingness to make personal sacrifices and their word-deed

# consistency (Avolio & Bass, 1991; Kirkpatrick & Locke, 1996). Also, individualised

consideration can signal to employees that leaders are benevolent (a defining feature of

affective trust) and will look out for their best interest, facilitating trust. All transformational

subdimensions predict trust (e.g., Kelloway et al., 2012).

The full range model also distinguishes laissez-faire, which represents an absence of

leadership, and transactional leadership styles (Bass, 1985). A transactional leadership style is

based on economic exchange (Pillai et al., 1999) and leader influence over follower

behaviour is achieved through contingent reward, where followers are rewarded for meeting

agreed-upon-objectives, or management-by-exception (MBE), where the leader only takes

corrective action, either active or passive, when things go wrong. Consistently engaging in

contingent reward is likely to signal competence, reliability and predictability all of which

denote aspects of ability or integrity (Mayer et al., 1995) or cognitive trust (McAllister,

1995). Thus, contingent reward helps followers trust that leaders will keep their word and

deliver on promises (Jung & Avolio, 2000). However, leaders who are disengaged (i.e.,

laissez-faire leadership) or engage in punitive behaviours (i.e., management-by-exception)

likely undermine the development of trust (e.g., Kelloway et al., 2012).

## Inherent in both the transformational dimensions and the contingent reward

component are features of leadership that have been repeatedly associated with trust and

subsequent performance (Ng, 2017; Podsakoff et al., 1990; Rubin et al., 2010). Research on

# (cid:32)(cid:56)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

emerging leadership styles have also found support for a strong link with trust in leadership

(see Table 1). When compared to the full-range model, it may be the case that some of these

more recent additions to the leadership literature may be stronger determinants of trust. More

contemporary styles, such as ethical and servant leadership, emerged as a direct attempt to

address a lack of trust and faith in organisational leaders (Avolio & Walumbwa, 2014). As

such, the moral tone of these styles may be more suited to facilitating trust compared to

transformational leadership, which does not explicitly address ethics as a core tenet (Brown et

al., 2005). There is some support for this contention (e.g., Hoch et al., 2018). For example,

some of the core qualities associated with these more morally toned styles, such as

transparency and openness (Korsgaard et al., 2002; Norman et al., 2010), play a central role

in facilitating integrity (Mayer et al., 1995) or cognitive forms of trust.

Theories of leadership such as authentic, servant and ethical leadership (Dinh et al.,

- 2014) can be grouped together in a ‘moral approaches’ category (Lemoine et al., 2019).

Within this category, scholars typically draw on common theoretical arguments including

SET to explain how these styles facilitate trust. For example, integrity is a core feature of

# authentic leadership and this, along with the unbiased processing of self-relevant information

and fair treatment of followers, is likely to influence a follower’s willingness to be vulnerable

to their leaders and trust them (Ilies et al., 2005). Ethical leader behaviours are argued to

influence follower’s willingness to be vulnerable because of the psychologically safe working

environment they create (Den Hartog, 2018). Ethical leaders for example, encourage

employees to voice concerns and show fair treatment and balanced decision making (Brown

et al., 2005) and empirical links to trust are found (e.g., Newman et al., 2014). SET has also

been used to provide an explanation of how servant leadership influences the trust between

followers and their leader (Lee et al., 2020). Servant leaders build trust by putting their own

self-interests second to the interests of their followers and focusing on the greater good. In

# (cid:32)(cid:57)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

difficult or uncertain situations, followers should feel that they can rely on servant leaders to

prioritize their welfare over organisational objectives, thus signalling affective trust and

benevolent intent (e.g., Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). Empirically, links between these moral

approaches and trust have been found as summarised in recent meta-analytical work (Banks

et al., 2016; Bedi et al., 2016; Hoch et al., 2018).

Other contemporary styles may also be important. For example, empowering

leadership has been found to elicit trust (Huang et al., 2010). Empowering leadership is

defined as promoting followers’ self-directed and autonomous decision making, the giving

and sharing of information, delegating authority and inviting input from followers (e.g.,

Kirkman & Rosen, 1999). Leaders who empower subordinates, providing them discretion and

latitude over decision making, make themselves vulnerable and demonstrate confidence; key

features of trust (Zhang & Zhou, 2014). Essentially, such empowering behaviours

demonstrate to followers that the leader trusts them and followers are likely to reciprocate by

trusting their leaders in return (Ferrin et al., 2008; Halbesleben & Wheeler, 2015; Seppälä et

al., 2011).

Paternalistic leadership is a style that comprises of authority and discipline as well as

care and concern for followers and is conceptualised as three dimensions: authoritarianism,

morality, and benevolence (Farh & Cheng, 2000). Trust in the leader has been found to

mediate the relationship between the morality and benevolence dimensions of paternalistic

leadership and follower behaviour (Chen et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2012). The moral and

benevolent dimensions are typically theorised to encourage follower reciprocation of positive

leader behaviour leading to the development of trust over time (e.g., Chen et al., 2014).

Specifically, positive and trustworthy leader behaviour encourages a shift from economic to

social-exchange (Blau, 1964) suggesting that trust in the leader may explain the positive

effects of leader morality and benevolence on followers’ behaviour. Authoritarian leadership,

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:48)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

however, is argued to create low levels of trust in leaders (e.g., Chen et al., 2014). Indeed, it

is likely to operate in the opposite way to follower empowerment as the assertion of authority

and control over followers may send the signal that leaders do not trust followers and

encourage followers to accept and comply with the leaders’ ideas without voicing dissent.

In addition, research has begun to explore the impact of destructive forms of

leadership and their effect on outcomes via trust. Destructive leadership styles refer to

voluntary acts committed by a leader which most people would perceive as harmful and

deviant. The most studied of these is abusive supervision, defined as the extent to which

supervisors engage in ongoing displays of verbal and non-verbal hostility (Tepper, 2000).

Examples of abusive supervision include humiliating employees in pubic, mocking,

belittlement, rudeness, breaking promises and other inappropriate behaviours (Tepper, 2000).

In accordance with SET, trust should decrease over time as a result of these unfavourable

exchanges with a leader which may even contribute to feelings of distrust of the leader

(Tepper, 2007).

# Insert Table 1 about Here

As discussed, numerous leadership variables are theoretically and empirically

associated with trust in the leader, which is often used as a mediator to explain the effects of

leadership variables on follower outcomes. While other lenses are also used, the link between

leadership, trust and outcomes is often built on the theoretical premise of SET. The

proliferation of new leadership variables has led to concerns of construct redundancy

particularly between the ‘newer’ conceptualisations of leadership and transformational

leadership (Banks et al., 2018). The magnitude of correlation often observed between

leadership styles (e.g., r = .72; Banks et al., 2018) is an issue for understanding the link

between leadership and trust. While different leadership styles may relate to trust, we do not

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:49)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

yet know whether effects are distinct from those of other leadership styles. Typically,

leadership styles are studied in isolation, or at best alongside few others. As such, scholars in

the leadership domain often fail to show the incremental effects of one leadership approach

over others (Hunter et al., 2007; Piccolo et al., 2012). This makes it hard to discern the

distinctiveness of leadership constructs (DeRue et al., 2011) and understand their relative

ability to affect trust.

What is needed to resolve the fragmentation in the field are critical tests of theory

where key leadership styles are examined concurrently to build a more parsimonious

understanding of their value. Initial attempts have been made through meta-analytical

methods (e.g., Banks et al., 2016; Hoch et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018, Lee et al., 2020, Ng &

Feldman, 2015). In the present study, we seek to contribute to this literature by meta-

analytically comparing the relative effects of eight leadership styles on trust and subsequent

performance outcomes (see below). In the first stage, we compare the relative variance

explained by each style over that explained by the full-range model of transformational and

transactional leadership. Given the dominance of this model in the literature, and its broad

coverage of leadership behaviours, it serves an important comparative function. Further,

recent critiques of transformational leadership’s theoretical foundations and practical

relevance (e.g., van Knippenberg & Sitkin, 2013), make it even more important to isolate

whether other styles are meaningfully different.

In the second stage, we compare the relative importance of the contemporary

leadership styles. Ideally, we would assess the relative importance of all six leadership styles

(ethical, servant, empowering, paternalistic, authentic and abusive) together. However, the

limited availability of primary data means that here we can only compare the effects of

## ethical, authentic, servant and abusive leadership on trust.

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:50)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

The relatively fragmented and inconclusive nature of the current literature means it is

not possible to make predictions as to which, if any, of the contemporary styles is the most

important for building trust in the leader. Thus, we take an explorative approach to address

this question. There are two related reasons for this. Firstly, as stated, each of the styles

included here potentially relates to trust. Take for example two seemingly distinct leadership

styles; empowering and ethical leadership. On the one hand, the delegation of responsibility

and provision of autonomy bestowed by an empowering leader may facilitate reciprocal trust.

At the same time, the role modelling and fairness inherent in ethical leadership should also

facilitate trust. There is no clarity yet as to which of these two ostensibly distinct styles offers

the strongest relationship with trust. In fact, compelling theoretical arguments, and empirical

evidence, exist for each of the styles included in our analysis. As leadership styles are

typically discussed in isolation, an a priori prediction of which style is the strongest predictor

of trust is problematic.

A second issue is that broader leadership styles often combine a set of different

dimensions e.g. the four dimensions of transformational leadership or the three dimensions of

paternalistic. While the conceptual core of the different styles may be different, in practice

these leadership constructs show overlap, particularly at the dimensional level. For example,

the empowering dimension of servant leadership (Liden et al., 2015) clearly overlaps with

empowering leadership. Such overlaps, common across many leadership styles, contribute to

the problem of making a priori predictions of which style would be most prominent for

engendering trust. As such, we propose the following two research questions:

Research question 1: What is the relative importance of the contemporary leadership

styles over transformational and transactional leadership in predicting trust in the leader?

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:51)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

Research question 2: Which contemporary leadership style is the most important for

predicting trust in the leader – ethical, authentic, servant or abusive?

## Mediating Mechanisms: The Role of Trust in the Leader and LMX Quality

Most meta-analyses examining trust test for direct relationships rather than

positioning trust as a mediator of the leadership-performance link (for exceptions see Lee et

al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; Martin et al., 2016; Ng & Feldman, 2015; Nohe, & Hertel, 2017).

Of these exceptions, only Lee et al. (2018; 2020) and Nohe and Hertel, (2017) accounted for

alternative mediation pathways measured concurrently. Trust in the leader is believed to be

one of the key reasons why certain leadership behaviours are associated with positive

employee outcomes. Empirically, trust in the leader has been found to mediate the

# relationship between numerous leadership styles and employee behavioural outcomes such as

performance and OCB (e.g., Chen et al., 2014; Newman et al., 2014; Zhu et al., 2013). Trust

facilitates these relationships due to its pivotal role in the formation and maintenance of

social exchanges (Den Hartog, 2018; Dirks & Ferrin, 2002; Konovsky & Pugh, 1994) and

ability to stabilize interpersonal relationships. When employees trust their leaders, they are

more willing and able to focus cognitive resources on in-role and extra-role performance

# (Mayer & Gavin, 2005).

In contrast, when a leader does not inspire trust, a follower’s performance may suffer

as they allocate resources toward ‘covering their backs’ (Dirks & Ferrin, 2002). Here, we aim

to test whether meta-analytic support exists for the role of trust as a key mediator in the

relationship between the different leadership styles and performance outcomes. We focus

specifically on task performance and OCB, as these are considered some of the most

important outcomes in the organisational behaviour context (Banks et al., 2017).

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:52)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

In considering alternative mediating mechanisms, we continue our focus on the

# attributes of the leader-follower relationship in line with their critical positioning in

understanding the impact of leadership styles via SET. While trust in the leader is one

important example of this, other, potentially overlapping or broader social exchange based

variables, may also be in operation (Hughes et al., 2018). Most critical would be LMX

quality which has been identified as the second most common operationalisation of SET with

higher content validity than the more commonly used perceived organisational support

(Colquitt et al., 2014). Given the leader-follower context of the relationships we are focused

on, LMX quality is also the most contextually specific operationalisation of the SET

relationship and its utility as a mediator in the relationship between leadership and outcomes

has received considerable support (e.g. Gu et al., 2013). As such, trust and LMX quality offer

# the most theoretically coherent mediators for the SE relationship between leadership and

performance related outcomes.

LMX, which is a relational approach to leadership, has been viewed as both a

leadership variable in its own right and as a mediator explaining the effects of other

leadership styles (e.g. Wang et al., 2005). This has resulted in confusion regarding the

treatment of LMX in combination with other leadership styles. Inconsistencies in the

literature about the conceptualisation and positioning of LMX have been carried over into

meta-analytic work in the area. For instance, while Ng and Feldman (2015) describe LMX as

a leadership style, others have positioned LMX, alongside trust in the leader, as an attitudinal

outcome of leadership (e.g. authentic leadership, Banks et al., 2016; ethical leadership, Bedi

et al., 2016). In addition, Dulebohn et al. (2012) treat LMX as a mediator, driven by styles

such as transformational leadership. Hoch et al. (2018) argue that, unlike other leadership

styles, LMX does not focus on leader behaviour and is thus more accurately captured as a

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:53)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

relational perception, along with trust. Similarly, Dirks and Ferrin (2002) consider LMX a

## correlate of trust rather than an antecedent.

A related issue is the conceptual and theoretical similarities between LMX and trust

and the fact that some scholars have positioned trust as a defining feature of LMX (Liden &

Graen, 1980). Indeed, the literature is often vague about the conceptual differences between

trust and LMX. While we recognise that the two concepts are conceptually related, we see

three key differences that influence how these variables might operate as SET mechanisms in

the leader follower relationship. First, LMX focuses on followers’ perceptions of the degree

to which they have a positive relationship with their leader (Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). In

contrast, trust is a psychological state that represents a volitional choice to be vulnerable to

another party (van der Werff et al., 2019). Second, trust as a willingness to be vulnerable, is

based on expectations of the other party’s behaviour. However, trust theorists argue that these

expectations are informed by more than perceptions of the leader’s past behaviour and that

heuristic processes play a key role in trust formation (Baer et al., 2018; Kramer & Lewicki,

2010). In contrast, LMX is argued to be built specifically on the history of exchanges

between a leader and follower (e.g., Graen & Uhl-Bien, 1995). Third, as observed by Brower

et al. (2000), the foundations of LMX assume a level of reciprocity in the relationship that is

not necessarily a feature of trust relationships (Korsgaard et al., 2015).

Based on their meta-analytic review, Dirks and Ferrin (2002) advocated that trust

should be treated as a construct separate from LMX. In support, Scandura and Pellegrini

(2008) found significant discriminant validity between trust and LMX. Despite this,

# theoretical explanations of their relationship with leadership both hinge on SET and

comparisons between them are warranted to confirm that trust and LMX form distinct

mediators of the leadership-performance relationship. As such, we propose:

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:54)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

Hypothesis 1: Trust in the leader and LMX quality provide unique mediating roles in

the relationship between leadership styles and performance related outcomes.

## The Differential Role of Cognitive and Affective Trust

As noted, trust can be categorised according to whether it is more cognitively or

affectively oriented. Implicit in this multidimensional view of trust is the assumption that

affective and cognitive forms of trust ought to be to functionally different in terms of their

nomological network. In the case of trust in leaders, it follows that affective and cognitive

trust in the leader might have partially different antecedents and outcomes. For example,

certain leadership styles may be more conducive to building affective trust than others.

However, the empirical evidence for the affective-cognitive distinction is by no means

indisputable. Dirks and Ferrin’s (2002) meta-analysis found that cognitive trust had a

# stronger association with antecedents like procedural justice and attitudinal outcomes such as

intention to quit compared to overall trust and showed a weaker relationship than overall trust

with performance. Unfortunately, their meta-analysis had an insufficient number of studies to

conduct analyses exploring the antecedents and outcomes of cognitive versus affective trust.

# Theoretical and some initial empirical support exists for the idea that different

leadership styles will influence the different trust bases. Affective trust is described as

signifying a genuine care and concern for the relationship partner built on positive, enduring

bonds (McAllister, 1995). Chen and colleagues (2014), for example, argue that the emphasis

on benevolence and managing relationships inherent in paternalistic leadership makes it more

likely to facilitate affective trust. Other styles which also prioritise the relationship and/or the

needs of the follower are likely to be more conducive to building affective trust. For instance,

a focus on caring action towards the follower and prioritising their interests is inherent in the

definition of servant leadership (Lemoine et al., 2019). The same could be said about the

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:55)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

# individualised consideration aspect of transformational leadership, although many studies

choose to collapse this into an aggregated measure of overall transformational leadership

(e.g., Phong et al., 2018). Similarly, empowering leadership is a signal of significant

investment in the relationship and the development of the follower, potentially at the expense

of the leader. In contrast, McAllister’s (1995) description of cognitive trust as being grounded

in perceptions of reliability, competence and dependability makes it likely to be influenced by

leadership styles that are focused on signalling the characteristics of the leader as competent

and full of integrity. For this reason, it may be the case that styles such as authentic, ethical,

transactional and transformational leadership will be influential in driving rational, cognitive

judgements about a willingness to be vulnerable to the leader.

As noted, making specific predictions about the styles in relation to the bases of trust

is hard due to the overlap between them on the dimensional level and the lack of studies

focusing on these separate dimensions in relation to trust. Indeed, failure to explore

differential effects for dimensions of a given style constitutes a considerable critique of the

leadership literature overall (Banks et al., 2016; Hughes et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; van

Knippenberg & Sitkin, 2013). Most leadership studies aggregate measures of leadership to

form an overall score (i.e., of overall servant leadership). However, if the conceptual core of

the different styles is sufficiently different despite the dimensional overlap, this may still

shine through in differential relationships with the two forms of trust. Our meta-analysis

serves to provide initial evidence to identify which leaderships styles are associated more

strongly with different bases of trust, thus providing support for their differing nomological

networks. In line with this, we hypothesise:

Hypothesis 2: Different leadership styles will have differential relationships with

# cognitive and affective trust.

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:56)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

The most studied leadership style in relation to the different bases of trust is

transformational leadership, with similar effects for both trust bases being found (Chiang &

Lin, 2016; Conchie et al., 2012; Zhu & Akhtar, 2014a; Zhu & Akhtar, 2014b). However

differential relationships with outcomes have also been demonstrated (e.g. Zhu et al., 2013).

For example, Schaubroeck et al. (2011) reported a relationship between transformational

leadership and cognitive but not affective trust. Conversely, they found a significant

# relationship between servant leadership and affective but not cognitive trust. Empirical

studies investigating the relationship between the different bases of trust and performance

also show mixed results with some studies reporting that affective trust is a more powerful

antecedent (e.g., Miao et al., 2014; Yang & Mossholder, 2010), while others report cognitive

trust has a stronger relationship with performance (e.g., Zhu & Akhtar, 2014a; Yang et al.,

2009). Taken together, the literature on the differential impact of trust bases is by no means

consistent and at the team level, a meta-analysis suggested the two bases demonstrate similar

relationships with performance related outcomes (de Jong et al., 2016). Given this

inconsistency, a key aim of our meta-analysis to explore the empirical evidence for affective

and cognitive trust having different functional relationships with leadership styles and

performance related outcomes. We hypothesise:

Hypothesis 3: Cognitive and affective trust will provide unique mediating roles in the

relationship between leadership styles and performance related outcomes.

# Method

To locate studies for inclusion in the meta- analysis, we first performed a

comprehensive search for studies that examined trust in the leader published in or before June

- 2019. Our search was not constrained in terms of starting year. The first paper to meet our

inclusion criteria was from 1988. We used several databases, including EBSCOHost,

# (cid:32)(cid:49)(cid:57)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

ProQuest, PsycINFO, and ScienceDirect. We used ‘trust*” and “leader*” as the initial search

terms to identify manuscripts that included these terms in their title or abstract. This initial

search returned around 40,000 results (depending on the database used) and included peer-

reviewed manuscripts as well as unpublished work such as dissertations and conference

papers. The inclusion criteria required papers to: (i) report individual level, empirical,

quantitative data; and (ii) provide a zero-order correlation between any measure of leadership

styles and trust in the leader; or (iii) provide a zero-order correlation between trust in the

leader and any other-rated (or objective) measure of follower performance or OCB. In order

to calculate the sampling error, the study had to report sample size. In instances where the

appropriate statistics were not provided in the original manuscript, efforts were made to

contact corresponding authors and obtain the information necessary for inclusion. Overall, we

identified a total of 170 empirical articles that met our inclusion criteria. 15 of these articles

included multiple studies, yielding a total of 185 independent samples. Of these articles, 19

were unpublished (for full details of the papers included see Appendix B; all appendices

mentioned in this article can be found online as supplemental materials).

In order to obtain correlations between leadership styles and performance outcomes,

we first looked for previous meta-analyses that had included corrected correlations between

leadership styles and other-rated performance and OCB (e.g., Banks et al., 2016). As can be

seen in Appendix A, we relied on previous meta-analyses to provide most of the correlations

between leadership styles and employees’ performance and OCB (both other rated). For some

relationships, we additionally searched for papers that had correlations between leadership

styles (if not already available from other meta-analyses; see Appendix A). Details of the

studies included in our analysis can be found in Appendix B which includes a breakdown of

the articles used to produce meta-analytic correlations for each relationship. The coding of

the studies was completed by one of the authors. Once completed, another author (who did

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:48)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

not code the original studies) double coded 10% of the studies. The intercoder percentage of

agreement across the study variables was 100% indicating no discrepancies in the coding of

# key information such as scale reliabilities and correlations between variables. Measures of

trust in the leader were coded as affective, cognitive or overall trust in line with the coding

protocol set out by de Jong and colleagues (2016). Measures that captured aspects of trust

such as competence, reliability, integrity, consistency and fairness were coded as cognitive

trust. The affective trust code was applied to measures that referenced benevolence,

disclosure of information, concern for welfare or goodwill. Papers where the authors had

addressed more than one of these dimensions in the same measure, or where the

operationalisation of trust was more general, were coded as overall trust.

Our meta-analysis adopted the Hunter and Schmidt (2015) approach. This method

produces a sample weighted mean correlation (r) as well as a mean correlation corrected for

unreliability in both criterion and predictor variables, referred to as the corrected population

# correlation (ρ). 90% confidence intervals (90% CI) of the sample-weighted mean correlation

and the 80% credibility intervals (80% CV) of the corrected population correlation were also

calculated and reported. Furthermore, in order to better determine whether moderators were

present, we calculated the percentage of variance accounted for in the corrected population

correlation by sampling and measurement error (% VE).

In order to examine the mediating effects, relative and incremental predictive validity

issues addressed in our research questions, we used meta-analytical path analyses (see

Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995). Relative weights analysis assesses the relative contribution (i.e.,

relative importance) among several (often correlated) independent variables in a regression

analysis. Relative weights analysis converts the total variance predicted in a regression model

(i.e., R squared) into weights that indicate the proportional contribution of the various

independent variables. Specifically, these weights can be interpreted as the percentage of

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:49)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

variance explained in the outcome (e.g., trust in leader) that can be attributed to each

independent variable (i.e., leadership style). Relative weights analysis deals with the problem

caused by correlated predictors by using a variable transformation approach that takes into

account a variable’s contribution to an outcome by itself and in combination with other

predictor variables (see Johnson, 2000; Johnson & LeBreton, 2004; LeBreton & Tonidandel,

2008; Tonidandel & LeBreton, 2011, for a detailed discussion of relative weight analysis).

Relative weights analysis is commonplace within meta-analyses in the management field (see

Hoch et al., 2018; Kurtessis et al., 2017; Lee et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020). To conduct

relative weights analysis, we first produced a correlation matrix, which included meta-

analytic correlations between all study variables (where possible). Using this correlation

matrix, we conducted relative weights analyses, using Tonidandel and LeBreton’s (2011)

# guidelines.

All path models were estimated using robust maximum likelihood estimation within

MPlus (version 7). In order to do this, we first calculated the harmonic mean of each

subsample size in order to arrive at a sample size for our analysis. This was required due to

the fact that sample sizes varied across the various cells of the aforementioned correlation

# matrices (Viswesvaran & Ones, 1995).

# Results

# Relative Effects of Leadership on Trust

The first aim of this meta-analysis was to determine the extent to which various

contemporary leadership styles predicted trust in the leader above the effects of

# transformational leadership and transactional leadership (i.e., Research Question 1). Rather

than focus on overall transactional leadership, based on our findings, we decided to focus on

contingent reward as our measure of transactional leadership given this dimension had much

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:50)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

stronger effects than MBE (see Table 3). To examine the relative effects of the contemporary

leadership styles over the full-range model, we first calculated the main effects of each

leadership style, including transformational leadership and contingent reward, on trust in the

leader. We also calculated correlations between the newer leadership styles and

transformational and contingent reward leadership (see Appendix A). As can be seen in Table

2, all leadership styles were significantly associated with trust in the leader.

Next, our relative weights analysis assessed the relative contribution of each

leadership style to trust in the leader and results are shown in Table 4. The results suggest that

the newer forms of leadership all have a relatively large association with trust in the leader.

For instance, servant, authentic, ethical, empowering, and paternalistic leadership all had a

relative weight over 35%. In the case of paternalistic leadership, both the moral (28.53%) and

benevolent (38.27%) dimensions explained greater variance than transformational leadership

(16.59). We could not include transactional leadership in this analysis due to a lack of

primary studies. In the case of abusive supervision, this leadership style had a lower relative

weight (21.83%) than did transformational leadership (39.01) or contingent reward (39.16).

# Insert Table 2, 3 and 4 about Here

The utility of the newer forms of leadership is further emphasised in the incremental

predictive validity analysis, included in Table 5. This table reports variance explained in the

criterion (trust in the leader) by transformational and contingent reward leadership and the

incremental variance explained by each of the other forms of leadership (i.e., authentic,

servant, ethical, empowering, paternalistic, and abusive). Results demonstrate that each of

these six leadership styles explained significant variance in trust in the leader over

transformational and contingent reward leadership. The amount of additional variance

explained varied across the leadership styles. Abusive supervision explained the least

additional variance (6%). Ethical leadership and authentic leadership both explained 10%

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:51)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

beyond transformational and contingent reward leadership, while empowering leadership

explained an additional 11%. The leadership styles which explained the most additional

variance were servant (20%) and paternalistic leadership (58% across the three dimensions).

However, it must be noted that for paternalistic leadership we were only able to assess

incremental validity over transformational leadership as too few primary studies examined

the association between paternalistic leadership and contingent reward. Taken together, the

results of the analyses suggest that while all the leadership styles tested demonstrated

incremental predictive validity, servant leadership style was best able to explain incremental

## validity over transformational and contingent reward leadership.

# Insert Table 5 about Here

Our second research question focused on exploring the relative importance of the

newer leadership theories. Thus, besides exploring the relative contribution of the newer

leadership styles with transformational and transactional leadership, we also conducted

relative weights analysis comparing these newer styles with one another. Too few primary

studies existed to examine all styles together in one analysis. Therefore, Table 4 shows the

relative weights analysis comparing the associations between servant, ethical, authentic and

abusive leadership to trust in the leader. For overall trust in the leader, servant leadership

demonstrated the largest relative contribution (31.39%) compared to the other styles.

## Mediating Mechanisms: The Role of Trust in the Leader and LMX Quality

# Table 6 highlights the meta-analytic correlations between trust in the leader and

performance and OCB (other-rated). As can be seen in the table, trust in the leader was

significantly correlated with both performance (p = .30) and OCB (p = .34). To address

Hypothesis 1 regarding the mediation effects of trust in relation to LMX, we conducted path

analysis (MASEM), which required additional meta-analytic correlations between the

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:52)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

leadership styles and LMX as well as the outcome variables (see Appendix A). The

mediation analysis, presented in Table 7, shows that all leadership styles had a significant

indirect effect on performance through trust in the leader. For OCB, a significant indirect

pathway via trust in the leader was found for all leadership styles with the exception of

paternalistic leadership. LMX was also found to mediate the effects of all the leadership

# styles on performance except for the authoritarian dimension of paternalistic leadership.

# Insert Table 6 about Here

Comparing the size of the indirect effects suggests that compared to LMX, trust in the

leader explained significantly more variance in the relationship between many leadership

styles and job performance. Specifically, significantly larger indirect effects were found for

transformational, servant, and ethical leadership and performance via trust compared to

LMX. This is indicated by non-overlapping 95% confidence intervals. Except for

paternalistic leadership, we also found trust to be the strongest mediator for all leadership

styles when OCB was the outcome of interest. Significantly larger indirect effects were found

for transformational, servant, authentic, empowering, abusive, and ethical leadership and

OCB via trust compared to LMX. The findings show LMX and trust in the leader are

distinctive explanatory pathways which can each explain unique variance supporting

# Hypothesis 1.

## The Differential Role of Cognitive and Affective Trust

The final aim of our meta-analysis was to explore the role of cognitive and affective

trust as separate dimensions of trust in the leader. Enough primary studies were available to

explore the effects of transformational, servant, authentic, ethical, abusive, and empowering

leadership on cognitive and affective trust. The aforementioned leadership styles predict

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:53)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

cognitive and affective trust to a similar extent and no significant differences were found in

these main effects (see Table 2).

The relative effects of the leadership styles on cognitive and affective trust over

transformational leadership are shown in Table 3. The relative weights analysis highlights

differences across the two bases of trust, supporting Hypothesis 2. Specifically,

transformational leadership is the dominant predictor of cognitive trust and thus explains a

larger amount of variance compared to all other leadership styles. However, for affective

trust, ethical leadership (63.17) and servant leadership (56.86) explained more variance

compared to transformational leadership. As was the case for overall trust in the leader, we

also conducted relative weights analysis comparing the associations between servant, ethical,

authentic and abusive leadership to cognitive and affective trust in the leader. For cognitive

trust in the leader, authentic leadership showed the largest contribution (34.92%), whereas

ethical leadership had the largest association with affective trust (34.38%).

As shown in Table 4, the incremental predictive validity analysis highlights that

servant, ethical, and authentic leadership showed modest incremental predictive validity over

transformational leadership for cognitive trust. Each of these styles demonstrated an 11%

increase in the variance explained above transformational leadership. Empowering leadership

accounted for an additional 9% variance in cognitive trust over transformational leadership,

while abusive supervision showed no evidence of incremental validity. Both servant and

ethical leadership predicted affective trust to a greater extent than transformational

leadership, accounting for 31% and 30% additional variance respectively. Authentic

leadership accounted for an additional 22% of the variance of affective trust.

In terms of predicting performance outcomes, both cognitive and affective trust have

significant correlations with performance and OCB (see Table 6). Furthermore, as shown in

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:54)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

Table 7, affective trust significantly predicted both performance and OCB when included in a

regression with cognitive trust. In contrast, cognitive trust did not predict either outcome.

This suggests that the effects of trust in the leader on performance outcomes are driven by the

affective rather the cognitive component and provides further support for the differential

effects of these bases of trust. Finally, we conducted MASEM analysis to further explore trust

in the leader as a mediator between leadership and performance outcomes focusing on the

differential effects of cognitive and affective trust (see Table 8). Again, we included LMX as

# an additional mediator.

Comparing the two bases of trust first, any positive indirect effects were driven purely

by affective trust. Conversely, for each leadership style, cognitive trust demonstrated negative

indirect effects. Affective trust and LMX accounted for unique variance in the mediation

analysis. Which was the strongest mediator varied by leadership style and as a function of

outcome. In the case of transformational leadership, affective trust was the stronger mediator

for both OCB (.18) and performance (.10) when compared to LMX. A similar pattern of

results was found for abusive supervision as the negative indirect effect for affective trust was

consistently stronger for both performance (-10) and OCB (-.13). Overall, the analysis

suggests differential effects do emerge as a function of the trust base (Hypothesis 3).

# Discussion

The seminal works of scholars such as Mayer et al. (1995) and Dirks and Ferrin

(2002) helped to cement trust as a vital concept within the organisational literature. Since

then, interest in the topic of interpersonal trust at work has continued to grow. Nowhere has

this been more evident than within the leadership domain where trust is frequently identified

as a key variable in the leadership process (e.g., Chan & Mak, 2014; Wu et al., 2012; Zhu et

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:55)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

al., 2013). However, to date, trust and leadership research has produced a complex and

cumbersome literature that undermines understanding and the development of clear practical

guidance for leaders. The aim of this meta-analysis is to bring some much-needed clarity to

the area in four key ways. First, we synthesise existing empirical work to produce robust

estimates of the correlations between eight leadership styles and follower trust in the leader.

Second, we explore the relative importance of these different leadership styles for facilitating

trust. Third, we investigate the role of LMX quality and trust in the leader as competing SET

mediators. Finally, we examine the differential role of cognitive and affective trust as SET

mechanisms in the relationship of leadership styles and follower performance related

outcomes. We discuss our findings in relation to our research questions and hypotheses

# below.

## Relative Effects of Leadership Styles on Trust in the Leader

First and foremost, our findings support the belief that trust is a core mechanism through

which the impact of leadership behaviours can be realised. Our results provide evidence that

ethical, servant, authentic, abusive and empowering leadership all offer some incremental

effects on trust in the leader compared to transformational and contingent reward leadership

(see Table 5). Of these styles, servant leadership demonstrated the largest incremental effects

suggesting it offers unique effects for trust that extend beyond those captured by the full-

range model. One of the elements of servant leadership that is likely to distinguish it from

other styles is the emphasis placed not only on a leaders’ moral responsibility to the success

of the organisation, his or her subordinates, but also the organisation’s customers, and the

wider community (Lemoine et al., 2019). In other words, servant leadership’s distinctive

focus is on serving multiple stakeholders. Our findings suggest that this wider stakeholder

focus may be important for building trust with followers.

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:56)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

An interesting finding to emerge was that abusive supervision, a destructive

leadership style, had the weakest association with trust in the leader compared to the other

styles included in our analysis. Abusive supervision had the smallest overall correlation with

trust in the leader and demonstrated no incremental effects above transformational and

contingent reward leadership. In their recent review, Tepper et al. (2017) highlight that very

few studies have compared the effects of abusive supervision within more comprehensive

models of leadership behaviour. Indeed, the authors called for research exploring “…the

relative importance of abusive supervision in predicting leadership criteria…compared to

traditionally studied leader behaviours” (pg. 136). Our findings suggest that, compared to

transformational and contingent reward leadership, abusive supervision has little impact on

trust. However, it is important to highlight that our analysis treats these styles separately and

does not account for the fact that leaders may engage in a wide variety of behaviours (e.g.,

demonstrate multiple leadership styles simultaneously). Studies have demonstrated that

supervisors who act abusively may also behave supportively within otherwise high-quality

relationships, a combination that can cause more damage than abusive behaviour alone (e.g.,

## Duffy et al., 2002; Lian et al., 2012; Xu et al., 2015).

Reflecting further on the findings, paternalistic leadership also appears to be a style

which is particularly effective over transformational leadership in eliciting followers’ trust in

the leader. Several parallels exist between paternalistic and transformational leadership. For

instance, the idealised influence of transformational leadership is conceptually close to the

morality dimension of paternalistic leadership, as it raises the consciousness of followers to

higher levels of morality and motivation by appealing to their ideals and moral values (e.g.,

Bass, 1985). However, despite these overlaps, our analysis highlights a distinct relationship

between paternalistic leadership and trust in the leader, thus lending support to the argument

# (cid:32)(cid:50)(cid:57)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

that these two leadership styles are empirically distinct (see Cheng et al., 2004; Hiller et al.,

2019).

A critical distinction between paternalistic and transformational leadership is the

extent to which leaders are involved with the welfare of their followers. Transformational

leaders provide individualised care, but this is usually limited to the work context.

Paternalistic leaders, on the other hand, are theorised to also provide such care in their

followers’ work and personal lives (Chen et al., 2014). Further, the benevolence dimension of

paternalistic leadership was the strongest predictor compared to transformational leadership.

This finding is consistent with the recent work of Hiller and colleagues (2019) which

highlighted that the benevolence component is not being fully captured in other mainstream

leadership styles. Our finding that benevolent leadership is particularly important for trust is

in line with many theoretical works which place benevolence as a critical determinant of trust

(e.g., Mayer et al., 1995). Benevolence denotes care and concern and behaviours that signal

having the employee’s best interests at heart are likely to evoke employee gratitude and

indebtedness (Chen et al., 2014), thus helping to fuel social exchanges. As a relatively new

addition to leadership discourse, it is of value to see how paternalistic leadership configures

alongside other contemporary approaches. Also, given that paternalistic leadership has been

studied more in non-Western contexts, it is of interest in future work to address whether these

effects generalise to Western contexts.

Finally, it is interesting to note that all the leadership variables included in our analysis

are significantly correlated with trust in the leader. This finding can be interpreted in several

ways. One explanation is that all these leadership styles can influence follower trust. Some

leaders may, for example, create trust through providing autonomy (i.e., empowering

leadership), whereas others may do so by showing behavioural integrity (i.e., authentic

leadership). Alternatively, it could be argued that there is a large empirical overlap between

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:48)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

leadership styles, some of which may be redundant (Banks et al., 2018). As noted, some of

this potential redundancy is particularly evident when looking at the underlying dimensions

proposed to be part of the different leadership styles. Relatedly because the scales used to

measure leadership styles are typically follower rated, responses may represent followers’

overall evaluation of their leader rather than any specific leadership behaviour or style (e.g.,

Lee et al., 2015). This is an issue within the wider leadership literature that needs to be

addressed in future research. Despite the overlap between the leadership styles alluded to

above, our relative weights and incremental validity analysis can begin to highlight where

uniqueness between them does in fact exist.

## Relative Effects across Contemporary Leadership Styles

An ancillary aim of the current research was to estimate the relative effects of ethical,

authentic, servant, and abusive leadership. As discussed, the leadership literature has been

critiqued for construct redundancy, with high correlations being observed between

supposedly distinct leadership styles (e.g., Banks et al., 2018). One way to address this issue

is through critical tests of theory where popular leadership styles are examined concurrently

to determine the value of each construct. Several recent meta-analyses have made progress in

this regard (e.g., Banks et al., 2016; Hoch et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2018; Lee et al., 2020; Ng &

Feldman, 2015) and we seek to contribute to this literature.

Our findings have important implications for the leadership field. On the one hand,

the high correlations observed between servant, ethical, and authentic leadership further

# highlight the theoretical and empirical overlap between these morally-based constructs.

Lemoine and colleagues (2019) argued that the similar effects observed among these different

moral approaches has led to “conceptual vagueness regarding their unique content” (pg. 177).

On the other hand, we find evidence that each of these styles has relative importance for trust

depending on how it is measured. Our results suggest authentic leaders are best able to build

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:49)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

cognitive trust in followers, while ethical leaders are best able to develop affective trust.

These findings help in mapping the differing nomological networks of cognitive and affective

bases of trust in terms of differing relationships with antecedents. Going forward, our results

also highlight a means for the leadership literature to address current critiques by refining

theoretical and empirical investigations of leadership to establish a more accurate picture of

distinct effects. Exploring differential effects for the dimensions of a given style would allow

for less overlap and more specific, granular predictions in terms of outcomes. It is likely that,

such efforts would reveal a more nuanced and complex picture due to the multi-faceted

# nature of leadership styles.

Take for example, servant leadership which is typically conceptualised as a multi-

dimensional construct. The most common measure of servant leadership (Liden et al., 2008

scale) includes seven dimensions: emotional healing, creating value for the community,

conceptual skills, empowering, helping subordinates, grow and succeed, putting subordinates

first, behaving ethically. As servant leadership is multi-faceted, the link with the two bases of

trust is likely to be through different dimensions. One could argue servant leaders create trust

by acting with integrity and ethics (thus suggestive of an important link to cognitive trust).

However, the care and concern implied by other aspects of the style (such as the

empowerment component) may be germane for building affective trust. Such a discussion

portrays the complexities of trying to tease out the differential nature of the relationship for a

given leadership style with the bases of trust. In Appendix C (online), we offer a table that

indicates the strength of the theoretical link between the dimensions of a given style with

cognitive and affective trust as well as LMX quality. Any efforts to further test these links

should go hand in hand with improved study design that can reduce endogeneity biases and

# provide more accurate estimates of the relationship between leadership variables and

## outcomes (e.g., Antonakis et al., 2010; Hughes et al., 2018).

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:50)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

## Mediating Mechanisms: Trust in the Leader and LMX Quality

Trust in the leader and LMX quality represent competing SET based variables that

can explain the link between leadership styles and follower outcomes. While LMX is one of

the most frequent operationalisations of SET, trust and particularly affective trust is among

the most content valid (Colquitt et al., 2014). Overall, the results of our mediation analysis

provided two key findings. Firstly, LMX quality and trust in the leader were distinct

mediators each demonstrating significant indirect effects between leadership and both

performance and OCB. The exception to this overall pattern relates to paternalistic

leadership. Specifically, we found that trust did not mediate the relationship between any of

the dimensions of paternalistic leadership and OCB, while LMX did not mediate the

authoritarian dimension of paternalistic leadership. Taken together these findings highlight

that LMX and trust in the leader provide distinctive exploratory pathways for both other-rated

# performance outcomes.

The second notable finding from our mediation analysis was that for most leadership

styles, trust in the leader explained a greater proportion of the overall indirect effect with

performance and OCB compared to LMX quality. The exceptions were the relationship

between empowering leadership and performance and between the moral and benevolent

dimensions of paternalistic leadership and OCB; where LMX explained a larger proportion of

the indirect effect. These findings are interesting, especially as previous meta-analyses

comparing the mediating role of LMX and trust have generally found stronger indirect effects

between specific styles of leadership and follower outcomes via LMX compared to trust. In

their meta-analysis, Nohe and Hertel (2017) found that LMX was the strongest mediator

between transformational leadership and OCB. Similarly, Lee and colleagues (2020) found

LMX was the primary mediating mechanism for relationships between servant leadership and

a range of employee outcomes as well as between empowering leadership and job

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:51)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

performance, although trust was more important for OCB. Our findings support Lee et al.’s

(2018) finding of larger indirect effects between empowering leadership and OCB via trust

compared to LMX and vice versa for employee performance. However, the overall pattern of

our results highlight trust as the primary mediating mechanism in contrast to both Nohe and

Hertel (2017) and Lee and colleagues (2020). These differences may be explained by

differences in the empirical studies that inform our analyses. Lee and colleagues (2020) and

Nohe and Hertel (2017) both draw on a smaller sample of primary studies, used a mixture of

self-rated and non-self-rated employee outcomes, and included additional non SET mediators

# alongside trust and LMX.

In summary, our mediation findings suggest that both trust and LMX offer distinct

pathways and provide support for the view of them as unique mediating mechanisms. The

uniqueness observed in our analysis may be indicative of the differing extent to which these

two mediators are in fact capturing the SET process. While LMX is a popular

operationalisation of SET, it has been argued that LMX measures (e.g., LMX-7; Graen &

Uhl-Bien, 1995) suffer from a shortage of items which are explicitly ‘exchange’ based

(Bernerth et al., 2007). For LMX, the SET conceptualisation may be more diffuse, often

reflecting more role-making aspects of the relationship (Bernerth et al., 2007). Trust, and in

particular affective trust, may offer a more accurate, focused operationalisation of SET. More

generally, our mediation results underscore the value of testing multiple social-exchange

# mediators.

## The Differential Role of Cognitive and Affective Trust

An increase in studies adopting multidimensional operationalisations allowed us to

explore the effects of the cognitive and affective components of trust. Interestingly, when

considered in parallel, affective trust in the leader was the only significant predictor of

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:52)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

performance and OCB. This constitutes an important finding as debate continues about the

extent to which these bases of trust are empirically distinct (van Knippenberg, 2018). From a

SET perspective, our findings suggest that affective trust is particularly powerful for

facilitating the exchange process between a leader and follower. Indeed, Colquitt and

colleagues (2014) identified affective trust as one of the most ‘content-valid indicators of

social exchange relationships’ (p. 609). Further, such a finding is consistent with the view

that affective trust represents a more enduring and powerful form of trust (McAllister, 1995;

# Williams, 2001).

We note that a meta-analysis by de Jong et al. (2016) revealed that cognitive and

affective team trust predicted team performance to a similar extent. Our findings paint a

different picture for trust in the leader at the individual level. Specifically, we found evidence

that affective trust in the leader is a more powerful predictor of OCB and performance

compared to cognitive trust suggesting that, in the context of a relationship with one’s leader,

affective trust may be more critical. This may be symptomatic of differences in how the

social exchange relationship operates in leader-follower exchange relationships compared to

# team relationships. The power differential and stronger hierarchical dependence inherent in

the leader-follower relationship (Emerson, 1962; Lapidot et al., 2007) may result in a

situation where issues such as care, concern and benevolence are more important for

performance or citizenship. In contrast, in less hierarchical team level relationships, where

team members may work more interdependently, aspects of cognitive trust such as the

competence and dependability of one’s team members may be of greater (or equal) concern.

We also find that servant and ethical leadership styles are more influential in driving

affective trust than the dominant theories of the full-range model. Servant and ethical leaders

put their followers first, even at the expense of themselves and organisational objectives

(Brown et al., 2005; Lee et al., 2020). This represents a key point of conceptual departure as

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:53)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

transformational leaders are more concerned with advancing organisational objectives (Bass,

2000). The findings reinforce the view that studies should adopt multidimensional measures

to tease out which form of trust is more important in creating desirable consequences and

which leadership styles are most likely to facilitate that trust. When studies choose to adopt

overall measures of trust, these nuances may be missed.

Turning to our mediation analysis, affective trust and LMX quality jointly explained

the indirect effects of leadership styles with outcomes whereas cognitive trust did not explain

the relationship in the expected direction. Interestingly, affective trust explains a larger

proportion of the indirect effects between all leadership styles and OCB. This is supportive of

the argument that affective trust most accurately captures features of the social exchange

relationship by evoking sentiments such as commitment and intrinsic significance (Colquitt et

al., 2014). As discretionary behaviour, OCB represents important SET currency (Lee et al.,

- 2019) that is especially useful in maintaining balanced exchanges (e.g., Ilies et al., 2007).

Finally, the negative indirect effects found for cognitive trust are likely indicative of a

suppression effect. According to Cohen and Cohen (1983), a suppression effect occurs

whenever one of the three possible pair-wise correlations among these three variables is less

than the product of the other two. The suppression effect likely comes from the

multicollinearity between the bases of trust, LMX and the leadership variables. For instance,

a high correlation (p = .77) was observed between cognitive and affective trust (see Table 6).

# Practical Implications

A number of practical implications can be garnered from these findings. It is

important to reflect on the fact that the relationship between affective trust in the leader and

performance outcomes was significantly stronger than that of cognitive trust. Importantly,

this finding differed to that of team trust which found equal effects for both bases of trust (de

Jong et al., 2016). As such, our meta-analysis suggests that organisations looking to enhance

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:54)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

leader-follower trust should look to facilitate this base of trust in particular. Employee

affective trust is driven by a perception that the leader has good intentions towards them and

cares for their wellbeing. Therefore, training aimed at equipping managers with the skills to

develop such positive orientations in employees where affective trust can emerge would be

highly beneficial. The most practical strategy for meaningfully targeting trust in this way is to

focus on developing those leadership styles most associated with affective trust. Based on the

findings of this meta-analysis, leadership development programs targeted at ethical and

servant leadership would be particularly beneficial. Equally, organisations could look to

select leaders who demonstrate an inclination towards a given leadership style. For example,

many leadership assessment processes now include the measurement of leadership styles

through practitioner-oriented scales such as the MLQ or integrity tests. Through adopting

such suggestions, organisations will not only benefit from enhanced performance and OCB,

but many of the other salutatory benefits which may follow from trust in the workplace. It is

also important to note, however, that many leadership styles have significant direct effects on

either performance or OCB over and above the indirect effects observed via trust or LMX. If

organisations are purely interested in influencing performance or OCB, our analysis suggests

that transformational and servant leadership have the largest overall effects on these variables

# respectively.

# Limitations & Future Research Directions

Our meta-analysis is impacted by the limitations of the studies which we have included.

In particular, we note two key limitations in the trust and leadership literatures. First, a lack

of consensus around the measurement of trust is well documented in the literature and leading

scholars in the area have called for a more unified approach (e.g. Dietz & Den Hartog, 2006;

McEvily & Tortoriello, 2011). As noted by a number of researchers (e.g., Aguinis et al.,

2010; Hoch et al., 2018), every meta-analytic study is subject to a variety of subjective

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:55)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

judgements; for example, when it comes to retrieving relevant studies and the coding of data.

To reduce issues related to the former, we conducted an exhaustive search of studies on

leadership and trust in the leader. Second, to address coding issues, a proportion of the data

was double coded to minimize judgement impacts. Despite these efforts, these limitations

may have unintentionally influenced the findings. On a related note, we recognise that some

of the comparisons drawn in our analysis were based on relatively small numbers of studies

and, in these instances, results should be interpreted with some caution.

Another limitation acquired from the empirical literature is that of causal inference. A

large proportion of the studies on trust in leaders have been conducted cross-sectionally with

only a handful of time-lagged designs (e.g., Newman et al., 2014; Zhang & Zhou, 2014) or

experimental (Hoyt & Blascovich, 2003). This limits our ability to demonstrate causality in

the relationship between leadership styles, trust and performance outcomes. In addition,

McAllister (1995) argues that cognitive trust is a necessary precondition for the development

of affective trust. Typically, however, trust is captured as a static variable rather than a

dynamic construct which changes over time. Further research is therefore required to

investigate these relationships using longitudinal and experimental methods to more

accurately account for the issue of time. Despite this, a strength of our meta-analysis was that

we only focused on other-rated outcomes for performance and OCB. This goes some way in

helping alleviate concerns regarding common method variance (Podsakoff et al., 2003).

It is important to consider our meta-analytic findings in relation to the wider leadership

literature. The literature has been subject to high profile critiques regarding the

conceptualisation, measurement and study design (e.g., Antonakis et al., 2010; Hughes et al.,

# 2018). Critiques of transformational (van Knippenberg & Sitkin 2013), and authentic

(Alvesson & Einola, 2019) leadership highlight one issue of particular relevance to the

current analysis. Both critiques point out that the conceptualisation and operationalisation of

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:56)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

these prominent leadership styles confound the variable with its effects. For instance, in

relation to trust, it is argued the perception that the leader instils trust is conceptualised as part

# of the charismatic (i.e., idealised influence) dimension of transformational leadership and

thus part of the independent variable as well as the mediating variable. Worryingly, this

tautology and a priori positive framing may also be relevant to the scale used to measure

ethical leadership which asks followers directly whether their leader “can be trusted” (Brown

et al., 2005). In fact, the value-based and moral behaviour models of leadership in general

tend to correlate heavily with constructs traditionally examined as outcome variables (e.g.,

trust) and thus are carriers of endogeneity bias (Banks et al., 2018). Such an explanation may,

at least, partly explain the high correlations found between the different leadership styles and

trust in the leader. To begin to address these issues, we echo the call for future research to

focus on the measurement of specific behaviours enacted by leaders rather than only broad,

## over-positive leadership styles (e.g., Van Quaquebeke & Felps, 2018).

The focus of the primary studies involved in our sample led to some further limitations

and highlight important areas to be addressed by future empirical work in the area. First, the

nascent nature of some of the styles included in our meta-analysis, combined with the rarity

of studying multiple styles within a single empirical study, means it is not yet possible to

compare the influence of all styles within a single model. We recommend that scholars

investigating novel leadership styles include the role of established styles in their models to

determine issues of relative influence. In addition, an insufficient number of primary studies

were available for some of the leadership styles to meaningfully test the mediated

relationships for both cognitive and affective trust. As such, greater uptake of

multidimensional measures of trust are needed to help to tease out their differential roles. As

noted, many styles also have subdimensions that may logically be more related to cognitive

or affective forms of trust. As research often only reports on the overall style, it is not

# (cid:32)(cid:51)(cid:57)(cid:32)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

currently possible to disentangle such effects. More studies focusing on the specific

subdimensions can help remedy this and the table in Appendix C may serve as a useful guide.

We also did not find sufficient studies which examined (or reported examining) trust in senior

leadership, making comparisons across leader level impossible. The relative homogeneity of

studies in the field in terms of leader level is a limitation as well as a potential area for future

# research.

Finally, it is important to acknowledge mechanisms other than LMX and trust are

likely to be operating. For instance, future work could consider other related variables which

revolve around the relationship between the leader and follower such as relational

identification. Another interesting avenue may be to consider the relationship between the

three dimensions of paternalistic leadership and OCB which were not found to be mediated

by trust in leader. Instead the dimensions of paternalistic leadership had relatively large direct

effects on followers’ OCB which may indicate that paternalistic leadership is a leadership

style with the potential to directly impact on follower behaviour. Alternatively, it may that

more motivational mediators such as self-efficacy may better explain the indirect effect

## between paternalistic leadership and follower OCB (e.g., Lin et al., 2015).

To conclude, in the complex, interdependent contexts of contemporary organisations

it is no longer appropriate to see trust as an exogenous factor, something of benefit if it

should happen to be present. The findings of this meta-analysis attest to this, having

demonstrated strong relationships between affective trust and performance outcomes. If trust

is a defining component of leadership (e.g., Shamir & Lapidot, 2003), determining which

styles are most relevant for facilitating its expression is of fundamental importance to both

the trust and leadership literatures. Our findings would suggest that ethical and servant

leadership hold most promise in this regard. So too may paternalistic leadership, following

## List of Leadership Styles, Definitions and Source

# Leadership Style Definition

# Authentic Leadership

A pattern of leader behaviour that draws upon and promotes both positive psychological capacities and a positive ethical climate, to foster greater self-awareness, an internalised moral perspective, balanced processing of information, and relational transparency on the part of leaders working with followers, fostering positive self- development.

# Servant Leadership

An understanding and practice of leadership that places the good of those led over the self- interest of the leader, emphasizing leader behaviors that focus on follower development, and de-emphasizing glorification of the leader.

## Ethical Leadership The demonstration of normatively appropriate

conduct through personal actions and interpersonal relationships, and the promotion of such conduct to followers through two-way communication, reinforcement, and decision- making.

Theorised link to trust

Authentic leaders build benevolence and integrity by encouraging open communication, engaging their followers, sharing critical information, and sharing their perceptions and feelings. This form of individualised concern and respect should build trust through positive SEs. Further, high moral standards, integrity, and honesty, should fosters positive expectations among followers, enhancing their levels of trust.

Servant leaders are concerned with the betterment of their followers. For instance, a servant leader encourages followers to plan for future opportunities, is willing to delegate responsibilities and share authority with followers. When followers feel that they are receiving such benefits from the servant leader, they should be motivated to trust their leader.

Ethical leaders’ fair treatment, consistent behaviour, and clear communication likely result in trust from followers. Such behaviours signal SE behaviours that are likely to promote positive interactions and reciprocity from followers. Further it is argued that ethical leaders are likely to inspire trust in followers as ethical behaviour signals these leaders take an interest in issues beyond themselves, rather than being egotistical.

# Paternalistic Leadership

A style that combines strong discipline and authority with fatherly benevolence. The most common measure treats paternalistic as three dimensional, consisting of authority, benevolence, and morality (Cheng, Chou, & Farh, 2000; Cheng, Chou, Wu, Huang, & Farh, 2004). In this conceptualisation, authoritarianism is a strong form of authority which reflects the leader's unquestioned authority and control over employees, benevolence reflects the leader's care and concern for the well-being of employees (and their families), and morality reflects the leader's selflessness, moral character, and integrity.

# Empowering Leadership

Leader behaviour directed at individuals or teams that involves delegating authority to employees, promoting their self-directed and autonomous decision making, coaching, sharing information, and asking for input.

# Abusive Supervision

Defined as the extent to which leaders engage in ongoing displays of verbal and non-verbal hostility (Tepper, 2000). Examples of abusive supervision include humiliating employees in public, mocking, belittlement, rudeness, breaking promises and other inappropriate behaviours.

# Transformational Leadership

An ongoing process, whereby “leaders and followers raise one another to higher levels of morality and motivation beyond self-interest to

# (cid:32)(cid:53)(cid:56)(cid:32)

Benevolent leaders show genuine care for their followers and do things to support them. These positive exchanges should strengthen the bonds of trust with followers. Similarly, when leaders act in line with high moral standards and integrity, followers are more likely to be view them as role models, thus developing trust with their leaders. Conversely, the monitoring and controlling behaviours associated with authoritarian leadership is likely to spur negative SE, which results in subordinates’ negative reciprocity and distrust.

Empowering behaviours such as providing discretion and latitude over decision making constitute positive exchange behaviours. Furthermore, empowering ones followers makes a leader vulnerable and demonstrates confidence; key features of trust (Zhang & Zhou, 2014).

The reciprocation of positive exchanges with a leader builds trust. In contrast, if a leader engages in abusive behaviour, it will inevitably reduce followers’ trust in leaders. Thus, in accordance with SET, trust decreases over time as a result of unfavourable exchanges with a leader. Abusive supervision represents unpleasant behaviours that can be predicted to contribute to feelings of distrust of the leader (Tepper, 2007).

Transformational leaders are theorised to increase followers' trust levels by showing concern for their needs, honouring agreements, demonstrating the capability and persistence to

serve collective interests. The dimensions of transformational leadership conceptualised by Bass (1985) include idealised influence (whereby the leader serves as a role model and followers idealize and emulate the behaviours of their trusted leader), inspirational motivation (whereby the leader articulates a clear vision to followers and provides them with symbols and emotional appeals focused on goal achievement), intellectual stimulation (whereby the leader promotes creativity among followers through encouraging them to change ways of thinking and doing), and individualised consideration (whereby the leader addresses needs of followers individually and delegates assignments to them to provide opportunities for learning).

# Transactional Leadership

Transactional leadership is based on an economic exchange process in which the leader provides rewards in return for the subordinate’s effort and performance. The dimensions of transactional leadership model include contingent reward (followers and leaders have a positively reinforcing interaction) and management-by-exception (the leader intervenes only when things go wrong).

# (cid:32)(cid:53)(cid:57)(cid:32)

achieve their vision, and through the encouragement of followers to make their own decisions. Such actions represent positive SEs and over time transformational leaders respected and trusted by their followers (e.g., Bass and Avolio, 1990)

Transactional leadership, in the form of contingent reward, involves the provision of rewards in exchange for followers' meeting performance expectations. By using contingent rewards, transactional leaders tend to acquire trust from followers through a reliable execution of largely economic exchanges (Bass, 1985). Thus, based on SET, as long as the transactional leader consistently recognises followers' performance and provides appropriate rewards, he or she is likely to be trusted for being consistent and showing integrity. Management-by-exception entails a focus on corrective action and (preventing) mistakes and indiscretions in follower behaviour. Although management-by-exception is commonly referred to as transactional it is less exchange based than contingent reward. It is perhaps best described as performance monitoring. This form of leadership is less

# Avolio & Bass (1991)

# TRUST IN LEADERSHIP(cid:32)META-ANALYSIS

# (cid:32)(cid:54)(cid:48)(cid:32)

likely to build trust as followers may see performance monitoring as abusive and controlling in some situations (Kelloway et al., 2005).
