“How are you justifying the sales and expenses estimates?” the CEO

asked. My face glowed red as I stuttered. My heart rate skyrocketed and

my throat tightened. I looked at my boss, Valerie. She made eye contact,

held a soft gaze, and said nothing.

She could have eased some of the heat directed my way by chiming in

and saving me, but she didn’t. That’s because I had asked Valerie for

an opportunity to present to our organization’s leadership team. Prior to

the meeting, she’d informed the head of our banking division and the

CEO that I was taking on this stretch assignment and that she would be

an observer. So, instead of taking over from me when I was facing tough

questions, she let me ﬁgure my own way out of the discomfort. I did

muddle through it, albeit not as well as I would have liked, but in a way

that left me better prepared for my next meeting with him.

I remember Valerie as a good boss because she often gave me

developmental opportunities like these. The stakes were usually low

like that small, internal meeting, where everyone knew I was still green

and would be supportive. Valerie was present but in the background,

allowing me to succeed or stumble but learn from the experience either

way. Afterward, she never gave me long lists of suggestions on how to

improve. Instead, she asked great questions that prompted me to think

about what I could have done diﬀerently.

In theory, most leaders know how important it is to delegate challenging

tasks to employees both to help them grow and create a collaborative,

empowered, productive team. But, faced with real workplace demands,

it can be tough to put this into practice. Many of my clients say things

like “I’m the only one who can do the job” or “If this project doesn’t go

smoothly, the whole team will suﬀer.”

Empathy can get in the way, too. When you see an employee struggling,

it’s only natural to want to step in and help. But from the other side, this

can feel more like micromanagement than support. And when leaders

over-function by keeping too many tasks, they allow their teams to

# under-function.

Here are some strategies you can use to make delegation easier.

# Shift from doer to leader mindset

In my corporate job, we promoted the best doers into leaders. This came

with an assumption that they would magically shift from being good at

and motivated by performance excellence and rewards to excelling at

and caring deeply about developing others’ potential. The mindset shift

may be the hardest part of all. So, how can you facilitate this in yourself?

- Notice your payoﬀ from doing. The thrill of achievement provides a

quick dopamine hit. But that’s something you need to resist to get to

the greater fulﬁllment of having helped others improve.

- Claim your leadership identity by getting clear on values. Ask yourself:

What three words do I want people to use to describe my leadership

style? For example: Do I want to lead with control, urgency, and

## expertise? Or, with patience, curiosity, and empowerment?

- Be intentional about responding, not reacting. In the moments where

you are triggered to step in, ask yourself: Would that be aligned with

my values and who I want to become as a leader?

## Embrace the discomfort of the learning process

Many leaders tell me that, after witnessing an employee falter, taking

back the work felt like the most supportive thing to do. I’ve felt this

tension too. But Valerie taught me the power of holding space for

struggle. Yes, this creates discomfort for both leader and employee

because it’s a new way of working for everyone. However, as Gallup

reminds us, one of the keys to engagement at work is the opportunity for

stimulating challenges. And when you push through the struggle, the

result is growth for all parties.

How can you embrace, rather than resist, the discomfort of learning?

- Name your emotions, which according to psychologist Susan David,

oﬀers clarity and resiliency and can empower you to respond in an

intentional way, aligned with your values.

- Normalize being uncomfortable. Neuroscientists know that these are

the periods in which learning happens and perseverance is developed.

- Reframe the situation. One potential reframe is: “I was allowed to

struggle and that’s where I gained conﬁdence in my skills. So I’m going

to give my employee the same gift of time to solve the problem on their

# own.”

## Distinguish between high- and low-stakes tasks

Leaders often tell me they remain stuck as doers because employees

make too many high-impact mistakes that require intervention. But this

usually happens when the bosses themselves hold on to all the work for

far too long and are then forced to delegate at the wrong moment. The

key is to instead hand oﬀ tasks when the stakes are low and missteps

tolerated, or even expected..

What makes an environment low-stakes? Failure will support learning

more than it would hurt reputation. Mistakes will not impact team

or company success. The environment is safe for stops and do-overs.

The people involved have support and compassion for less experienced

colleagues on learning curves.

To know which tasks are ripe for delegation, consider ones that now feel

easy or rote to you but would be good development opportunities for

those on your team? Also think about work that drains your energy and

doesn’t align with your skills, talents, and strengths but might excite

and feel like a perfect ﬁt for others.

For example, if your employee’s goal is to develop better presentation

skills, try a low-stakes activity like asking them to lead the next staﬀ

meeting before a high-stakes one like conducting a client meeting. Or,

if they want to get better at inﬂuencing others, challenge them to get

buy-in from a small team on using a new tool or work process before

asking them to persuade your whole division to implement it.

# Be curious and facilitative

Early in my corporate career as a trainer, people told me that I was

visibly nervous during sessions I was leading. I explained to my boss

that I was worried about not having answers to participants’ questions.

Her response: “What if your role isn’t to have all the answers but to

facilitate the expertise in the room?” This changed my perspective.

Like trainers, leaders can’t be expected to have all the answers. But they

do need to have patience and curiosity and ask insightful questions to

facilitate learning. For example: What has your current approach been?

Can you apply past experience to this problem? What is this situation

teaching you?

Finally, practice compassion and grace. This doesn’t mean tolerating

poor eﬀort or careless mistakes. Instead, it means oﬀering

understanding and accommodation in the face of someone not doing

something exactly how you would do it.

Valerie’s approach that day with our CEO didn’t feel good at the time.

But had she intervened, I wouldn’t have learned how to respond to

unexpected questions or later reﬂected on how to better prepare for

executive presentations. If she’d followed up with advice, I wouldn’t

have discovered my own authentic ways of improving. To this day,

I credit her with helping me to develop the ability to present calmly

in high-stakes situations. She’s also the reason I have the courage to

delegate to colleagues and team members even if it means watching
