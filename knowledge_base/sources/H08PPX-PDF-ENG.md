The ongoing debate over DEI often frames the practice as either

fundamentally ﬂawed or entirely unnecessary. However, this binary

## perspective oversimpliﬁes a far more complex reality. Research and

practical experience reveal that while some DEI initiatives have

successfully raised awareness of individual biases and systemic barriers,

others have fallen short—and in some cases, even produced unintended

# negative consequences.

At this critical moment, leaders should resist the temptation to abandon

DEI initiatives, as research demonstrates that these initiatives can

be helpful in improving a variety of employee and organizational

outcomes, including access to new markets and innovation. Instead,

leaders can use this opportunity to modernize ineﬀective models.

Rather than getting caught in debates about the legitimacy of DEI, the

focus should be on enhancing its eﬀectiveness for all employees.

In this article, we address three common, ineﬀective, and outdated DEI

models that have sparked organizational resistance, public backlash,

and legislative rollbacks. We also introduce three updated approaches,

based on research and our combined expertise as management scholars

and diversity practitioners. These new models are designed to provide

organizational leaders with clearer guidance, ensuring better alignment

with both the challenges they face and the opportunities they seek to

# capitalize on in the years ahead.

- 1. Instead of measuring progress by headcount, align metrics with organizational values.

While leaders recognize that DEI is a multifaceted issue—encompassing

## equitable representation, access, and treatment—organizations often

reduce this complexity to headcount.

## The overreliance on headcount and other quantitative metrics reﬂects

a broader—and understandable—organizational tendency to seek

objective measures of progress. However, when operational metrics

become the primary focus rather than a tool for insight, organizations

risk losing sight of the deeper, more meaningful changes they seek to

# achieve.

Furthermore, prioritizing headcount as the primary measure of DEI

success can unintentionally limit managerial discretion. Research

indicates that reducing ﬂexibility in hiring and promotion decisions

often leads to pushback and resentment, which can hinder progress

toward meaningful diversity improvements. While well intentioned,

rigid numerical DEI targets can provoke resistance from managers and

weaken their engagement, ultimately undermining progress.

Organizations must strike a balance in how they track and assess

progress. While metrics like market share, stock price growth,

proﬁtability, revenue, cost reduction, and brand equity are crucial for

demonstrating business value to stakeholders, an overemphasis on the

“business case” can reduce DEI to a transactional tool rather than a core

## organizational commitment. Ironically, research shows that explicitly

linking DEI policies to ﬁnancial returns can actually undermine the

sense of belonging among underrepresented employees—precisely the

group many organizations are trying to recruit and retain.

A sustainable DEI strategy seeks to integrate both business and cultural

imperatives, ensuring that DEI is not just linked to short-term ﬁnancial

gains, but embedded in the long-term health and success of the

# organization.

Given that organizations are complex systems with diverse

stakeholders, regulations, and opportunities, there is no one-size-ﬁts-all

metric for capturing DEI goals. To identify the right metric for their

organization, leaders should determine the indicators that best align

with their strategic objectives. For example, in organizations that serve

a demographically diverse population, a success metric might be having

## a leadership team that mirrors those demographics. Organizations

interested in driving innovation and collaboration might integrate

## cultural metrics like psychological safety and inclusion.

DEI metrics must also align with an organization’s core values. For

example, Ben & Jerry’s has identiﬁed “human rights & dignity” and

## “social & economic justice” as fundamental organizational values. Their

leadership has prioritized DEI within the company, using metrics that

reﬂect these values, such as engagement with diverse suppliers, their

impact on the communities they serve, and their eﬀorts to reduce harm

in the regions where they operate.

Organizations should also consider how they deﬁne and value

meritocracy—speciﬁcally, how they recruit, hire, and reward the

most qualiﬁed employees. A balanced scorecard approach to human

resources, integrating both ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial metrics like

DEI, enables leaders to identify advancement opportunities and talent

pipeline bottlenecks. TD Bank, which has been recognized as a

leader in corporate equality and a top workplace for diverse talent,

exempliﬁes this approach through its strategic emphasis on customer,

colleague, and community experience, which is underpinned by their

commitment to creating spaces where employees and community

members feel respected and empowered.

A comprehensive DEI strategy that aligns metrics with company values

helps leaders uncover blind spots in policies, practices, and procedures

that may inadvertently undermine merit-based decision-making. This

alignment ensures that DEI eﬀorts support, rather than conﬂict with,

the organization’s commitment to meritocracy.

- 2. Create personalized learning solutions instead of one-size-fits- all DEI training.

Organizations often neglect the diverse needs of their workforce

and organizational culture when considering training solutions. This

approach overlooks critical factors such as employees’ readiness and

willingness to learn, leadership perceptions, power dynamics, and the

# overall workplace climate.

In the context of DEI training, failing to tailor learning experiences

can lead to environments where employees do not feel psychologically

safe to learn. Worse, it can trigger identity threats—situations where

employees fear conﬁrming negative stereotypes associated with their

social group. For instance, a white male executive might worry about

being perceived as racist, while a young African American emerging

leader might fear being labeled as a victim. DEI training that lacks

sensitivity to these concerns risks reinforcing divisions rather than

fostering learning.

Another signiﬁcant challenge is the siloed nature of learning functions

within organizations. DEI training is particularly prone to being

treated as a peripheral eﬀort rather than a core component that can

drive broader organizational outcomes. This marginalization not only

## undermines the potential impact of DEI initiatives but also signals

to employees that these eﬀorts are less critical to the organization’s

# mission and success.

The path forward requires organizations to adopt more personalized

and eﬀective approaches to diversity training—strategies that focus

on how people engage with and apply what they learn. Research

underscores the importance of moving away from rigid, compliance-

driven training designs to approaches that are adaptive to diﬀerent

learning styles and workplace contexts. Personalized learning paths

that incorporate adaptive content, real-time feedback, and role-speciﬁc

applications can signiﬁcantly enhance engagement and retention.

For adult learners, including C-suite leaders, continuous learning is

essential to reinforce that diversity education is both an organizational

## priority and a practical, relevant endeavor.

Active micro-learning—short, frequent, and customized learning

sessions—aligns with the evolving attention spans of adult learners,

making the content more digestible and impactful. Technology plays a

vital role as well, enabling personalized learning solutions that adjust in

real time based on learner progress and feedback. Such solutions help

ensure that key concepts resonate with diverse learners, facilitating a

## deeper and more sustained learning experience.

Organizations like Mastercard have embraced this model by embedding

DEI learning into leadership development through role-relevant micro-

learning modules. For example, leaders receive personalized feedback

on inclusive behaviors drawn from employee surveys and then

are oﬀered adaptive learning content tailored to address speciﬁc

developmental gaps. By integrating gamiﬁed elements and real-time

interaction, Mastercard has created a scalable learning ecosystem that

is not only engaging but also directly linked to leadership performance

# metrics.

Similarly, Kaiser Permanente has taken a more personalized approach,

customizing training modules based on clinical roles and regional

## patient demographics. Physicians, nurses, and frontline staﬀ each

receive content tailored to their unique responsibilities, such as

addressing implicit bias in clinical decision-making or improving

## cross-cultural communication with diverse patient populations. This

training is further localized to reﬂect the cultural context of the

communities they serve, enhancing relevance and reinforcing the

## connection between inclusion and healthcare quality.

- 3. Craft a purpose-driven narrative instead of using vague catch- all terms.

One of the biggest challenges leaders face is translating an abstract

## vision into clear, actionable communication.

Organizations often use acronyms like SWOT, SMART, and DEI to

distill complex ideas into simple frameworks. While this approach can

enhance clarity, it also has unintended consequences. Grouping distinct

concepts under a single umbrella term can obscure critical diﬀerences,

create confusion, and oversimplify nuanced issues.

This consequence is especially true for DEI. Over time, the acronym

has become politicized, diluted, and even weaponized, often reducing

## it to a corporate buzzword rather than a meaningful, actionable

practice that drives individual, team, and organizational success. While

organizations and researchers continue to debate and reﬁne DEI

terminology, they have yet to establish a universally accepted deﬁnition,

standardized goals, or shared language.

Adding to this challenge, current DEI eﬀorts often overemphasize

diversity, conﬂate equity with equality, and use inclusion as a vague

catch-all rather than a well-deﬁned practice. As a result, DEI often

appears as an abstract statement of values rather than a concrete,

measurable strategy tied to innovation, market growth, talent retention,

# and community impact.

As one leader pointed out to an author of this article: “I ﬁnd that DEI

experts use words that only they understand. For example, they say,

‘DEI is a journey.’ I don’t really know what that means. What is this

journey? What are we trying to achieve?”

Language is not just a byproduct of organizational life—it actively

shapes it. Thus, clarity in language is critical. Rather than using DEI

as a broad, ambiguous concept, leaders should frame diversity, equity,

and inclusion within a clear, operational narrative. By integrating these

## principles into organizational goals and daily practices in a way that

employees can understand and apply, they ensure DEI’s strategic value

is both tangible and actionable.

For instance, instead of simply saying, “Diverse teams perform better,”

leaders should say, “Over the past year, our diverse project teams have

improved customer satisfaction by 15%, reinforcing our commitment to

# inclusive hiring.”

Instead of stating, “We foster a culture of inclusion,” leaders should be

more speciﬁc, saying, “In every leader’s performance review, we include

objectives related to participating in mentorship programs and ensuring

# pay equity within their teams.”

Instead of saying, “We expect all employees to create an environment

where everyone feels like they belong,” leaders should say, “Employees

are expected to contribute and invite diverse perspectives in meetings,

complete annual training on bias mitigation, and speak up if they

## witness exclusionary behavior or microaggressions.”

This type of narrative work can make the eﬀort feel more meaningful

and empower even those who feel ambivalent to engage more

# constructively.

The most widely adopted DEI models to date have often focused

on the wrong metrics, relied on siloed and overly general training,

and failed to clearly communicate how DEI practices are aligned

with speciﬁc operational goals and value. Rather than following the

growing trend of blanket calls to end DEI initiatives—an approach we

believe is misguided—we urge organizational leaders to take bold action

in redeﬁning and reﬁning their DEI models for greater impact and

## alignment with their organization’s objectives.

Like all strategic models, DEI models must evolve over time. The

moment has arrived to challenge outdated approaches and embrace

a more mature, dynamic model of DEI. This means crafting a DEI

model that is tailored to the unique context, needs, and strategy of

the organization. We urge organizational leaders to seize the current

momentum to critically assess their organizations’ needs and how

diversity, equity, and inclusion can be integrated into every core

# function of the organization.
