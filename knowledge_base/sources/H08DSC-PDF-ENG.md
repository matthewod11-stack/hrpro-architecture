C-level technology roles have proliferated over the past few decades.

Chief information oﬃcers ﬁrst appeared in the early 1980s. Next,

chief technology oﬃcers became common in high-tech ﬁrms, and then

spread to other types of businesses. These roles were followed by chief

information security oﬃcers, chief data oﬃcers, chief analytics oﬃcers,

and chief digital oﬃcers. Most recently, chief artiﬁcial intelligence

oﬃcers have appeared. Their numbers have greatly increased with the

## rise of generative AI over the past few years.

While the creation of these roles reﬂects the increasing importance of

## technology in business, such a dizzying array of technology leaders can

also lead to confusion.

A recent study — sponsored by Thoughtworks (where one of us works)

## and the MIT Chief Data Oﬃcer/Information Quality Symposium —

suggests that this is a serious issue. In a survey of 266 technology

and data leaders, more than 4 out of 5 reported confusion in their organizations around the roles of diﬀerent technology-oriented groups

and where to turn for data- and technology-oriented services and issues.

Only 12% reported no confusion.

As more organizations seek to integrate data and AI into their

operations, this confusion may be having a negative impact. People

in leadership roles are often unsure about their own responsibilities

relative to other tech leaders: 30% of the surveyed leaders said they

lacked clarity about how their role relates to other technology and data

leadership roles. And although 78% of respondents reported that data

and technologies are viewed as important or very important by their

organizations, only 10% of respondents said they were very satisﬁed

## with their data foundations and capabilities for analytics and AI. In

comparison, 30% said they were dissatisﬁed.

There are, of course, many challenges preventing success with data goals: people readiness, politics, diﬀusion of responsibility (heavily

related to overlapping organizational structures in some organizations),

## budgets or ﬁnancial constraints, technology readiness, and time — or

just limited patience. Addressing all of these challenges will require

## clear, concerted leadership and a broad mandate for change.

# HBR / Digital Article / Why Companies Should Consolidate Tech Roles in the C-Suite

In this study, however, we discovered that some organizations are

recognizing the downside of C-level proliferation. To tackle the issue,

they’ve begun to consolidate senior technology and data roles; we refer

to them as “SuperTech” leaders, although it’s important to note there is

## variation across organizations in the speciﬁcs of their roles and titles.

These individuals are most likely to be known as chief information

oﬃcers, but they typically have broad responsibility for data and

technology functions. Many also have operational responsibilities

within the business. Leaders of specialty tech and data functions

(data, analytics, AI, cybersecurity) usually report to them. Establishing

SuperTech leadership roles will bring clarity and accountability to

organizations’ digital transformation initiatives. We interviewed several

such leaders for the study and describe some of their backgrounds and

# perspectives below.

# Rise of the SuperTech Leader

What skills should a combined tech leader should have?

Survey participants named overall leadership and senior executive

## relationships (85%) and business strategy and vision (82%) as most

important. Technology strategy and vision (72%) was somewhat

less important. Skills involving managing the employees of the

combined technology function (38%) and technology execution

skills (35%) were viewed as substantially less important. In other

words, SuperTech leaders should be heavily business-oriented, with a

# technical underpinning.

The executives who hold multiple technology roles that we interviewed

for this report reinforced this view. They talk and think as business

people ﬁrst and tech people second in their day-to-day experience of

# these roles.

For example, Shamin Mohammad, who is both chief information and technology oﬃcer at CarMax, told us: “To be eﬀective as a technology

leader, I have to be a business leader. I am working side-by-side with

the CMO, the COO — we are joined at the hip — and then the CFO, the

CEO, and the board. Execution is table stakes. You have to deliver — it’s

not even up for discussion. It is more important for a technology leader

to be a business leader, to understand what’s happening in the industry,

and to envision where the industry is going so you can enable that with

technology and bring the rest of the organization on board.” Topics like

“Keeping the lights on,” renewing technical infrastructure, or dealing

with cybersecurity threats are important, but not his primary focus; his

direct reports ensure they are taken care of.

Sean McCormack, a SuperTech leader at school busing company First

Student, noted, “If you are not a value- and innovation-oriented IT

executive, it won’t work to oversee technology innovation, analytics

and AI, and that sort of activity. If all you’ve done is package

implementations, you will not succeed in a broader role.” Sebastian

## Klapdor, until recently the head of technology, data, and analytics at

marketing services company Vista, said that a strong business value

orientation is key to being asked to lead multiple technology and data-

related functions. When he was head of data and analytics for the

company, he focused heavily on achieving measurable value through

successful data products. He mentioned in an interview that he believes

this was a key factor in his being asked to also assume the CTO role as

# well.

In the survey, respondents minimized “managing down” skills and

technical execution skills, but the SuperTech leaders interviewed

suggested they shouldn’t be discounted. Several mentioned the

importance of hiring strong specialists in each area reporting to

them. Sastry Durvasula, whose title at TIAA is chief information and

client services oﬃcer, leads all technology functions at TIAA, and has

direct reports dealing with data and AI, client services, and shared

services, as well as chief information and technology oﬃcers for TIAA’s diﬀerent business lines. In each area he seeks out people who have the

relevant technology skills, but who also understand how to transform

an organization. He reports to the company’s CEO, and said he still

codes on occasion as well. Klapdor, who worked at Vista, said that

he doesn’t think of himself as highly technical, but he did create a

small Arduino-based device for capturing sensor data from printing

equipment. Understanding the technology helps him lead those who

do it for a living. Both of these leaders have at least some degree of

# technology execution skills.

The broad survey of data and tech leaders suggests that many diﬀerent groups within the organization are involved in overseeing

or coordinating the introduction and use of generative AI. Chief data

## oﬃcers, chief information oﬃcers, chief technology oﬃcers, chief

## digital oﬃcers, and chief AI oﬃcers (in order of their perceived

involvement in generative AI strategy and execution) all play a role.

While this probably indicates that the potential value of the technology

is viewed as high, it may be ineﬃcient or confusing for so many groups

to be involved and to have contention around the leadership roles for

generative AI. This is another argument for consolidation of tech and

# data leadership.

# Dissenters from This Model

Not all technology and data executives believe that an integrated

organization and SuperTech leader is a good idea. In interviews we

heard some objections that were based on individual attributes of

leaders, and some that were more principle-based.

Several data leaders told us that they would not be interested in

reporting to a chief information oﬃcer who is primarily focused on

infrastructure and “keeping the lights on,” as opposed to bringing about substantial business change. Other leaders had diﬀerent concerns with

an integrated role. Scott Hallworth, the chief data and analytics oﬃcer

at Hewlett Packard had been interim co-CIO at HP for much of 2023. His

concerns about a fully integrated role — particularly the combination

of chief digital and chief information oﬃcer roles — is that combining

the roles would eliminate a check on important decisions within a

# company.

Of course, the strengths and weaknesses of organizational structures are

speciﬁc to individual companies and the people who hold roles within

them. It’s possible that a particular structure and leader for technology

and data would work better or worse depending on the organizational

circumstances and the individuals involved.

# Actions for the Future

The most obvious action that organizations can take to address these

issues is to create an integrated technology and data leadership role with an eﬀective, business-oriented executive occupying it. Judging

from our interviews, many organizations have already taken that step

and appear to have been successful with it.

If for some reason that isn’t possible, there are other ways that some of

the issues raised in this study can be addressed. One, for example, is

to create greater role clarity for C-level tech and data leaders and make

the role distinctions known to internal customers. Another is to foster

more collaboration among tech and data leaders, which can lead to joint

projects and higher levels of success in delivering them.

There are a variety of technologies and applications in use within

organizations today, both familiar and emerging. There are times

## when specialists in particular technologies or management issues with

them are needed. However, the trend toward specialized technology

and data leaders has, we feel, gone too far. Greater coordination and

integration is needed, and SuperTech leaders with a strong connection to the business can help make information technology a more eﬀective
