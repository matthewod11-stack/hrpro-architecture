## When former Microsoft U.S. chief technology ofﬁcer Jennifer Byrne

was oﬀered her role, she worried that she didn’t know enough about

technology. After all, Microsoft’s suite of tech products is just so vast.

If even one of the world’s top technologists worries about not having

enough tech knowledge, what hope is there for those of us who have

never written a line of code?

Digital transformation is everywhere — even your local coﬀee shop has

an app. When done right, it brings impressive business outcomes. But

sadly, success is not a likely outcome: According to McKinsey 70% of all

digital transformation initiatives do not reach their goals.

While most leaders now know that tech is a vital part of business,

many are wondering what they really need to know about technology

to succeed in the digital age. Coding bootcamps may appeal to some, but

for many leaders, learning to code is simply not the best investment. It

takes a long time to become a proﬁcient coder, and it still doesn’t give

you a holistic overview of how digital technologies get made — even if

you learn Python, you still won’t understand how product goals relate to

business goals, why user experience research matters, or how to assess

# your product’s success.

The good news is that most leaders don’t need to learn to code.

Instead, they need to learn how to work with people who code. This

means becoming a digital collaborator and learning how to work with

## developers, data scientists, user experience designers, and product

managers — not completely retraining.

## For example, when non-technical, customer-facing teams in the

## planning and development department at Santa Clara County

collaborated with external technology consultants, they created a process to improve eﬃciency by 33%. The software specialists were

experts in their ﬁelds, but only by combining forces with non-

technical professionals could they make useful products.

Most ambitious leaders are working under severe time constraints, so

the time they do have must be used eﬀectively. What’s the best return

on your time investment, given your opportunity costs? The best and most eﬃcient use of a leader’s time is to become a digital collaborator by

learning how to get a holistic view of how a software product gets made

and who does what on a tech team. Here are four ways to do it.

# Remove choice.

The best way to learn anything quickly is to put yourself in a situation

where not doing it isn’t an option.

Set up a weekly meeting with technical specialists and your team to discuss what they’re working on and how it impacts scale, eﬃciency,

and customer satisfaction. This public commitment to collaboration

removes your choice to delay.

Catherine Breslin, a machine learning scientist with a PhD in automatic

speech recognition from the University of Cambridge, told me that,

while she is a technical specialist, she needs the insights of domain

experts to do impactful work. She notes that non-digital professionals

often don’t know that some problems can be solved easily by technology

because they’ve never discussed them with a technologist. This is why

regular communication is vital.

For example, if you work in marketing, understanding consumer

behavior is your top priority. This is where a regular meeting of

the marketing team and data scientists can help both become more

# productive.

This weekly event doesn’t have to be longer than 30 minutes. In the ﬁrst

meeting, begin by outlining your goals for the year and where you see

the biggest bottlenecks. Is there something you wish you knew about

your customers? Are there sales spikes or sudden drops that mystify

you? What concerns you about your next advertising campaign?

While the data science team might not have solutions right away, this

conversation will lay the foundation for eﬀective collaboration. In turn,

ask the technical team to tell you what problems they’re working on,

how they measure success, and who is involved. Seeing how engineers

and data scientists solve problems will educate you on what’s possible

# for you.

Remember that while your team may be concerned that they don’t

“speak tech,” technical teams are often concerned that they don’t

understand the business side. See these meetings as a coming together

of two equal partners sharing knowledge, not one Luddite seeking the

# wisdom of an oracle.

Learn how other people did it.

The myth of coders in a garage creating a billion-dollar company

is persistent. The story of non-technical professionals driving

technological change is not often told, but that doesn’t mean it doesn’t

# exist.

## For example, non-technical founders like Katrina Lake of Stitch Fix

and Brian Chesky of Airbnb have created innovations and massive

shareholder value driven by technology. Colin Beirne, a liberal arts

graduate, has had more impact on deep tech than many computer

scientists, because he helped found Two Sigma Ventures, a deep tech

investor that has funded 100 startups, 10 of which are now valued

at over $1 billion. Bruce Daisley, who started his career selling radio

advertising, had more inﬂuence on social media than most developers

when he helped take Twitter global as its vice president for Europe,

# Middle East, and Africa.

Each of these people had to learn how to collaborate with technology

teams, make the right investments, and lead people who did jobs they

themselves could not do. Learning how they did it — and what they had

to learn about technology on their path — will give you the knowledge

and conﬁdence to apply their lessons to your career.

## However, the current cultural zeitgeist focuses on the story of

engineers-turned-developers, and if you passively consume most

technology-focused media, you’ll mostly hear the stories of the likes of

Mark Zuckerberg, Bill Gates, and Elon Musk. Seeking out the stories of

non-technical professionals who have succeeded in tech is an eﬀort, but

# well worth it.

# Understand different working styles.

## The biggest diﬀerence between how technical and non-technical teams

work is that the former iterates and learns, while the latter focuses on

perfection. This diﬀerence can create tension and misunderstanding if

# not addressed head-on.

One of the core concepts of software development is releasing new

features, seeing how people use them, and then iterating based on

results. Thus, the aim of releasing something new is to test a hypothesis,

rather than to create a perfect end product for a customer. On the

other hand, non-technical teams usually focus on creating a perfect end

product for a customer. This diﬀerence makes sense: Digital products

can be changed quickly when customers already have them, while

traditional products cannot. For example, developers can release a new

feature once an app is already on your phone, but a chocolate bar can’t

become less sweet or more nutty after you buy it.

Thus, traditional products require more planning and forecasting before

release than digital products. Tension often arises when non-technical

teams want to discuss and plan every feature for every possible

outcome, which frustrates technical teams, who want to “move fast and

break things.” Both approaches are right for their own specialty; the key

is not to mix them up.

If you’re working on a digital product for the ﬁrst time, understand that

apps, sites, and algorithms are built using an experimental “build —

measure — learn” cycle. The product team simply cannot tell you what

features are going to be released in a year because they don’t know yet.

This can cause frustration, especially in the ﬁnance department, which

understandably wants to forecast spend and revenues. This is where it

helps to learn from startups. Early-stage technology companies are by

nature experimental, but they have a very clear deadline: the amount of

cash left in the bank. The question they’re answering is: What can we

learn given the amount of funding we have? Given our runway, what

experiments can we do to get closer to our goal?

Thinking in terms of experimentation within a certain budget or time

frame helps bring business realities to the scientiﬁc method used in

# digital innovation.

Learn concepts rather than skills.

While you don’t need to learn to code a product with your bare hands,

you do need to learn core tech terminology. As Jennifer Byrne told

me: “You have to understand the diﬀerence between acquiring digital

context versus digital ﬂuency. Context means seeing the bigger picture

of how things connect together, but not necessarily understanding the

# detail.”

## Concepts such as user-centric design, APIs, and cloud computing

are pervasive, but many non-technical leaders don’t fully understand

them. Taking a course on technology for non-technical professionals or

creating a learning program at your organization is a great way to invest

# in your leadership capital.

## For example, according to Tsedal Neeley and Paul Leonardi, the Digital

## Transformation Factory program at French IT company Atos trained

## both technical and non-technical employees in digital technologies

and artiﬁcial intelligence. Within three years, more than 70,000 Atos

employees completed their digital certiﬁcation and helped contribute to

revenue reaching close to $13 billion.

Neeley and Leonardi argue that most people can become digitally savvy

if they follow the “30% rule” : “You only need about 30% ﬂuency in a

handful of technical topics to develop your digital mindset.” In other

words, that’s the minimum threshold that gives you enough digital

literacy to be an active participant in digital transformation.

When many of today’s leaders graduated from college, the technology

sector simply wasn’t what it is today. The typical jobs that the smartest

graduates considered were in investment banking, consultancy, or

advertising. The world has since changed, and the skills we learned are

no longer enough. Today, Amazon (founded 1994) and Google (1998) are

in the top ﬁve recruiters of MBAs, while they weren’t even in the top 10

in 2002.

To succeed in this new tech-enabled world, learning how to work with

people who make tech products is simply a core leadership skill.

For example, Starbucks is a coﬀee chain. Its core focus is selling

coﬀee and snacks and running coﬀee shops. But its app-based rewards

program represents 53% of the spend in their stores, and AI-based

personalization drives customer loyalty. Thus, understanding how

digital technology works and how to embed it into business strategy

Making the best use of digital technologies is what propels organizations

into the future. To lead successfully in the digital age, leaders have to go

beyond their usual training and learn to become digital collaborators.
