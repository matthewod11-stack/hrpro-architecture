Of all the decisions that a company’s board of directors makes,

choosing the next CEO is arguably the most crucial. A failed CEO

succession can disrupt employees’ work, cause senior talent to jump

ship, damage the company’s reputation, erase enormous value, and

ruin the careers and legacies of the outgoing CEO, the board, and the

designated successor.

According to research by Claudio Fernández-Aráoz and colleagues, the

cost of failed CEO and C-suite successions is close to a trillion dollars

annually among the S&P 1500 alone. On average, companies that have

to ﬁre their CEOs sacriﬁce $1.8 billion each in shareholder value, a 2015

study by PwC found. The handoﬀs from Bob Iger to Bob Chapek and

then back to Iger at Disney and from Jeﬀ Immelt to John Flannery to

Larry Culp at General Electric serve as powerful reminders of the cost of

mishandling successions.

In theory the key parties in the process would be fully aligned on getting

a succession right. In reality there are multiple agendas at play.

The outgoing CEO may be eager to burnish his legacy by promoting

his accomplishments rather than helping his successor achieve hers. Or

he may push to continue his favorite initiatives; for the successor to

retain his top team; to leave on his own terms (and his own timeline)

rather than the board’s; or to play a more signiﬁcant role in choosing his

# replacement.

The board’s agenda is to pick the right CEO for today who also can grow

as the company changes; to be applauded (primarily by investors) for

having made a wise choice; and to establish a power dynamic with the

incoming CEO that ensures the directors’ primacy.

Meanwhile, the designated successor wants to impress the board, the incumbent, and the rest of the senior executive group and aﬃrm that

she was the best choice; to build positive working relationships with

inﬂuential directors; and to lay the groundwork for success after the

# formal handoﬀ.

When powerful players have diverging agendas, tensions can easily

escalate into conﬂict. The result can be a high-stakes and deeply fraught

process that is all about power—who has it, who wants it, and how each

party uses it.

That can be disorienting to the successor, especially if she’s a ﬁrst-

time CEO. She probably has been promoted for performing well

## in straightforward operational or functional roles and consistently

exceeding expectations. Success in the top job, in contrast, requires

acute awareness of political forces, the wise use of power, and skill

at inﬂuencing others. Mastering these requirements is crucial for

incoming CEOs.

We have witnessed these dynamics ﬁrsthand. One of us, Dan, has

seen them as an adviser to CEOs and boards for ﬁve decades and

as a director at companies that changed CEOs. He also experienced

## them as the designated successor to the CEO of a consulting and

software ﬁrm and then, after more than a decade as CEO and chairman,

while orchestrating the search for and handoﬀ to his own successor.

As a former business journalist, Adam has interviewed more than

## 1,000 CEOs, directors, and heads of HR about their key leadership

lessons and covered high-proﬁle corporate successions. Since becoming

a leadership consultant, he has worked with many companies and

individuals that were navigating this complex process.

Our goal in this article is to illuminate and analyze the role of power

and inﬂuence in succession and to oﬀer speciﬁc guidance on how new

leaders can handle the period of overlap with their predecessors. We

will bring these insights to life with two case studies—one involving a

## successful transition and the other a failed one.

# Understand the Complexity

CEO successions generally happen in one of three ways. Strategic

successions take place after a merger or an acquisition, when the CEO of

one of the companies becomes the leader of the combined entity. Forced

successions occur when the incumbent leaves abruptly because of health

or performance problems, and the new CEO takes over immediately.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Power, Influence, and CEO Succession

Planned successions happen when a new leader is hired from the outside

or promoted internally after the board and current CEO have initiated

# the search for a replacement.

In planned successions the outgoing and incoming leaders overlap;

the designated successor will report to the current CEO, often taking on a title such as chief operating oﬃcer, with the expectation that

she will assume the top job after a period that could be as brief as

several weeks or as long as 18 months. That overlap makes the process

complex—especially if it is extended. The key players must learn to

work together, the organization must shift how it operates, and new

reporting relationships must be formed.

At the world’s 2,500 largest companies, planned successions account

for two-thirds of all CEO handoﬀs, according to a 2018 study by PwC,

which is why we focus on them here. Boards prefer them for a number

of reasons. The successor has a chance to learn the full range of

responsibilities before taking over. Directors get to see the successor

in action. The incumbent can coach the successor but remains fully

engaged in case the new leader somehow falters.

A planned succession has two overlapping phases: the transition phase

and the taking-charge phase. The transition phase starts when the board

and the CEO agree that the CEO will eventually step aside, initiating a

search for the company’s next leader. It ends when the incumbent CEO

passes the baton and moves to the board (usually as chair) or leaves the

# company.

The taking-charge phase starts when the board names the successor. But it doesn’t end when the new CEO oﬃcially takes oﬃce; it ends only

once she has earned the loyalty of the organization’s most inﬂuential

people and the full conﬁdence of the board. That often takes longer

than observers realize (see “How CEOs Build Conﬁdence in Their

Leadership” in this issue), but only when both are attained can the

handoﬀ be seen as successful.

Planned successions require diﬃcult balancing acts. The designated

successor must establish legitimacy and push for change and

improvement—without appearing too critical of the current CEO’s

tenure. She must establish relationships with directors while respecting

the fact that she still works for the CEO until he steps down.

Success in the top job requires acute awareness of political forces, the wise use of power, and skill at influencing others. Mastering these requirements is crucial.

The outgoing CEO must show the organization that he’s ready to leave

while dealing with his own emotions about ending this chapter of his

career. He also must prepare the organization for a new leader—by

inﬂuencing those loyal to him to support his successor and perhaps making diﬃcult organizational changes now rather than leaving them

for the new CEO to deal with.

Meanwhile, the board must ensure that the incumbent departs in

the best possible way. The directors must develop a good working

relationship with the successor while setting clear expectations and

standards for her performance. They must agree on big questions about

## the company’s strategy and culture and, in particular, their power

# relative to the CEO’s.

In our experience the actions of the incoming CEO have the biggest

impact on whether the handoﬀ succeeds or fails. After all, she has the

most to gain or lose. If things break down, the board can ﬁnd someone

else while keeping (or bringing back) the incumbent CEO or asking a

director to serve as interim CEO. But for the successor, failure often

means a disrupted career and a damaged reputation. She therefore must

# use power and inﬂuence skillfully.

To be sure, any new CEO, whether she takes over during a strategic

succession, a forced succession, or a planned succession, will need to

ﬁgure out how to inﬂuence others in order to implement her agenda.

With that in mind, here are the key approaches that will improve the

new leader’s chances of success.

# Match Influence Styles to the Moment

Scholars such as Robert Cialdini and Jeﬀrey Pfeﬀer have published

## best-selling studies on the use of inﬂuence and power. However, in

the context of CEO successions, we prefer the inﬂuence framework

developed by Roger Harrison and David Berlew in the 1970s, because

it applies more readily to the dynamics of power and inﬂuence at the

top of large organizations. It describes several approaches useful to the

departing CEO, to the board, and especially to the new leader, each of

which applies to a diﬀerent kind of situation.

The ﬁrst approach, assertive persuasion, involves marshaling facts to

make a cogent, logical argument, such as “A plus B equals C. Therefore,

there’s no other reasonable option but for you to do what I’m asking.

The facts are irrefutable, and the logic is clear.” This style requires

being forceful and credible in expressing opinions about what must be

done and how best to proceed. But it will be more eﬀective if you also

make people recognize how their own interests will be served by the

suggested plans.

Michel de Broin’s sculpture Possibility is inspired by oversize roadside signs and their ability to signal destinations to passing traffic.

The second inﬂuence style is called incentives and disincentives. It’s a

carrot-and-stick way of explaining consequences by saying things like

“Do what I want you to, and I’ll give you something you want. If you

don’t, I’ll take away something you have or withhold something you

desire.” Someone using this style must have the power to deliver or

take away what followers want. This approach is commonly used in

companies facing a burning platform. (“Here are the bad things that

will happen to us if you don’t follow me down this new road.”) It can

also be seen in reward systems that oﬀer bonuses or stock options for

# extraordinary performance.

Assertive persuasion and incentives and disincentives are “push” styles

of inﬂuence. There are also two “pull” styles, which require followers’

commitment. One is called common vision. The leader paints a picture

of a future state that inspires followers, pulling them forward—for

instance, by saying, “Imagine with me for a moment just how great

it would feel if together we could create a place that…” Leaders

skilled in this style can describe their ideal state in vivid detail, are

good communicators, and appeal to followers’ emotions. They project

credibility and are at least somewhat charismatic.

The other pull style is called openness and involvement. It entails

inviting followers to help shape and execute the new plan. Leaders

## who practice it demonstrate humility and a belief in the power of

collaboration. Using active listening skills, they draw out the ideas of

followers and meld them with their own, perhaps by saying, “I’m going

to tell you everything I can about what I think we need to do and why

it’s important. Then I need your help. I can’t do this by myself. Each of

you has diﬀerent abilities, ones I don’t have. Together we can solve this

problem and achieve something really special.”

## During the transition phase, the incoming CEO’s main objective should

be to make others conﬁdent that she is well prepared to take charge.

That requires doing four things.

Learn about the audiences you must inﬂuence and about how best to

convince and persuade them. The new leader must accurately read the

hopes, fears, and goals of her new direct reports and of the executives

who still report to the incumbent CEO. That will enable her to tailor her

approach, choosing which push and pull styles are most likely to win

people over to her ideas and get them behind her objectives. Though the

CEO and the board may press her for conclusions and quick decisions,

she should take time to listen, observe, and ask questions, in hopes of

identifying which style will work best where.

Consider culture and context. The optimal inﬂuence style will depend

partly on the company’s norms and practices as well as on the technical,

ﬁnancial, and strategic forces that aﬀect its performance right now.

For example, engineering and scientiﬁc organizations usually respond

best to assertive persuasion because it’s based on facts and logic.

People at sales-oriented companies tend to respond to incentives and

disincentives and to praise for achieving targets and feedback on

progress toward goals. Companies that are not performing well, are

under stress, and are tired of not succeeding might respond best to

a common vision because it’s a more inspirational approach. If the

strategy and operating model require intense collaboration across the

business, leaders will be more eﬀective if they encourage input, show

appreciation, and are willing to be inﬂuenced themselves—that is, if

they use openness and involvement.

Secure the right allies and minimize the impact of opponents. Any

time a new leader is poised to take over, there will be opposition. Some

people will believe that the path the new leader represents is not best

for the company. If those individuals are important to the company’s

success, then the new leader should gradually and patiently try to

alter their views. Others will resist for self-centered, political reasons.

Perhaps they wanted the CEO position themselves, or the new leader’s

change agenda threatens to erode their power. Successors should deal

with outright resistance ﬁrmly and decisively (using push rather than

pull styles) to send a clear message that the common good is more

important than individual ambitions. But the response should ﬁt the

situation: You want inﬂuential followers to approve of the way the

designated successor responds to honest pushback and the way she

responds when dealing with people who have a political agenda.

Enhance your power by acting in a humble manner. Even once she’s

been publicly identiﬁed as the heir apparent, the designated successor

should tread carefully and never act as if her promotion to CEO

is inevitable. Coming across as too conﬁdent oﬀers ammunition to

opponents and strengthens resistance. She should solicit opinions and

listen so that people feel they’re being heard and understood. Admitting

that they don’t know the answer to a question and acknowledging

mistakes also help humanize leaders and open lines of communication.

New CEOs may not be used to thinking so deliberately about inﬂuence

styles. That’s because even in senior executive roles, success is more

dependent on people’s own behavior than on their ability to inﬂuence

others. But at the CEO level the work is diﬀerent. To succeed, especially

in large, complex organizations, chief executives must focus primarily

on getting others to think and act in ways that will further their

# leadership agenda.

When the existing CEO steps down and the successor formally takes oﬃce, two additional objectives become paramount.

Deepen support from the board. During the transition phase, the new

CEO should have learned what the directors expect of her and how

they and the outgoing CEO view the board’s relative decision-making

authority. After taking the reins, she must ensure that she has the

power to accomplish her goals while the board meets its oversight

responsibilities. That can require intense relationship building, which is

best done by meeting one-on-one with directors, seeking to understand

each director’s priorities, and using the inﬂuence style that is most

likely to persuade each. For a new CEO, learning to gain and use power

in the boardroom is a critical political task, especially when a board is

used to having a lot of input and control.

Clarify and communicate your leadership vision. Once the existing CEO

has moved on, the new leader has more freedom to articulate her own

vision for the company. It shouldn’t be merely a restatement of the

existing mission or a set of general aspirations. The new CEO should

paint a complete picture of what will be seen, heard, and felt once the

ﬁrm’s new future has been realized. She should describe the behavior

## of key people and the organization’s processes at their best. Particularly

in the early days of a new CEO’s tenure, followers will expect her to do

this. Within the ﬁrst year she should communicate her vision often and

in full detail to encourage others, especially the people who are most

important to the strategy, to adopt it as their own. This is an obvious

place to use the common vision style of inﬂuence.

# Cases of Success and Failure

New CEOs who learn to inﬂuence others adeptly are better positioned

for a long and successful tenure. If they ignore or mishandle this aspect

of the role, they’re much more likely to become another data point

about failed CEO handoﬀs. Consider the following two stories, which are

based on the successions of two actual CEOs.

Beth was one of three CEO candidates at her fast-growing company,

which had revenues of almost $40 billion. She was considered a long

shot because she ran an administrative function and had no operational

or international experience. She also was not a self-promoter, believing

that her results would speak for themselves. But 18 months after the

board began the CEO succession process, she won the top job as the

result of a deliberate strategy to prepare herself for it.

During the transition phase, she focused on getting to know

the outgoing CEO better—not to ingratiate herself but to study

his leadership style and thought processes. She invested time in

envisioning the optimal operating model and culture for the ﬁrm and

how best to communicate them. After the board oﬀered her the job,

she continued to hone and demonstrate the skills she’d relied on to

get there: devotion to preparation, the ability to shift from strategic to

operational to cultural perspectives, connecting disparate information

to produce insights, building close ties with frontline performers, and

# ruthless prioritization.

As the designated successor, Beth made wise moves to build her

credibility and support, including persuading the CEO to put her in

charge of a large and vital operating unit. She developed a network of

internal and external advisers and learned how to get the most from

them. She reshaped relationships with the peers who would soon be her

subordinates (including one who’d been the early front-runner for the

CEO role). She built relationships with the most inﬂuential directors

and sought to understand the inner workings of the board without

threatening the CEO. Fast-forward ﬁve years, and Beth has grown the

company at a record pace and was recently elected chair.

Why did Beth’s succession go so smoothly? She made the most of

her opportunity, and the board and the outgoing CEO played their

parts well. The succession process was launched three years before

the transfer of power. (Most boards wait too long to get serious about

succession.) Most directors had been in place during the previous

CEO handoﬀ, so they had the beneﬁt of experience. The incumbent

CEO inﬂuenced the succession process in his role as board chair. The

company also was performing well ﬁnancially—a condition that makes

# any leadership change easier.

Contrast Beth’s story with Jeﬀ’s. At his fast-growing health care

company, the board unanimously considered Jeﬀ the best succession

## candidate, primarily because of his deep operating experience. The

incumbent CEO and the board chair convinced the other directors that

the existing growth strategy was sound and that the next CEO need only

focus on execution. But as Jeﬀ was taking over, warning signs appeared

that revenue and proﬁts would soon decline. He had never been a CEO

before, and in his previous jobs he’d had little interaction with the ﬁrm’s

independent directors. He struggled to understand the board’s points of

view and overestimated his power and room to maneuver.

Stylistically, Jeﬀ was a sharp contrast to the incumbent CEO, who

was charismatic, eﬀective with investors, and a powerful spokesman

for the company. Jeﬀ had a reserved style and tended to emphasize

the practical rather than the possible. He also made mistakes that

hurt his eﬀorts to win the board’s conﬁdence, including criticizing

aspects of the outgoing CEO’s tenure and keeping on an inﬂuential

but controversial direct report the directors believed he should replace.

Most important, he did not invest enough time in understanding the

board’s expectations and concerns.

Compounding this situation, the independent directors played a passive

role in the succession process. They went along with the CEO’s choice

rather than critiquing his process or creating their own. Most of the

directors had never gone through a CEO succession before, and their

inexperience showed. They were faced with limited options because the

CEO had decided against an external search, worrying that it would be a

## sign of failed planning and talent development.

The outgoing CEO decided that the period when he and Jeﬀ overlapped

should be a short one. Seeing a chance to gain power more quickly, Jeﬀ

conveyed to the independent directors that it would be best if the CEO

left even sooner. As their relationship soured, tension increased within

the senior management group. Eventually things calmed down, but Jeﬀ

never overcame the poor start. Then the pandemic hit, overwhelming

the company. Its growth collapsed, and investors became skeptical of

Jeﬀ’s leadership. Because the former CEO was not in his corner to

help with either the board or investors, Jeﬀ was ﬁred before his ﬁrst

# anniversary as CEO.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Power, Influence, and CEO Succession

These two situations were quite diﬀerent, but the same set of

factors enabled Beth to succeed and led to Jeﬀ’s failure: the relative

sophistication and skill with which each handled the pressure of

assuming the top spot and, in particular, winning over key decision-

makers and securing loyal followers. Jeﬀ needlessly created a conﬂict

with his predecessor that forced senior managers and the board to

choose sides. Beth was patient and focused on moving into the CEO

## job with as little stress and tension as possible.

. . .

No succession is easy. Because the process involves people in positions of power, the dynamics are political in nature and therefore diﬃcult

to manage. Planned successions are the most complex because of the

overlap between incoming and outgoing leaders and the reality of

three powerful players, each with their own objectives, inﬂuencing one

# another.

Conventional wisdom holds that the best course of action in CEO

successions is for the key players to deepen their interpersonal

relationships—revealing more about their expectations and objectives,

showing appreciation for one another’s wants and needs, listening with

empathy, making others feel welcome, seeking common ground, and

cooperating. That isn’t enough. The new leader must convince key

people, who have their own agendas and biases, that she is the best

choice for the job and then earn their loyalty and conﬁdence. Great

managers do this by using a broad repertoire of approaches to inﬂuence

and persuade others. The ability to do that is the essence of leadership,

and it is particularly critical for designated CEO successors.
