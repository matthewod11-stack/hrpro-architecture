Have you ever been on the receiving end of vague feedback? Maybe

your manager has said that “you need to be more strategic.” Or perhaps

they’ve mentioned that they want to see you “deepen your knowledge of

the business” or that they wish your direct report was more of a “team

player.” On the one hand, you may appreciate hearing their take, but

on the other hand, you might feel frustrated that their guidance isn’t

actionable or clear. Without speciﬁcs or concrete examples, you’re left

guessing what success looks like and at a loss for exactly what to change.

This happened to Maya, Managing Editor at a media company, who

was trying to parse through her latest performance review. During

the session, her boss had said, “Everything seems to be on track, but

keep pushing for innovation.” On the surface, this sounded somewhat

encouraging, but as someone responsible for shaping coverage and

developing talent, Maya needed more speciﬁcs. Was she driving the

right long-term priorities? Were there unspoken concerns she should be

addressing?

The higher you advance, the more common this kind of ambiguity

becomes. The executives, board members, or clients you report to

are often busy, and the feedback they give tends to focus on softer,

more subjective qualities. Things like “acting as a thought partner,”

“motivating through vision,” and “driving alignment” are often hard

to deﬁne and even harder to measure. In an ideal world, feedback on

these behaviors would be delivered with precision and in a way that’s

immediately useful. But the leaders you work closely with, like all of us,

are imperfect humans operating in imperfect conditions. Your boss may

be overwhelmed, an abstract thinker who struggles getting down to the

nitty-gritty details, or someone who simply never received training.

Nevertheless, you can’t aﬀord to let vague feedback slide, because the

impact doesn’t stop with you. The lack of clarity trickles down to aﬀect

your team’s priorities, slows decision-making, and creates confusion

across the organization. Translating vague input into actionable insight

is a skill. Here’s how to get the direction you need from your manager.

# Ask better questions

When you seek your leader’s perspective, you may naturally ask high-

level questions like “Do you have any feedback?” or “What did you

think?” The intent here is good—you don’t want to steer their thoughts

or appear like you’re ﬁshing for compliments. But broad questions can

unintentionally lead to replies that are all over the board. For example,

you ask your manger, “How did my presentation go?” You’re hoping for

suggestions on your slides, but they start criticizing your posture, and

now you feel self-conscious.

Ask more speciﬁc questions to get more speciﬁc answers. For example,

“What’s one thing I could have done diﬀerently with how I shared the

market analysis?” or “How could I have addressed the CEO’s question

about the budget more accurately?” By narrowing down what you want

to know, you encourage your manager to drill into the areas you care

# about the most.

# Guide them toward your goals

When your manager knows what skill you’re working on and why their

feedback matters, they’re more likely provide a thoughtful response.

You might say, “I’m focused on making my emails more concise. Was

the executive summary succinct?” or “Delegating tasks is my biggest

development area. What changes have you noticed in how I assign

work?”

After Maya’s vague performance review, she emailed her boss,

connecting her quarterly goals to his feedback: “Looping back to

your comment about pushing for innovation. One of my goals this

quarter is to experiment with new story formats, including adding more

multimedia. Could we talk about what you’re seeing work best right

now across the industry or in our analytics?” This subtly signaled that

she took her professional growth seriously and expected meaningful

## guidance, not just lukewarm encouragement.

# Present binaries

When you present your manager with two clear options, it prompts their

brain to compare and contrast them. This type of framing, known as

forced choice, has been shown to speed up decision-making because it

allows the other person to easily react to options laid out before them.

# For instance:

- Would you prefer I handle the negotiations independently or bring you

# in for the ﬁnal decision?

- Is the challenge with this campaign the messaging or the target

# audience?

- Should I spend time mentoring junior team members or taking on

# higher-visibility projects?

This approach works particularly well with big-picture leaders who tend

to think and communicate in broad strokes. Instead of hoping they’ll be

speciﬁc, guide the discussion so you get the feedback or decision you

# need.

# Pay attention to non-verbals

If you’re not getting the direction you need from your boss verbally,

look to their body language and behavior for information. For example,

if you notice their energy visibly drops when you’re explaining how

you handled a disagreement, that might suggest concerns about your

approach—even if they outwardly say it “sounds alright.” Similarly, if

they keep glancing at a speciﬁc section of your report while saying “this

looks good overall,” follow up and probe deeper: “I noticed you spent

more time on the ﬁnance section. Did something stand out to you?”

# Highlight the consequences

Many leaders don’t realize that their communication style isn’t working

for you because it’s their default, not because they’re intentionally

holding back. So explicitly—but diplomatically—state your preferences.

Try, “I learn best from examples. Is there a particular moment where

you saw this issue come up?” or “It helps me most when feedback is tied

to speciﬁc situations rather than general patterns.”

Respectfully explain how a lack of speciﬁc feedback impacts your

work as well. You might point out, “Without details, I might focus my

energy in the wrong areas and waste time we don’t have,” or “Tactical

guidance would help me deliver better quality because I wouldn’t have

to experiment.”

. . .

As you advance, you’re expected to make decisions with less direction

and make sense of the ambiguity around you. More often than

not, the responsibility of getting clarity—whether around priorities,

## expectations, or your and your team’s performance—falls on you. The

better you get at translating feedback from abstract to actionable, the

more eﬀectively you can deliver results.
