Knowledge workers attend an astounding number of meetings, many

of which aren’t a good use of their time. According to recent research

from Microsoft, ineﬃcient meetings are the number one barrier to

productivity, with 68% of employees saying they don’t have enough

uninterrupted focus time during the workday. Further, research shows

that up to one-third of meetings are likely unnecessary. This issue

negatively impacts productivity and engagement, with a cost estimate

# in the hundreds of billions of dollars.

## HBR / Digital Article / Hybrid Work Has Changed Meetings Forever

While meeting ineﬃciency was certainly an issue before the pandemic,

it should be no surprise that the sudden switch to virtual collaboration

exacerbated the problem. However, that switch had a beneﬁcial side eﬀect: virtual meetings produce data. At today’s scale, that data holds

meaningful insights — touching on productivity, engagement, and even

retention — and can be applied in a variety of beneﬁcial ways. For

organizations looking to improve their meeting culture, collaboration

data is a valuable but largely untapped resource.

At Vyopta — a monitoring and analytics platform for enterprise

collaboration — we work directly with companies to help them realize

value from their meeting data. Additionally, using a large dataset, we

routinely analyze global collaboration metrics to establish benchmarks

and identify signiﬁcant trends. This article will cover key insights from a recent analysis and oﬀer examples of how organizations have used

data to improve their meetings.

# What Meetings Look Like Today

For this analysis, we evaluated more than 40 million meetings from

11 organizations, spanning more than 450,000 unique employees

(anonymized for privacy). For comparison purposes, we collected data

in two six-week snapshots from Q1 2022 and Q1 2023, each allowing

for suﬃcient time after the sample to measure retention. The data was

gleaned from remote or hybrid meetings facilitated by online platforms

## such as Microsoft Teams, Cisco Webex, and Zoom. Fully in-person

meetings were not considered. For brevity, we’ll refer to these remote/

# hybrid meetings simply as “meetings.”

Meetings, of course, come in all shapes and sizes with diﬀerent

purposes and behavioral expectations. For instance, the intent of a large quarterly business review diﬀers substantially from a ﬁve-person daily standup, and the data shows clear diﬀerences in participant behavior

and engagement. For such reasons, we grouped meetings into three

# categories:

- 1:1 — Meetings with exactly two participants

- Small Group — 3–15 participants

- Large Group — 16+ participants

On average, each meeting produces close to 400 data points which can eﬀectively quantify many aspects of organizational collaboration,

including an accurate measure of time spent, meeting hygiene issues

(late starts, running over scheduled time), modality (audio-only, video

enabled, reviewing content), and much more.

For this eﬀort, we analyzed the data from the snapshot periods looking

for signiﬁcant patterns, shifts, and correlations. While it should be

noted that this data is novel (pre-pandemic, 77.6% of meetings were

entirely face-to-face) and that we are still in the early stages of

understanding its practical applications, we were able to identify some

## key takeaways, particularly around small group meetings.

Returning to the ofﬁce did not reduce virtual meetings.

Many of the organizations in this analysis implemented substantial

return to oﬃce policies over the past two to three years. We anticipated

a drop in virtual meeting volume, but that wasn’t the case. In 2021,

employees attended an average of 8.3 meetings per week, which jumped

to 10.32 in 2022. 2023 saw a slight reduction to 10.1, mostly driven by

fewer 1:1s (the easiest to replace when fully in-person).

This number staying high represents an important shift in employee

preference. By default, most meeting invites include a virtual link and

participants will often choose to join via video even when others are in

the same oﬃce. Some also prefer virtual meetings because they allow

for recording, transcription, and AI note summaries that aren’t available

otherwise. Other factors are at play as well, but the takeaway is that in-

person collaborative behaviors are unlikely to return to pre-pandemic

# norms.

“No-participation rates” in small group meetings are increasing.

In addition to meeting volume, collaboration data can measure how

frequently the features of virtual meeting platforms are utilized, such

as attendees enabling their cameras, microphones, and recording

capabilities. Among these features, it can measure how many

participants stayed muted for the entirety of a meeting, which we refer

to as the “no-participation rate.” This behavior can be desirable for large

meetings to reduce interruptions and background noise, but for small

groups, it’s often an indication of a meeting that could have been an

# email.

In 2023, this rate was 7.2% for small group meetings, up from 4.8% in

- 2022. It should be noted that these numbers are likely underestimates, as they require the participant to never go oﬀ mute for the entire meeting (if someone brieﬂy says “hi” at the beginning but then goes

on mute for the remainder, that would not be captured).

This metric also oﬀers a unique method for quantifying the time-cost

of meeting ineﬃciency, and its rise further supports the notion that

the cost of unnecessary meetings is increasing. Assuming an average

## employee compensation of $50/hour, and an average employee count

## of approximately 40,000, in 2022 the cost of no-participation meeting

attendance was $10.2 million per organization. In 2023, that number

rose to $19.1 million.

Participants are enabling their cameras less often.

During most meetings, participants can choose whether to enable their

camera to appear on video. Doing so is commonly encouraged, as it

can increase the quality of communication and is often preferred by

management. At the same time, frequent use of front-facing cameras is

also tied to increased fatigue and other negative outcomes. From 2022

to 2023, camera enablement rates fell slightly for each meeting type. In

a similar analysis from 2022 (with certain takeaways published here),

we saw slight increases in this rate over a three-year period. While the

reduction of a couple percentage points isn’t dramatic, it does represent

the ﬁrst downward trend we’ve seen for this metric.

## Camera use, no-participation rates, and retention.

Both camera enablement and no-participation rates show strong

correlations with retention. Employees who would leave their

## organization within one year of the sample period (attrition group)

enabled their cameras in 18.4% of small group meetings, compared to

32.5% for those who stayed (retention group).

Similarly, the attrition group showed considerably higher rates of

no-participation in small group meetings (9.6%) compared with the

# retention group (7.1%).

It’s important to note that these relationships don’t imply causality, and

we would advise against drawing conclusions at an individual level (e.g.,

“Sam rarely turns his camera on, he might quit”). But at suﬃcient scale,

the correlations are too strong to ignore.

While the data doesn’t explain why these relationships exist, recent

research on meeting modality and employee engagement may shed

some light. According to one study, highly engaged employees reported

less fatigue from virtual meetings than those who were disengaged. If the fatigue and negative eﬀects of enabling one’s camera are

disproportionately higher for disengaged employees, and disengaged

employees are at a higher ﬂight risk, it could explain the behavior diﬀerences between the two groups.

With this in mind, some organizations are exploring the value of

monitoring high-level trends in camera enablement as a potential

proxy for general employee engagement. Some are even correlating the

## metrics with internal data from pulse surveys for further validation.

While more research is needed, this approach has the potential of

providing a leading indicator for larger issues that may need attention.

# Using This Data to Improve Meetings

In addition to our analysis, we are also directly engaged with

a small group of companies to deﬁne and implement practical

applications for this data. After several rounds of conversations

with organizational leaders who’ve reviewed the insights from their

company’s collaboration data, as well as the benchmarks and broader

trends mentioned above, we’ve compiled some key takeaways you

might consider applying at your own organization.

## Treat meeting culture as an important part of company culture.

This is especially critical for hybrid and remote teams where a

signiﬁcant portion of interaction is via an online meeting platform.

As with company culture, deﬁne the meeting culture you want —

determine best practices and deﬁne roles and responsibilities. This can also include expectations on when not to meet, such as scheduled focus

# hours and meeting-free days.

Identify the people who can make a difference and support them. Running eﬀective meetings is a skill, and like any skill, it can be

cultivated and strengthened. Fortunately, to make positive changes you

don’t have to boil the ocean. From our analysis, 54% of all meetings

are hosted by just 10% of employees. These “power users” have an

outsized inﬂuence on meeting culture, setting the tone for the majority

of meetings within the company. Once you’ve deﬁned best practices

and areas for improvement, targeted training for this group can allow

beneﬁts to propagate across the board.

Leverage data to validate and iterate.

Once you’ve identiﬁed areas for improvement, leverage collaboration

data to monitor progress and iterate as necessary. For instance, if a

speciﬁc department has a particularly high no-participation rate, you

could monitor how that number changes as you roll out trainings

within the department. McKinsey published a case study of how

Netﬂix implemented similar steps with the goal of improving meeting

eﬃciency. They reduced the number of meetings by a whopping 65%

with over 85% of employees favoring the approach.

# Respect privacy concerns

When discussing collaboration data with organizations, concerns

around privacy are often raised, and rightfully so. You don’t want

employees to be concerned that their boss is monitoring whether

they enabled their camera in each meeting. Such a perception could

increase anxiety and diminish psychological safety, which is critical

for team performance. It’s worth repeating that the steps outlined here

don’t indicate tracking or targeting employees at an individual level,

but using anonymized data to identify actionable trends. When done

correctly, the results are equally popular among upper management

## (gains in eﬃciency and productivity) as well as the employee base

(fewer pointless meetings), as evidenced by the Netﬂix example.

# Provide executive visibility.

Policy decisions, including those around meeting culture, are often

driven at the executive level. For example, one Fortune 500 company

we work with had a stated goal of reducing the time spent in meetings

by 25%, which came directly from their CEO.

We’ve found that providing executive visibility to key markers of

internal collaboration has many beneﬁts. Foremost, as companies still

struggle to ﬁnd the right hybrid work strategies (only 15% of managers

are very comfortable leading hybrid teams), leveraging data from the

hybrid collaboration patterns of your workforce will facilitate more

# informed decision making.

Fortunately, most organizations already have capable business

intelligence (BI) infrastructure to monitor company health and

performance. We strongly recommend integrating collaboration data

as an additional component to your BI suite and choosing a set of

KPIs to include in executive dashboards. These can include the metrics

mentioned above, but there are several others of value across the

leadership spectrum. For instance, aggregate reporting on manager 1:1s

can be used to ensure employees are receiving suﬃcient time with their

bosses across the company. Once the data is available, there are similar

applications oriented toward eﬃciency, engagement, and employee

# experience.

Organizations that have implemented these types of policies have seen

measurable success. One company we worked with created a set of

meeting culture policies for their hybrid workforce. Their intention was

to ensure that each meeting had purpose and necessity — if the purpose

was simply to convey information, it could potentially be replaced

with an asynchronous method. They also wanted to empower their

employees: If they know a certain meeting is not a good use of their

time, it’s OK to decline the invite. If they’re not needed for the rest of the

agenda, it’s ﬁne to drop early. The organization trained frequent hosts

to set the tone and convey this information at the top of meetings and

encouraged the hosts to be more thoughtful about the purpose of each

# meeting.

After initiating the program, the data showed clear improvements.

Meetings got smaller (from an average of 6.7 participants to 6.3), shorter

by several minutes, and camera enablement rates increased by over two

percent. The result was higher quality collaboration, and the eﬃciency

gains saved employees an average of 21 minutes each week.

A theme we frequently heard from organizational leaders was that without intentional eﬀort, meeting culture will gravitate toward ineﬃciency. For those willing to invest that eﬀort, a data-driven

approach is critical for success.
