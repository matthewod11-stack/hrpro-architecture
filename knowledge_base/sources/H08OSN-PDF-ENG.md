When managers are overloaded as many are now, the usual leadership

advice is to delegate more. But what if you’ve delegated everything you

can and you still have too much work? If your team is drowning too,

delegating more work simply means shifting the overload. This is not a

# sustainable option.

## HBR / Digital Article / When You’re Overloaded—and Delegating Isn’t an Option

We have seen this situation many times working with hundreds of

leaders and teams in our consulting and coaching work. Fortunately,

there are three key strategies you can use to reassess and reconﬁgure the

work you do to free up your limited time and capacity.

- 1. Make sure your team really understands what “good enough” looks like

It’s easy to think that every piece of work should be an A+. But if

everything you or your team does is “excellent,” you are overdoing

quality, stressing your team, wasting energy, and slowing down

# progress.

We encourage leaders to work in a “ﬁt-for-purpose way.” That means

intentionally assessing what level of eﬀort makes sense for a given piece

of work. Do you discuss what is “good enough” for speciﬁc assignments

with your team members? Or what corners should be cut?

One example of a client who managed eﬀort and time well was a CEO

one of us (Jordan) coached who understood what was important and

what wasn’t. He told his board that he was going to send weekly email

updates and that these notes would be a “brain dump,” without any

editing. This allowed him to keep his board informed in real time and

## didn’t waste his own critical leadership capacity.

## In a diﬀerent organization with a process-heavy culture, the leadership

team was in the habit of soliciting employee feedback on a lot of

organizational decisions. You might think that employees would love

this high-involvement approach, and occasionally they did. Overall,

however, staﬀ regularly complained that the organization was too

process heavy, and it made their jobs and lives harder, not better. We

coached this CEO and team to use diﬀerent decision-making processes

depending on the importance or risk of the issue, and to streamline

# whenever possible.

Another executive client now asks her direct reports to share quick,

ﬁrst-draft plans with her for work that is not overly complex or risky,

instead of perfect, multi-page documents. She also encourages her team

to send bullet-point emails, when possible, instead of long narratives,

with the understanding that she will follow up if she has questions. The

team is also looking into how they can leverage AI to make work less

# labor intensive.

If you and your team are too busy, it’s essential to take time to ﬁgure out

how to work diﬀerently.

Ask yourself and discuss with your team:

- Where could you do B-quality work, cut corners, or streamline

processes to save yourself time and energy? For example, can

you shorten weekly updates? Can you send bullet points instead of

narratives? Do you really need a full project plan if the situation is

# simple?

- What agreements could you make with your boss to simplify

or reduce deliverables and processes? For example, could you tell

your boss that it would be helpful if you could send simpler or fewer communications? Will a rough draft suﬃce instead of a perfect

document to get the information across? Can a decision-making

process be streamlined?

- How can AI support you and your team in reducing time required

for “good enough” work? Ask your team what apps they are starting

to experiment with and encourage them to do more. For example,

meeting summary apps have gotten really good. First draft writing

apps are also helpful. We brainstormed with colleagues recently

and came up with an impressive list of tools with which to start

experimenting.

When managers and teams step back to assess if there are tasks on

which they can lower the bar strategically, the answer is almost always

yes, and encouraging “good enough” work energizes the team.

- 2. Identify and eliminate hidden low-value tasks

We all know it’s important to eliminate low-value tasks, however, in

working with clients we often see that many low-value tasks have

become unconscious habits, hidden in plain sight. Even teams that have

worked on streamlining stop too soon and miss opportunities. There are

many more hours to be saved if you look deeper.

In our experience, it consistently takes two rounds of “looking” to get people to identify all of the tasks they could oﬄoad or reduce.

Here is a simple oﬄoading process you can use with your team:

- 1. Ask your team, in advance of an oﬄoading session, to think of all the

tasks that could be eliminated. In the actual session they will often

ﬁrst come up with things that other people can stop doing. That’s ﬁne.

It gets them warmed up.

- 2. Then ask them to go deeper and think about what work they

themselves could stop doing if they had one day less per week to

work? This is when we typically see breakthroughs.

Of course, you need to make sure that eliminating work does not

## negatively impact customers, colleagues, or ﬁnance.

One of Frans’s clients leads several nurse teams in a hospital. The nurses

felt overwhelmed with administrative work and had too little time to

look after patients. She asked the nurse teams how their workload could

be reduced without compromising the care patients received. After

some in-depth discussion, they came up with the idea to stop using a

100-question checklist that had to be ﬁlled out for each patient, and

instead, only register irregularities. This led to a reduction of three to

four hours per team member per week and enabled the nurses to spend

# more time on patient care.

A common place to ﬁnd low-value work is in information overﬂow.

Often a lot of information is shared that people don’t read or act upon.

Frans experienced this when he was CEO at a retail company, earlier in

his career. There was far too much reporting and communication, and

all of his leaders complained about it. He and his team decided to stop

all reporting for the next month and then discuss what essentials were

missing. As a result, the team was able to eliminate close to 40% of all

# reporting.

Another usual suspect for low-value work is in administrative tasks,

and long, involved forms or approval processes, as the hospital example

above shows. Organizations with “process-heavy” cultures also tend

to “over-process” everything they do, when many decisions, tasks, or

projects should be handled in a simpler way. Additionally, review and

rework of documents takes up a lot of time unnecessarily when “good

enough” (as above) will get the job done. And of course, there are almost

always meetings that don’t need to happen or could be signiﬁcantly

shortened.

What could you experiment with stopping, changing, or reducing?

Remember, if you eliminate something that does matter, you can always

restore it. We have found that teams are much more comfortable

stopping or simplifying work when they embrace the “two-way door”

decision principle. Assure your team: If we remove or change the way we

do this work and we need to put it back in place, we will.

- 3. Strategically reduce your availability

Many leaders think they should always be available. But too much

availability creates more interactions and makes team members more

dependent on you than necessary or ideal. With a bit more space, your

team members will experience more room to act and this frees up time

# for you too.

One senior partner in the professional services industry that we worked

with consistently found herself overloaded with work because she was

involved in too many projects.

We challenged her on her standard, “all-in” level of participation on

projects and introduced two other possible modes. The ﬁrst was: Be

there at the start, check in one to two times during the project phase,

and attend the closing session of the project. The second option was

to be available as an advisor “on request” for brainstorming ideas or

# solutions.

Shifting her involvement was a big relief for her—and for her team.

She stepped back on several projects and the team felt much more

empowered to lead the work.

Here are some questions to ask yourself:

- What projects or initiatives are you too involved in now? What could

you step out of completely?

- How could you scale back your involvement and still provide

colleagues with what they need?

- Are more asynchronous updates possible?

- Can you attend only the relevant parts of meetings? Or only key

# decision-making meetings?

- Could you try 15-minute catch-ups with direct reports or colleagues

# instead of longer meetings?

Be creative in removing yourself where you can (and helping your

team do the same), and tell colleagues why, so they understand your

# motivation.

. . .

When you are overloaded and delegating more to your team isn’t an

option, there are still ways to free up capacity. Now is the time to

reassess and be intentional about what you do and how you do it.

Working in a ﬁt-for-purpose way that matches appropriate eﬀort with

true need, removing habitual low-value work, and being strategically

unavailable will enable you and your team to free up vital time and

# energy for what matters.
