In today’s climate, large-scale layoffs are in the news often. The

industry being hit the hardest right now is tech, with more than 100,000

roles being cut in 2024 so far, including from large companies like

Microsoft, Intuit, and Dell. With such high-proﬁle companies making

widespread staﬀ cuts, it’s only natural for leaders to wonder if reducing

headcount might be the answer to their business’s woes, too.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Long-Term Costs of Layoffs

Layoﬀs might sound like a shortcut to a more agile, lean, and responsive

operation, but proceed with caution. While they can lead to short-term

ﬁnancial beneﬁts — and even rightsize burn to ensure the continued

economic stability of a company in uncertain economic times — our

research shows just how much of an impact they can have on employee

## engagement, morale, and loyalty, and how long that negative impact

# can last.

# Our Research

To understand the impact of company layoﬀs on employee engagement,

we studied 146 companies that went through layoﬀs between

March 2020 and November 2022. The companies had conducted

employee engagement surveys before and after layoﬀs, giving us an

## understanding of the change in employee experience over time. We

also augmented our data with datasets from layoﬀs.fyi. Here’s what we

learned:

After layoffs, companies see a signiﬁcant drop in employee experience in many key areas.

We found that company conﬁdence dropped 16.9 percentage points.

Belief in career opportunities dropped 12.1 percentage points. And

conﬁdence in leadership dropped 10.5 percentage points.

We conducted further research this year, looking at the experiences

of companies that conducted layoﬀs in 2023 to see if these patterns

were consistent with previous ﬁndings, and we found that layoﬀs are

having an even bigger impact on employee engagement. On average,

engagement declined 2 percentage points more than in the 2020–2022

High employee engagement prior to layoffs won’t protect you from the negative impact of doing layoffs.

In fact, the higher your employee engagement is to start, the more likely

it is to plummet after layoﬀs, and the less committed your employees

will be to staying with the business. The largest declines were from

companies scoring in the top 10% prior to the layoﬀs. However, for some

companies where employees were less engaged and committed to begin

with, a layoﬀ can be perceived as addressing structural and systemic

problems within the organization and can actually boost commitment.

Recovery takes time.

Our 2020–2022 research found it took 12–18 months for engagement to

rebound after layoﬀs. And for 2023 layoﬀs, the recovery is looking even

longer, at 18–24 months, and that’s only if you hire new employees to

# backﬁll essential roles.

For employees who make it through a time of layoﬀs, their commitment

to staying with the company continues to drop over time, and this

sentiment is a strong predictor of actual turnover.

So layoﬀs could actually set your company back a year or more

on engagement and morale, something many businesses can’t aﬀord

## in times of uncertainty and in a highly competitive employment

environment. Oscar-winning Pixar director Brad Bird has a famous

quote that we fully endorse: “If you have low morale, for every $1 you

spend, you get about 25 cents of value. If you have high morale, for every

$1 you spend, you get about $3 of value.” Companies should pay much

# more attention to morale.

To further understand the impact of layoﬀs on engagement and morale,

we asked our advisor and renowned relationship expert Esther Perel to

# weigh in on our ﬁndings:

It’s no coincidence that we see a shift in employee dynamics and a

rise in tension after layoffs. Staff begins to question whether their

company cares about its employees, whether they respect the work

they do, whether employees still have power within the company. Can

you really show up to work with the same enthusiasm when you’re

feeling betrayed and wondering, “Will I be next?”

Perel also noted that building loyalty is almost impossible in an

environment where people feel they could lose their jobs at any

moment: “Many employees come to work looking for a sense of identity,

belonging, and purpose,” she told us. “When companies do round

after round of layoﬀs, it erodes their trust, diminishes their sense

of belonging, and threatens their motivation. It’s hard to continue

embracing work with the same gusto when you’re not sure if your

# employer cares about you as a human.”

# How to Humanize the Layoff Experience

Our data highlights some of the real costs that are incurred by

companies when layoﬀs are required, but it also helped us to identify

what you should be focused on if you do decide to go down that path.

Here are a few quick pointers:

- 1. Be realistic in your expectations and expect engagement and company conﬁdence to take a long-term hit. While you gain short-term ﬁnancial beneﬁts, you need to weigh this

against the challenge of rebuilding engagement and performance.

- 2. Focus on how the change is communicated from the outset.

Companies that are transparent and open fare better. No one wants to

be working in a constant state of uncertainty.

- 3. Don’t try to do more with less.

Recognize that employees are human, and after going through a diﬃcult change it’s unlikely they’ll be able to increase their output.

Instead, ruthlessly prioritize what work can be dropped so that everyone

can focus and rally around the most important things that need to get

done.

- 4. Treat people humanely in the off-boarding process.

While layoﬀs can involve months of planning for HR and business

leaders, the experience of an employee ﬁnding out, reading an email,

and having their system shut oﬀ can happen in a matter of minutes,

creating a literal shock to the system. From a security and risk

perspective, this is common practice. But more organizations are taking

a diﬀerent approach, giving people more time to access systems that

aren’t storing sensitive information, say goodbye to colleagues, process

the news, and get the closure needed to move forward.

- 5. Recognize that relationships outlive employment contracts.

Perel says that people need time to process what’s happening and grieve

for the loss of identity that comes with the loss of a job:

Jobs involve a network of connections and relationships and people

need time to grieve. Sometimes layoffs are unavoidable. Sometimes

they are essential to the survival of the business — and the thriving

of the remaining employees. But even so, companies would do well

to remember that when people leave a job they are also leaving the

colleagues they’ve worked side by side with — virtually or in person —

# for years.

And these employees often linger on. Their digital footprint remains in

## online artifacts such as their name on an internal Slack channel and

alongside tasks in a group project as email bounce-backs, reminding

those left behind of their absence. Some organizations develop alumni

slack groups to allow people to continue to connect after their

# departure.

. . .

Humanizing the layoﬀ experience in these ways can help lessen the

impact and set your business up for a more rapid recovery. But

remember to go into the decision to do layoﬀs with clear eyes: There’s

business, and your rebound is likely to take years rather than months.
