## Despite years of effort and copious amounts of thought leadership

(some of it of questionable value), leaders across industries are still

struggling to ﬁgure out how to create policies that balance their desire

to see employees back in the oﬃce with employees’ undiminished

desire for ﬂexibility. Managers are also struggling to make these

arrangements and policies work and keep their teams engaged in an

## era of unprecedented uncertainty and burnout.

## HBR / Digital Article / Using Data to Design Your Hybrid Work Policies

We’ve seen how fully remote work can lead to a loss of connection

and development opportunities, particularly those that require

observational learning, or learning by watching someone else do it.

However, people still want to work from home at least some of the time

## because of the greater work-life balance and personal productivity that

they experience. But what is the right amount of time to be in person?

How can corporate policymakers and team leaders get the best of both

# worlds?

At Ernst & Young LLP (EY U.S.), we’ve spent the last few years

comprehensively studying our people throughout this period of

profound change. This has enabled us to take a data-driven approach

to questions around hybrid work, grounded in what our own people are

telling us about their experiences. Our data comparing the performance

## and well-being of hybrid employees with their fully in-person and

remote counterparts has yielded (often surprising) insights from which

other organizations may beneﬁt. In addition, we’ve learned a lot about

the critical role that teams and their managers play in successfully

navigating hybrid’s challenges.

# Our Findings

We asked our full-time workforce in the U.S., across all of our lines

of service and at every level of our organization, to tell us about

key dimensions of their work experience, including engagement, well-

being, and perceived opportunities for learning and advancement. We

had over 27,000 responses, which we were able to map to respondents’ diﬀerent ways of working: in person, remote, or hybrid.

Knowing that there likely wouldn’t be a one-size-ﬁts-all solution for all of our teams, particularly given the diﬀerent kinds of work they perform

and clients they serve, we hoped to ﬁnd clues as to the best way to

optimize our teams’ experiences.

## HBR / Digital Article / Using Data to Design Your Hybrid Work Policies

We found that hybrid employees at EY U.S. who spent 40% to 60% of

their time in person experienced higher well-being, belonging, skills

development, and engagement when compared to fully remote or in-

person employees. Here are a few of our most striking ﬁndings:

# Beneﬁts of the in-person part of hybrid

Looking at the trends emerging in our data, we see that our hybrid

employees report a stronger sense of psychological safety to voice

concerns when compared to our fully remote workers. They also tell

us that they beneﬁt from more on-the-job observational learning and

## experience more real-time feedback and more-equitable opportunities.

And while our data did not directly address it, research suggests

that creativity and ideation seem to beneﬁt from in-person energy, to

produce more and higher-quality ideas.

# Beneﬁts of the remote part of hybrid

There is little doubt that the opportunity to work remotely at least

some of the time has a substantial positive impact on well-being and

work-life balance. (In fact, we had a nearly 20% increase in agreement

with the statement “I am able to dedicate time to my health and well-

being needs” among hybrid workers compared to fully in-person.) One

of the more surprising ﬁndings in our research, however, is that hybrid

employees feel more recognized and appreciated than fully in-person

employees. Why would someone who works in the oﬃce less experience

greater trust and feel more valued?

While we are still in the process of collecting data to support our

hypothesis, we believe based on anecdotal feedback that the answer

lies in the culture of care and respect for employees that hybrid work

helps facilitate. Employees know that leaders are eager for them to

return to the oﬃce, so oﬃce policies that allow ﬂexibility despite leader

preferences signal that employee well-being is paramount. It is the

implicit message that employers send when they respect employee

preferences as much as possible that creates such positive perceptions.

# How Leaders Can Make Hybrid Work

At EY U.S., we recognized early on that the only way that we were going

to get hybrid working right was to try to do so at the level of teams,

with each team co-creating expectations and taking into consideration

## the unique preferences and challenges of team members and the needs

of their clients. Team-led models feel autonomous and intrinsically

motivating, as opposed to company-mandated return-to-oﬃce policies

that feel controlling and one-size-ﬁts-all.

We also knew that it wasn’t as easy as telling team leaders to “go have

a conversation with your team” in the hopes that they would ﬁgure it

out. These kinds of conversations can be diﬃcult without a roadmap.

Leaders may make assumptions about what their teams want or what

good solutions look like, and team members — particularly those earlier

in their careers or those belonging to underrepresented groups or

cultures — may feel reluctant to speak up about what’s working and

what isn’t.

To ensure that conversations covered the necessary ground and felt as

comfortable and equitable as possible, we created the Ways of Working

Team Accelerator. It provides a framework for a 60- to 90-minute team

discussion, beginning with a short video highlighting the importance

of well-being and examples of healthier ways of working in ﬁve critical

## domains: Focus, Flexibility, Impact, Development, and Connection.

Next, each team reviews norms or habits that they could adopt in each

domain, with the option to brainstorm their own. They ask, “Is this a

good ﬁt for our team?” and “What are the obstacles that stand in the way

of this working for us?” for each one. Finally, they arrive at a small set to

# commit to together, such as:

- Plan 15-minute breaks (Focus) and at least one 60-minute heads-down

working session each day (Impact)

- No team meetings on Fridays after 2 PM (Flexibility)

- Create open oﬃce hours for team members to drop by and ask

# questions (Development)

- Celebrate team wins and milestones with in-person and virtual fun-

# focused meetings (Connection)

Having teams co-create and commit to speciﬁc ways of hybrid working

has been very successful at EY U.S. Teams that had these accelerator

discussions reported:

- A 27% increase in agreement with the statement “I am comfortable

with the personal and professional demands on my time.”

- A 25% increase in agreement with “I am able to dedicate time to

# support my mental and emotional health.”

- A 37% increase in agreement with “I am able to dedicate time to

# support my physical health.”

If you’re a team leader and your organization doesn’t have a tool or

framework for setting team norms, you can do this on your own. When

leading your team in this collaboration, make sure to cover:

- The work-life challenges that each team member is managing

- Ways you can support each other with these challenges in mind

- When you’ll be in person together and how you’ll make the most of

# that time

- Behaviors that can enable better remote collaboration when you’re

# apart

- A plan to revisit the norms and habits to which you commit at some

point in the future, to see if they’re working for everyone

Figuring out the right ways of working to support our new hybrid model

at EY U.S. hasn’t always been smooth sailing, and we still consider our

approach a work in progress. But that’s the point: Real innovation is

always an experiment that requires an open mind, a commitment to

communication and collaboration, and a lot of ﬁne-tuning. We believe

that it starts by putting your intuitions aside and really understanding

how hybrid work is impacting your people — in practice, not theory.
