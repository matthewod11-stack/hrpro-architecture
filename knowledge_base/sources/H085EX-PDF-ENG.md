## The conventional approach to business transformation — top-down

directives coupled with bottom-up execution — isn’t working. Today,

fewer than one in eight transformations yield lasting results, leaving

seven in eight lacking sustained impact. While the traditional top-down

method may aid in cost-cutting and eﬃciency, it fails to produce

enduring breakthroughs in business performance.

But why? Because sustained performance improvement isn’t solely

about cutting costs; it’s about fundamentally changing how an

organization operates and what it achieves. Identifying these necessary

changes demands insights and experience that aren’t typically found at

the top or bottom of the corporate hierarchy, but rather in the middle.

To elaborate, top-down directives often overlook the subtle nuances

crucial for propelling performance to new heights. Executives in the

C-suite can become detached from the details of day-to-day operations,

leading them to propose solutions that barely scratch the surface.

## Conversely, frontline managers, although well-versed in operational

details, may lack the broader perspective required to spark radical

thinking, often resulting in tweaking current practices rather than

# wholesale changes.

Successful transformations strike a balance — a sweet spot of

experience that identiﬁes areas for improvement without succumbing

to entrenched routines. This equilibrium frequently resides within the

middle layers of an organization. By harnessing the collective wisdom of

middle managers and teams, companies can instigate transformations with enduring eﬀects.

Drawing from our research and experience, we identify three strategies as pivotal to eﬀective middle-out transformation:

Enlist your very best middle managers

Transforming a business demands a blend of creativity and ingenuity

— attributes that only the very best managers possess. Mediocrity won’t

suﬃce; it’s the cream of the crop who can bring the necessary acumen

and experience to spearhead transformative change.

In our article featured in the Harvard Business Review, titled

“Transformations That Work,” we delve into the middle-out strategy

adopted by Bob Bradway and his team at Amgen, a $27 billion

biopharmaceutical company. From the outset of the transformation eﬀort, senior leadership ﬂooded the scene with Amgen’s best talent.

For every initiative, two mid-level leaders were handpicked — a VP-level

## “initiative lead” and a director-level “initiative liaison.” These leaders

were fully committed to the transformation, with no distractions. The

selection process was rigorous, resembling a draft conducted with the

## entire CEO team, overseen by the Chief Transformation Oﬃcer and the

## company’s Chief Human Resources Oﬃcer (CHRO). Eligible executives

had to rank among Amgen’s highest-rated, showcasing their ability to

tackle the company’s most pressing challenges.

Once initiative leads and liaisons were established, teams were

meticulously assembled based on their competencies and expertise.

Leadership underscored the signiﬁcance of assigning the best talent to

each transformation initiative. This approach ensured that the teams

possessed the requisite skills to drive meaningful change swiftly.

The transformation journey at Amgen served as a platform for testing

and nurturing the next generation of leaders within the company. Many

initiative leads and liaisons have since transitioned into senior roles

## at Amgen, a testament to the success of this leadership development

# strategy.

Empower the middle to sponsor transformative changes

## In many large organizations, there’s often discussion of the “frozen

middle,” portraying mid-level managers as lacking inspiration and

motivation in contributing to company progress. However, in our

experience, very few middle managers truly ﬁt this description.

More commonly, the issue stems from a lack of engagement

and empowerment. It’s imperative for senior leadership to actively

encourage middle managers to bring forth innovative ideas, provide

adequate support when these managers propose signiﬁcant changes,

and listen to them when they surface likely sources of resistance.

A prime example of this approach can be seen in the transformation

## of the French multinational biotechnology company, bioMérieux. In

2020, the company’s leadership made a strategic decision to integrate

BioFire, a U.S.-based diagnostics company acquired by bioMérieux in

- 2014. BioFire’s PCR technology played a pivotal role in providing rapid

Covid-19 tests during the pandemic. Pierre Boulud, who would later

be appointed CEO of bioMérieux, was entrusted with overseeing this delayed integration. The successful execution of this eﬀort proved

instrumental in establishing bioMérieux as a global leader in healthcare

# diagnostics.

A critical factor contributing to bioMérieux’s success in merging with

BioFire was leadership’s adeptness in activating middle management.

The company engaged high-potential middle managers from both

BioFire and bioMérieux in the US to spearhead the integration.

Leadership empowered these mid-level managers by clearly deﬁning

priorities for the integration team, providing essential resources, and

deputizing them – thereby granting them the authority and means to

## implement signiﬁcant changes to the business and strategy of both

bioMérieux and BioFire. Furthermore, middle managers at BioFire were

encouraged to collaborate with their peers, leaders, and direct reports to discuss proposed changes openly and oﬀer direct feedback to senior

leadership in Lyon. This inclusive approach facilitated the identiﬁcation of potential areas of resistance, thereby enabling eﬀective mitigation

Today, bioMérieux stands as a uniﬁed company with a singular

purpose: “To make the world a healthier place.” Through pioneering

diagnostic solutions, the company aids clinicians in improving patient

care and assists industries in preventing contamination of food and

pharmaceuticals they produce. Since 2019, the enterprise value of

bioMérieux has surged from less than $8 billion to over $13 billion,

signiﬁcantly surpassing the global healthcare sector.

# Reward bold action and results

Leaders often express a desire for bold thinking but end up rewarding

minor adjustments instead. Successful transformation demands a

fundamental reexamination of every aspect of a business to achieve

breakthrough results. To achieve this, rewards must reinforce this need

# for wholesale change.

Take, for example, the transformation of T-Mobile. Prior to 2013, T-

Mobile struggled to compete with its larger rivals and consistently

ranked last in customer surveys compared to AT&T, Verizon, and

Sprint. Following the failed AT&T acquisition of T-Mobile in 2011, John

Legere assumed the role of CEO. He introduced the radical concept of

“customer focus,” emphasizing the need to understand customer needs and prioritize business processes and oﬀerings accordingly.

Recognizing the importance of the company’s website as a primary

## point of contact with customers, leadership identiﬁed it as a critical

area for improvement. At the time, T-Mobile’s website, much like its

competitors’, was complex and overwhelming, with numerous tabs

leading to irrelevant information. The cross-functional team tasked

with revitalizing the website received ambitious yet intentionally vague

guidance from leadership, encapsulated by the directive to “do what’s

needed to rock the world.” Leadership placed no constraints, trusting

the team to devise the optimal solution.

The team deﬁned three speciﬁc goals: 1) Enable eﬀortless discovery,

## sales, and eService; 2) Be simple and straightforward; and 3) Radically

reconsider the T-Mobile brand. Rather than proposing minor tweaks,

they completely overhauled T-Mobile’s online presence, making it

easier for customers to navigate and do business with the carrier online.

The results were remarkable. User satisfaction with the website soared,

with the proportion of “highly satisﬁed” users jumping from 10% to

50%. The website’s “ease of use” increased from approximately 22% to

57%, and the rating for the “shopping experience”, crucial for driving

sales growth, improved by 50%.

Impressed by the team’s bold thinking and results, leadership acknowledged the IT team’s leadership role in this eﬀort. This initiative

marked a crucial ﬁrst step in realizing Legere’s vision of making T-

Mobile the “Un-carrier.” By setting the ambitious goal of “rocking the

world” and rewarding bold thinking, T-Mobile laid the groundwork for

# its successful transformation.

. . .

It’s time to redeﬁne the approach to transformation. Instead of the

## traditional top-down targets and bottom-up delivery model, leadership

should adopt a middle-out approach. By harnessing the ingenuity and

creativity of an organization’s middle management, companies can

develop the innovative solutions needed to unlock the full potential of

# transformation.
