Marta, the CTO at a sporting goods company, scans her operating

metrics and ﬂinches at the continued “red” status of her team’s

technical capability. The board is concerned that upstart competition

is nibbling away at market share, so Marta is under intense pressure

to help the company move faster to market by implementing more-

sophisticated digital and conversational AI capabilities. But her in-

house talent lacks the deep expertise and experience necessary to

transform the company’s oﬀerings, processes, and data and security

infrastructures, and her recruitment team has been unable to pry away

top professionals from tech ﬁrms, despite making generous oﬀers.

Taking stock, Marta (a composite character we’ve drawn from numerous

interviews) reluctantly acknowledges that she needs to tap the

freelancer market. She recognizes that this is not a stopgap measure

and that a major shift in how work gets done is underway. But she has

qualms. How can she properly prepare her team for the issues this new

blended workforce will unleash?

At almost every company we talk with, managers are facing the same

recruiting challenge. They simply do not have the talent they need

in-house, and they’re unable to persuade highly skilled professionals

to come on board full-time. As a result, companies are embracing the

freelance model more than ever before. “To stay competitive in our

manufacturing, digital, and veterinary services,” says Michele Cefola,

## the global vice president of talent acquisition at Mars, “we must

continually attract people with the latest skill sets.” This is particularly

## true for tech and digital experts, her colleague Jeremy Andrulis, the

vice president of talent, told us. “And people with the most sought-after

skills are more than likely to be freelancers.” He went on to explain

why this works for Mars: “Freelancers tend to jump from one project

to another. That’s essentially what we’re paying for—their accumulated

experiences and the fresh external perspectives they bring.”

## Peter Fasolo, the chief human resources oﬃcer (CHRO) at Johnson &

Johnson, also remarked on the change in worker preferences: “Without

question, there has been a huge shift. Many of the individuals we’re

looking to attract—in technology, data sciences, machine learning,

## blockchain, and the internet of things—have a diﬀerent mindset now.

They want more-ﬂexible working arrangements.”

Talented workers have sought ﬂexible work for some time, but it’s only

recently that the downsides traditionally involved in freelancing have

been addressed. Independent work used to be an unreliable source of

income that was heavily dependent on personal networks, but today

## job-matching platforms—such as Upwork and Fiverr—can instantly

match highly skilled candidates with employers’ needs. Some platforms

are hyperspecialized, such as A.team and People Analytics, which

serve engineers and data scientists. Technology also now provides

administrative and other support to independent workers, whether it’s

virtual fractional accountants, tax apps, or AI for managing email and

# calendars.

J&J’s purpose, values, and credo critically shape how work is done, so the company gives freelancers the same in-depth introduction that it gives to employees.

Today at least 36% of the U.S. workforce has chosen to work as contract,

freelance, temporary, or gig workers, according to an extensive study

conducted by McKinsey in 2022. Upwork’s December 2023 study of

3,000 professionals put the number at 38%, or 64 million workers.

Of these, one-third were earning more than $150,000 a year, and

just over half were providing knowledge services—such as computer

programming, marketing, IT, and business consulting. Signiﬁcantly,

52% of Gen Z workers and 43% of Millennials were freelancers in 2023.

And the shift is catching on globally: Gartner predicts that independent

workers will make up 35% to 40% of the global workforce by 2025.

Integrating and managing what we call the “blended workforce”

will be one of the main managerial challenges in the years ahead.

We’ve recently interviewed executives at leading companies that

are experimenting with how best to bring freelancers into their

organizations. In this article, we’ll lay out some of the most helpful

lessons they’ve learned and what all this bodes for the future of the

# enterprise.

# The Challenges of a Blended Workforce

Let’s return to Marta as she wrestles with her concerns about hiring

freelancers for her digital and AI projects. She and her team have

worked hard to create a culture of inclusion, collaboration, ownership,

and continuous learning. Will skilled freelancers live by these values

and help maintain this culture? A colleague recently told her that a

freelancer at his company took screenshots of an internal CEO video

and posted them online. “It felt like an onlooker eavesdropping on our

family dinner conversation and posting our squabbles,” the colleague

said. And what of skills transfer? How will Marta avoid developing a

## problematic dependence on outside talent over time—and how can she

make sure her own employees’ skills don’t atrophy?

Marta is also concerned about her ability to manage freelancers without

the formal authority over employees that is traditionally invested in

company managers. She recognizes that managing freelance workers

will require a diﬀerent set of skills; they’re specialists, after all, and

she’ll need to evaluate them strictly on project deliverables, rather than

on their contribution to overall performance. She also knows that she

can’t rely on the (often unspoken) leverage of pay increases or enhanced

career opportunities to motivate them and manage their performance.

Finally, Marta wonders if her full-time

team members will stay committed once

they see the autonomy granted to

freelancers, who can more easily decline

will they react, say, to a freelancer calling

arrangements appropriately engaged?

# Emerging Management Practices

Many of the leaders we talked with initially tried to manage freelancers

the same way they’ve long managed other temporary workers: by relying on a contract agency for staﬃng and then maintaining a

transactional relationship with the workers that focused on speciﬁc

deliverables, with minimal investment by the company in developing

an emotional connection with them. But they soon learned that force-

ﬁtting the model they use for temporary staﬀ needs doesn’t work well

for freelancers. That’s not surprising. The role of traditional contractors

is staﬀ augmentation: They add capacity on a temporary basis and

perform outsourced, noncore work as employees of a third party. But

when the purpose is not augmentation but innovation, ﬁrms need a

diﬀerent approach—one that fully integrates expert freelancers into

a highly cohesive team. To that end, forward-looking companies are

starting to develop new practices.

Options abound for how to do this. Johnson & Johnson, for example,

recognizes that its purpose, values, and credo critically shape how

employees interact and how work is done, so the company gives

freelancers the same in-depth introduction that it gives to employees.

## The software giant Salesforce onboards employees and freelancers

together using its Culture in a Box process, which asks workers to

## commit to one another and to their deliverables as a team. Freelancers

receive in-depth training on company values and work processes,

including the disciplined use of project tools to manage workﬂows and

# facilitate communication.

At the M&C Saatchi Group, where one business has been experimenting with staﬃng all nonmanagement positions with freelancers, the

introduction to company culture starts even earlier—at the interview stage. Mark Dickinson-Keen, the company’s chief people oﬃcer, told us,

“The majority of the interview time is spent sharing how our freelance

model works, helping them understand what they can expect from the

business, and checking that they are truly ready to work in this way. It is

# very much a two-way process.”

They follow rigorous practices to retain institutional knowledge. A

common concern with hiring freelancers is that when they leave, they’ll

take the valuable skills and knowledge they’ve accumulated with them.

Companies are handling this in several ways: by engaging in disciplined

project-hygiene practices, using shared project-management tools (such

as Asana, Moovila, or Smartsheet), and assigning full-time employees to

take responsibility for end-to-end critical project deliverables. In some

## highly digitized workplaces, such as at J&J, the internal knowledge-

management systems are facilitated by AI, enabling skills transfer and

## corporate knowledge management without the need for extra process

steps or human eﬀort. “We try to ensure that all the data sits in what

we call the ‘operating room,’” says Fasolo. “It’s a digital workspace where

we can track critical project data in one place. It’s visible to everyone

—employees and freelancers—and managers can observe the ﬂow of

work and intervene to adjust workloads, reprioritize tasks, and solve

bottlenecks in real time.”

Where skills transfer is of lesser concern, companies can adopt

a complementary workforce strategy: In-house employees develop

generalist skills and are augmented on an as-needed basis by highly

specialized freelancers. At Mars, freelancers return periodically to

conduct tune-ups on the products and services they helped develop.

They adopt a “sponsor” mindset to guide freelancers’ performance.

Managers know that it’s critical to provide their employees with

feedback and help them progress in their careers while motivating them

to contribute to company performance. When it comes to freelancers,

though, managers should take a diﬀerent tack, focusing on shaping

challenging work assignments and creating an environment that allows

freelancers to meet their professional goals during their stints with the

## company. Roshni Haywood, the global head of HR at HSBC Digital

Business Services, told us, “A key motivator for skilled freelancers to

join us is the opportunity to work on a major digital transformation at a

legacy bank.”

# A Fragile Equilibrium

As highly skilled freelancers are increasingly integrated into the core of the

workforce, managers will need to understand how their capabilities, needs, and

ambitions complement—and diverge from—those of in-house employees.

At J&J, the role of “sponsor” is formally deﬁned, with a speciﬁc

job description and a training program. The role diﬀers from the

supervisory relationship that a manager has with in-house employees: It

is designed to forge a bond between the freelancer and the company

and is aligned with the local legal and regulatory frameworks for

independent work. Sponsors acknowledge freelancers’ desire to work

autonomously and to gain a range of experiences. “Sponsors ensure

that the freelancers are not only executing their tasks,” Fasolo told us,

“but are also advancing their broader professional development. We ask

our freelancers to share their aspirations, and we support them in their

journey. We believe that if we are their partner in the advancement of

## their professional development, everybody wins.”

They leverage digital workﬂows and build trust to manage changes

in project needs. One dilemma with bringing in freelancers is that

although their work is determined by a ﬁxed contract, a company’s

project needs will inevitably change. Saatchi resolves this issue with

digital workﬂows. Dickinson-Keen describes it this way: “First, we

redesigned the operational processes of how work gets done; then

we rebuilt the workﬂow system to have more of a real-time pulse on

what everyone’s doing. It sounds controlling, but it’s smart workﬂow

management.” This enables Saatchi to have more visibility into how

the workload and hours are distributed. “To digitize workﬂow, we have

to quantify tasks and streamline operational workﬂows,” he adds. “It

requires strong management of time and output daily.”

When freelancers are working on multiple projects at diﬀerent

companies simultaneously, as they often are, it can be tricky for

managers to gauge their availability and bandwidth. Delegation

and traditional control mechanisms are oﬀ-limits for freelancers, so

managers must invest in mutual trust building. Employers need to trust

that their freelancers will tell them if they are occupied with another

signiﬁcant project, and workers should be able to trust that they’ll

be informed in advance if projects are accelerated or put on hold. As

Dickinson-Keen told us, “It’s not about controlling the worker’s time

or choices but understanding and managing expectations. It’s about

keeping commitments and ensuring both parties are aware of the work

availability.”

The focus on well-being is part of a shift away from industrial-era policies and toward more flexibility in time and place of work and better employee benefits.

As more work devolves from ﬁxed jobs into a series of projects,

managers are applying this approach even when working with full-

## time employees. For example, the introduction of internal talent

marketplaces for project gigs enables full-time employees to ﬂuidly

move into roles that tap their skills and experience while still formally

reporting to their people managers. As we wrote in “Managers Can’t Do

## It All” (HBR, March–April 2022), at some companies, especially those

using agile methods, managers no longer “own” the in-house talent

but instead are project managers—scoping and budgeting a project,

determining skills requirements, and contracting with workers for their

# time and energy.

## What Does This Mean for In-House Employees?

The inﬂux of skilled freelancers into the workplace is a phenomenon

in gestation, but at the moment, we’ve arrived at an equilibrium. Both

freelancers and employees have a deal that matches their preferences.

Employees get the stability of a job, relationships at work, a sense of

belonging, the promise of upward mobility, and beneﬁts. For their part,

skilled freelancers can earn six-ﬁgure incomes while working when they wish, without the hassles of a commute, dealing with a diﬃcult boss,

navigating bureaucracy, or taking on less-than-fulﬁlling work.

But this equilibrium is increasingly fragile, with much riding on the

## continued engagement and performance of in-house employees. Those

workers bear the brunt of jumping in when the unexpected happens.

More than ever, employers count on them to keep the business running

smoothly and do the right thing to achieve the outcomes the company

needs. In-house employees are prized as much for their willingness to

show up and pitch in as they are for their skills. (Indeed, already 71%

of employees say that their job description no longer matches the work

they’re actually doing, and 24% say their organizations have begun to

# drop job titles.)

This is happening at a time when employees are demanding more and

tolerating less. A 2023 HP study of 15,600 workers in 12 countries found

that expectations have changed dramatically since the pandemic. In

particular, organizations will need to address unhealthy relationships

at work in order to retain valued employees. For example, 83% of

employees said they would take a pay cut to be happier at work.

According to a 2023 study by the American Psychological Association,

64% of U.S. employees characterize their workplaces as “toxic,” citing

behavior such as disrespectful and noninclusive treatment. This is often

missed in company engagement surveys that focus on aggregate scores

covering a range of topics such as pride in and connection with the

## company and satisfaction with management and employee programs.

In 2022, Microsoft decided to abandon its annual “engagement” survey

when managers realized that it consistently generated very positive

feedback despite reports that employee well-being was suﬀering in

some areas. They decided to dig deeper into areas where people were

clearly struggling. Their more frequent survey measures how much

employees are “thriving,” which they deﬁne as “being energized and

empowered to do meaningful work.”

This focus on well-being is part of a shift away from industrial-era

policies and toward more ﬂexibility in time and place of work and better

employee beneﬁts. Recent examples of such enhancements include

sabbaticals, expanded bereavement and family leave, four-day work

weeks, and paid time oﬀ for volunteerism.

Employees are also demanding that their companies demonstrate

## alignment, in word and in deed, with their personal social and

environmental concerns. Increasingly, they are making career choices

based on those criteria. According to a 2022 IBM survey, more than

two-thirds of employees said they would be more likely to apply for

and accept a job with an organization that they considered to be

environmentally conscious. Nearly half of respondents (48%) also said

they’d be willing to accept a lower salary from an organization that they

perceived as environmentally sustainable. In ways that could not have

been predicted even two decades ago, many companies are now working

hard to show how they are serving a higher purpose.

Looking ahead, we see two key challenges for companies. First, as

newer generations increasingly choose freelance work, they may put

the full-time employment model at risk. Research shows that the

primary downside for freelancers is the lack of employee beneﬁts, but

at 38% of the U.S. workforce, freelancers are capable of exercising their

considerable voting power to push for improvements in social beneﬁts,

among them universal health care as an alternative to the employer-

sponsored model. If companies do not substantially enhance the in-

## house oﬀer in response to such changes, the full-time employment

model may start to crumble.

Second, companies may also be in danger of developing a concentration

of risk-averse individuals in their in-house workforces. A lot of the

employees who choose full-time employment do so because they like

the security of beneﬁts and steady work. That does not bode well for

the quality of the in-house leadership pipeline. Perhaps the Saatchi

experiment of hiring only freelancers for nonmanagerial roles is a

# proﬁt-sharing program.

. . .

Where does all this leave Marta? To start, she makes it a priority

to upskill her current managers so that they can better handle a

blended workforce. She develops a manager playbook and a training

program that ensure that employment laws are observed and that

teams comprising both employees and freelancers are engaged and

working well. She knows this won’t be easy. She acknowledges that

many employees are increasingly reluctant to be available on demand,

and she still has managers who lead through “command and control,”

especially when a project is under stress.

Marta decides to enlist her management team to create an initiative

to address those issues. Working with HR, the team identiﬁes pain

points in the workplace and comes up with ways to keep core

employees motivated, especially now that they are working side by

side with freelancers who have full autonomy, great ﬂexibility, and

higher pay. First steps include improved time-oﬀ policies, a clearer

## ﬂexible-work framework, core collaboration hours, and a more generous

recognition program for in-house employees. The team looks at creative

compensation arrangements to bolster employees’ incentive to deliver

needed business outcomes. Marta also establishes a “give back” day

each quarter at local high schools to strengthen employees’ connection

with the company’s sports and ﬁtness purpose and to nourish their

desire to make a societal impact.

She recognizes that none of her eﬀorts will bear fruit in a toxic work

environment. She decides to publish the results of her department’s

employee-sentiment survey. She adjusts key performance indicators to

hold her managers accountable for the climate in their units and looks

into AI-powered tools to help managers detect patterns indicative of low

psychological safety and to pinpoint and address negative or harmful

# behaviors.

It will take time for Marta—and all of us—to navigate this new terrain.

For now, we’ve entered a period of profound reassessment in which

smart companies must rethink the role and skills of the manager—and

how organizations address the demands of the modern workplace.
