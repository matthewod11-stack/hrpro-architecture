Nathan Green, known to many as Uncle Nearest, was an enslaved man

in the 1850s in Lynchburg, Tennessee. He was known to make whiskey

using a special technique he learned when cleaning water back home in

West Africa. His method of ﬁltering whiskey through sugar maple tree

charcoal became known as the famous “Lincoln method.” It’s still used

# today.

Jasper Daniel, an entrepreneur, saw genius in Nearest Green’s method

and product. When the Civil War ended, Jasper bought a distillery and

named it after himself, subbing in the ﬁrst name Jack. Jack Daniel’s

ﬁrst master distiller was Nathan Green, Uncle Nearest, now a free man,

mentor and close friend to Jack. Green worked at the distillery for many

years until he retired.

Fawn Weaver was so inspired by the story and Nearest’s family (some

of whom she interviewed) that she invested $1 million of her own

money in 2017 to found a distillery in Green’s name. Now, Uncle Nearest

has become fastest-growing whiskey brand in the country. Within the

company’s ﬁrst four years, Weaver raised $60 million. Today, Uncle

Nearest is the bestselling African American-owned and founded spirit

brand of all time. Its three ultra-premium whiskeys have won hundreds

of awards including being named one of the “Top 5 Whiskies in the

# World.”

In the $70 billion wine and spirits industry, where less than 1% of

wineries and distilleries are Black-owned, and there is a lack of BIPOC

leadership, Weaver knew that as a Black woman she would be ﬁghting

an uphill battle from the start. But Weaver was undaunted. She sought

not only to make history as an inclusive brand breaking barriers as

the ﬁrst spirit to commemorate an African American and the ﬁrst to

have a Black master distiller on record, but she also to create a top-

performing organization. Her strategy for making it happen was to

embrace diversity in all forms, including diversity of thought.

# The Tricky Topic of Diversity of Thought

As a researcher and consultant, I’m wary of the term “diversity of

thought.” In principle, it’s good. Having many ideas from many people

who think in many ways will improve performance.

However, the concept is often used as a scapegoat. It’s a way to

avoid diﬃcult DEI conversations around race, gender, gender identity,

sexual orientation, disability and so on. I have heard countless leaders

suggest that since they have diversity of thought on their teams, they

don’t need to be focused on demographic inequity or changes to the

makeup of teams. Even if their leadership teams comprise mostly men,

## mostly white, from mostly from the same colleges and socioeconomic

backgrounds, they use diversity of thought as their excuse not to work

# on those other, necessary DEI tasks.

True DEI progress requires both types of diversity. Diversity of thought

isn’t always found where you expect it to be found.

# Intentionality Is a Virtue

Fawn Weaver was deliberate about bringing diversity — and diversity

of thought — to Uncle Nearest. Some may assume that because her

distillery is owned run a Black woman, DEI is less of a concern

## to Weaver. Not so. Every organization, no matter their demographic

makeup, must be intentional about the equitable nature of their

systemic structures, such as hiring and promotion, in addition having a

strong focus on making the culture diverse, equitable, and inclusive.

It started with hiring a team in an industry with a deep lack of

demographic diversity. One way Weaver could have approached this

was to prioritize hiring minorities to start her company. Yet, she wasn’t

thinking that way. She is adamant that minority-owned businesses that

seek to grow to the highest levels of success must prioritize diversity

in hiring, even when their counterparts do not, and that the notion of

“Black-only excellence,” for example, will ultimately be a disservice to

the business and the communities that will be positively impacted by

# the business.

## “I want to position Uncle Nearest with Jim Beam, Jack Daniels, and

Johnnie Walker, brands that have sustained for 150 years. You cannot do

that by limiting your diversity.”

To be clear, Weaver would seek demographic diversity on her team; she

was not foregoing that part of her DEI journey. She was only saying that

she was not interested in that alone. Diversity of thought, which would

come from multiple types of people, and often unexpected people,

would be what would make Uncle Nearest a brand beyond its diverse

roots, competing with august incumbents.

Her success in cultivating diversity and diversity of thought comes from

largely avoiding four DEI pitfalls many companies fall into.

# Pitfall 1: A lack of cultural clarity.

Companies aren’t clear and deliberate about who they are and what

they stand for. Weaver fosters diversity of thought even before you work

there: Prior to submitting a resume, you must review the company’s 10

core principles, which include clear statements about its devotion to

# diversity.

## Pitfall 2: A lack of intentionality from the start.

Most companies today, even the ones we identify as doing the best

with DEI, are playing catch-up on their diversity demographics. Weaver

set out to create a team that would embody diversity of thought and

reﬂect the world around her. Yes, this would help her create the internal

culture she desired, but equally crucial it would be a team that would be

## a signiﬁcant competitive advantage in the wine and spirits marketplace.

“I’m African American,” Weaver says, “but the ﬁrst two people that I

brought in alongside me were white. I was looking for energy, not color.

And as I’m looking for the energy, and as I’m looking for the diversity of

thought, it was imperative that my company looked like America. Today

if you look at my team it is almost identical to the demographics of

America. We are 50% women. If anything, we try to over-index on Black,

Latinx and LGBTQ populations, but the goal is to mirror America.”

Pitfall 3: Tradeoffs aren’t acknowledged in a DEI strategy.

The reality is that there are less people from underrepresented groups

## in major industries such a ﬁnance and technology (and spirits)

because of systemic structures that have historically limited access and opportunity. To build up a pipeline of diverse talent, tradeoﬀs need to

be built into the strategy.

Leaders must acknowledge these disparities and realize it will take

and time and sacriﬁces to ﬁx it. If an organization is committed to

increasing their diversity of leadership, they may have to keep a position

open longer than expected to identify a diverse slate of candidates.

They may have to recruit outside of their typical top schools. They

may have to reevaluate if the requirements they have always had for

the job (such as a bachelor’s degree) are actually indicators of success.

They may even have to consider nontraditional candidates who have

had career success in other industries or business functions. Leadership

teams must explicitly create opportunities for the DEI strategy to be implemented. This will always require tradeoﬀs.

Weaver is vocal about her willingness to embrace the tradeoﬀs in order

to build the most diverse team: “I would keep a position open for two

years before I put the wrong person in it. I can tell you, if we were,

for instance, to fall to 40% women in team members, I would hold

those positions open for women, because I want their percentages in my

company to match that of America.”

Pitfall 4: A belief that diverse cultures do not need explicit DEI initiatives.

Achieving demographic diversity, as Uncle Nearest has, doesn’t obviate

the need for DEI programs. You need to continue to build that culture

through programming or else the job of DEI falls to the diverse

people within it sharing their lived experiences and navigating diﬃcult

conversations about what it is like to be gay, or Indigenous, or disabled.

It’s unfair to expect them to be the representative for their entire group.

The reality is that while people can share their individual experiences,

most people without speciﬁc education or training are not equipped

to navigate conversations about diﬃcult DEI topics. Thus, even

## organizations with demographic diversity and diversity of thought

beneﬁt from professional DEI education and other initiatives to create

# inclusivity.

“We regularly have diversity training to educate our team on topics

such as the Tulsa massacre and Juneteenth,” Weaver says. “We’ve done

skills building to have everyone walk through their journey together

and identify their own implicit biases. Every time we do training, team

members share that one of their favorite parts of our culture is that we

create space for everyone to learn about these topics together.”

# Using History to Build Better Together

Weaver’s intentional eﬀorts to foster diversity and diversity of thought

have been instrumental to its success. Now, she’s thinking bigger.

In 2020, Weaver had an epiphany: “The piece I think our industry was

missing until now was that we were all trying to ﬁgure out how to foster

diversity within the American spirits industry separately,” she says. So,

Uncle Nearest and Jack Daniels parent company formed the Nearest

& Jack Advancement Initiative to increase diversity in the American

whiskey industry, starting with the Nearest Green School of Distilling

## at Motlow State Community College in Tullahoma, Tennessee, aimed at

helping build a more diverse pipeline of talent for the entire industry.

(Weaver’s also leading other eﬀorts to help develop more diverse talent

# and businesses in the spirits industry).

Weaver stated in a 2020 interview:

You had this interesting friendship and bond that was created during

the most racially divided time in our nation’s history. Now, to bring

the names of those two people together to help solve [problems] now is

the most rewarding thing I have ever done in my life, hands down.

I think the beauty of companies that began in the last few years have

the opportunity to let today’s standard for DEI be the foundation

they’re being built upon. Ten years from now, this conversation looks

very different because we have solid foundations being built right

now and that has never been the case before now.

One eﬀect of her eﬀorts, Weaver has noticed, is how intentional

diversity creates lasting, familial friendships among people with remarkably diﬀerent life experiences.

“I saw a quote recently that said something like, Company culture isn’t

buying a beer keg, it’s creating a culture in which people want to have

a beer together. Our team members go out of their way just to hang

out. We have an annual summit, and it will be like a big giant family

reunion. And it’s not because we’re doing things to make it feel that way.

Literally, just people walking through the doors are going to feel that

way. This company culture is unique, and I’m not confused about what

we’ve built. It’s special.”
