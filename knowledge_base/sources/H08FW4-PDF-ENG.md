Executive teams have been a consuming focus of many CEOs and

those leading parts of large enterprises for good reason. One study of

1,250 executive teams shows a clear correlation between a company’s

## performance (revenue, proﬁtability, and shareholder return) and strong

executive team performance. But only 20% of executive teams in that

study were shown to be high performing.

## HBR / Digital Article / What the Best Leadership Teams Do Right

Top leaders intuitively understand that when their team functions

well, it has a positive ripple eﬀect across the organization. But when

they struggle to work well together, that same ripple eﬀect can create

# company-wide misalignment and confusion.

As it turns out, the factors that allow top teams to have outsized impact

on enterprise performance are the same ones that make its eﬀectiveness

such a challenge. For one thing, they face both external pressures from

competing stakeholders like customers, shareholders, and ﬁnancial

markets while also having to contend with internal competition for

## resources, the limited capital available for too many priorities, and the

## tensions between their massive day jobs and their roles on the executive

team. And because each member is the embodiment of their function (if you’re the chief marketing oﬃcer, you are marketing) as well as a

## face of the enterprise, the team’s visible actions and internal dynamics

become a spectator sport for the rest of the organization. Further, the

fact that the CEO is also the team leader makes the distribution of power

# a zero-sum game.

Given the unique responsibilities of executive teams, it would seem

obvious that they require a specialized set of skills and approaches to be

eﬀective. And yet few have cracked the code on building and sustaining

such eﬀectiveness. Their distinctive forms of dysfunction have been

commonly chronicled — for example, they often avoid conﬂict and have

unhealthy rivalry, bloated membership, and unfocused agendas.

In our experience working with hundreds of executive teams over the

last two decades, we’ve discovered three critical, highly interdependent

roles they must play to have lasting impact on the company’s

performance, culture, and ability to adapt. We’ve observed that

executive teams often perform one or two of these reasonably well but

fall short in integrating all three. The good news is that, with persistent

eﬀort, executive teams willing to put in the work can learn to play all

three of these roles — setting themselves apart from the many willing to

settle for much less.

- 1. They set competitive direction and secure resources.

Like air traﬃc controllers guiding hundreds of aircraft into and out of

a busy airport, the executive team’s role in steering the organization

toward a deﬁned future, mobilizing the needed resources to get

there, and narrowing focus to stay on course is fraught with risk.

It takes discipline to say no to even good opportunities to protect

the investment returns of scarce talent and capital. And it takes

ruthless self-honesty to articulate a competitive positioning that keeps

the organization grounded in reality, focused on sustaining real

## diﬀerentiation versus mere marketing hype.

Where executive teams fall short

But many executive teams lack such courageous self-honesty. Setting

focused, clear direction is often usurped by the executive team turning

into the “Company U.N.”: Instead of enterprise leaders with a shared

agenda, you have “the ambassador from marketing” or “the ambassador

from Asia-Paciﬁc” there to exclusively represent the interests of those

they lead. This turns the executive team into a lobbying platform

where backroom horse-trading replaces sound decision-making and

transparent tradeoﬀs. It often results in overly convoluted strategic

plans that lack actual strategy, overloaded with expensive initiatives

that require more capacity than the organization has and metrics that,

in aggregate, diametrically oppose one another.

What they need to do

In one organization we worked with, the executive team was

contemplating a major acquisition that, on paper, could have added

complementary oﬀerings and markets to their portfolio. There was

tremendous pressure from several members of the team to pursue the

deal. But the CEO, taking a long view, said: “We can’t keep chasing

shiny objects to satisfy our short-term appetite. Does anyone here really

believe we could successfully integrate these products and customers

into our existing portfolio without destabilizing our core?” He knew

they had more fundamental things to work on and refused to allow

them to be distracted by what he called “another magic bullet.”

## In our organization assessment for another client, our interviews

revealed at least six diﬀerent versions of the enterprise’s strategic

priorities. The team was astonished to see just how misaligned they

were, lacking any shared understanding of how the organization could

win in their respective markets. Over the course of our work, we helped

them articulate and validate four competitive diﬀerentiators and ﬁve

competitive capabilities around which they would exclusively prioritize

their capital and talent investments. This dramatically reduced the

clutter on their agenda and concentrated their strategic conversations

on driving growth through the priorities they’d deﬁned together. While

they struggled at ﬁrst with staying within the boundaries they’d set,

eventually they developed the discipline to respect and guard them.

Over the 18 months that followed, their proﬁtability grew by 11%

and their previously stagnant stock price grew by 14%, which was

# exceptional for their industry.

- 2. They shape healthy culture by building relationships and modeling values.

Executive teams must think of themselves not only as “stewards” of

## the enterprise culture and value system, responsible for deﬁning and

reinforcing a particular set of norms — they must be aware that they

embody that culture. Their actions speak louder than their words when

it comes to reinforcing or diminishing a set of cultural norms.

## HBR / Digital Article / What the Best Leadership Teams Do Right

Successful executive teams articulate an operating philosophy aligned

## with their strategy, not a set of pie-in-the-sky platitudes that look nice

## on paper but feel irrelevant to the daily operation of the organization.

They believe that by investing in relationships with each other and

across the enterprise they can further embed a culture that supports

success. That’s because healthy, trusting relationships among the

executive team create broader organizational safety needed to welcome

dissenting voices and diﬀering viewpoints, leading to deeper insights

and shared ownership of decisions. They understand that how they

## handle conﬂict serves as a model for the rest of the organization.

Where executive teams fall short

Sadly, commitment to modeling a healthy culture seems rare. One study

by Gallup found that only 27% of employees believe in their company’s

values and only 23% think they could actually apply them to their jobs.

And McKinsey’s State of the Workplace study found that only 25% of

employees experience their leaders as inspiring them by example to be

# their best.

This suggests that executive teams don’t understand that, in order

to align the organization, they must exemplify cohesion among

themselves. This makes sense considering many executive teams are

constructed around perceived “ﬁxed pie” rewards that tear at the

# foundations of trust.

What they need to do

## Culture-shaping executive teams regularly assess the strength of their

cultures, starting with themselves. They invite feedback about their

individual and collective leadership. Asking “How could I/we have

done that better?” becomes their norm. This ensures they sustain the

competence and commitment needed to embody the values they’ve

declared.

One executive team we worked with, whose organization espoused

“innovation and creativity” as a value, deliberately constructed their

dialogues to include “dueling fact bases” and contrarian views. They

believed conﬂict was the raw material of innovation and wanted

to enable the organization to safely invite contrasting views while

maintaining positive relationships. Their culture’s history of conﬂict

aversion, back-channel gossiping, and collusion would have suﬀocated

any eﬀorts to innovate had they not convincingly introduced new

# behavior.

We also recently worked with an executive team where market shifts,

promotions, and retirements had turned over 60% of the team’s

longstanding leaders. The newly reformulated team was faced with

leading a signiﬁcant transformation of the business to match the rapidly

changing market that had been remade by new entrants. The new team hadn’t had suﬃcient time to develop the trust needed for the enormity

of the task, so we helped them dive deep into their own orientation to

trust: What made them extend or withhold it? How much trust would

they need to build within the organization for the challenges ahead?

Together, they each discovered their inner barriers to trusting others,

were vulnerable enough to acknowledge them, and made commitments

to overcome them. This laid the groundwork for a culture that could

embrace new behaviors because the organization saw their leaders

modeling the way and making a clear connection between the values

they were espousing and the actions needed to be successful in their

# transformation.

- 3. They establish disciplined governance to synchronize performance.

## Finally, with the orchestration skills of a master conductor, executive

teams must set a productive rhythm and pace for the business. Through

a well-constructed system of governance, leaders guide the ﬂow of

information, allocating resources to support the countless requirements

# for coordination across the enterprise.

Simply stated, governance is the act of regularly bringing together

the right roles, aligned against clear priorities, and equipping them

with the right data and authority to make informed decisions and to

hold the organization accountable for execution. Ultimately, well-run

governance aligns the organization, ensuring that all consequential

decisions are consistent with the organization’s stated objectives.

Where executive teams fall short Sadly, too many leadership teams struggle to establish suﬃcient

governance to keep their organizations focused and moving forward.

Despite their best intentions, they get mired in too many priorities,

fail to clarify decision rights, follow undisciplined resource-allocation

processes, and poorly document (then fail to communicate) outcomes.

One of the most common shortfalls is maintaining bloated membership.

This “more is better” trend toward greater inclusion, usually justiﬁed

by the complexities of industry dynamics or wide portfolios, denies the

reality that too many leaders seated at any governance table creates

unwieldy dynamics as the number of relationships to manage increases.

## An executive team of 15, for example, sets in motion more than

100 diﬀerent relationships to be managed. This dilutes the trust that

enables individuals with diﬀering views to debate vigorously but then

support the conclusions they collectively reach. Despite the potential

for governance to become a highly leverageable tool, executive teams

often become the source of its widespread failure.

What they need to do

## For too many companies, this essential aspect of organizational life

feels insuﬀerable, particularly for executives whose calendars are

# consistently double and triple booked.

For one global consumer products client we worked with, our

assessment revealed an unusually intense degree of frustration over

the amount of time consumed by useless meetings, leaving “only

evenings to do our day jobs,” according to one interviewee. The top 500

leaders collectively spent more than 57,000 hours per year in recurring

meetings, the equivalent of six and a half years! The executive team had

unwittingly abandoned their governance responsibilities. Motivated by

the assessment, they eliminated hundreds of unnecessary standing

meetings, redeploying thousands of hours of capacity toward clearly

# deﬁned priorities.

Bringing the roles together

As the ﬁgure below illustrates, the power behind these three roles is

the outcomes they produce in combination with one another. At the

intersection of shaping a healthy culture, setting competitive direction,

and securing resources, organizations experience a greater measure

of cohesion: the broad sense of unity that comes from feeling deeply

connected to those we work with, and the sense that we’re all moving

# together in the same direction.

The combination of setting competitive direction and disciplined

## governance yields the vital but often elusive experience of

organizational clarity. Instead of people feeling confused about where

their authority starts and stops and how it all ladders up to the bigger

picture, people in the organization have the conﬁdence to make choices

they know connect to the organization’s most important priorities.

And lastly, the roles of disciplined governance and shaping healthy

culture produce the organization’s capacity to execute. People feel no

need to see each other as rivals, competing for their own agendas.

Rather, they see each other as allies, all contributing to the performance

results they collectively want. And all three roles produce the fulcrum

everyone knows where they’re going, what part they play in getting

there, and are conﬁdent in and committed to the in the people they’re

going with.

a complex range of capabilities. It’s understandable that so many have

obsessed over how to increase the eﬀectiveness of executive teams —

their disproportionate impact on a company’s performance is immense,

and the frequency of their underperformance disturbing. But if you

want an enterprise that is aligned, cohesive, and can execute, all while

protecting a culture enveloped by trust, this is the price of admission.
