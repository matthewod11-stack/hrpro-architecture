On paper, Sean was doing well. Early on in his career, he had put in an

immense amount of eﬀort into his work and advanced to the level of

ﬁrm partner. Now as one of the top leaders in his organization, he had

more freedom to set his hours and had chosen to use that ﬂexibility for

# his wife and children.

For Sean that meant dropping oﬀ the kids at daycare in the morning,

trying to be done by 4 PM to have time with them before dinner, and

starting work a few hours late one morning a week so that he could

watch them attend their swim class.

But leveraging that ﬂexibility for his family while also striving for excel

in his career meant that he was logging back onto his computer after

everyone else went to sleep and trying to ﬁnish up work at midnight.

Then he set his alarm for 4:30 AM in an attempt to exercise before the

kids woke up. (The workout rarely won out over the snooze button.)

Sean wanted to be an amazing husband and father, and a successful

partner at the ﬁrm, all while not ruining his health in the process

through sleep deprivation and lack of exercise. But even though Sean

spent a lot of time with his family, he rarely felt fully present because he

always felt behind at work.

What did this lead to? Burnout.

Can you relate? Sometimes the blessing of a ﬂexible schedule can turn

into what feels like a curse when you don’t have enough time during

normal work hours to get your job done. You’re left trying to do it all at

odd hours, making you feel maxed out. But not using ﬂex time feels like

a missed opportunity, especially as leaders are often told to model using

the beneﬁts that employees are oﬀered.

So what to do? As a time management coach for over 16 years, I’ve found

that a fully ﬂexible schedule can be a recipe for burnout where you

feel like you’re not measuring up anywhere. It can also lead to feeling

constantly distracted because you’re never quite sure if you’re doing the

right thing at the right time. And it can cause you to feel guilty for taking

time to relax because you always feel like you should be putting in more

# hours somewhere.

But there are ways to be more strategic with your time and make

ﬂexibility work for you. Here are the steps you can take to restore your

work and life and show up fully present in both areas.

# Define What’s Enough

Not having clear, realistic standards for what’s “enough” in the diﬀerent

areas of your life can set you up to feel like a failure.

After we objectively evaluated his schedule and goals, Sean realized that

he needed to modify his perception of what was enough in terms of time

with his family. That meant giving himself permission to work until 5

pm and to skip the morning swim classes, so that he could start work

at 7:30 AM instead of 9:30 AM those mornings. If he traveled and was

away from his family, he did want to use his ﬂexibility to end early on

a Friday. But most days, Sean realized that giving himself more time

to work during the day served him and his family best. Also, between giving himself permission to work more during standard oﬃce hours

and ﬁnding ways for him to be more strategic with that time, Sean

decided that he was not working past 10 pm unless it was an absolute

emergency. This gave him the ability to sleep and consistently get up for

# his early morning workout.

To deﬁne what’s enough in your life, set more standard work hours for

yourself or have a target number of hours that you work per week. Then

determine what the most important personal time investments are for

you, such as dinner with your signiﬁcant other or going to your kids’

games or shows, as well as those commitments you’re OK skipping, like

# standard practices or lessons.

# Clarify Where You Add the Most Value

Tim came to me as an executive, husband, and father of a large, blended

family. He was always feeling guilty—guilty when he was working and

not with his family, and guilty when he was with his family and not

working.

I worked with Tim on deﬁning what was enough in diﬀerent parts of his

schedule, as I did with Sean—but we took it a step further. To actually

compress his work hours to a less ﬂexible timeframe, he needed to

radically clarify where he added the most value. As a senior leader, he

had to ensure that he was producing results for his corporation.

Although he had ﬂexibility with his work hours, Tim found that almost

all of his scheduled workday was spent in back-to-back meetings, which

forced him to work on nights and weekends to get his work done as

an independent contributor. To free up time, we did a meeting audit,

where we took a look at the meetings he was accepting to determine

which were really necessary to attend. After this assessment, he started

to reduce how many meetings he went to by declining them, delegating

them to other team members, emailing his thoughts, or attending

only the decision-making part of the meetings and leaving once the

execution part began.

This allowed Tim to open up hours during the day to focus on strategic

## initiatives, like a roadmap for an organization-wide eﬀort, as well as

meeting with other executive stakeholders to get alignment on that

plan. Tim performed at a higher level and received a promotion by

ensuring that when he did work, he was doing so on the most valuable

use of his time. Best of all—he stopped feeling guilty and had time back

in the evening and on weekends to spend with his family.

As a senior leader, there will always be more tasks that people want you

to do than you can get done. To succeed, decide on where you provide

the highest value in terms of the organization’s goals. Focus on those

areas and then eliminate as many of the activities as possible that fall

# outside that scope.

# Make People Unhappy in the Short Term

When Sarah came to me as a director in an international organization,

she had the ﬂexibility to work from home, to take her kids to school, and

to touch base with friends and family during the day. But that ﬂexibility

made her feel obligated to accept calls with international colleagues late

at night when she really just wanted to spend time relaxing with her

husband after her kids had gone to bed.

Sarah realized that by trying to make everyone happy in the short term

she was making herself really unhappy.

Like Sean and Tim, Sarah started by deﬁning what was enough in terms

of work hours and where she added the most value. Then she realized

that she needed to take another step: Set boundaries. That meant not

touching base with friends and family during the day unless it was

absolutely necessary. It also meant having international colleagues

schedule meetings at a time that worked better for her. If a time did fall

in a less convenient time (and it was non-urgent), she requested those

meetings to be scheduled up to a month in advance.

Sarah no longer gave everyone immediate gratiﬁcation in terms of

having access to her time. But by being less ﬂexible, she showed up

as present, happy, clear-minded, and helpful versus distracted, stressed,

and sometimes even annoyed in her interactions. This beneﬁted those

## around her and massively decreased feelings of burnout.

# Be Really On; Be Really Off

Henry had a very successful career as the senior partner in a 400-

person law ﬁrm and had senior leadership responsibilities in two other

enterprises. He also had a family he cherished with a wife and two

young children. On the surface, he had it all, taking extra time to be with

his wife and children in the morning and being home most nights and

weekends. But he always had one eye on his mobile phone so he could

be available—just in case. Making himself always on call meant that he

never felt fully at rest.

Through our work, Henry realized that he wanted to be more present

at work—fully in that space and not as engaged with personal items in

that time, even when he was working from home. But he also wanted to

be much more present with his family. He made it a rule that when it

was time to be with his wife and kids that he needed to leave his mobile

phone in a basket on silent. He wasn’t allowed to look at it until after his

kids were in bed.

## This shift from full availability and ﬂexibility in communication to

a more deﬁned line of “on” and “oﬀ” helped Henry to feel happier

and more refreshed on a daily and weekly basis. He also gave himself

permission to go on vacation and not check in on work at all, which was

# a ﬁrst for him in years.

If you ﬁnd yourself tethered to your phone or smart watch, create rules about when you can oﬃcially turn oﬀ. It could be that from when

you log oﬀ before dinner until your kids go down to bed that you’re

disconnected with work. Or you have “no email” weekends, where you

don’t check your work inbox and only emergencies can reach you via

text. The exact times and rules can vary, but the important point is that

you create a space where you and the people around you know that they

have your full attention.

As a leader, there will be times when a truly urgent situation calls

for being available to work after hours. There will also be times when

you can and want to ﬂex for your personal priorities. But by being

more strategic and proactive with your schedule, you can increase

your conﬁdence that you’re investing your time in alignment with your

priorities and reduce your probability of burnout.
