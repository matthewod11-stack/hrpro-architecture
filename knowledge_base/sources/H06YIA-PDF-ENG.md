Companies regularly shake up their organization structure, whether

it’s due to a change in strategy, a change in leadership, or for other

reasons. Most of these changes are incremental, while a few are

radical. In our decades-long experience, we’ve observed a leap-and-

hops pattern in which a series of minor adjustments is followed by a

major rearrangement, after which the cycle starts all over again.

Most major rearrangements, or “leaps,” involve a change of proﬁt

and loss (P&L) responsibility in the organization’s primary dimension.

Companies can be organized around product category, region, customer

## segment, distribution channel, business function, asset, program, major

## account, or any other value-driving dimension.

For example, let’s take consumer goods company Procter & Gamble

## (P&G). In July 2019, P&G reorganized around six industry-based sector

## business units (SBUs), each with sales, proﬁt, cash, and value-creation

responsibility for one or more product categories. This leap, which CEO

David Taylor described as “the most signiﬁcant organization change

we’ve made in the last 20 years,” elevated product as the company’s

primary dimension. A few years later, in 2021, the company “hopped”

from six to ﬁve SBUs.

Most companies in a given industry stick to the same primary

dimension. For example, large pharmaceutical companies (e.g., Amgen,

BMS, GSK, Merck, Pﬁzer) tend to have function (research, development,

## supply, commercial) as their primary dimension. Industrial equipment

## companies (e.g., ABB, Atlas Copco, Eaton, Emerson) tend to have

product as primary dimension. Food and beverage companies tend to

seek a balance between region and product, with most giving more

weight to region (e.g., AB InBev, Coca-Cola Company, Danone, Nestlé,

## PepsiCo) and others to product (e.g., Cargill, Mars, Tyson Foods).

Companies don’t change their primary dimension just because their

business strategy changes. Ultimately a company changes its primary

dimension only when it believes that the change will enable it to deliver

value to its customers more eﬀectively. That depends on:

- Creating verticals that sustain expertise through their focus, critical

# mass, and stability

- Clearly delineating the verticals’ responsibilities and assigning

# accountability for performance

- Establishing clear interfaces and minimal friction losses between

# verticals

Executives considering a major rearrangement should ask two key

questions: 1) When has the time come to change our primary

dimension? and 2) Once we have decided to change, how fast should

we go?

To address the ﬁrst question, we’ve identiﬁed three situations where it

makes sense to consider changing the company’s primary dimension:

- 1. When the business model changes

If “the way we make money in this business” changes fundamentally,

a change of primary dimension may be in order. Telecommunications

companies, for example, used to be organized by asset (ﬁxed network,

mobile, internet, IT systems) but changed to customer (e.g., consumer,

## corporate, wholesale) as technological and commercial convergence

overturned their business model. Motion-picture studios traditionally

were organized by channel (movie theater, home entertainment,

broadcast television), but some changed to product (e.g., direct-to-

## consumer entertainment, live sports and news programming, content

production, advertising) as on-demand streaming of bundles of content

changed the name of the game in their industry.

- 2. When the organizational structure is outdated

Young companies often have a ﬂat organization structure that they

keep stretching as their business expands. Each time a new entity (e.g.,

country, product category, customer segment, or asset) is added, its

manager is added to the CEO’s direct reports.

Such a string-of-pearls approach works well — up to the point where the

CEO’s span of control becomes unmanageable and/or opportunities for

collaboration between the large number of entities are left unattended.

For example, a global midstream energy company we worked with had

grown over a period of 15 years from four to more than 20 assets, each

with P&L responsibility and reporting directly to the CEO. At that point,

the company decided to rethink its historically eﬀective organization

# structure.

- 3. When overcompensating for organizational design flaws leads to inefficiency

Any organization design choice involves negotiating concessions —

## for example, between global and local, control and autonomy, or

centralization and decentralization. When leaders make a major design

change, the result is never perfect — it’s typically the least-bad design,

so to speak. Subsequently, they put small add-ons in place after

implementing the new design (the “hops” we mentioned above) to

try and compensate for any imperfections. If they graft too many

corrections upon the design, the organization becomes totally opaque

and unwieldy. At that point, it may be time for a major change,

including of the primary dimension.

Changing an organization’s primary dimension is like a country

deciding to switch from driving on the left side of the road to driving on

the right: You don’t decide it lightly, and you surely cannot implement

it gradually. That brings us to the question of pacing: Once you

have decided to change the primary dimension, how fast should you

# implement it?

# Rupture without disruption

When you make a leap and radically change your organization design,

you intentionally make a clear break with the previous way of doing

things. But much as you want rupture, you want to avoid disruption.

You have to safeguard your company’s ongoing business, which

## depends on the continuity of your people, networks, and processes.

In determining the pace of your change, you want to make a careful but

ﬁrm transition. Consider these four points:

Anticipate the unintended consequences of the change.

Switching an organization’s primary dimension is a profound structural

change, and leaders must anticipate the collateral eﬀects. When

changing the “anatomy” (formal structure) of the organization,

be mindful also of its “physiology” (processes) and “psychology”

(attitudes), to use terms from researchers Christopher Bartlett and Paul

# Beamish.

For example, as part of its reorganization, the previously mentioned

midstream energy company undertook what it called a “recalibration”

of its corporate values. The exercise aimed to bolster employees’

commitment to the company as it remodeled its formal structure.

Through a participatory approach, employees could indicate what they

thought should or should not change in the company’s core beliefs,

# attitudes and behavioral patterns.

# Address your new silos.

Switching an organization’s primary dimension doesn’t make silos

go away — it just creates new ones. Leaders must ensure lateral

coordination between the new verticals, which can be done through

## hard-wiring (such as a formal matrix or coordination function) or soft-

wiring (such as councils, planning processes, or knowledge networks).

Apply a strict comply-or-explain rule.

When changing the organization’s primary dimension, usually a small

CEO-sponsored group designs the new model. The subsequent detail

design phase involves a much broader group of managers to ensure

## proper migration, communication, and buy-in.

During that phase, people regularly plead for adjustments or exceptions

to the target model. The arguments and anecdotes they use may

make sense from a local optimization perspective, but rarely do when

considering the full picture. Therefore, the sponsor should apply a stern

comply-or-explain rule: Any proposed deviation must be explained very

well and can only be accepted after approval by the governance body

that approved the target model.

## Move when in calm seas (as much as possible).

Major structural changes are sometimes foisted onto the organization

when the company is already suﬀering from other ills, such as

leadership strife or strategic vacillation. For example, food company

Danone’s “local-ﬁrst” initiative of 2020 implied a change of the primary

## dimension from product to region, alongside the replacement of the

## CEO and the near-complete renewal of the board of directors. Global

energy company ENGIE switched its primary dimension from product

to region in 2016, only to ﬂip back to product in 2021. Turbulence and

uncertainty are not conducive to a serene discussion about organization

design: They drain energy, lead to fatigue, prevent alignment, and make

people leave at all levels needlessly.

Changing an organization’s primary dimension, i.e., making a diﬀerent

choice of which verticals have full P&L responsibility, is not something

to get into lightly. But don’t do it belatedly either, when your degrees of

freedom and the time to handle it carefully are severely limited.
