Two-plus years into the pandemic, many leaders worry that remote

and hybrid work are undermining their organizations’ culture. Their

concerns aren’t entirely misplaced: A 2022 global study by the research

and advisory ﬁrm Gartner found that just 25% of remote or hybrid

knowledge workers feel connected to their company’s culture. But

forcing employees back to the oﬃce is risky, as CEOs including Elon

Musk and Jamie Dimon have discovered ﬁrsthand. Companies should

take another tack.

“I ﬁnd it ironic when leaders say they need to bring workers back to

the oﬃce because of culture,” says Alexia Cambon, a research director

in Gartner’s HR practice and a principal author of the study. “They’re

going to get the opposite of what they hope for. Instead of viewing

hybrid work as a disruption to the cultural experience, leaders should see it as an opportunity to build culture diﬀerently.”

Culture can be evaluated on the basis of two components, Cambon

explains: alignment (meaning that employees know what the culture

is and believe that it is right for the ﬁrm) and connectedness (they

identify with and care about the culture). A Gartner survey of more

than 4,500 knowledge workers and 200 HR leaders showed that in-

oﬃce mandates drove connectedness sharply down. Among employees

with “radical ﬂexibility” (deﬁned as considerable freedom over location,

schedule, work volume, team, and projects), 53% reported a high degree

of connectedness, whereas just 18% of those with low ﬂexibility did so.

That’s important, the research shows, because more-connected workers

perform at a higher level than others (by as much as 37%) and are

36% more likely to stay with the organization. In another Gartner

survey, half of knowledge workers said they would jump ship if their

company rescinded their Covid-era ﬂexibility. “Some CEOs may think

that workers will grumble a bit but eventually habituate to a full-time

return,” Cambon says. “Without a sense of connectedness, though, they

have nothing to stop them from going to a less-rigid company.”

Before the pandemic, ﬁrms tended to focus their culture-building eﬀorts on alignment, trusting that connectedness would occur more or

less by osmosis. “Leaders hoped that the way oﬃces were designed and

decorated and the frequent interactions among workers would foster

an emotional connection with the organization,” Cambon says. That

approach had limitations even before the pandemic, she adds, and it is

obviously insuﬃcient in a world where employees spend 65% less time

in oﬃces than they did before the pandemic.

The researchers suggest three strategies for driving connectedness

# among hybrid and far-ﬂung workers.

- 1. Shift from diffusing culture through the ofﬁce to diffusing it through

the work itself. Managers often worry that remote workers’ productivity will suﬀer because of interruptions and distractions at home. In fact just

the opposite happens: People often have more time for deep work, and

productivity soars. This points to a valuable opportunity for employers

to instill culture through daily tasks. “When you’re home, you have a

more intimate relationship with work,” Cambon says. “Every time you

engage in a task, you should see the corporate culture reﬂected in it.”

Leaders should start by auditing the ﬁrm’s work processes to make

sure they are compatible with the intended culture, the researchers

suggest. “Say you want your ﬁrm to be innovative, forward-thinking,

and fast-paced,” Cambon says. “If your methodologies are bureaucratic

and your systems have constant technical glitches, that will undermine

# the culture.”

Companies should help employees see that their value comes from

the role they perform, not their physical location. For example, Virgin

Money, a ﬁnancial-services company, identiﬁes its call center workers as

the “voice of the company.” Employees use an app to pinpoint what they

most value in their work and then talk with their managers about how

to adjust their roles to reﬂect those priorities. Companies should also

encourage teams to set the rhythms for how work gets done rather than

# operate under manager-directed norms.

- 2. Connect through emotional proximity, not physical proximity.

The view that in-oﬃce interactions sustain culture confuses physical

proximity with the more important sensation of emotional proximity,

the researchers argue. “Physical proximity is being in the same space

as another individual—being seen,” they write. “Emotional proximity

is being of importance to others—feeling seen.” One survey showed

that emotional proximity increased employees’ connectedness to their

workplace culture by 27%, while physical proximity had no impact.

Because remote and hybrid employees have fewer workplace

interactions, each exchange makes a stronger impact. That heightens

the imperative to identify and remove toxic workers, especially those

in positions of inﬂuence. It also means that companies should refrain

from requiring people to attend meetings unless they’re truly needed.

The more employees feel that their contributions are valuable, the more

connected to the culture they become.

Finally, leaders can create moments of emotional proximity by helping

remote employees see how their work connects to the company

mission. TBS, a pharmaceutical company based in Japan, uses role-

play techniques during virtual onboarding to help people build an

emotional connection to the ﬁrm from the start. New hires are assigned

a medical condition that can be treated by a TBS drug and are asked

to behave as a patient would. Someone assigned a gastrointestinal

disorder, for example, would be pinged frequently for a bathroom break,

thus simulating the inconvenience and discomfort patients endure. New employees also interview patients about how TBS oﬀerings have

improved their quality of life. It’s not about heaping praise on people,

says Cambon. “It’s about ensuring that employees understand the value

of their work to the organization and beyond.”

- 3. Shift from optimizing corporate culture to fostering microcultures.

Multinationals have long faced the challenge of creating a strong

corporate culture while also allowing local microcultures to thrive.

With hybrid work splintering workforces into more-autonomous

cells, all companies must now strike that balance. The research

suggests that leaders should favor somewhat devolved control:

Survey respondents reported that team-level experiences increased

connectedness substantially more than enterprisewide initiatives did.

Royal DSM, a Dutch health and nutrition company, now treats the

culture as a ﬂotilla of independently piloted ships rather than a single

tanker. “The company provides the ﬂotilla with guidance to sail in

the right direction, but it does not prescribe the norms and behaviors

aboard each boat,” the researchers write.

. . .

The pandemic has radically changed how employees experience

corporate culture, and ﬁrms must embrace the new reality. “By relying

less on osmosis to drive connectedness and more on intentionality,” the

researchers write, “leaders will see outsized impact on performance and

intent to stay.”

## About the research: “Culture in a Hybrid World,” by Gartner (white paper).

## “Hybrid Work Balances the Requirements of the Job with Personal Flexibility”

## Over the course of the pandemic, almost all the 6,500 global associates

## of Acushnet—the parent company of golf brands Titleist and FootJoy—were

told not to come in to work, and manufacturing shut down. The decision

to focus on health and safety was easy, says chief people officer Brendan

Reidy. Determining how and when people should return was much harder.

Reidy spoke with HBR about how Acushnet’s strong culture embraces

hybrid work arrangements. Edited excerpts of the conversation follow.

How did you decide when to reopen?

# Shortly after the shutdown, we

experienced a huge uplift in business

as people flocked to outdoor recreation.

The question became: How do we

keep our associates safe while meeting

our customers’ growing needs? Our

manufacturing operations reopened in

# accordance with local and state

guidelines and when we could ensure

a safe work environment. As for our

# Doug Levy

office-based associates, we have always

empowered our leaders around the world

to make decisions in the context of their local businesses. So as things

began to improve, we let them use their own judgment about associates’

returns, as long as they were in accordance with global health and safety

guidelines. We determined at the corporate level that our future was with

# hybrid work.

How do you define “hybrid”?

Our goal is a productive, engaged, and passionate workforce and a

workplace that encourages meaningful collaboration. We’re not designing

things so that associates will bump into each other in the hall; we’re

designing them so that groups come together for specific types of tasks.

You can share a prototype of a shoe remotely, but at a certain point team

members need to hold the shoe and feel the leather and so on. A special

piece of our culture happens when we gather, and we want to continue

that. Some of our associates, particularly in manufacturing and R&D, will be

on-site because their jobs require it. Others will come in every day because

they prefer it or occasionally for meetings or to use office resources. Hybrid

work balances the requirements of the job with personal flexibility.

So full-time office work is not essential to culture?

Every company is different. But hybrid doesn’t mean business as usual

except with only half the associates present. You need to create a new

reality where each in-person interaction is intentional and collaboration can

happen more effectively. That’s more beneficial to building culture than the

old watercooler chats ever were.

Are you concerned that remote workers will shirk?

No. We take pride in the long tenure of most of our associates. We lead with

trust, recognizing that associates’ situations differ.

How do you enculturate new hires if they don’t spend much time in the

# office?

The key is to distinguish between macro- and microcultures. We

consistently communicate our core values, particularly during onboarding.

They’re also reflected in our performance management systems. But we

lean on managers to guide new hires and orient them to team norms; we’ve

implemented new training to build their capabilities in that area. In a hybrid

world, associates have fewer but deeper interactions. Their relationship

with their manager is even more important now.

What lessons can you share?

Really listen to associates. Ask whether they have the tools and support

they need to succeed. Is information being shared? Are new technologies

working? It is easy for problems to go undiscovered in a hybrid world. You

have to pay close attention and include associates in creating ways to best

navigate the new work arrangement.
