As summer winds down and many of our coaching clients and research

participants are returning from vacation, we’re seeing increased levels

of return-to-work anxiety. As one client, “Leslie,” put it:

Coming back from vacation almost makes [it] seem not worth it. For

me, it’s like psychologically accelerating from a cruising pace of 30

mph to a speed of 80 so I can get through my inbox, catch up on all

the meetings I missed, and reconnect with my neglected clients. And

that’s on top of the guilt I’ve been feeling about overburdening my

team while they’ve been covering for me.

It’s easy to respond to these intense feelings like Leslie did, by throwing

yourself into overworking, overcompensating, and overachieving the

minute you disable your out of oﬃce responder — especially in work cultures that don’t exactly encourage time oﬀ in the ﬁrst place.

However, there’s a healthier, more balanced approach that can help you

ease back into your routine without losing all the stress-reducing and

performance-enhancing beneﬁts of unplugging from work.

# Time Off Is Essential

First, let’s be clear that taking periodic breaks in order to reset and

recover from work stress (what researchers refer to as work recovery)

isn’t a “nice to have” — it’s essential for sustained performance and

growth. Just as athletes engage in regular periods of rest and recovery

in order to perform at their best and avoid injury, workers need periods

of time away from their jobs to recuperate from the strain of work and

replenish their physical and mental energy.

Research shows that those who don’t take the opportunity to rest,

recharge, and recover are at higher risk of exhaustion, low motivation,

poor performance, and burnout, while those who engage in regular

periods of work recovery enjoy better sleep, higher job satisfaction,

more engagement, and higher job performance. Human bodies and

brains simply aren’t built to endure chronic stress, and there’s plenty

of evidence showing how disconnecting from the strains and demands

of work not only lowers stress, but increases productivity and boosts

creativity. Even micro-breaks taken throughout the workday, such as

stretching, doing some deep breathing exercises, or stepping outside for

some fresh air, can halt the stress cycle and return you to baseline.

Despite the clear beneﬁts of time away, however, nearly half of American workers don’t take all the paid time oﬀ their employer oﬀers.

Chief among their reasons are worries that they’ll fall behind, or that time oﬀ will hurt their chances for advancement or even increase their

risk of losing their job, as well as guilt over coworkers having to take on

# additional work.

These are sentiments we hear often, including from our senior executive

clients, who frequently express a fear of losing momentum if they step

away. Part of our role as executive coaches is empowering clients to

## invest in themselves and their performance with the practice of regular

# work recovery.

## Resisting the Urge to Overwork After Time Off

Post-vacation, it can be tempting to double down on work in an attempt

to make up for “lost” time, or to try to hurry through the time it takes

to get back up to speed. Other times, the urge to overwork stems from a well-meaning eﬀort to relieve team members of the extra work they

were covering for you, or a desire to demonstrate that even though you

were away, your commitment remains high and you’re still valuable to

# the organization.

Whatever the motivation behind post-vacation overwork, it can leave

you boomeranging from one extreme to the other, which increases stress and actually undermines your eﬀorts to catch up. So how can

you retain all the beneﬁts of work recovery and resist jumping right

back into the grind? Here are some strategies that have worked for our

# research participants and clients:

# Shift to a performance mindset.

High performance and suﬃcient recovery were never meant to function

separately, yet in the corporate world, performance tends to be

overemphasized while recovery is overlooked. Rather than treating time

away as a last resort only after you’re depleted and unproductive, or as

a special reward when your to-do list is ﬁnally done, take a cue from top

athletes and include work recovery as an essential component of a high-

performance strategy. Work recovery works best when it’s practiced

# regularly and consistently.

Prevent or ease “reentry shock.”

“Reentry shock” refers to the discombobulation you feel when you

transition from a place of calm and equilibrium to one that pulls you into the frazzle and fray. You can prevent this by using buﬀers. Schedule

a free day between your return from vacation and your return to work so

you can mentally and physically prepare for the change in environment.

Keep your calendar light just after your return, which will give you a

chance to reacclimate and avoid overwork. For example, one of our clients has a two-day “no meetings” buﬀer after his return.

Bring some vacation magic home with you.

What exactly was it during your period of recovery that helped you

decompress and feel more like yourself? Was it exercise? Reconnecting

with loved ones? An artistic pursuit or hobby that’s neglected during

the work week? Simply enjoying some unscheduled leisure time? As

much as possible, build these activities and conditions into your normal

weekly routine. Remember, even small doses of downtime make a diﬀerence.

Before saying yes to new requests when you return to work, consider what’s getting in your way of saying no.

Are you concerned about not being recognized, rewarded, or promoted?

If so, stop, breathe, and check your assumptions. It may be possible

to get the recognition and rewards you’re looking for without

overcommitting yourself and sacriﬁcing your health and well-being. If

you can’t identify the problem areas — or if you need help ﬁguring out

what to do about them — consider working with a coach.

Review, communicate, and maintain your boundaries.

Returning from a recovery period is a great time to review and refresh

your work boundaries. Let everyone know when you will and will

not be available for work, and if work demands begin to creep past

your role or your comfort level, speak with leadership about shifting

responsibilities, or see if you can delegate. Boundaries should help

deﬁne others’ expectations of your role, and they should protect your

downtime and allow you to mentally detach from work.

Leave a toxic work environment that discourages time away or that rewards employees for excessive hours and self-sacriﬁce.

This kind of unhealthy work environment will leave you ripe for

exhaustion and burnout. If you can’t leave right away, start creating an

# exit strategy.

## Preventing the Urge to Overwork Before Time Off

Next time you’re planning to take time oﬀ, try in advance to make things

easier for future you. Weeks before you leave, arrange for who’s covering

your responsibilities during your absence, and include their contact

information in your out-of-oﬃce message. Set clear expectations for

when/if you should be contacted during vacation. Structure a reentry

routine ahead of time so you can plug into an existing process and

more easily get back into work mode. Finally, consider conducting a

premortem before ﬁnalizing your plans. What speciﬁc challenges or

failures might you expect or imagine? What were their main causes?

What was not yet accounted for? And ultimately, what additional

preventive steps can you take now? This simple but powerful process helps further reﬁne your pre–time oﬀ planning, which can prevent most

# reentry problems.

Periodic time away from work is one of the best ways to ensure that

you’ll be able to sustain your energy and productivity. With some
