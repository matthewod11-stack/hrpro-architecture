As you progress through your career, you’ll no doubt encounter some

major milestones and transition points that might spur you to pause

and reassess the path that you’re on. One such milestone that aﬀects

working parents is becoming an empty nester. When children leave

the house for college or other opportunities, so go predictable routines

that order much of family life: sports practices and games, concerts,

special school events, etc. What happens with all that time once your

children move out? The sudden change and loss of predictability can be

## disruptive, both for your home life and your career.

It’s common for parents to feel grief when kids leave the house. Perhaps

you’ve been caught unaware: You haven’t fully anticipated this time and

season, and now your life looks like a blank canvas. How do you ﬁll it?

Even asking the question can give rise to emotions that need to be fully

processed.

If you’re an empty nester (or will be soon), here are some strategies to

help you re-shape your life and ﬁnd meaning — both personally and

# professionally — during this time.

# Make Space To Think Ahead

You don’t have to wait until you’re an empty nester to think about how

you’ll structure your life once the kids leave. Begin thinking about this transition ﬁve years out. Let your mind wander; what could your life

look like without kids at home? Then, get more speciﬁc; think about

what you’d like to your life to look like, based on your interests and

# professional goals.

Try this: Once a week, go to a coﬀee shop with only paper and a

pen. Brainstorm possibilities for your future self. Don’t bring along any

technological device. Let your mind wander and capture your thoughts

with pen and paper; the quality of your thoughts will be diﬀerent than

if you use digital devices. Use this time to think broadly and speciﬁcally

# about dreams for your future self.

# Take Time to Rest

Perhaps you’re sad about your new circumstances and you’re grieving

the time you had with your children; you may even feel resistance if

you didn’t want this change to happen (on a conscious or subconscious

level). If you haven’t proactively planned for this phase, you may be at a

loss as to how to ﬁll your time. What opportunity does your extra time

# present?

To explore that question, take a moment to reset. Become mindful of the

present. This is a paradox; in order to begin to think about what’s next,

you must ﬁrst become aware of the present moment. Don’t succumb

to overwhelm about the future. Focus on each day, each moment,

as it comes — even if your mind wants to race ahead. Embrace a

combination of doing and non-doing as you see what desires emerge

# for you.

Resist the need to control every aspect of your newly available free time.

Try releasing the reins and seeing what comes up serendipitously. For

example, a client I coached was traveling for work and instead of going

right home after the meetings, he stayed and went to an art exhibit with his client. The time spent in a creative space outside the oﬃce was

energizing, helped him bond with his new client, and generated some

new ideas. When you’re settled and able to think about what you want

in this new phase, consider what you would like to happen in both your

# career and your personal life.

# Focus on Professional Development

Now that you have extra time, how would you like to move forward in

your work life? I advise clients to consider these options:

Think about classes or certiﬁcations that can help you push ahead in your career.

Do you have a knowledge or skills gap? Have time constraints kept you

from moving forward in that area? With your extra time, you can get

## up-to-date on key skills in your industry.

One CHRO I worked with decided to dedicate more time to reading once

her kids left the home. She made a list of books she’d always meant

to read and began working through it. As a result, she gained deep

## knowledge in her ﬁeld — and an enjoyable hobby.

## Go back and look at past work reviews and 360s.

Are there common themes that arise from looking at the data? Do you

notice areas you could work on? Look back to move forward: cataloguing

your past can spark insights for where you want to go next.

For example, a client I worked with looked more deeply at her reviews

and 360s from a strength-based lens. We discovered that she enjoyed

and was good at creating and leading programs to help with the culture

of the organization. With that knowledge, she decided to speak with

the CEO about some of her ideas and recommendations. By adding this

work to her plate, she was able to build skills to shift her work into this

# area.

Is it time to make a pivot or try something new?

Maybe you would enjoy and ﬁnd fulﬁllment from teaching a class at the

local college (or more simply, volunteering to be a guest lecturer). Don’t

take on too much change at once, but do consider where a change in

direction or a schedule addition would add to your life and happiness.

Perhaps you’ve always wanted to start a side business. Consider what

would be the ﬁrst step toward that new venture?

One leader I worked with kept a log of activities he found interesting.

He also created a list of fellow empty nesters he wanted to reconnect

with now that they all had more free time. My client found that he

enjoyed sharing experiences with fellow empty nesters, and that his

conversations sparked ideas for activities to add to his log.

Thinking about what’s next for you might require a deeper level of

self-inquiry than you’re used to. Consider leveraging a trusted advisor or

friend to help you get in touch with your wants and needs.

# Re-Evaluate Your Personal Interests

As you think about refocusing your work life, consider: What activities

outside of work would add to your development and enjoyment?

Start with reinvestigating your foundational interests. Consider what

your goals were 20 years ago. What was your vision for your life? Ask

yourself what you like to do with your time (not what you feel you

“should” do). The answer may be “take a yoga class” or “try horseback

riding lessons” — explore whatever bubbles up. You can also re-look at

your hobbies from childhood. Can you ﬁnd a new way to restart one of

# them?

Inventory all areas of your life and ask yourself whether you’re satisﬁed

with that particular area. Categories to consider might be: friendships,

health, work, and travel. Look at where you might be under-indexing

and start to evaluate your next step. If you’re overwhelmed with this

inventory, move your body. You’ll think more clearly after a workout.

All of the extra time and mental energy that comes with being an empty

nester can put you into option overload, which can feel paralyzing.

Remember: You can take your time determining what comes next. You

don’t have to have the perfect life and career plan right away. Engage in

deep reﬂection and consider what you love to do. Accept that there will

be ups and downs in this transition, but you can navigate them and take

# hold of the many opportunities ahead.
