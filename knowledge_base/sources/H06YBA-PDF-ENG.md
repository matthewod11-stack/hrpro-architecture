As leaders in organizations see embracing diversity as enriching

the talent pool, they become increasingly interested in welcoming

neurodivergent and, speciﬁcally, autistic talent. This leads to a desire

to signal this interest via special events and observances, especially

## on April 2, which is World Autism Awareness Day. But well-meaning

company leaders may ﬁnd that their intentions don’t match their

## impact, because the messaging of traditional “autism awareness” can

actually alienate autistic people and strengthen the fear they may feel

about “coming out.”

## People outside of the autism community often receive contradictory

information about which “awareness” eﬀorts are welcomed, with the

## mainstream media, parents of autistic children, and adult autistic self-

advocates presenting very diﬀerent perspectives. The confusion over

the language and symbolism reﬂects the philosophical divide between

the medical perspective on autism that has primarily dominated the

## awareness conversation in the mainstream and the neurodiversity

perspective. Leaders need to understand the origins of these mixed and

changing messages, then take steps to celebrate and include the autistic

# community meaningfully.

## The deficit perspective and the diversity perspective

## The traditional medical model views psychological characteristics

associated with autism, ADHD, dyslexia, and other developmental

diﬀerences as deﬁcits, or pathologies situated within individuals. An

alternative view is the neurodiversity perspective. In the late 1990s, Judy

Singer and Harvey Blume independently deﬁned autism as a form of

diversity — a variation of the norm that’s beneﬁcial on the societal level

(think biodiversity), yet might be stigmatized on the individual level.

Soon, the neurodiversity perspective included other developmental

diﬀerences. The neurodiversity perspective is primarily aligned with the

## social model of disability, where disablement results largely from the

## mismatch between individuals’ needs and their environments.

Autism Awareness Day began in 2007 as an initiative rooted in the

medical model of autism and focused on autistic children and ﬁnding

a cure. It was driven mainly by parents and medical professionals.

Most parents embraced autism awareness with the best intentions.

However, the cure and “combat” messaging that presented autism as

the enemy aiming to destroy families dominated autism conversations

in the mainstream media in that decade. This messaging left many

autistic youths, now grown, with mixed feelings about the dominant

## societal portrayal of autism — and their very place in that society.

Many autistic adults take the neurodiversity perspective; they seek

acceptance and inclusion rather than a cure and prefer the symbolism

of diversity and completeness (the inﬁnity sign). Some have a very

## intense emotional reaction to traditional autism awareness symbolism;

it reminds them of feeling like “a missing piece,” a “tragedy” that

“destroyed” their parents’ dreams. They also prefer identity-ﬁrst

## language (autistic person) rather than person-ﬁrst language (person

with autism), similar to other marginalized communities that wish to

reclaim their identity. On the individual level, however, it’s always polite

to ask each person about their language preferences.

In the last few years, some organizations aiming to represent autism

in the mainstream media switched from the “autism is the enemy”

rhetoric to the language of diversity. Still, the deﬁcit perspective

remains an underlying assumption that biases much of the inﬂuential

discourse, and autistic adults feel largely excluded by it. When well-

meaning company leaders make plans to mark Autism Awareness

Day, that sometimes takes the form of messaging based on potentially

harmful stereotypes or outdated messaging, such as “light up the blue”

(blue is associated with fundraising for the cure and also perpetuates

the stereotype that autism is more common in boys than in girls,

who are underdiagnosed) and puzzle pieces (which to many connote

## incompleteness), along with walks for a cure and “autism” events

that center non-autistic speakers. While likely unintended, that cure

and deﬁcit messaging can make many autistic employees feel othered.

Invisible. And like they can never belong.

How to focus on inclusion, rather than awareness

Forward-looking organizations can do much better than having an

## outdated, performative Autism Awareness Day. Celebrating autism

acceptance and inclusion rather than simply awareness can not only

improve the well-being of your autistic employees, but it can also:

- Help shift societal views on autism toward positivity

- Amplify the strength and vibrance of autistic culture

- Support much-needed autism inclusion in the workplace, as autistic

adults with college degrees remain the most underemployed group

Here are some tips for updating the symbolism of your autism

acceptance eﬀorts and for supporting autistic people in practical and

# impactful ways.

## Use language and symbolism of autism inclusion.

While individual preferences may vary, as a group, neurodivergent

adults developed shared meanings, symbolisms, and traditions

that diﬀer from those suggested by organizations without autistic

leadership. Your eﬀorts might not be perfect, but centering the autistic

community and experience is a good starting point. Here are ways

leaders and allies can use language and symbolism to help amplify the

# voice of the community:

- Use identity-ﬁrst language preferred by most autistic adults.

- Use neurodiversity-inclusive imagery. A golden or multicolored

inﬁnity symbol are the most prominent and the least contested. Some

prefer a butterﬂy (also used for ADHD and neurodiversity in general).

Feature the colors red, tan, or gold instead of blue.

- Replace “cure” language with support language. Refer to autism

## acceptance or, better yet, inclusion, instead of awareness, in your April

# events.

- Consider celebrating Autism Pride Day (June 18) and Neurodiversity

## Celebration Week (the last full week of March).

## Center the experience of autistic people.

For a long time, others have claimed to speak and decide for

autistic people, and much of the public discourse centered on non-

autistic autism professionals or family members. But the neurodiversity

movement encouraged many autistic people to advocate for themselves

and adopt “nothing about us without us” as a motto. Here are ways

leaders and allies can help others see from the autistic perspective:

- Include your autistic employees in planning any relevant events — and

let them lead.

- Hire an autistic designer for your campaign materials.

- Before you ﬁnd an outside speaker, invite your employees to volunteer.

- Oﬀer virtual sensory sensitivities experiences that simulate sensory

overload in everyday situations (e.g., by amplifying common sounds

to simulate auditory sensitivity, or amplifying lights and vibrations)

to help allistic (non-autistic) employees understand the role of

the environment in “disabling” individuals and develop empathy

toward neurodivergent colleagues. This should be accompanied by an

explanation that everyone’s autism experience is diﬀerent.

- Feature works by autistic scholars, inventors, artists, writers, and other

# creatives.

- Include parents of autistic children, grandparents, siblings, and

friends. Events and focus groups supportive of their experience are

important; perhaps one of your permanent ERGs could also serve their

needs. However, do not center their experience over the experience of

autistic people. Allyship ampliﬁes; it does not speak over.

Amplifying autistic culture and centering autistic experience is the

mark of true allyship. However, the best form of allyship is full

inclusion, and the best way organizations can support autistic people

is by creating inclusive workplaces. Celebrating and normalizing

diﬀerences without othering helps create a foundation for cultures

where diﬀerent people can thrive and belong.
