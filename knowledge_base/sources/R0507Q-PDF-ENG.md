and innovation—activities today’s competitive environment demands.

The traditional ﬁnancial performance measures worked well for the

industrial era, but they are out of step with the skills and competencies

companies are trying to master today.

As managers and academic researchers have tried to remedy the

inadequacies of current performance measurement systems, some have

focused on making ﬁnancial measures more relevant. Others have

said, “Forget the ﬁnancial measures; improve operational measures

like cycle time and defect rates. The ﬁnancial results will follow.” But

managers should not have to choose between ﬁnancial and operational

measures. In observing and working with many companies, we have

found that senior executives do not rely on one set of measures to the

exclusion of the other. They realize that no single measure can provide

a clear performance target or focus attention on the critical areas of the

business. Managers want a balanced presentation of both ﬁnancial and

# operational measures.

## During a yearlong research project with 12 companies at the

leading edge of performance measurement, we devised a “balanced

scorecard”—a set of measures that gives top managers a fast but

comprehensive view of the business. The balanced scorecard includes

ﬁnancial measures that tell the results of actions already taken. And

it complements the ﬁnancial measures with operational measures

## on customer satisfaction, internal processes, and the organization’s

innovation and improvement activities—operational measures that are

## the drivers of future ﬁnancial performance.

## Think of the balanced scorecard as the dials and indicators in an

airplane cockpit. For the complex task of navigating and ﬂying a

plane, pilots need detailed information about many aspects of the

ﬂight. They need information on fuel, airspeed, altitude, bearing,

destination, and other indicators that summarize the current and

predicted environment. Reliance on one instrument can be fatal.

Similarly, the complexity of managing an organization today requires

that managers be able to view performance in several areas at once.

The balanced scorecard allows managers to look at the business from

four important perspectives. It provides answers to four basic questions:

- How do customers see us? (customer perspective)

- What must we excel at? (internal business perspective)

- Can we continue to improve and create value? (innovation and

learning perspective)

- How do we look to shareholders? (ﬁnancial perspective)

While giving senior managers information from four diﬀerent

perspectives, the balanced scorecard minimizes information overload

by limiting the number of measures used. Companies rarely suﬀer

from having too few measures. More commonly, they keep adding new

measures whenever an employee or a consultant makes a worthwhile

suggestion. One manager described the proliferation of new measures at

his company as its “kill another tree program.” The balanced scorecard

forces managers to focus on the handful of measures that are most

# critical.

Several companies have already adopted the balanced scorecard. Their

early experiences using the scorecard have demonstrated that it meets

several managerial needs. First, the scorecard brings together, in a

## single management report, many of the seemingly disparate elements

of a company’s competitive agenda: becoming customer oriented,

shortening response time, improving quality, emphasizing teamwork,

reducing new-product launch times, and managing for the long term.

Second, the scorecard guards against suboptimization. By forcing senior

managers to consider all the important operational measures together,

the balanced scorecard lets them see whether improvement in one

area may have been achieved at the expense of another. Even the best

objective can be achieved badly. Companies can reduce time to market,

for example, in two very diﬀerent ways: by improving the management

of new-product introductions or by releasing only products that are

incrementally diﬀerent from existing products. Spending on setups can

be cut either by reducing setup times or by increasing batch sizes.

Similarly, production output and ﬁrst-pass yields can rise, but the

increases may be due to a shift in the product mix to more standard,

## easy-to-produce but lower-margin products.

We will illustrate how companies can create their own balanced

# future performance.

# [ Customer Perspective ]

# How Do Customers See Us?

Many companies today have a corporate mission that focuses on

the customer. “To be number one in delivering value to customers”

is a typical mission statement. How a company is performing from

its customers’ perspective has become, therefore, a priority for top

management. The balanced scorecard demands that managers translate

## their general mission statement on customer service into speciﬁc

measures that reﬂect the factors that really matter to customers.

Customers’ concerns tend to fall into four categories: time, quality,

performance and service, and cost. Lead time measures the time

required for the company to meet its customers’ needs. For existing

products, lead time can be measured from the time the company

receives an order to the time it actually delivers the product or service

to the customer. For new products, lead time represents the time to

market, or how long it takes to bring a new product from the product

deﬁnition stage to the start of shipments. Quality measures the defect

level of incoming products as perceived and measured by the customer.

Quality could also measure on-time delivery—the accuracy of the

organization’s delivery forecasts. The combination of performance and

service measures how the company’s products or services contribute to

creating value for its customers.

To put the balanced scorecard to work, companies should articulate

goals for time, quality, and performance and service and then translate

these goals into speciﬁc measures. Senior managers at ECI, for example,

established general goals for customer performance: Get standard

products to market sooner, improve customers’ time to market, become

customers’ supplier of choice through partnerships with them, and

develop innovative products tailored to customer needs. The managers

translated these general goals into four speciﬁc goals and identiﬁed an

# appropriate measure for each.

To track the speciﬁc goal of providing a continuous stream of attractive

solutions, ECI measured the percentage of sales from new products and

the percentage of sales from proprietary products. That information was

get data from outside. To assess whether the company was achieving

its goal of providing reliable, responsive supply, ECI turned to its

customers. When it found that each customer deﬁned “reliable,

responsive supply” diﬀerently, ECI created a database of the factors as

deﬁned by each of its major customers. The shift to external measures

of performance with customers led ECI to redeﬁne “on time” so it

matched customers’ expectations. Some customers deﬁned “on time”

as any shipment that arrived within ﬁve days of scheduled delivery;

others used a nine-day window. ECI itself had been using a seven-day

window, which meant that it wasn’t satisfying some of its customers and

overachieving for others. ECI also asked its top 10 customers to rank the

# company as a supplier overall.

Depending on customers’ evaluations to deﬁne some of a company’s

performance measures forces that company to view its performance

through customers’ eyes. Some companies hire third parties to perform

anonymous customer surveys, resulting in a customer-driven report

card. The J.D. Power quality survey, for example, has become the

## standard of performance for the automobile industry, while the U.S.

Department of Transportation’s measurement of on-time arrivals and

lost baggage provides external standards for airlines. Benchmarking

procedures are yet another technique companies use to compare their

performance against competitors’ best practices. Many companies have

introduced “best of breed” comparison programs: The company looks

to one industry to ﬁnd, say, the best distribution system, to another

industry for the lowest-cost payroll process, and then forms a composite

of those best practices to set objectives for its own performance.

In addition to measures of time, quality, and performance and service,

companies must remain sensitive to the cost of their products. But

customers see price as only one component of the cost they incur

when dealing with their suppliers. Other supplier-driven costs range

from ordering, scheduling delivery, and paying for the materials;

to receiving, inspecting, handling, and storing the materials; to the

scrapping, reworking, and obsolescence caused by the materials;

and schedule disruptions (expediting and value of lost output) from

incorrect deliveries. An excellent supplier may charge a higher unit

price for products than other vendors but nonetheless be a lower-cost

supplier because it can deliver defect-free products in exactly the

## right quantities at exactly the right time directly to the production

process and can minimize, through electronic data interchange, the

administrative hassles of ordering, invoicing, and paying for materials.

## Other Measures for the Customer’s Perspective

- A computer manufacturer wanted to be the competitive leader in

customer satisfaction, so it measured competitive rankings. The company

got the rankings through an outside organization hired to talk directly

with customers. The company also wanted to do a better job of solving

customers’ problems by creating more partnerships with other suppliers.

It measured the percentage of revenue from third-party relationships.

- The customers of a producer of very expensive medical equipment

demanded high reliability. The company developed two customer-based

## metrics for its operations: equipment up-time percentage and mean-time

# response to a service call.

- A semiconductor manufacturer asked each major customer to rank the

company against comparable suppliers on efforts to improve quality,

delivery time, and price performance. When the chip maker discovered

it ranked in the middle, managers made improvements that moved the

## company to the top of customers’ rankings.

# [ Internal Business Perspective ]

# What Must We Excel At?

Customer-based measures are important, but they must be translated

into measures of what the company must do internally to meet its

customers’ expectations. After all, excellent customer performance

derives from processes, decisions, and actions occurring throughout

an organization. Managers need to focus on those critical internal

operations that enable them to satisfy customer needs. The second part

of the balanced scorecard gives managers that internal perspective.

The internal measures for the balanced scorecard should stem from

the business processes that have the greatest impact on customer

satisfaction—factors that aﬀect cycle time, quality, employee skills,

and productivity, for example. Companies should also attempt

to identify and measure their company’s core competencies, the

critical technologies needed to ensure continued market leadership.

Companies should decide what processes and competencies they must

excel at and specify measures for each.

Managers at ECI determined that submicron technology capability was

critical to its market position. They also decided that they had to focus

## on manufacturing excellence, design productivity, and new-product

introduction. The company developed operational measures for each

# of these four internal business goals.

To achieve goals on cycle time, quality, productivity, and cost, managers

must devise measures that are inﬂuenced by employees’ actions. Since

much of the action takes place at the department and workstation

levels, managers need to decompose overall cycle time, quality,

product, and cost measures to local levels. That way, the measures

link top management’s judgment about key internal processes and

competencies to the actions taken by individuals that aﬀect overall

corporate objectives. This linkage ensures that employees at lower

levels in the organization have clear targets for actions, decisions, and

improvement activities that will contribute to the company’s overall

# mission.

Information systems play an invaluable role in helping managers

disaggregate the summary measures. When an unexpected signal

appears on the balanced scorecard, executives can query their

information system to ﬁnd the source of the trouble. If the aggregate

measure for on-time delivery is poor, for example, executives with

a good information system can quickly look behind the aggregate

measure until they can identify late deliveries, day by day, by a

## particular plant to an individual customer.

If the information system is unresponsive, however, it can be the

Achilles’ heel of performance measurement. Managers at ECI are

currently limited by the absence of such an operational information

system. Their greatest concern is that the scorecard information

is not timely; reports are generally a week behind the company’s

routine management meetings, and the measures have yet to be

linked to measures for managers and employees at lower levels of the

organization. The company is in the process of developing a more

responsive information system to eliminate this constraint.

## Other Measures for the Internal Business Perspective

- One company recognized that the success of its total quality

management (TQM) program depended on all its employees internalizing

and acting on the program’s messages. The company performed a

monthly survey of 600 randomly selected employees to determine if they

were aware of TQM, had changed their behavior because of it, believed

the outcome was favorable, or had become missionaries to others.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Balanced Scorecard: Measures That Drive Performance

- Hewlett-Packard uses breakeven time (BET) to measure the effectiveness

of its product development cycle. BET measures the time required for

## all the accumulated expenses in the product and process development

cycle (including equipment acquisition) to be recovered by the product’s

## contribution margin (the selling price less manufacturing, delivery, and

# selling expenses).

- A major office-products manufacturer, wanting to respond rapidly to

changes in the marketplace, set out to reduce cycle time by 50%. Lower

levels of the organization aimed to radically cut the times required to

process customer orders, order and receive materials from suppliers,

move materials and products between plants, make and assemble

products, and deliver products to customers.

# [ Innovation and Learning Perspective ]

## Can We Continue to Improve and Create Value?

## The customer-based and internal business process measures on the

balanced scorecard identify the parameters that the company considers

most important for competitive success. But the targets for success keep

changing. Intense global competition requires that companies make

## continual improvements to their existing products and processes and

have the ability to introduce entirely new products with expanded

# capabilities.

A company’s ability to innovate, improve, and learn ties directly to

the company’s value. That is, only through the ability to launch new

products, create more value for customers, and improve operating eﬃciencies continually can a company penetrate new markets and

## increase revenues and margins—in short, grow and thereby increase

# shareholder value.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Balanced Scorecard: Measures That Drive Performance

ECI’s innovation measures focus on the company’s ability to develop

and introduce standard products rapidly, products that the company

expects will form the bulk of its future sales. Its manufacturing

improvement measure focuses on new products; the goal is to achieve

stability in the manufacturing of new products rather than to improve

manufacturing of existing products. Like many other companies, ECI

uses the percentage of sales from new products as one of its innovation

and improvement measures. If sales from new products are trending

downward, managers can explore whether problems have arisen in new-

## product design or new-product introduction.

## In addition to measures on product and process innovation, some

companies overlay speciﬁc improvement goals for their existing

## processes. For example, Analog Devices, a Massachusetts-based

manufacturer of specialized semiconductors, expects managers to

improve their customer and internal business process performance

continuously. The company estimates speciﬁc rates of improvement for

## on-time delivery, cycle time, defect rate, and yield.

Other companies, like Milliken & Company, require that managers make

improvements within a speciﬁc time period. Milliken did not want its

“associates” (Milliken’s word for employees) to rest on their laurels after

winning the Baldrige Award. Chairman and CEO Roger Milliken asked

each plant to implement a “ten-four” improvement program: Measures

of process defects, missed deliveries, and scrap were to be reduced by

a factor of 10 over the next four years. These targets emphasize the

## role for continuous improvement in customer satisfaction and internal

# business processes.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Balanced Scorecard: Measures That Drive Performance

# [ Financial Perspective ]

# How Do We Look to Shareholders?

Financial performance measures indicate whether the company’s

strategy, implementation, and execution are contributing to bottom-

line improvement. Typical ﬁnancial goals have to do with proﬁtability,

growth, and shareholder value. ECI stated its ﬁnancial goals simply: to

survive, to succeed, and to prosper. Survival was measured by cash ﬂow,

success by quarterly sales growth and operating income by division, and

## prosperity by increased market share by segment and return on equity.

But given today’s business environment, should senior managers even

look at the business from a ﬁnancial perspective? Should they pay

## attention to short-term ﬁnancial measures like quarterly sales and

operating income? Many have criticized ﬁnancial measures because

of their well-documented inadequacies, their backward-looking focus,

and their inability to reﬂect contemporary value-creating actions.

Shareholder value analysis (SVA), which forecasts future cash ﬂows

and discounts them back to a rough estimate of current value, is an

attempt to make ﬁnancial analysis more forward-looking. But SVA still

is based on cash ﬂow rather than on the activities and processes that

# drive cash ﬂow.

Some critics go much further in their indictment of ﬁnancial measures.

They argue that the terms of competition have changed and that

traditional ﬁnancial measures do not improve customer satisfaction,

quality, cycle time, and employee motivation. In their view, ﬁnancial

performance is the result of operational actions, and ﬁnancial success

should be the logical consequence of doing the fundamentals well. In

other words, companies should stop navigating by ﬁnancial measures.

By making fundamental improvements in their operations, the ﬁnancial

numbers will take care of themselves, the argument goes.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Balanced Scorecard: Measures That Drive Performance

Assertions that ﬁnancial measures are unnecessary are incorrect for

at least two reasons. A well-designed ﬁnancial-control system can

actually enhance rather than inhibit an organization’s total quality

management program. More important, however, the alleged linkage

between improved operating performance and ﬁnancial success is

actually quite tenuous and uncertain. Let us demonstrate rather than

# argue this point.

## During the three-year period between 1987 and 1990, a NYSE electronics

company made an order-of-magnitude improvement in quality and on-

time delivery performance. The outgoing defect rate dropped from 500

parts per million to 50, on-time delivery improved from 70% to 96%, and

yield jumped from 26% to 51%. Did these breakthrough improvements

in quality, productivity, and customer service provide substantial

beneﬁts to the company? Unfortunately not. During the same three-

year period, the company’s ﬁnancial results showed little improvement,

and its stock price plummeted to one-third of its July 1987 value. The

considerable improvements in manufacturing capabilities had not been

translated into increased proﬁtability. Slow releases of new products

and a failure to expand marketing to new and perhaps more demanding

customers prevented the company from realizing the beneﬁts of its

manufacturing achievements. The operational achievements were real,

but the company had failed to capitalize on them.

## The disparity between improved operational performance and

disappointing ﬁnancial measures creates frustration for senior

executives. This frustration is often vented at nameless Wall Street

analysts who allegedly cannot see past quarterly blips in ﬁnancial

performance to the underlying long-term values these executives

sincerely believe they are creating in their organizations. But the hard

truth is that if improved performance fails to be reﬂected in the

bottom line, executives should reexamine the basic assumptions of

their strategy and mission. Not all long-term strategies are proﬁtable

# strategies.

Measures of customer satisfaction, internal business performance,

and innovation and improvement are derived from the company’s

## particular view of the world and its perspective on key success factors.

But that view is not necessarily correct. Even an excellent set of

balanced scorecard measures does not guarantee a winning strategy.

The balanced scorecard can only translate a company’s strategy

into speciﬁc measurable objectives. A failure to convert improved

operational performance, as measured in the scorecard, into improved

ﬁnancial performance should send executives back to their drawing

boards to rethink the company’s strategy or its implementation plans.

As companies have applied the balanced scorecard, we have begun to recognize that the scorecard represents a fundamental change in the underlying assumptions about performance measurement.

As one example, disappointing ﬁnancial measures sometimes occur

because companies don’t follow up their operational improvements

with another round of actions. Quality and cycle-time improvements

can create excess capacity. Managers should be prepared to either put

the excess capacity to work or else get rid of it. The excess capacity must

be either used by boosting revenues or eliminated by reducing expenses

if operational improvements are to be brought down to the bottom line.

As companies improve their quality and response time, they eliminate

the need to build, inspect, and rework out-of-conformance products

or to reschedule and expedite delayed orders. Eliminating these tasks

means that some of the people who perform them are no longer

needed. Companies are understandably reluctant to lay oﬀ employees,

especially since the employees may have been the source of the ideas

that produced the higher quality and reduced cycle time. Layoﬀs are

a poor reward for past improvement and can damage the morale of

remaining workers, curtailing further improvement. But companies will

not realize all the ﬁnancial beneﬁts of their improvements until their

employees and facilities are working to capacity—or the companies

confront the pain of downsizing to eliminate the expenses of the newly

created excess capacity.

If executives fully understood the consequences of their quality and

cycle-time improvement programs, they might be more aggressive

about using the newly created capacity. To capitalize on this self-

created new capacity, however, companies must expand sales to existing

customers, market existing products to entirely new customers (who

are now accessible because of the improved quality and delivery

performance), and increase the ﬂow of new products to the market.

These actions can generate added revenues with only modest increases

in operating expenses. If marketing and sales and R&D do not generate

the increased volume, the operating improvements will stand as excess

## capacity, redundancy, and untapped capabilities. Periodic ﬁnancial

statements remind executives that improved quality, response time,

productivity, or new products beneﬁt the company only when they are

translated into improved sales and market share, reduced operating

## expenses, or higher asset turnover. (more…)

## How One Company Used a Daily Financial Report to Improve Quality

In the 1980s, a chemicals company became committed to a total

indicators. Using computerized controls and remote data entry systems,

the plant monitored more than 30,000 observations of its production

processes every four hours. The department managers and operating

personnel who now had access to massive amounts of real-time operational

data found their monthly financial reports to be irrelevant.

But one enterprising department manager saw things differently. He

created a daily income statement. Each day, he estimated the value

of the output from the production process using market prices and

subtracted the expenses of raw materials, energy, and capital consumed

in the production process. To approximate the cost of producing out-of-

conformance product, he cut the revenues from off-spec output by 50% to

100%.

The daily financial report gave operators powerful feedback and motivation

and guided their quality and productivity efforts. The department head

understood that it is not always possible to improve quality, reduce

energy consumption, and increase throughput simultaneously; trade-offs

are usually necessary. He wanted the daily financial statement to guide

those trade-offs. The difference between the input consumed and the

output produced indicated the success or failure of the employees’ efforts

on the previous day. The operators were empowered to make decisions that

might improve quality, increase productivity, and reduce consumption of

# energy and materials.

That feedback and empowerment had visible results. When, for example,

a hydrogen compressor failed, a supervisor on the midnight shift sent

an emergency repair crew into action. Previously, such a failure of a

noncritical component would have been reported in the shift log, where

the department manager arriving for work the following morning would have

to discover it. The midnight shift supervisor knew the cost of losing the

hydrogen gas and made the decision that the cost of expediting the repairs

would be repaid several times over by the output produced by having the

# compressor back on line before morning.

The department proceeded to set quality and output records. Over time,

the department manager became concerned that employees would lose

interest in continually improving operations. He tightened the parameters

for in-spec production and reset the prices to reflect a 25% premium for

output containing only negligible fractions of impurities. The operators

continued to improve the production process.

The success of the daily financial report hinged on the manager’s ability

to establish a financial penalty for what had previously been an intangible

variable: the quality of output. With this innovation, it was easy to see

where process improvements and capital investments could generate the
