Western managers who are charged with leading global teams face a

trap. Their expertise and training usually have their roots in Western,

individualistic contexts, steeping them in ideals such as autonomy,

empowerment, egalitarianism, and authenticity. Yet according to the

GLOBE Leadership Studies, 70% of the world’s workforce is collectivist

and hierarchical. These values are characteristic not only of employees

## in Shanghai and Dubai but also of immigrant talent in Copenhagen and

# Omaha.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Leading Global Teams Effectively

A diﬀerent approach is needed for leading global teams. It’s not that

Western leadership advice is entirely wrong; rather, a global leader

needs a larger toolbox and a more reﬁned understanding of when

and how to use the tools inside. Cultural sensitivity training and even

culture-speciﬁc preparation often fall short because they’re too targeted

and episodic. It’s like trying to teach a robot how to read and respond to

## body language with limited training data.

Instead, leaders need to develop “cultural intelligence”—a ﬂexible

intercultural ﬂuency for adapting to culturally complex situations. I

have spent over two decades researching and consulting with leading

international organizations on how to manage workers and teams in

diﬀerent cultural contexts. My research shows that honing cultural

intelligence is an unending discipline, reﬁned through a lifetime of

work and experience. But a good starting point is to understand the

most common mistakes that derail Western leaders and learn how to

use cultural intelligence to avoid them.

# Too Much Autonomy

Many leaders who come from individualist cultures fall into the trap of

assuming that what motivates them will motivate their team. This often

means they don’t see the best ways to motivate people from collectivist

# cultures.

Misunderstanding often arises around the question of autonomy—

encouraging team members to make their own decisions, express their

creativity, and manage their work independently. The prevailing view

in Western leadership training is that giving employees latitude to do

their job is crucial for engagement, retention, and team performance.

But autonomy is not equally motivating for everyone. Some individuals

## thrive when their leader outlines clear processes and deadlines, and

they struggle to be productive in environments that lack directive

leadership. The degree to which individuals want to make decisions on

their own, oﬀer recommendations, and chart their own development

paths varies widely depending on whether they have an individualist

or collectivist orientation. Dutch psychologist Geert Hofstede found

that employees from individualist cultures expected to be consulted in

decision-making while those from collectivist cultures preferred leaders

to make decisions on behalf of the group. INSEAD’s Erin Meyer adds

nuance to Hofstede’s ﬁnding, noting that most collectivist leaders don’t

explicitly solicit their team members’ input, but they do consider their

perspectives when making decisions.

Most people value some measure of autonomy, but it’s especially

important to individualists. They want a say in decisions, and they

thrive in environments that encourage them to express their diﬀerences

and creativity. In many Western organizations, proactively voicing

unique ideas is rewarded because it’s believed to signal initiative and

# engagement.

Yet the majority of the global workforce has grown up in collectivist

environments, where you speak up only when invited to do so—and

even then, you’re taught to defer to those more senior. You make

decisions based on what’s best for your extended family and the other

social groups of which you’re a part. Being told to set your own goals

and solve your challenges independently can feel disorienting and

demotivating. A McDonald’s executive once told me that the company

learned this lesson in India when its Employee of the Month program

failed because no one wanted to be singled out. People who were

recognized for the award were often teased mercilessly for acting

superior and were accused of betraying their team and undermining

camaraderie. McDonald’s quietly shifted the program to the Team of the

Month, which worked much better given employees’ preference to work

collectively to accomplish goals.

Leading a global team requires more than just knowing broad cultural

distinctions; it demands the cultural intelligence to accurately assess

each situation and adjust the level of guidance, autonomy, and control

## to the unique values and preferences of each team member. For

executives at Everfresh (a pseudonym), a $30 billion company operating

in more than 75 countries, this meant rethinking the rollout of its

Speak Up campaign. Its purpose was to foster innovation and reduce ineﬃciencies by encouraging employees to oﬀer constructive feedback.

Executives thought people would welcome the initiative, but many

employees, especially in Asia, reacted negatively. They perceived

“speaking up” as a directive to challenge senior leaders and voice

opinions in public forums—behaviors that clashed with their cultural

norms. So Everfresh leadership reframed the campaign. It emphasized

that participation was expected but made it clear that speaking up

didn’t have to be verbal, public, or individual. Alternative ways for

employees to contribute, such as allowing collective feedback curated

by a group, were introduced, making the campaign more inclusive and

# eﬀective.

James Mollison assembles composites of moments that happened during a single break time at playgrounds around the world. Here, children play at Freretown Community Primary School in Mombasa, Kenya.

Everfresh used two other strategies to reframe its approach to

autonomy. First, leaders designed cultural training speciﬁcally geared

for midlevel managers, recognizing that these are the people with the

most-direct impact on whether employees speak up, take ownership,

and feel engaged. The training went beyond simply raising awareness

about cultural diﬀerences. It focused on equipping managers with the

skills needed to interpret subtle cues and provided tools for supporting

employees who found it uncomfortable to voice their perspectives and

make recommendations. The training used role-plays and coaching to

teach managers how to understand nonverbal cues, emotional signals,

and indirect communication styles. Managers learned that indirect

eye contact, silence in meetings, or reluctance to respond via email

can hold entirely diﬀerent meanings depending on a person’s cultural

background. They learned to decode unfamiliar behaviors and navigate

issues like power dynamics and the importance of saving face, how

much autonomy each team member valued, and how to adapt their

# leadership style accordingly.

In addition, Everfresh managers learned how to revamp team activities

that were biased toward an individualist view of autonomy. Take

brainstorming, for example. It might seem ideally suited to collectivists

because it invites broad participation, but brainstorming is inherently

individualist because it is rooted in participants’ willingness to speak up

with unique ideas. To make brainstorming more culturally intelligent

and eﬀective, managers asked team members to begin by writing down

their ideas. This practice beneﬁted not only collectivists but also non-

native speakers and introverts. They also oﬀered multiple ways for team

## members to share their ideas, such as one-on-one conversations, in

writing, or through group submissions. For professional development

discussions, Everfresh moved from focusing solely on individual

achievements to also emphasizing group stability and collective

success. This approach aligned with the values of team members

from collectivist backgrounds, who prioritize group harmony over

individual accolades. Over time, Everfresh saw a signiﬁcant increase

## in constructive input from employees around the world, along with

## improvements in its employee engagement scores.

# Too Much Psychological Safety

Psychological safety is a crucial aspect of eﬀective leadership.

## According to Harvard Business School’s Amy Edmondson, teams need

environments where members feel accepted and comfortable enough

to take risks and share concerns without fear of embarrassment or

retribution. (For more on this topic, see “What People Get Wrong

About Psychological Safety,” in this issue.) Google, an early adopter

of Edmondson’s work, found that teams with higher levels of

psychological safety had lower turnover rates, implemented diverse

ideas more eﬀectively, and generated more revenue. However, the teams

included in Google’s study often lacked signiﬁcant diversity—members

were mostly white or South Asian men steeped in Silicon Valley’s

culture. On these teams, “psychologically safe” meant that people felt

comfortable openly disagreeing with and debating one another, but

that kind of open conﬂict is incongruent with what most of the global

# workforce perceives as safe.

When leaders in other organizations attempt to replicate Google’s

success applying psychological safety, many end up with teams whose

members, instead of embracing a culture of rigorous debate, are timid

and afraid of oﬀending one another. They default to the common

knowledge eﬀect, in which team discussions revolve around familiar

ideas that everyone already knows, and individuals avoid sharing

anything that might be disagreeable and lead to uncomfortable debate

or ﬁnger-pointing. The research on this backﬁre risk is now extensive.

Several studies, including one led by Jeﬀ Dyer at Brigham Young

University, have shown that many global teams have become places

where safety, inclusion, and belonging are emphasized at the expense of

intellectual honesty and the conﬁdence to challenge the status quo—the

## exact opposite intention of psychological safety.

Leaders can use an array of strategies to create psychological safety

without sacriﬁcing intellectual honesty on culturally diverse teams. One

is to develop team norms that guide behavior while embracing diverse

perspectives. Isabella, an executive I coached, led the global marketing

division of a U.S. company’s top product line. Her team spanned

four regions and several time zones, and team members had diﬀering

cultural preferences. When preparing a campaign, they had vastly

diﬀerent opinions on messaging, timing, and design priorities, causing

friction and stiﬂing performance. Isabella brought in a facilitator

## for trust-building activities and discussions on collaboration, but the

bonding didn’t last. So she tried a diﬀerent approach: To address

conﬂicting priorities, the team developed some norms—for example,

“Any product launch campaign needs to be tested in at least three

markets within six weeks.” This allowed the team to balance two

diﬀering priorities: speed and thoroughness.

To ensure that norms are explicitly inclusive, rather than defaulting to

the dominant culture’s preferences, leaders can co-create norms with

their teams—soliciting input from everyone, identifying where cultural

diﬀerences come into play, and negotiating adjustments to gain the

most from the diverse approaches. Isabella’s team developed a variety of

acceptable ways to meet the norm of gaining stakeholder support before

launching a campaign. Some team members preferred gathering input

early in the process while others felt more comfortable securing buy-in

after the design was nearly ﬁnal. The team agreed that both were viable

ways to follow the six-week rule of thumb.

Many global teams have become places where safety, inclusion, and belonging are emphasized at the expense of intellectual honesty.

Another tactic leaders can use is to adjust the types of questions

they ask their teams. For instance, instead of asking a closed

question that prompts a yes or no answer (such as, “Are we missing

anything?”), rephrase it as an open-ended question that encourages

participation: “What are we missing?” This simple adjustment supports

both psychological safety and intellectual honesty. The ﬁrst question

may cause a team member to think, No one else has brought this up, so I

don’t want to be the one to say it. The second question acknowledges that

issues have likely been overlooked and should be brought forward.

When I ﬁrst started teaching, I frequently stopped throughout my

lectures to ask, “Do you have any questions?” Inevitably, the same few

students responded, while the majority stayed silent. But when I graded

their assignments, it became clear that many didn’t fully understand

the material. Eventually, I stopped asking if they had questions and

started asking what questions they had and began to say things like,

“This is a challenging concept. I’m sure you have questions, so now

is a great time to ask them.” This tactic is particularly eﬀective when

dealing with people from collectivist cultures or a mix of cultural

backgrounds because it normalizes the act of asking questions and

fosters a more inclusive environment. So, instead of asking, “Are you

facing any challenges?” try something like, “We just ﬁnished a tough

quarter. Everyone is facing signiﬁcant challenges. I want to hear about

yours.” This shift signals that sharing challenges is not only safe but

expected.

Psychological safety is critical, but it must be developed with cultural

intelligence to ensure that diversity moves beyond being a politically

correct bonus to becoming a genuine source of improved performance

# and innovation.

# Too Much Emphasis on Differences

Understanding our diﬀerences has become the holy grail of inclusion

initiatives and cross-cultural management training. It’s considered

key to building innovative teams. And there’s plenty of evidence to

support the power of diversity. Team members who have diverse

backgrounds and perspectives oﬀer built-in expertise for tackling

problems and viewing products and projects more critically. But

overindexing on diﬀerences can be damaging. One Deakin University

study of 265 Australian workers found that diversity can make us

anxious, leading to reduced knowledge-sharing and communication

## challenges with colleagues from diﬀerent backgrounds. Researchers

from the University of Missouri found that some diversity initiatives

can also inadvertently lead to disengagement and the exclusion of

underrepresented individuals, hindering the very inclusion they were

meant to create.

## A meta-analysis of 199 cultural intelligence studies by Thomas

Rockstuhl and Linn Van Dyne showed that knowing a lot about cultural

diﬀerences can be more harmful than being culturally ignorant. When

people become overconﬁdent in their understanding of diﬀerences, it

can lead to rigid, categorical thinking in which behavior is reduced to

monolithic labels like being “German” or “Gen X” or an “engineer.” In

addition, a heightened focus on how we’re diﬀerent becomes mentally

taxing and prevents dynamic, generative learning about one another.

Cultural intelligence equips leaders to skillfully acknowledge and adapt

to diverse backgrounds while keeping the team centered on shared

# objectives.

One eﬀective strategy for harnessing diversity’s beneﬁts is for leaders

to emphasize perspective-taking with their teams. Perspective-taking

is the ability to step outside one’s own experience to imagine the

## emotions, perceptions, and motivations of someone else. Unlike

empathy, which can sometimes confuse personal feelings and the

## team’s mission, perspective-taking enhances cognitive ﬂexibility while

maintaining focus on the task at hand. It helps team members

understand, for example, how two smart people can receive the same

## information yet arrive at radically diﬀerent conclusions.

A study led by Adam Galinsky at Columbia University illustrates the

power of perspective-taking. Students were shown a photo of an elderly

man sitting next to a newspaper stand and were asked to write a short

essay about a typical day in his life. Galinsky divided the students

into three groups. The control group was asked to simply describe the

man’s day. The second group was told to describe his day without using

stereotypes, and the people in the third group were instructed to write

the essay in the ﬁrst person, imagining themselves as the man.

## Seabright Primary School, London James Mollison

Many of the students in the control group used negative stereotypes,

portraying the man as lonely, dependent, and declining in health.

The students instructed to avoid stereotypes wrote more neutral

descriptions about the man, making up scenarios about how he might

spend his time and what he might be thinking about. The students

asked to write in the ﬁrst person had the most positive descriptions,

highlighting the man’s wisdom, his broad circle of friends, and the joy

he ﬁnds in life’s simple pleasures. Managers can apply this strategy

when teammates disagree about a course of action by asking them to

describe the opposing perspective in the ﬁrst person. This approach

humanizes teammates, encourages perspective-taking, and may lead to

insights that enable the team to ﬁnd a solution that leverages multiple

# viewpoints.

Another way leaders can prevent an overemphasis on diﬀerences is

by focusing the team on solving a shared problem. Research has

consistently shown that labeling diﬀerences within a group—whether

based on culture, identity, or even something as trivial as assigning

people to “blue” or “green” groups—inevitably creates divisions. The

most eﬀective way to counter this tendency is to reframe the group’s

identity around a common goal or challenge. The psychologist Muzafer

Sherif’s famous Robbers Cave experiment illustrates this: Researchers

divided boys into two teams at summer camp, leading to conﬂict that

only subsided when they faced shared challenges, like ﬁxing the camp’s

water supply and a broken truck carrying food. In a far more dramatic,

real-world example, at Hadassah Ein Kerem Hospital in Jerusalem,

Israeli and Palestinian doctors and nurses work together to provide top-

quality care, focusing on their shared commitment to patient care rather

# than their cultural diﬀerences.

Diversity training can play an important role as leaders walk

the line between ignoring diﬀerences and overindexing on them.

## Sociologists Frank Dobbin and Alexandra Kalev found that opt-in

training sessions that emphasize perspective-taking and skill-building

help team members understand how their diﬀerences contribute to

achieving shared goals. Instead of relying on broad generalizations and

stereotypes, leaders can emphasize diverse work styles and values—

## in areas such as approaches to communication, decision-making, and

conﬂict resolution—that are often shared across a range of identities

and cultures. Eﬀective diversity training fosters constructive dialogue

by creating an environment in which participants say what they really

think instead of staying silent or simply echoing what they think

is expected. By acknowledging diﬀerences without allowing them to

become the dominant focus, leaders can foster a team culture that is

# both inclusive and high performing.

# Too Much Transparency

Trust in leadership is at an all-time low. According to the 2025 Edelman

Trust Barometer, a majority of people in 28 countries believe their

leaders are deliberately misleading them. This isn’t only happening

in countries that prefer ﬂat leadership structures, such as the United

States and Sweden. Leaders’ credibility is also low in places like Japan

and France that prefer top-down leadership. The conventional wisdom

in the West is that leaders gain trust by being vulnerable, authentic,

## and transparent. As former Starbucks CEO Howard Schultz put it, “The

currency of leadership is transparency.” But those values chafe against

the more nuanced, discreet communication styles preferred by much

of today’s global workforce. It’s not that team members from other

cultural contexts don’t value transparency; they just expect leaders to

communicate transparently in ways that align with their own cultural

norms. Global teams need their leaders to have a broader repertoire of

communication styles so that they can eﬀectively gain the trust of team

# members.

Western managers are told that owning their mistakes and discussing

them openly is crucial for building trust, but for someone from a face-

saving culture, it can be disorienting when a leader speaks candidly

about a mistake. Leaders hold a position of authority and honor, and

hearing them grovel about what they did wrong may actually erode

trust. People already know when something has gone awry. Many team

members from collectivist cultures would rather see their leader address

the issue quietly and restore trust through actions rather than words.

Owning mistakes is important, but the way leaders communicate about

them needs to reﬂect the cultural diﬀerences on the team.

## Shohei Elementary School, Tokyo James Mollison

Team members, regardless of culture or personality, want leaders

to be clear. In fact, in the GLOBE Leadership Studies, “clarity” was

rankedas one of the highest priorities that global employees want from

leaders. One eﬀective strategy is to build trust gradually by gauging

team members’ receptivity and modulating the level of disclosure

accordingly. For cultures or individuals who may ﬁnd too much

disclosure unsettling, start slowly and build trust through consistency,

incremental sharing, and demonstrated competence. In some cases,

sensitive information is better communicated through a third party

rather than directly from the leader. Some senior leaders task their

deputies with sharing diﬃcult information, not so much to avoid the

discomfort for themselves but to create an environment in which team

members are comfortable asking questions while allowing everyone to

# save face.

Transparency also requires that leaders expand their repertoire of

communication styles to align with the varying comfort levels and

values of team members. Ex-Googler Kim Scott says leaders need

to use radical candor with everyone. From her perspective, even

“obnoxiously aggressive feedback” is better than “ruinous empathy”

lest leaders withhold feedback that might be helpful. However,

this approach assumes that bluntness is the only eﬀective way

to provide clear feedback. In most cultures people communicate

more indirectly. They are not necessarily being passive-aggressive or

dishonest; they’re just communicating the same message in a diﬀerent

way. Indirect communicators expect their leaders to trust them to be

intelligent enough to interpret subtle cues without the discomfort of

a confrontational approach. There’s an art to deftly communicating in

ways that are crystal clear but without a blunt edge.

An expanded repertoire of communication styles enables leaders to

adapt—modifying when and how much information to share—to ensure

that their message is received clearly and builds trust. Some team

members want play-by-play updates during a crisis, while that level

of transparency induces anxiety for others, particularly if there’s no

resolution or proposed plan yet. Others may prefer that leaders outline

theoretical principles before diving into practical applications.

Culturally intelligent leaders understand that their preferred approach

may not build trust with every team member. By adjusting their

approach, they build deeper connections, enhance clarity, and respect
