I nodded, let it go, and didn’t think more about it until a fewyears later when I finished grad school with massive debt from astudent loan. The first job I took barely covered my expenses. Ihad to rely on a credit card, even when

aside some savings wouldn’t help me in the long run. To build afinancially safe future, I had to find ways to create wealth.While learning about financial planning can seem daunting atfirst,

So, here are some recommendations from ourauthors to inspire you.
