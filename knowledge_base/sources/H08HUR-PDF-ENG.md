The morning meeting started like any other, until Sarah presented her

new marketing strategy. As she spoke, her boss, Tom, seemed visibly

disappointed. “Ha! That’s the stupidest idea I’ve heard,” he interrupted,

his voice sharp enough to make everyone ﬂinch. “This is why we’re

falling behind — because of team members like you who don’t want to

# think things through.”

Sarah’s hands trembled as she gathered her papers. This was not the

ﬁrst time her boss had humiliated her. The room sat in uncomfortable

silence, everyone averting their eyes — they’d all been in her position

before. They knew what she was going through.

Later that day, Tom took credit for Sarah’s idea in an email to the

leadership team, changing just enough details to make it his own. There

wasn’t anything Sarah could do to prove it was her idea, and the others

were afraid to stand up for her because they didn’t want to risk losing

their jobs in what was already a tough market.

This is the lived experience for many employees with toxic bosses.

What should you do if your boss’s behavior is bringing everyone down

and aﬀecting your wellbeing? When should you consider quitting? And

is there anything you can do in the meantime to actually cope with the

amount of stress a toxic boss can bring?

In my decade of experience as a workplace culture consultant, I’ve seen

just how damaging a toxic boss can be. Here are the signs to help you

assess whether your boss is toxic — and what to do if you’re ﬁnding yourself in this impossibly diﬃcult situation.

# Signs of a Toxic Boss

While some bosses can be annoying, dismissive, or frustrating at times,

it doesn’t mean they’re toxic. So, what should you watch out for? Here

are 10 toxic boss traits:

- 1. They lack self-awareness.

Toxic bosses lack the ability to recognize and control their emotions.

They tend to think that they are right about everything. This inhibits

their ability to create resonance with teams and generates resistance to

# feedback.

- 2. They lack empathy.

Toxic bosses don’t invest time or energy in building relationships to

understand how their communication approach may impact others.

They struggle to relate to team members’ challenges, perspectives, and

## emotions, and this in turn leads to low trust.

- 3. They’re excessively motivated by self-interest.

Toxic bosses make everything about them and seek to take credit for the

work of others. They are more likely to make risky, attention-grabbing

## strategic moves, often at the expense of long-term organizational

# stability.

- 4. They demonstrate inconsistent behavior.

Toxic bosses display unpredictable behavior, and employees may ﬁnd it diﬃcult to decipher what is expected of them from one day to the next.

They are unclear in their communication and often display favoritism

# or discrimination.

- 5. They take advantage of power dynamics.

Toxic bosses will weaponize their authority, expecting employees to

carry out their instructions obediently and without questioning their

authority or the value of the work being undertaken.

- 6. They micromanage.

Toxic bosses don’t trust or empower staﬀ, instead they tell people how

work should be done or insist on being copied into emails or invited to

meetings. They seek to control how you complete your work.

- 7. They set unreasonable expectations.

Toxic bosses may demand results or set deadlines that are unachievable

or, their expectations are unclear leading to vague and confusing goals,

# excessive workloads, and uncertainty.

- 8. They belittle and demoralize.

Toxic bosses will “joke” at the expense of others and talk negatively

behind people’s backs. They will rarely have good things to say about

people and will look to generate agreement from others that their

opinion is true.

- 9. They seek to blame others.

When issues arise or mistakes are made, toxic bosses will look to

blame everyone but themselves. They will go to great lengths to explain

how others are culpable for the outcomes arising from errors, while

exonerating themselves.

- 10. They’re overconﬁdent about their knowledge.

Toxic bosses routinely overestimate their skills and knowledge, leading

them to believe that they are better at their job than they actually

are. They continually think that they have the knowledge required and

reject any suggestions of self-development.

It only takes one of these traits to generate toxicity in the workplace and

their impact can be felt across teams and the organization.

## The Consequences of Working for a Toxic Boss

If you’re working for a toxic boss, you’re likely well aware of just how

damaging it can be. Here are some of the most common impacts:

- 1. Increased feelings of fear and anxiety

Feelings of fear will permeate not only through your workplace but also

into your home. Research shows that as many as one in four employees

dread going to work in the morning. Your boss’s toxicity may also lead

you to constantly feeling anxious as they undermine your conﬁdence,

leaving you worried about your job.

- 2. Undermined trust

Trust is critical for employee wellbeing, yet the behavior of toxic bosses

will erode the trust that you have in them.

- 3. Low morale

When morale and conﬁdence are low it can undermine your feeling

of self-worth, lead to a deterioration in your performance, and have a

## negative impact on the dynamics of the wider team as well.

- 4. Increased employee turnover

A toxic boss will not only aﬀect your conﬁdence, they will also decrease

your job satisfaction and motivate you to look for another job.

- 5. Increased risk of serious illness

Numerous studies have found a link between toxic bosses and serious

health issues such as depression, high blood pressure, PTSD, anxiety,

and even premature aging.

- 6. Burnout

The expectations of toxic bosses around work-life balance are

demanding. They don’t recognize or appreciate your eﬀorts or

achievements, and they tend to provide inadequate support for you to

succeed. All of this can lead to burnout.

## How to Deal with a Toxic Boss — and When to Quit

- 1. Prioritize your own well-being.

First, know that you are your priority, so your starting point should be

to ﬁrst take care of yourself. Recognize which emotions belong to you

and which belong to others. If you’re an empath and tend to absorb

other people’s emotions, you may ﬁnd yourself sharing their emotional

burden, stress, or outrage about the toxic boss. This might make you

feel anxious or concerned on their behalf, aﬀecting your mental health

when you already have your own emotions to process. Investing time

and energy in hobbies, relationships, and goals outside of work can help

maintain perspective and reduce the impact of work-related stress.

Journaling has also been shown to be an eﬀective method to manage

emotions. In fact, writing about negative experiences has a positive

eﬀect on our mental health. Expressive writing, for example, can result

in a reduction in stress and anxiety, and can even bring us greater focus

and clarity. Set aside a few minutes each day to write freely about your

emotions and experiences at work. Use prompts like “Today I felt…” or

“A situation that aﬀected me was…” to explore your feelings.

Mindfulness can also help, and can be practiced in many ways,

including using techniques like meditation or deep-breathing exercises

to stay grounded and manage stress. This can help you remain calm in diﬃcult situations. A good place to start would be with the 4-7-8 exercise

where you breathe in for 4 seconds, hold your breath for 7 seconds, and

then breathe out for 8 seconds.

- 2. Seek constructive dialogue.

If you feel you can talk to your boss, attempt to have calm, professional

conversation about how their behavior makes you feel. It’s important

to be factual. State speciﬁc examples, link them to your feelings, and

talk about how it undermined your ability to do the work asked of you.

Don’t be accusatory or apportion blame. Simply and calmly state how

their actions made you feel. It’s important to remain in control of your

feelings, and also to make note of anything they may say, in case you

need to take the issue further.

Instead of saying: “You signaled that you don’t value me when you

passed me over for the new client’s project and said I couldn’t handle

competing priorities. It crushed my conﬁdence. I knew I could do

it, but it seems you didn’t trust me enough. You also point out my

mistakes in front of everyone, making me appear careless.”

Try: “When you passed me over for the new client project, it made

me feel undermined. I felt like you didn’t trust that I could handle

competing priorities. It also aﬀects my conﬁdence when you point

out my mistakes in front of other people. I value your feedback, but I

would appreciate if you could give that to me in private and help me

understand how I can do better.”

- 3. Keep an audit trail of information.

Keep detailed records of interactions, assignments, and any

inappropriate behavior directed towards you or others. In dire situations

where you may need to seek help from human resources, you would be

able to use your information trail to show that your feelings are rooted

in facts. If your boss tends to give a lot of instructions verbally, say,

while walking through the hallway, you could go back and email them

with what was discussed. Present the instructions the way you heard

and processed them, and ask your boss to reconﬁrm if they look okay.

Try: “Hi Alex. I want to be sure I got all the information right as this

will help me do a good job on the project and meet your expectations.

Here is what I took away from our conversation a few minutes ago

[list instructions here]. Please conﬁrm if my understanding is correct.

In case I may have missed something, please feel free to add to/edit

the list. Thank you.”

- 4. Find a support group.

If you’re unable to ﬁnd a way to talk to your boss or need advice on the

way forward, talk to a trusted colleague. You may ﬁnd that other direct

reports are also reeling under the same stress. It can help to talk to them

about their experiences and understand how they are dealing with the

situation. Talking to a mentor or another senior leader could also help

you gain a diﬀerent perspective. They may be able to oﬀer insight into a

stressful work situation that could be triggering your boss’s behavior, for

# example.

- 5. Talk to HR.

Sometimes, approaching your boss directly doesn’t feel possible. This

could be because of unequal power dynamics, emotional barriers (you

lack the conﬁdence to do so, or you fear their reaction), or they may

simply be unavailable to you. In which case, you should work with your

human resources department to explain the situation and, perhaps, ﬁle

a formal complaint. Present the facts that you have saved as emails,

messages, etc, and narrate them as you have witnessed them. If more

drastic action is required, seek professional advice.

- 6. Look for other opportunities.

No one should be working for someone who doesn’t respect them,

makes them feel undermined, or makes their work life hell. While you

can do all that you can to maintain high work standards to protect

yourself from unwarranted criticism, a toxic boss may still ﬁnd ways to

belittle you. If a boss’s toxic behavior has become intolerable and all

else fails, actively seek out other opportunities. If the company you’re

working for is a place you like, you could reach out to HR and talk about

other roles within the company. If you feel the toxicity is a widespread

## issue within the organization, look for opportunities outside.

Working for a toxic boss can be devastating and can have a lasting

impact on your mental and physical health. No one should suﬀer at the

# hands of a toxic boss.
