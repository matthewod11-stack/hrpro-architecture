We’re taught from an early age that hard work is important. What

we’re not taught is that hard work comes in two equally important

forms: eﬀort to perform and eﬀort to improve.

When we have a murky understanding of the two types of eﬀort, our

lengthy to-do lists tend to trap us in chronic eﬀorts to perform —

a relentless drive to execute tasks as best as we know how, trying

to minimize mistakes. I call this the “performance zone,” where we

develop tunnel vision, focusing only on getting things done. This might

make us feel productive, but it leads to stagnation. When we’re focused

only on execution, we respond to challenges by pedaling harder,

working more hours, hiring more people, and at times even cutting

corners. None of this is enough to keep up with the fast pace of change,

so we still feel behind.

When we switch our lens to include eﬀorts to improve, entering what I

call the “learning zone,” we can get things done in ways that make us

more eﬀective. Not only does this result in better outcomes, it makes

## our journeys more interesting, enjoyable, and fulﬁlling.

These ﬁve strategies can help managers equip your teams to move

from the performance zone to incorporating the learning zone, enabling

them to work eﬀectively while driving change and growth.

- 1. Set the stage for the learning zone.

In everyday work and life, most of us tend to get stuck in the

performance zone, ﬁxated on getting things done as ﬂawlessly as

possible. This might work ﬁne while we’re novices, but once we become

proﬁcient, this single-minded focus leads to stagnation, or worse.

For example, a Harvard Medical School meta-analysis concluded that,

## on average, the more years general physicians practice medicine, the

worse their patient outcomes become. That’s because many of them

are solely focused on providing care: seeing patients, diagnosing, and

prescribing as best as they know how. But doctors who continue

to engage in eﬀective learning — seeking out and expanding their

knowledge and skills, and examining mistakes — continue to improve.

Most of us don’t have the luxury of devoting signiﬁcant blocks of

time every day to learning or practicing a speciﬁc skill. The biggest

opportunity to accelerate our development is to get things done in ways

that also lead to improvement — engaging in the performance zone and

the learning zone at the same time, which I call learning while doing.

This means leaping beyond what we’ve already mastered — setting

challenging goals that push us to the next level, while paying attention

to what we can learn and change. You can do this while executing. For

example, try testing whether a new technology or technique you heard

about could enable your team to solve customer problems better, faster,

# and with less eﬀort.

To move your team from chronic performance to learning while doing,

# managers can:

- Revisit your guiding language, such as your core values, key behaviors,

and team norms. Does your messaging reinforce continuous change

and improvement as a core goal, and guide people on how to go about

# it?

- Clarify when it’s appropriate to stay in the performance zone, and

when and how to engage in the learning zone. For example, if you’re

under a tight deadline for a high-stakes project that’s at risk, it

might be OK to stay in the performance zone. Conversely, to ensure

regular engagement in the learning zone, consider setting up systems

to run experiments, or scheduling conversations across divisions to

help people better understand the organization and explore ways to

# enhance collaboration.

- Align on why, when, and how to solicit feedback from customers,

peers, supervisors, direct reports, and beyond. Listening to feedback

yields insights about what the team is doing well and ideas on what to

consider changing.

- Schedule regular discussions on how your team is working together,

sharing ideas for what to try diﬀerently. Without change, there can be

# no improvement.

- 2. Embed learning opportunities in daily tools and processes.

Developing consistent routines supports high performance. That’s why

we use standard procedures, templates, checklists, weekly meetings

with set agendas, daily standups, strategic planning processes,

# dashboards, and quarterly reviews.

But these systems shouldn’t have a sole focus on getting things done.

You can design processes that encourage team members to regularly

enter the learning zone — even when you’re not around. To establish

routines that ensure continuous improvement:

- Design meeting agendas to include sections that prompt participants

## to share questions, struggles, mistakes, ideas, insights, or feedback.

- Ensure checklists include steps to reﬂect on what went well, what

didn’t, and what to try diﬀerently moving forward.

- Teach people that when a standard procedure or template leads to a

mistake, they should ask how the process or tool could be changed to

avoid repeating the error.

- Make it standard practice for projects to incorporate mid-action and/or

# after-action reviews.

- Put systems in place, such as daily standups, to remind individuals

and teams of what they’re working to improve and how.

- 3. Model being a learner.

At the beginning of my keynotes, I often ask attendees how they

want their colleagues to perceive them. Their answers encompass

positive qualities such as being trustworthy, collaborative, accountable,

## empathetic, knowledgeable, competent, responsible, and supportive. I

rarely hear someone share that they want to be perceived as a learner or

a work in progress — a person who is continuing to develop themselves.

If we want to create a culture of learning, we must be deliberate

about being perceived as learners. Many leaders embrace ongoing

improvement: We read books, listen to podcasts, solicit ideas from

trusted mentors, experiment, and reﬂect. But we tend to do so in

# private, away from our teammates.

We must talk about the importance of learning and show it through

our actions. This prompts others to act as learners too, and to do so in

collaboration, which generates even more powerful growth.

# Consider:

- Does your team know which skill you’re personally working to

improve?

- Do you solicit feedback from a variety of people, at least a few times

# each week?

- Do you acknowledge when you don’t know something or do you

present yourself as someone who is sure to have the right answer?

Asking for others’ perspectives supports the notion that anyone can

always expand their understanding.

- When you take on a challenge, face a struggle, or make a mistake, do

you share that with others, voice your reﬂections, and ask for ideas?

You might fear that these behaviors could prompt others to lose

conﬁdence in you or your organization. However, it is these exact

## behaviors that enable success, especially in our complex and fast-

changing world. If you model them, your team will become more

conﬁdent about learning and better equipped to prosper.

- 4. Regularly reinforce messages about learning.

While leaders can set the stage by describing a desired culture,

changing mental models and behavior takes time and requires periodic

reinforcement. People need regular reminders, especially early in your

# eﬀorts.

Make it an ongoing practice to remind your teams what feedback is —

information the best performers use to improve even further. Encourage

colleagues to reﬂect on and discuss mistakes to extract their precious

## lessons. Praise these essential learning behaviors.

Also remind your teams frequently of your core values and norms.

When you notice the desired behaviors, point them out and celebrate

them. When people fall short — especially you — point that out and

discuss what led to the shortfall and what can be changed.

Regularly clarify when and how to be in each zone. If you are preparing

for an important client meeting, should your team see that purely

as a performance zone, or is there something the group wants to try

diﬀerently during the meeting? Either way is ﬁne, but make your

implicit assumptions explicit. You want to be clear and aligned, and

to seize opportunities to reinforce the new ways of thinking.

- 5. Schedule regular discussions about what to try differently — and how to get better at getting better.

Periodically revisit your learning and performance routines and systems

and discuss what to adjust. If your team is working the same way today

as last month or last year, it probably hasn’t improved. In fact, you’ve

probably become less eﬀective, as the world has changed while your

# team hasn’t.

Perhaps you’re spending too much time in meetings, communicating things that could be communicated more eﬃciently asynchronously.

Perhaps emails are too short and are leading to confusion and

unnecessary work, or perhaps they’re too long and overly detailed.

Regular meetings where teams rotate sharing what they do and how

they’re working to change can promote systems thinking and cross-

# functional collaboration.

These conversations lead to increasing performance, but also reinforce a

culture of learning that prompts everyone to approach their daily work

# diﬀerently.

# Overcoming the Performance Paradox

Our lack of awareness of the two forms of eﬀort, along with our human

bias to overvalue the present and undervalue the future and the

presence of systems that have not been designed for learning, all lead to

## a persistent underinvestment in our own development.

We sometimes think that engaging in learning will detract from

performance, but that is shortsighted. Research in many domains shows

the opposite: The highest performers are those who regularly engage in

the learning zone. It doesn’t need to take more time. It’s about how we

go about our daily work and life while getting things done.

When we explore others’ ideas, leap beyond the known, try new ways

of working, ask questions, experiment, examine mistakes, and solicit

feedback, we discover ways to work smarter and achieve greater impact.
