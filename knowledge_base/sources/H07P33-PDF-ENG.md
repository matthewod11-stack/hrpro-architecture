Middle managers are receiving pressure from their leaders to spend

more time developing and coaching their direct reports. The pressure

is also coming from below, as employee expectations have risen for real-

time, personalized feedback, particularly among those early in their

careers or who were onboarded remotely. The challenge is satisfying

these demands without incurring even higher levels of middle manager

burnout and stress. Based on our research and advisory work, we

foresee new AI tools making it easier for managers to provide high-

quality coaching more eﬃciently.

Employees want more coaching, but managers are out of capacity

O.C. Tanner’s 2023 Global Culture Survey found that leaders whose

supervisory responsibilities — including training employees — had

increased over the past year showed a 21% higher rate of anxiety, which

increased the odds of burnout by a staggering 520%.

Despite the potential for overload, managers generally want to coach

their employees because they know it’s beneﬁcial. In fact, managerial

coaching has been shown to increase job satisfaction, knowledge

sharing, and performance — all outcomes that organizations (and

# managers!) want.

# The AI opportunity

Our review of the ﬁeld indicates that AI-based managerial coaching is not yet commonplace, so we oﬀer two case examples to demonstrate

how it might work in your organization:

# Eleos Health

Eleos Health is a behavioral health technology company that Katherine

studied in depth as part of her ethnographic research. The Eleos

platform uses HIPAA-compliant software to record and analyze

conversations between therapists and clients. In addition to saving time

for therapists in note-taking, the platform’s AI automatically identiﬁes

relevant evidence-based techniques and summarizes key moments in

## conversations between therapists and clients.

One therapist explained: “After each session, the Eleos platform

analyzes the counseling techniques I used and provides a helpful

summary. This gives me a great sense of where I left oﬀ with that

patient and what interventions I should use next time to best help

them.” In this way, the AI platform enables therapists to make self-

directed improvements in their work without having to rely so heavily

# on supervisors for guidance.

In addition, the AI platform can facilitate more useful checkpoints

between therapists and their supervisors when they do need to meet.

For example, it can be used to quickly synthesize or extract relevant

client session data when discussing a complex case, reducing reliance

on memory or notes. As one supervisor told Katherine, “New therapists

often have questions … Eleos’ analyses allow me to zero in on key

moments in their session visits, or on techniques the therapists have

used, as well as patient progress over time, so that our coaching time

together can be spent most productively.”

# Gong

A second example comes from Gong, which has developed an AI

platform for sales teams. Gong’s platform unobtrusively captures

## live interactions between agents and prospective clients. While the

conversation is unfolding, AI is crunching data in the background,

examining how variables like pace, topic, tone, and turn-taking compare

to best practices at that company. This data is used to provide insights

# and advice to sales agents in real time.

Moreover, Gong’s AI can automatically create a library of high-quality

examples of recorded sales conversations to serve as a resource for

independent learning. This has been found to be especially helpful for

new employees, who can listen to exemplary sales calls at their own

pace, rather than relying on direct training from others.

Identifying essential onboarding content and providing sales reps with

real-time advice during sales calls saves managers hours of time that

used to be spent listening to new employees’ calls to help them

understand what works and what doesn’t in the sales process. The result

is eﬃcient knowledge transfer. As one Gong user told us, “The platform

empowers me to improve my skills and share best practices with fellow

sales reps. I ﬁnd that AI-based knowledge-sharing through feedback

and metrics leads to continuous improvement for the entire team.”

Understanding potential challenges

We’re not endorsing any particular tool or company, but we do

encourage HR and people managers to be on the lookout for AI

options that could enhance managerial coaching in their organizations.

Other companies in this space include Beamery, Humu, Culture Amp, BetterUp, Skillsoft, and IBM. We expect new oﬀerings will continue to

emerge, including those embedding generative AI capabilities.

As you shop around, assess your workforce’s readiness for adopting an

AI-assisted coaching system. Keep in mind that evaluating someone’s

work and trying to improve it are already emotion-laden processes;

adding technology to the mix can amplify anxiety.

One well-documented phenomenon is “algorithm aversion”: people’s

reluctance or unwillingness to trust algorithms more than human

judgment. This can be even more potent when the algorithm is judging

# an employee’s eﬃcacy.

In addition, introducing a new source of evaluation can potentially

create a social distance between managers and their employees,

especially if there are concerns about bias, transparency, and privacy.

For example, one study showed that employees resented AI-based

feedback, even if it was objectively helpful, if they were not apprised

ahead of time that their manager was using it. This study speaks to

the importance of not only considering factors such as cost, accuracy,

and timing when evaluating an AI-assisted coaching tool, but also the

human factors that can inﬂuence its success or failure.

## Five steps for successful AI-assisted coaching

To ensure that AI-assisted coaching initiatives achieve the best possible

outcomes for both employees and managers, we recommend the

following steps:

# Establish psychological safety and trust

Decades of research show that a trust-based relationship between parties is essential for eﬀective feedback and coaching. This is even

more essential when dealing with the “black box” of AI-generated

assessments. In a new study, for example, employees who felt their

managers had their best interests at heart were more willing to accept

AI-generated recommendations — even ones they didn’t initially agree

with. Managers can create psychological safety and trust in the tool by

clarifying the rationale for the AI integration, giving assurances as to

how employee data will be used, and encouraging people to speak up

# about problems or questions.

## Engage employees in design and implementation

For the best quality as well as the most buy-in, it’s critical to

be inclusive of employees throughout the exploration and adoption

process. Microsoft found in a recent survey of 4,500 global executives

that giving people a say in technological initiatives goes a long way

toward keeping them satisﬁed and engaged with the tools. Ideally,

employees will be involved down to the level of determining the

performance metrics and type of coaching that will be generated by AI.

Give employees some control over their data and participation

Giving employees agency over how they engage with AI-assisted

coaching systems helps alleviate scrutiny and privacy concerns. For

example, Eleos Health’s platform allows clinicians to opt out of using

the platform for speciﬁc patient sessions. Another recommended

approach is to form an employee-inclusive AI governance board to

ensure transparency in what data is being collected, how it’s being used,

and what safeguards are in place to protect employees’ privacy.

Streamline and customize the output

Typically, AI tools allow managers to customize the data displays and

analyses generated; we recommend organizations take full advantage of

these features. At the start of a rollout, for example, it might be helpful

to focus the output on only a few performance metrics until people feel

# more comfortable with the tool.

Managers can also customize the quality of the feedback to reﬂect

speciﬁc employee needs — for example, by having the output provide

more encouraging feedback during employee onboarding. In one study, the AI coaching tool was found most eﬀective for moderately skilled

employees, as less-skilled employees sometimes found the feedback

## overwhelming (too many suggestions), while more-skilled employees

sometimes found it lacking in nuance. What employees want is

personalized coaching, so it’s important to pick an AI tool that’s ﬂexible

enough to accommodate the array of people and situations in your

# organization.

Train managers intensively Many managers could beneﬁt from basic training in eﬀective coaching,

including how to embed genuine empathy and compassion in the

process. Integrating AI tools will require additional upskilling of

managers. They should be trained not only in technical know-how but

in how to translate AI-generated data sensitively and competently to

employees. AI tools may also prove useful for training new managers by

providing practice cases and other forms of experiential learning.

AI tools hold special promise for increasing the frequency,

personalization, and accuracy of coaching, without increasing the

burden on managers. These gains are not guaranteed, however. To be

successful, it’s critical to integrate AI technology in a way that leads to a better human experience for both managers and employees.
