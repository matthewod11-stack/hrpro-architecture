Transitioning back to work after parental leave is hard. You’ve been

out of the ﬂow of the oﬃce for weeks or months, and you’re returning as a diﬀerent person with new priorities and concerns. (Not to mention

the stress and strain of endless new logistics.) It’s jarring and often

overwhelming. So how can you make your ﬁrst few weeks back in the

oﬃce as smooth as possible? If you have the choice, is it better to

ease back slowly or to jump right in? How should you manage your

relationships with your boss and coworkers? Perhaps most important,

where can you turn to get the emotional support and encouragement

you need during this time?

# What the Experts Say

Returning to work after being home with a new baby is “a transition

that’s like no other,” says Daisy Wademan Dowling, the founder

and CEO of Workparent, a consulting ﬁrm for working parents and

employers. “Everything is changing — from your practical day-to-day

## schedule, to your new responsibilities as a parent, to your identity in

terms of how you’ve seen yourself your entire adult life,” she says.

Adding to the pressure, you’re making this transition while “taking care

of a little human who might not be sleeping very well.” It’s an “intense

physical and psychological adjustment,” adds Denise Rousseau, a

## professor of organizational behavior and public policy at Carnegie

Mellon University. “You may not feel ready to leave your child,” she

says. Or you may even feel guilty about your decision to go back to work

in the ﬁrst place. “All of this is normal,” of course, but that “doesn’t

make it any less overwhelming.” Reentry is a challenge, and there’s no

perfect path. Have faith “that you will walk it well,” she says, and know

that there are many ways of doing so. Here are some pointers for how to

# navigate those ﬁrst weeks back at work.

# Be gentle with yourself

First things ﬁrst: “Try not to take your emotional temperature in the

ﬁrst two to three weeks” that you’re back on the job, says Dowling. Your

life has changed dramatically. “You will be tired, frustrated, and full of

self-doubt,” she says, maybe even conﬂicted about whether to return to

work or stay at home. Indeed, many people come back from parental

leave and consider quitting. But just because you’re sad or worried now

doesn’t mean you will be forever, she says. “It’s an emotional time.”

Remind yourself that it’s too early “to draw conclusions.” Don’t ignore

your feelings, but bear in mind that, just like the ages and stages of your

new child, this too shall pass. “Don’t be too hard on yourself,” agrees

# Rousseau.

Consider your schedule

Making the transition back to work will “never be easy,” but there are

“a lot of aspects of it that you can manage and plan for,” says Dowling.

Take, for instance, the question of whether you return gradually by

working a couple of days a week or resume full-time work from the get-

go. Not everyone has an option, but if you do, it’s sensible to consider

# the pros and cons of each.

- Easing back in by working part-time at ﬁrst “allows you to learn

how to do the job you did before diﬀerently,” says Rousseau. It removes

some of the pressure of juggling your new home life, and it helps you

focus at work. “You learn to prioritize and concentrate on the things

that move the needle.” When you’re part-time, “you can’t putz around,”

she says. “You have to be discriminating” about the tasks you take on

and how you do them. Be aware, however, that this schedule might

“send a complex message” to your team, says Dowling. “If you’ve

been a guns-blazing professional and you come back to two days a

week, you’re telegraphing — even if you don’t mean to — that you

are no longer working in the same way,” she says. “Your attention and

ambition have shifted.”

- Going back full-time immediately allows you to “resume the

career you had before,” rather than one “with radically reduced

expectations,” says Dowling. It may be harder at ﬁrst, but the beneﬁt is that you’re not “setting the bar diﬀerently” at the outset. Returning

full-time allows you to “go in and do some data gathering and test

things out.” If you need to, you can then “ratchet back.”

Whichever path you choose, Dowling recommends working only two or

three days in your ﬁrst week back on the job. A midweek start allows you

to make the adjustment a little more slowly and ensures that you don’t

have a ﬁve-day stretch of work from the start, which will no doubt feel

# too long.

Do a few practice runs

Returning from parental leave often involves executing on a new set of

complicated logistics. Dowling advises “trying to get ahead of them” as

much as possible to “minimize the sting.” Start with the basics: The ﬁrst

day you go back to work shouldn’t be the ﬁrst day your baby goes to

daycare or stays home with a new nanny. Dowling recommends doing at least a few practice drop-oﬀs or asking your sitter to start a week early.

“Get your child used to the process and accustomed to the caregiver,”

she says. Dry runs will help you, too. “Get up in the morning, take a

shower, put on your work clothes, feed the baby, take her to daycare,

get your Starbucks, and drive to the oﬃce,” she says. “Then literally

turn right back around.” If you’re nursing, try to add a pumping session

or two in there as well. Your goal, says Rousseau, is to get “a realistic

preview” of what to expect.

Be up front with your boss

Maybe not on your ﬁrst day back, but at some point, you need to

have an honest and “up-front conversation” with your boss about the

new realities of your life as they relate to your job, says Dowling.

Acknowledge that the “next few weeks may be bumpy” — your

emotions may be all over the map — but make it clear that “you are

still fully committed to your job and organization.” Think about what

you need from your employer and how to make your new situation

work best for you. Bring up “projects you’d like to be considered for”

and “work travel that you’re willing to do or not do,” Dowling adds.

“You need to proactively own your story; the more you can control,

the better.” Rousseau recommends asking for your boss’s advice and

counsel on how to reenter successfully. Be candid and realistic about

what can be accomplished in your ﬁrst few weeks and months back on

the job. “Talk to your manager about what’s critical versus what’s nice to

have.”

# Set expectations with colleagues

Be mindful of how you manage relationships with colleagues as you

settle into your new work life. A lot of parents return from leave with

the “mindset of ‘I’ll ﬁgure it out’ or ‘I’ll adapt,’” but this is risky, Dowling

says. “If you don’t go in with a clear idea of what your schedule and

plans are, others will make assumptions.” Communication is critical.

Be direct about how and when you will work. Make your schedule

predictable. For instance, “if you need to leave every night at 5 PM on

the dot, then people will know not to come by your oﬃce at 4:59 PM

wanting to talk,” she says. Things may change over time and even on the

ﬂy, of course, but if you “train your colleagues on what to expect” — and

explain your schedule requirements clearly — they will learn how and

when to adjust as needed.

# Seek support

Resuming your professional life is a process — don’t go it alone.

As you make the transition, Dowling advises, seek out support and

encouragement. “Join a mom and dad network,” she says. Look for

an online support community. “Build connections with people in your

neighborhood who also have young children.” Find out if your employer

has resources for new parents. Seek advice from colleagues who’ve been

# through the process.

Be deliberate about your time with your child

As you’re getting back into the swing of work, think about “how you will

spend time with your kids,” Dowling says. Will it be in the morning? In

the evenings? Mostly on weekends? Especially “if you work long hours

or travel,” you need to have a plan for when you’ll have “rewarding time

with your child.” Let your child’s caregiver in on your thinking. Whether

the baby is going to daycare or staying at home with a nanny or family

member, these people are now critical pieces to your professional

puzzle. “Do you want them to send pictures to you while you’re at

work? Will you do FaceTime?” The bottom line is, “Don’t allow your

emotional bond with your child to play second ﬁddle,” Dowling says.

# “Be deliberate.”

Reset your expectations

In those early days of coming back to work, it’s wise to think about how

you can recast yourself professionally. Think about “what makes you special or diﬀerent,” Dowling says. Then consider how to modify those

attributes to suit your new life. “If you were the hardest-working person

in the oﬃce, then maybe you become the most eﬃcient. If you were the

best mentor or project leader, you become the best delegator,” she says.

Your goal is to reset your expectations for yourself. “If you don’t, you

will ﬁnd yourself trying to play a role you can no longer play.” Rousseau

agrees: “You need to be realistic about what you can and should give.”

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Resist taking your emotional temperature during your ﬁrst few weeks

back on the job. Returning to work after parental leave is a process.

- Make your schedule as predictable as possible and communicate your

plans to your colleagues. But understand that adjustments may be

needed along the way.

- Seek out support and encouragement from other parents at work.

# Don’t:

- Make the ﬁrst day you go back to work the ﬁrst day your child goes to a

new caregiver. Do practice runs to get you and your child accustomed

# to the situation.

- Be shy about asking for ﬂexibility if it will help you do your job better.

Speak up for what you need.

- Assume that you will be the same professional you were pre-baby.

Instead, think about how to modify your best attributes to suit your

# new life.

Case Study #1: Redeﬁne your expectations for yourself, and make

adjustments to how you do your job

Three years ago, Ericka DeBruce, the vice president of engagement,

## inclusion, and corporate social responsibility at Sedgwick, a provider of

claims and productivity management products, became a mother.

“I realized going in that life would never be the same, but I still didn’t

know quite what that meant until my son was born,” she says.

She drove her son to daycare on her ﬁrst day back from maternity leave.

“I called my boss in tears from the parking lot,” she says. “I couldn’t

leave. I was very emotional.”

She eventually got used to the drop-oﬀ, but that initial experience

taught her an important lesson. “Now I always recommend to new

moms and dads [on my team] that they do a couple of days of daycare

before they come back.”

Ericka admits that her ﬁrst few months on the job were a struggle. “I

thought I was doing nothing right,” she says. “I felt like I was always

hurrying. I was hurrying to leave work to get back to my baby, and I was

hurrying [my son’s] bedtime routine so that I could get back online to do

work.”

Ericka reﬂected on the situation. Before becoming a mother, she

## thought of herself as ambitious, conscientious, and hardworking. She

was still all of those things, of course, but she realized that the birth of

her son heralded a shift in how she thought about her career goals.

“I thought about what I wanted to accomplish,” she says.

She talked to her boss about where she should focus her eﬀorts and

“areas where I could contribute and add value.”

She also realized she needed to adjust how she did her job and the

parameters she put around work. In a way, she was “setting the bar too

high,” she says. “For the sake of my sanity, I realized that not every

email needed an immediate response. I didn’t need to return a phone

call as soon as I got the voicemail.”

Today Ericka has found a good balance between work and parenthood.

“I realized I needed to redeﬁne the expectations I had for myself [within

the context of] my new normal,” she says.

Case Study #2: Set expectations with others while leaving room for

# ﬂexibility

Courtney Lazzari’s ﬁrst maternity leave in 2014 involved a lot of change.

During her time away, Courtney, a partner at EY, relocated from New

York to Texas, and got promoted to a new role. “I was a new mom in

a new job in a new city. At the time I thought, ‘Let’s make all these

transitions at once,’” she says with a laugh.

As Courtney geared up to return from leave, she thought about what she

wanted to achieve in her new position. She also reﬂected on her identity

at EY. “In New York, [my colleagues] knew me and my work ethic,” she

says. “In Houston, I didn’t have a historical relationship with them. I

wanted to make sure people still thought of me as hardworking. I was

anxious not to be viewed as someone whose priorities had shifted.”

When she returned to work, she had a direct conversation with her

manager to discuss her goals for the job. They also talked about

expectations — both what her boss wanted to see from her and what

she needed from the organization as she adjusted to her life as a mother.

Courtney expressed her commitment to the company and her job. But

she also acknowledged that she needed more ﬂexibility than in the past.

“My one nonnegotiable was that I needed to always be able to take my

son to the doctor — whether it was a planned appointment or if he was

sick. I was up front that I would up and leave whatever I was doing in

order to do that.”

In addition, Courtney talked to her boss about her schedule and how

she would structure her day. Initially, she planned to start her workday

at 7 AM so that she could leave at 3 PM to spend time with her son. She

then planned to log back in at night once he went to bed.

She did this for a while. But Courtney, who has a one-hour commute

each way, soon found that this schedule was not sustainable. Now, “I

work from home two days per week,” she says. “It just gives me more

moments in the day to be a mom.” (She now also has a daughter.)

Still, she’s glad she tried to resume her old schedule because it helped

her recognize that, while it wouldn’t work over the long term, she still
