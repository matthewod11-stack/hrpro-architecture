## Immigrants Play a Disproportionate Role in American Entrepreneurship

Immigration is one of the most divisive and polarizing topics today.

Do immigrants take American jobs, or help our economy grow? Do

immigrants drain our welfare funds, or can they help reﬁll public coﬀers

as our baby boomers retire?

One argument you tend to hear in the immigration debate in the U.S. is

that there is a ﬁxed number of jobs in the economy — and immigrants

just compete for a slice of the pie rather than helping the pie grow.

This perspective is less prevalent when talking about startups, however,

because the rate of entrepreneurship has declined signiﬁcantly in the

U.S. over the last 30 years, and fewer startups are being generated today.

With many places looking to stoke economic growth, state and local

governments have clamored to launch initiatives to attract more

immigrant entrepreneurs, hoping they will found businesses and create

more jobs. Globally, many countries are doing the same — for example,

Chile pays overseas entrepreneurs to come visit for six months through

its Start-Up Chile program, as a way to build global bridges and foster an

# entrepreneurial culture at home.

But to harness immigrant entrepreneurship for better growth and

job creation, we need more hard facts. Good statistics on immigrant entrepreneurship are exceptionally diﬃcult to assemble, and therefore

it’s challenging to create productive policies. Likewise, most standard

government sources that are publicly accessible can only tell us about

immigrant self-employment, which leaves a big question mark around

# job creation and economic growth.

Our recent research aims to address this. We have built a platform that

uses restricted-access Census Bureau datasets to explore diﬀerences

in the types of businesses formed by immigrants and their medium-

term survival and growth patterns. The core building block is the

## Longitudinal Employer-Household Dynamics (LEHD) database, but it

incorporates other sources like the Longitudinal Business Database.

This platform gives us a comprehensive view of immigrant

## entrepreneurship over a long duration (1995 – 2008). The database

currently covers 31 U.S. states, with more being added as their

unemployment insurance (UI) ﬁlings data become available. It spans

ﬁrms of all shapes and sizes, so long as they have one paid employee

or more. For the ﬁrst time, we can analyze a spectrum of companies

## — from “Main Street” businesses to VC-backed Silicon Valley ﬁrms. We

can see what happens to these ﬁrms after they have been founded,

and whether, for example, immigrant-founded ﬁrms perform diﬀerently

# from the start-ups of natives.

Here are some key ﬁndings:

- 1. Immigrants constitute 15% of the general U.S. workforce, but they

account for around a quarter of U.S. entrepreneurs (which we deﬁne as

the top three initial earners in a new business). This is comparable to

what we see in innovation and patent ﬁlings, where immigrants also

## account for about a quarter of U.S. inventors.

## The ﬁgure below shows that this immigrant share of entrepreneurship

has been increasing dramatically since the mid-1990s, when the

immigrant share of founders was closer to 17%. This rise in immigrant

contributions to entrepreneurship is sharper than the rise in the

immigrant share of all employees in new ﬁrms. You can also see that, in

total, 35%-40% of new ﬁrms have at least one immigrant entrepreneur

connected to the ﬁrm’s creation.

- 2. Many discussions around immigration and entrepreneurship focus

on startups backed by venture capital ﬁrms and entrepreneurs seeking

high-growth opportunities that could result in the next Starbucks,

Facebook, or Staples. We have merged in data on the ﬁrms backed by

VC ﬁnancing. On the whole, immigrant entrepreneurship is somewhat

stronger for VC-backed ﬁrms, with 31% of VC-backed founders being

immigrants, compared to 25% of all entrepreneurs in 2005.

- 3. Immigrant founders launch ﬁrms that are smaller than native-

founded ﬁrms. The average initial employment for ﬁrms founded by

immigrants exclusively is 4.4 workers, compared to 7.0 workers for

ﬁrms launched exclusively by natives. When both types of founders are

present (i.e., “mixed founder team”), the average is 16.9 workers.

- 4. We quantify subsequent ﬁrm performance by analyzing employment

growth and closure rates. The ﬁrms founded by immigrants close at a

faster rate than ﬁrms founded by natives, but those that survive do grow

## at a faster rate in terms of employment, payroll, and establishments for

the next six years. Previous research has found that this phenomenon —

called “up or out” — is how young ﬁrms create more jobs. Compared to

older ﬁrms, which show modest growth regardless of their size, young

ﬁrms and new entrants have more dynamic patterns that foster greater

job creation. Immigrant-founded ﬁrms display more of this behavior.

We are still in the process of uncovering why. We have identiﬁed

that the choices made by immigrants with respect to industry and

geographic location are an important part of the story—that is,

immigrants choose settings with heightened “up or out” dynamics.

But we don’t yet know whether this is due to greater risk tolerance

by immigrants, better skills and ethnic social networks for navigating

these settings, pure coincidence (i.e., immigrant happen to be arriving

in cities that are very dynamic), or something else.

If we use statistical methods to control for the location and industry of where a company is started, immigrant entrepreneurs are more likely

to survive than their native peers, but they’re only modestly more

likely to experience employment growth, and their payroll growth is

slower than that of native-founded ﬁrms. Thus, much of the growth and

volatility properties of immigrant ﬁrms result from where they decide

to found their companies. Among VC-backed start-ups, immigrant and

native entrepreneurs do not show meaningful diﬀerences in terms of

# our growth metrics.

- 5. We are just starting to be able to separate types of immigrant —

e.g., those coming to the U.S. as children versus adults, those initially

working in large companies versus in universities versus in startups.

This will vastly improve policy making, which has so far suﬀered from

having too little information to work with. For instance, let’s look at

Sergey Brin, who is frequently used as an example to advocate for

expansion of H-1B visas under the assumption that this would boost

American high-tech entrepreneurship. There are several problems with

the argument, one of which being that H-1B visas are mostly issued

to skilled employees working in large ﬁrms, which means that any

entrepreneurial stimulus would come with a time lag. Further, Brin

came to the U.S. as a child, and is thus not representative of adult skilled

# migrants under H-1B.

Now that we can study the age of arrival, we found that immigrants

coming to the U.S. as children are more likely to start larger ﬁrms than

immigrants arriving as adults. Moreover, ﬁrms created by immigrants

who have grown up in the U.S. are generally associated with better

## outcomes, in terms of lower closure rates and higher representation

among larger ﬁrms. Much remains to be done here, but we hope this

## serves a spring board to the study of other migrant traits.

We are by no means near the ﬁnish line at understanding the causes and

eﬀects of increasing immigrant entrepreneurship. We don’t yet know,

for example, what share of hiring created by immigrant-founded ﬁrms

ﬂows to natives or to other immigrants. But hopefully many more pieces

can emerge in time for future debates about immigration.

Global talent ﬂows will continue to be a fundamental force shaping

the U.S. economic and business landscape. This is especially true for

entrepreneurship given the economic dynamism that startups unleash

## and the disproportionate role of immigrants in this process.
