Leading through volatility is now the most in-demand skill at U.S.

companies (topping AI ﬂuency), according to dozens of senior human

resources executives I polled recently at Fortune 100 companies from an

array of industries, including healthcare, sales, ﬁnance, food service,

manufacturing, tech, and biotech. The demand has been driven by

## recent spikes in global uncertainty, technological disruption, and

# economic instability.

## HBR / Digital Article / Lessons from U.S. Army Special Ops on Becoming a Leader

But in this unpredictable new world, organizations are falling short

at training people how to lead. The $50 billion executive education

sector—as Warren Bennis ﬁrst pointed out in his 1961 HBR article “A

Revisionist Theory of Leadership”—has tended to conﬂate leadership

with management. As a result, executive education is good at helping

people improve management skills such as accounting, active listening,

and data-driven decision making. Yet it hasn’t developed a comparably

rich curriculum for cultivating initiative, strategic vision, and the other

skills needed to lead in volatility.

There is one organization, however, that has spent more than seven

decades creating exactly that curriculum. The U.S. Army Special

Operations has taught tens of thousands of soldiers who excel at

managerial tasks (such as maintaining standards and optimizing

operations) to successfully take on leadership tasks (such as seizing

opportunities and launching innovations). It has done so by creating

training pipelines, centered at the JFK Special Warfare Center and

## School, in North Carolina, that guide recruits through rigorously

assessed experiential-learning exercises.

Those exercises have never been incorporated into business school

or private education coursework—partly because they’re secret, but

also because they’re extremely specialized, relying on tasks and

environments particular to elite combat units. Over the past four

years, however, my lab at Ohio State has worked with the Army to

convert its Special Ops curriculum into a general method of leadership

training that has been transferred into the Medical Corps, the Corps of

## Engineers, Logistics, Military Intelligence, and other Army sectors. And

with the help of Army Special Operators, my lab has also translated the

method into business settings, transitioning managers into leaders at

## companies of all sizes in a variety of industries.

In this article, I’ll describe how you can develop leadership like Special

Ops. First, I’ll explain what distinguishes the Special Ops curriculum

## from traditional executive education: namely, experiential exercises

that coach the brain to learn from failure. Next, I’ll share what Special

Ops has identiﬁed as the four main reasons for leadership failure—and

how to correct them. Finally, I’ll lay out a “Simulated Failure” exercise

for scaling Special Ops training across your organization, equipping

every manager to lead in volatility.

# How Special Ops Trains Leadership

According to internal Army assessments, recruits who completed

Special Ops training between 2005 and 2020 had a leadership success

rate of more than 90%. That success was measured on multiple scales,

including:

- Integrity

- Mental agility

- Sound judgment

- Innovation

- Leads by example

- Develops others

- Gets results (deﬁned as “developing and executing plans while

providing direction, guidance, and clear priorities towards mission

# accomplishment”)

Why was the training so eﬀective? Special Ops lacked a satisfactory

theory—and seeking one, they contacted my lab in 2021. During the

next three years we worked closely with the Army, guided by, among

others, Lieutenant Colonel Tom Gaines (Special Operations Command),

## Lieutenant Colonel Christopher J. Haviley (JFK Special Warfare Center

## and School), Sergeant Major Matt Jackson (Special Operations), and Dr.

# Brittany Loney (Special Operations).

## HBR / Digital Article / Lessons from U.S. Army Special Ops on Becoming a Leader

Together, we determined that Army Special Ops curriculum diﬀers from

## current business leadership training in two key ways: technique and

# focus.

# Technique

Special Ops training goes beyond classroom reﬂections on case studies

and conceptual frameworks. Instead, it provides controlled exercises

in failure that give students the experience of learning from simulated

failures based on stressful real-world leadership situations, such as:

- The sudden loss of critical resources or infrastructure

- Fresh information that fundamentally contradicts prior datapoints

- Major transitions in senior personnel

- The abrupt failure of long-established procedures or strategies

- Aggressively innovative competitors

- Compelling new ideas that may be transformational opportunities or

# dangerous boondoggles.

These situations are collectively deﬁned by an Army coinage that is

also common in the business world: VUCA (Volatility, Uncertainty,

# Complexity, Ambiguity).

# Focus

Special Ops doesn’t equate leadership with inﬂuence. Inﬂuence is the

capacity to organize and direct the behavior of others, making it the

foundation of what business schools and consultancies refer to as

## transformational leadership (along with other styles of leadership).

Special Ops has found, however, that leadership requires mental

skills that precede inﬂuence. “Inﬂuence is a management task,” one

operator told me. “Before you can exert inﬂuence, or perform any other

management task that organizes a team to do something, a leader needs

to ﬁgure out what something the team should do.”

## HBR / Digital Article / Lessons from U.S. Army Special Ops on Becoming a Leader

The fundamental characteristic of a leader is, in short, the ability to

respond to new situations with new plans. New plans don’t have a

formula, of course; that’s why they’re new. But when a leadership failure

occurs, it’s typically for one of four reasons.

## The Four Reasons for Leadership Failure—and How to Address Them

As Special Ops has learned from years of leading in VUCA, new

plans are launched by initiative, sustained by emotional conﬁdence,

multiplied by imagination, and focused by strategic vision. If leadership

breaks down, the root cause is thus usually a failure in one of these four

# processes.

## Within business settings, failures of initiative and emotional conﬁdence

are more prevalent in managers who are new to leadership tasks;

failures of imagination and strategic vision are more prevalent in

managers on the cusp of being promoted to an executive level.

Here’s how to diagnose and ﬁx these failures.

- 1. Failure of Initiative

- Special Ops Name: The Fear Box

- Diagnostic Indicators: Blank mind, freezing, submissiveness,

# helplessness

- Root Cause: A leader has no plan for dealing with a situation

VUCA causes stress, which activates the brain’s threat response, aka

ﬁght-or-ﬂight, triggering fear. Fear evolved because the brain has

learned, from millions of years of grappling with volatility, that

planning must accelerate to match the rate of change. If you can’t spin

up your planning fast enough, fear therefore intercedes to provide its

own plan, which is typically either to escape the situation or to copy

what people around you are doing, solving the problem of no plan by

borrowing a plan from others. This is why fear makes us vulnerable to

# outside inﬂuence.

Solution 1: Make a “hasty plan.” In combat, Special Operators exit fear

by making a hasty plan, which is the quickest ﬁrst step they can take

toward a target. That ﬁrst step gets the brain’s planning mechanisms

moving, gathering impetus to meet the pace of events.

You can practice this in a business setting by using a quiet moment

to write down a concrete near-term goal, like communicating better to

your team, or reaching out to new clients. The next time you hit VUCA

at work, ask yourself: Given this unexpected situation, what simple

action can I still take to advance my goal? Take that action immediately.

Once you have your brain engaged in active planning, shift focus onto

the situation itself, engaging leadership skills such as imagination and

strategic vision (discussed later in this article).

Solution 2: Choose your own advisor. Start by identifying a leader

you respect and research how they handled a challenging leadership

situation. For example, you could read their memoirs or interview them

# in person.

When you encounter challenges in your own life, ask yourself: What

would that leader do? This process shifts your brain’s attention from its

personal stress onto an outside possibility, encouraging mental motion.

In VUCA, if you can’t imagine what your chosen leader would do, call on

a nearby colleague to give you advice. Even though the advice is theirs,

the choice of whom to call is yours, so this technique is a quick way

for you to get your planning motor going. Remember: You don’t have

to take the person’s advice—your purpose in soliciting it is to kick your

own planning into drive, leaving fear behind. So, if the advice prompts

you to think of a diﬀerent plan, go in your own direction.

Key Takeaway: Initiative gets you out of the Fear Box by providing what

# fear wants—a plan.

- 2. Failure of Emotional Conﬁdence

- Special Ops Name: Flashback Quit

- Diagnostic Indicators: Hesitation, self-doubt, unproductive anxiety,

# shame

- Root Cause: A leader has a plan—but lacks conﬁdence to try it

Hesitation is a learned behavior. It’s triggered by memories of failure

(or perceived failure) that suﬀuse the brain with shame. Shame makes

you think: I am useless. And when past shame surfaces in the present, it

makes you think: Here we go again. I am going to mess this up, just like I

did before.

Shame isn’t inherently bad; it evolved to prompt us to learn from

our missteps. But shame is so psychologically powerful that it can be

## counterproductive in VUCA, especially for young leaders.

Solution 1: Emotion reset. To brace your conﬁdence against

unexpected shocks, recall an occasion when you responded eﬀectively

to an instance of volatility or uncertainty. Prime the memory in your

brain by writing down everything you remember about the event,

vividly visualizing each detail, including every step of your response

## plan. This process outﬁts your brain with a positive ﬂashback to

counter negative ﬂashbacks you might experience during a leadership

# challenge.

When you encounter VUCA, before you do anything else, take a moment

to recall your positive memory, activating conﬁdence in your brain. This

technique is used by Special Operators during combat. In trials run by

my lab on corporate managers, it produced substantially less hesitation

# during leadership challenges.

Solution 2: Eat your demons. Review your past for moments of failure

that prompt strong feelings of shame. Assign each moment to one of two

# buckets:

- Room for personal improvement. Shame goes in this bucket if you

reﬂect on the moment and think, I could have done better. Make a plan

for what you should have done instead and commit to executing it next

# time.

- Other people judged wrong. Shame goes in this bucket if you realize

that other people wrongly criticized you for an appropriate action. Fﬃrm yourself for doing what was right, reminding yourself that

leaders walk independent from the crowd.

By proactively reviewing these moments, you’ll reduce the likelihood

that they’ll resurface during your next leadership challenge. You’ll also

gain strength from shame, turning it from hindrance into sustenance.

Key Takeaway: The brain believes its memories of success because it

has lived them, so by strengthening those memories in advance, you

equip yourself with the emotional conﬁdence to overcome Flashback

# Quit.

- 3. Failure of Imagination

- Special Ops Name: Captain Rightman

- Diagnostic Indicators: Anger, irritation, impatience, evading

# responsibility

- Root Cause: A leader has a plan—but only one plan

Anger is fear’s partner. In the brain’s threat response, it is the ﬁght.

Fight isn’t bad; leaders beneﬁt from hanging tough in VUCA. Anger,

however, is almost always a sign of a leadership failure.

When the brain has only one plan, anger thinks, I need to push this

plan forward with everything I’ve got, because my only other option is

fear. Unless you happen to be in a life-and-death emergency with zero

seconds to spare, anger is the wrong approach.

Your other option is to take a moment to create a second plan. A second

plan gives you operational ﬂexibility, ensuring that if your ﬁrst plan

breaks, you can maintain initiative. This calms your brain, allowing you

to act assertively without shouting, bullying, or burning out your team.

Solution 1: Develop the planner, not the plan. The purpose of

planning isn’t to develop a plan. It’s to develop the planner. No plan,

regardless how brilliant or evidence-based, survives contact with reality

—but a good planner can always exploit the future’s unexpected twists.

Become that planner by proactively planning and replanning: Create

detailed plans for potential futures, make contingency plans for

currently optimal operations, and devise counterfactual plans for past

initiatives that could have worked better.

If you ever grow emotionally attached to a plan, remember that

whenever new crises or opportunities appear, good leaders throw out

the plans they’ve made, knowing that the real purpose of making those

plans was prepare the brain to create better plans now.

Solution 2: Go beyond probabilities into possibilities. Probabilities

are events that can be statistically quantiﬁed because they’ve occurred

multiple times before. Possibilities are events that could happen but

never have. When the brain focuses on probabilities, it starts to believe

that there’s one best plan; when the brain focuses on possibilities, it

perceives that there can be many viable paths to success.

To shift yourself into thinking in possibilities, imagine the

## mainstreaming of a near-future technology—stem-cell therapies that

can reverse aging, perhaps, or highways that can wirelessly charge

electric vehicles while driving. This disrupts your priors, encouraging

you to exit probability.

Then ask yourself: What initiatives could my organization launch to

take advantage of this tech revolution? After you’ve used sci ﬁ to open

up your mind to fresh possibilities, you’ll be primed to mull more

immediate questions: What never-before events could occur at work

# today? Tomorrow? Next week?

Key Takeaway: By increasing possible plans, imagination eliminates

the inﬂexibility that produces Captain Rightman’s anger, frustration,

# and intolerance.

- 4. Failure of Strategic Vision

- Special Ops Name: The Headless General

- Diagnostic Indicators: Disorganization, contradictory directives,

excessive attention to minor details, self-pity.

- Root Cause: A leader has multiple plans—yet lacks a global objective.

Disorganization occurs when you’re better at tactics than at strategy

—in other words, when you’re a creative problem-solver but haven’t

developed the ability to prioritize a single long-term goal.

Lacking that goal, your attention wanders in response to short-term

challenges and opportunities. You issue contradictory directives. You

troubleshoot reactively rather than leading with drive. You become so

focused on what’s happening now that you start believing that you’re

necessary for everything, falling into megalomania, micromanagement,

# and self-pity.

Solution 1: Target victory. List all the successes you want your

organization to achieve over the next ﬁve years. Then identify a single

ambitious goal that, if you hit it, will enable you to achieve most (even

all) of those successes. That goal is your deﬁnition of victory.

Victory is bold and speciﬁc—a precise target that is hard but possible

to attain. When leaders fail to deﬁne victory, it’s usually because their

target is either bold but not speciﬁc (Double proﬁts in four years) or

# speciﬁc but not bold (Update product X).

A deﬁned victory, by contrast, is bold and speciﬁc: Develop the ﬁrst

tumor-agnostic cancer drug (Merck); build a personal computer that

actually feels personal (Apple); put a man on the moon (NASA). Keep

victory top of mind whenever you encounter VUCA, and you can fully

engage tactical creativity without losing strategic direction.

## Solution 2: Distinguish familiar stress from new stress. When

projects hitch or fall behind schedule, stress increases, prompting

leaders to leap into action. But this leap can be an overreaction that

introduces confusion into operations, adding to the problem instead of

alleviating it.

To avoid overreaction, analyze your stress, determining whether it’s

familiar or new. Familiar stress is caused by problems that have

occurred before; new stress by problems that haven’t. New stress can

only be resolved by new plans, which are your responsibility as a leader;

familiar stress can be resolved by employing the solution that worked

last time, which is what managers are there for. So only get involved

when stress is new. If the stress is familiar, ignore the problem and trust

your managers to handle it, keeping your focus on your organization’s

# long-term strategy.

Key Takeaway: By providing a bold but speciﬁc target that focuses

planning during VUCA, strategic vision preempts the chaotic meddling

# of the Headless General.

# Develop a Leadership Readiness Program

Once you know the four reasons for leadership failure, you can learn

more eﬀectively from experience, you can review your past leadership

missteps to remedy their root causes, and you can adapt faster when

VUCA interrupts existing plans.

And your own personal development is just the beginning. Like

Special Ops, you can scale the training, providing it to managers

across your organization. That’s because you don’t need to sit around

waiting for VUCA to strike. You can simulate failure in a learning

environment, averting real-life calamities and proactively creating

leaders, by developing what Special Ops calls a leadership readiness

program. Here’s how:

# Recruit cadre.

Cadre are members of your organization who have two years or more

## of experience in senior leadership roles (the equivalent of VP level or

above), have been involved in at least one successful major initiative,

and have weathered at least one serious crisis. It’s the cadre’s job to plan

and execute the training, and to counsel and assess the students.

They can be retired—in fact, recently retired leaders often make the best

cadre. You must have at least two cadre in any training, so that students

can be provided with at least two perspectives. A good ratio of cadre to

students is 1:5.

## HBR / Digital Article / Lessons from U.S. Army Special Ops on Becoming a Leader

Create a catalogue of training scenarios.

Convene cadre to write down every serious leadership crisis or

opportunity that they have experienced or witnessed. This might

involve any number of situations: a failed initiative; a major merger;

a disruptive competitor; new regulations; big market shifts; systemic

## supply chain problems; a promising new product or service; the loss of

## a major client; the departure of a key leader; conﬂict between essential

## personnel; a budgetary surplus; a fatal accident; discovery of internal

## fraud; a longshot research possibility; a PR disaster.

After your cadre have compiled a list of past scenarios, have them

imagine a list of potential near-future scenarios your organization

might realistically face. Each scenario (past and near-future) should be

short enough to be presented on a single 3×5 notecard or PowerPoint

slide. It doesn’t need to contain all the information about the situation.

In fact, it’s better if it contains very little information, since leadership

situations are murky and change fast. Speciﬁc details can be provided

(or improvised) by cadre during training.

The goal is not to hand students a logically designed puzzle with an

elegant optimum solution. It is to elicit psychological stress, giving

students the opportunity to generate new plans under pressure. This

means that there should never be one right answer to a scenario.

Instead, every scenario should provide students with the experience of

doing what leaders do: Inventing and testing possible plans in ongoing

# uncertainty and volatility.

Examples of eﬀective training scenarios include:

- You’ve just lost your biggest client to your biggest competitor, reducing

annual revenue by 10%. What’s your next move?

- Your division is projected to double its proﬁts over the next three years.

What do you do with the additional capital?

## HBR / Digital Article / Lessons from U.S. Army Special Ops on Becoming a Leader

- Due to a recent acquisition, 10% of your senior managers now

have fewer than three direct reports. What do you do about your

# organizational structure?

- Legacy sales are holding steady but no one is buying your new product

line. What’s your strategy?

You should have 20 of these kinds of scenarios to run the program,

but more is always better, because a large catalogue of varied scenarios

increases the experience of VUCA. Each time the program is repeated,

take the opportunity to expand and refresh the catalogue with new

# scenarios.

# Enroll students.

Invite managers across your organization to enroll as students in

a leadership-readiness program. The invitation should be inclusive,

because leaders can come from all ranks and any sector. Enrollment

must be voluntary, because the ﬁrst step in becoming a leader is to

choose to take the step. If you notice that parts of your organization

are underrepresented or that a manager with leadership potential is not

volunteering, ask a cadre member to encourage participation.

# Run a Simulated Failure Exercise

Now that you’ve got students, cadre, and a catalogue of training

exercises, you’re ready to simulate failure.

## In the center of a midsize room, preferably without windows, place a

table. At the table, seat two to ﬁve cadre. (More cadre are better, if you

have them.) Behind the cadre, convene a seated audience. The audience

does not need to be large but it should be emotionally signiﬁcant

to the students. It might contain members of their peer group,

respected senior members of the organization, previous graduates of the

## leadership-readiness program, or even personal friends and family. The

audience’s main purpose is to increase the psychological pressure on

the student. (Its minor purpose is to provide an outside perspective on

the training, so that cadre can get feedback on their own performance.)

If possible, add ambient distractors, such as screens tuned to diﬀerent

# newsfeeds.

Invite a student to enter the room. Have them face the cadre. Inform the

student that they can choose to end the exercise at any time, without

stigma. Tell them that leaders all experience failure, which is honored

here as an opportunity to develop strength and wisdom.

Present the student with a training scenario. To provide verisimilitude

and emotional grip, the scenario should be tailored on the spot by

cadre to the student’s speciﬁc experience and organizational role. For

example, cadre could tailor the scenario: “You have just lost [speciﬁc

member of your team] to [speciﬁc competitor].” Or: “You have just

discovered that [speciﬁc product] has been downloaded twice as many

times as projected, doubling revenue.”

Once the student has been presented with the scenario, invite them

to propose a plan. Then have the cadre challenge it. Cadre should

not challenge the plan by presenting hypothetical objections. Instead,

cadre should directly inform the student: Your plan has resulted in [this

negative outcome]. For example, if a student proposes using a budget

surplus to hire more salesforce, cadre could inform the student that the

new hires did not increase sales enough to cover the salary expenditure.

Cadre should be speciﬁc about the negative outcome. For example, if

the student says, “I would then eliminate the new sales positions,” cadre

could say, “That created a crisis of conﬁdence in the remaining sales

team, and your top two salespeople [X and Y] resigned.”

The purpose of the cadre’s challenges is to diagnose how the student

responds to pressurized open-ended situations. Eﬀective leadership is

indicated by the ability to respond promptly to all challenges with new

and potentially viable plans, demonstrating that the student possesses

the four leadership skills discussed above: initiative, emotional

conﬁdence, imagination, and strategic vision. If a student displays

eﬀective leadership during the ﬁrst scenario, provide them with another

scenario. If the student succeeds again, provide them with a third.

If cadre challenge the student with multiple speciﬁc negative outcomes,

and if the three scenarios are materially distinct, the student will

usually experience a failure. However, in the event that the student

succeeds at three scenarios, congratulate them on displaying eﬀective

leadership. When this occurs, the student should be provided a

leadership opportunity within your organization, whether in an existing

# role or on a startup project.

If, instead, the student displays helplessness, hesitation, irritation,

## disorganization, or one of the other diagnostic indicators of leadership

failure (see “The Four Reasons” above), stop the exercise immediately.

Congratulate the student on pushing themselves to failure. Then ask the

student to go to another room and perform a “hot wash” in which they

write down everything they can remember about the exercise, including

## the scenario, the cadre’s challenges, and their own responses.

The following day, have the student meet with cadre to review the

hot wash. The review’s purpose is to pinpoint the root cause of the

leadership failure, helping the student identify which leadership skill—

## initiative, emotional conﬁdence, imagination, or strategic vision—they

should develop next.

To protect student wellbeing, this exercise contains multiple

## safeguards: the voluntary nature of participation, the emphasis on

failure as a good, the multiple cadre to check each other, the

audience there to monitor the cadre. But as an additional measure, an

experienced HR professional can be on hand to reject unreasonable

cadre challenges and to interrupt the exercise promptly if students

# display helplessness or shame.

To ensure that training is student-centered, cadre should remember:

although the exercise’s immediate purpose is to challenge students,

its ultimate purpose is to create leaders. When a student produces

a plan that contradicts what cadre would have done, cadre should

resist the urge to criticize or correct the student. Instead, cadre should

disinterestedly consider whether the plan is feasible. If it is, cadre

should congratulate the student for doing something smart that they

wouldn’t have done. This technique fosters leaders, because leadership

is, at root, acting intelligently—and independently.

# Next Steps

Leadership skills are strengthened through practice. That practice can

take place during simulated failure exercises. (Two exercises a year is

an eﬀective tempo for most organizations.) But it can also be organic to

the workday. To engage in workday practice, managers should monitor

## themselves for anger, shame, and the other diagnostic indicators of

leadership failure—then employ a recommended Special Ops solution

## (like “Make a Hasty Plan” or “Target Victory”).

If managers struggle with stress during training, here’s a Special Ops

tip: Have gratitude for crisis, chaos, broken plans, nasty surprises,

missed objectives, unreasonable expectations, team conﬂict, friendly ﬁre,

and the other progeny of volatility. They’re providing an opportunity

to lead, handing you the chance to create a better future. This

## mental shift inhibits rumination, exasperation, resentment, and other

counterproductive psychological responses to stress.

## HBR / Digital Article / Lessons from U.S. Army Special Ops on Becoming a Leader

The stress-enriched training of Special Ops might seem unsuitable for

executive education. But real-life business is saturated with powerful

stressors, and there’s no more eﬀective way to prepare the brain than

through simulated failures punctuated with supportive coaching. In

a world where VUCA is inevitable, better to learn its psychological

pressures via structured exercises than to be suddenly forced to sink

Volatility and uncertainty can strike at any moment without warning.

To prepare themselves for that moment, aspiring leaders must develop

## the initiative, emotional conﬁdence, imagination, and strategic vision

to create new plans. These leadership skills are all best cultivated via

Leadership and management are complementary skills: Once you

create the future, you want to guide others to join you. That’s a job

that a century’s worth of management theory can help you with. In

VUCA, however, that job comes second. To adapt a Special Ops adage:

Managers can exploit the peace, but only if leaders have ﬁrst won the
