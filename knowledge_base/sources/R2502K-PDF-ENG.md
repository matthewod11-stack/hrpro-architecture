The Uniqueness Trap Your project isn’t one of a kind, and that’s a good thing because it means you can learn from others how to manage it better. by Bent Flyvbjerg, Alexander Budzier, M.D. Christodoulou, and M. Zottoli

Uniqueness bias is what psychologists call the tendency individuals

have to think they’re more unusual than they actually are. In the ﬁeld

of project management, it manifests itself as the belief that projects are

one of a kind. This is partly a conscious choice, stemming from the view

that when something is presented as unique and new, it’s more likely to

attract support and funding. But the bias is also deeply entrenched in

## the project management profession and the literature about it. The U.S.-

based Project Management Institute, for example, deﬁnes a project as

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Uniqueness Trap

“a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product, service,

or result.” The UK-based Association for Project Management deﬁnes a

project similarly, as a “unique, transient endeavour.” The very ﬁrst study

of projects as a management problem identiﬁed their ﬁnite duration

as a “unique aspect of the project manager’s job.” And in his classic

## book Development Projects Observed, Albert O. Hirschman concluded

that each project he had studied represented “a unique constellation of

# experiences and consequences.”

To ﬁnd out how distinctive most projects actually are, we analyzed data

on more than 1,300 IT projects in 34 companies, which had budgets

ranging from $77,000 to $4.5 billion. We then took a deep dive into

219 of them, which were located in North America, Europe, the Middle

East, Africa, Asia, and Australasia, to see whether managers believed

that their projects were unique and how that perception aﬀected project

# performance.

What we found was sobering. Our analysis suggested that managers

are indeed highly prone to believing that their projects are one of a

kind even though few, if any, actually are. This causes them to think

they have nothing to learn from other projects. Most important, it

leads them to underestimate risk and overestimate opportunity and

thus make poor decisions. Speciﬁcally, the more distinctive managers

consider a project to be, the more likely it is to exceed its budget

and the more likely the overrun is to be considerable. That led us to

the conclusion that improving project performance has less to do with

managing the activities involved and more to do with addressing how

project managers make decisions.

In this article we’ll look ﬁrst at the relationship between perceived

uniqueness and performance outcomes and show how little grounding

the perception of uniqueness has in reality. Then we’ll oﬀer a theory

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Uniqueness Trap

## about why uniqueness bias occurs and conclude with some advice on

how managers can ﬁght against it.

# The Cost of Uniqueness Bias

To quantify the eﬀect of perceived uniqueness on projects, we asked the

managers of each of the 219 projects in our sample to indicate, on a scale

of one to 10, how much they agreed with the statement “This project is unique, and therefore it is diﬃcult to compare with other projects.”

Twenty-seven percent gave their project a score of seven or higher.

Next we tested the association between perceived uniqueness and

performance, which we assessed by measuring the beneﬁts delivered

and cost and schedule overruns. The results supported our hypothesis

that project leaders’ view of projects as unique was correlated with

underperformance. We found that a one-point increase on the 10-point

scale was associated, on average, with a ﬁve-percentage-point increase

in cost overruns. That meant that in projects receiving the highest

rating—a 10—cost overruns were 45 percentage points higher, on

average, than overruns in projects receiving the lowest rating (a one).

Worryingly, in 37% of the projects rated a 10, the cost overrun was

extreme—exceeding the budget by more than 75%.

It should be noted that the above conclusions are based on perceived

uniqueness. As we discovered, the perceptions didn’t necessarily match

# reality.

# Do Unique Projects Actually Exist?

The short answer is no. In fact, whenever we came across a project we

thought was unique, it turned out not to be.

Here’s an example: In 2004 the top civil servant in charge of

decommissioning nuclear power plants in Sweden needed a reliable

estimate of how much that eﬀort, which would take decades, would

cost, as well as how expensive it would be to safely store nuclear waste,

which would last centuries. The Swedish government was going to ask

the nuclear industry to pay into a fund to cover the costs, and it needed

to know how much to collect.

The Swedish oﬃcial approached one of us, Bent Flyvbjerg, for advice.

Bent didn’t think he could help. At the time he didn’t have any data

on nuclear decommissioning. No other country had carried out such a

program. (Decommissioning nuclear plants has become more common since then.) The project truly did seem unique. But the Swedish oﬃcial

had read an article Bent had written about the costs and cost risks for

transportation infrastructure projects involving roads, bridges, tunnels,

and rail lines. He proposed using Bent’s data as a “ﬂoor” and assuming

that the real cost risks of nuclear decommissioning would be higher.

The Swedish government could get the nuclear industry to start making

payments based on the ﬂoor and then adjust the estimate and the

payments as it learned more about decommissioning. Bent realized that

he had fallen into the uniqueness trap by assuming that the manager

of a project as unprecedented as nuclear decommissioning would have

nothing to learn from other projects. He has never forgotten that lesson.

# projects in another, larger database. We

found that with all 59 projects, including

those rated a nine or a 10, a similar project

had, in fact, previously been executed in

# the same organization or the same

# industry. In other words, none of the

projects could be considered unique. For

example, ﬁve of the 59 projects were

regulatory-compliance projects in banks. We established not only that

each of the banks in question had completed similar regulatory eﬀorts

before but also that every other bank in its relevant jurisdiction was

working to address the same type of regulation at the same time.

On that basis we concluded that many more projects are perceived as

unique than actually are and that perceived and actual uniqueness are

not correlated. We also found that perceived uniqueness is what matters

to project performance, because when managers think there is nothing

to learn from other endeavors, the lack of learning will hamper their

# projects.

# How Uniqueness Bias Happens

Our study suggests that the bias is linked to certain project features.

Perceived uniqueness was generally correlated with a project’s

complexity, its political sensitivity, its number of unknown variables,

and the extent to which its requirements shifted. But none of those

characteristics had a statistically signiﬁcant eﬀect on their own, which

implied that they could not by themselves explain extreme cost

overruns. From a statistical perspective, the uniqueness bias was the

cause of the overruns, and despite the correlations, it was not rooted in a

## project’s complexity, sensitivity, uncertainty, or requirements.

So where did the bias come from? One strong possibility is that it

resulted from the tendency to assume that what’s unique to you will

be unique to everyone. For instance, California has never built a high-

speed rail line before, so in that sense, the recent eﬀorts to construct

one between Los Angeles and San Francisco may be considered unique.

But there are plenty of precedents outside California: Dozens of similar

rail projects have been built around the world, with data and lessons

learned that would be highly valuable to California for assessing

costs, schedules, contracting relationships, procurement, revenues, and

# environmental impact.

The cure for uniqueness bias is to always assume that someone, somewhere has undertaken a project like yours, adopting what’s called an “outside view.”

Our research appears to conﬁrm that people are more likely to believe

that a project is unique if they have no personal experience of anything similar. Consider what happened with the chief information oﬃcer of

one large global logistics company that participated in our study. When

we debriefed the company about its results, the CIO spotted a project

described by his managers as absolutely unique, scoring a 10 on our

scale. When the CIO asked which project it was, he learned that it

was the installation of a standard software package for supply chain

and warehouse automation in the Czech Republic. That surprised him

because the company had installed this package for clients in nearly

1,000 other locations. He phoned the Czech project manager on the spot

to ﬁnd out what was going on. The manager explained that the project

was unique because it was the ﬁrst time that this software would be

used in the Czech Republic.

## The uniqueness trap feeds into what the Nobel laureate Daniel

Kahneman called the “inside view.” When managers fall into it, they

will fail to gather data and proven insights that could help them and

will build budgets and schedules based only on their own beliefs and

personal experiences. That can be risky: Plenty of behavioral research

shows that when decision-makers do this, they tend to underestimate

## not only average risk but also the probability of rare, catastrophic

outcomes. Another Nobel laureate, Richard Feynman, famously found

that this was precisely what happened in the Challenger space shuttle

## disaster: The inside view of ﬂight risk at NASA, especially among

its top managers, was so narrow that it caused the agency to wildly

underestimate the chances of an explosion, resulting in the tragic loss of

## the shuttle with all seven astronauts aboard.

# Take an Outside View

The cure for uniqueness bias is to always assume that someone,

somewhere has undertaken a project like yours, adopting what

Kahneman called the “outside view.” Before you start putting your

project together, therefore, ask other people in your company if they’ve

seen anything like it before, because chances are that, as we just

saw with the logistics ﬁrm, someone in your organization has done

# something comparable.

If you can’t ﬁnd any direct analogues, break the project down into

modules and subprocesses, which may then prove comparable across

projects. One project leader at a major international bank told us that

many of its teams had believed that their projects—especially big IT-

led change programs—were unique, but after disassembling them into

speciﬁc tasks and approaches, they found opportunities to leverage

experiences from other projects. As he explained, “If you’re developing

a run book for a go-live migration, you should talk to people who have

done migrations before. Or if you’re trying to estimate the lead times in

establishing your test environment for a new project, ask other projects

and teams for their experiences with lead times to get an outside view,

and use this to challenge the inside view of your team.”

If you can’t ﬁnd analogues inside your

organization, look further aﬁeld. At a

# McKinsey conference for IT leaders we

attended, a participant whose company

had been involved in the invention and

rollout of mobile texting suggested that it

had truly been a unique project. The leader

explained that it had taken only a few

weeks to develop the SMS app and that no

one on the project or outside it had really

understood what the team had invented.

Adoption was slow at ﬁrst. The project seemed minor. No one could

have predicted the explosion in usage that would follow, and no other

project had set a precedent for it. So mobile texting was unique in that

sense, or so the leader argued, and many of us in the room agreed at

# ﬁrst.

But then others jumped in and suggested that texting was not

unprecedented. A host of communication technologies could be

considered its forerunners, including the telegraph, the radio, the

## telephone, the fax machine, and early versions of today’s internet, such

## as ARPANET. A systematic study of the diﬀusion of these and other

new communication tools would have given the inventors of texting

an idea of the uncertainties and the S-curve growth pattern—with a

slow start and acceleration later—that they were likely to face. Had

anyone thought about that? No, because everyone saw texting as both

unique and unimportant and was therefore not motivated to look for

# similarities.

Once you have found your analogues, be careful about how you process

the information you glean from them. Even when taking an outside

perspective, project managers making forecasts and decisions can fall

prey to other biases that cause them to discount the risks attached.

Fortunately, there are forecasting and risk assessment methods that

help eliminate or reduce biases. The main ones are:

Reference class forecasting. This is a way to predict the future by

looking at what has happened in similar situations. In a project

management context, it involves comparing possible outcomes of your

## project in terms of costs, timeliness, and other performance measures

with how all the similar projects performed on the same measures. In

other words, to assess the probability of a 10% cost overrun in your

project, look at how often a 10% overrun has occurred for the whole

class of comparable projects. This approach was ﬁrst applied in 2004 for

a mass transit project in Scotland, and today it’s used in hundreds, if not

## thousands, of projects across business and government.

## Similarity-based forecasting. A complementary and more focused

## tool bases predictions about the performance of a system or a

## project over time on the past performance of a similar system

operating under comparable conditions. Similarity-based forecasting

helps managers identify unexpected outcomes and variations in actual

operating conditions. It can be applied in many contexts, notably in

macroeconomics, where economists believe that drawing on data from

situations that match your current conditions produces more-accurate

forecasts than relying on a more general dataset.

Premortems. In these exercises participants presume that a particular

outcome will happen and oﬀer an analysis of why it will occur.

For example, before starting a project you might assume that it will

be completed 10 months later than forecast and then explain why.

Premortems entail what behavioral psychologists call “prospective

hindsight,” a concept that began to appear in management literature

in the wake of a groundbreaking 1989 article by Deborah Mitchell,

Edward Russo, and Nancy Pennington. They’re a highly eﬀective

way of surfacing potential problems. The 1989 research suggests that

prospective hindsight can improve decision-making and also make

# people signiﬁcantly more proactive.

## Noise audits. Kahneman, Andrew Rosenﬁeld, Linnea Gandhi, and Tom

Blaser described this technique in the 2016 HBR article “Noise: How

## to Overcome the High, Hidden Cost of Inconsistent Decision Making.”

The idea is that human decision-makers are swayed not only by biases

## but also by “noise”—factors unrelated and irrelevant to the decision

being made. A noise audit helps them measure the eﬀects of those

factors. It involves presenting multiple decision-makers with a set of

similar hypothetical situations and asking them to predict outcomes.

For instance, you might ask a group of judges to predict the sentences

for a set of similar criminal convictions. The objective is to assess how

the predicted sentences of each judge vary across cases as well as how

they vary across the group of judges as a whole. Typically, the noise

level is the standard deviation of predictions across cases and across the

predictors. If it’s high, then the judges need to revisit how they make

sentencing decisions. The tool can be applied to help project managers

identify whether they’re likely to be swayed by irrelevant factors in

making key decisions in, say, purchasing services or hiring.

These methods, and their eﬀectiveness, are well documented in

management literature. Anyone interested in eliminating uniqueness

bias and other preconceptions that distort decision-making—which

is to say, anyone interested in running projects and organizations

successfully—should become versed in them.

. . .

It’s easy to understand why people think their projects are unique.

It stems from what Kahneman called “fast thinking,” which is

humans’ mental default mode. Fast thinking saves project planners and

managers the considerable eﬀort of ﬁguring out which class of project

a new undertaking belongs to, what the averages and extremes are

for that class, how those values translate into risk, and how that risk

may be mitigated. But very few, if any, projects are unique, no matter

how complex they are. Unless you accept that and invest in identifying

similar endeavors and learning from them, your own project will most

likely come in late and well over budget and underdeliver on beneﬁts.
