A client of mine, Melissa, the CEO of a tech company in the healthcare

sector, vented to me about a conversation she’d had with her CHRO,

Ben. He came to her and said, “I’m hearing frustrations on the team

about how decisions are getting made.” Having prided herself on being

a transparent, inclusive leader (which she is), she was perplexed. Ben

went on to share several stories of team members who’d learned about

critical decisions that aﬀected them from their peers, not from Melissa.

For example, the VP of engineering learned about a deprioritized

product feature from the VP of marketing. The VP of quality learned

about a new project to accelerate product delivery from the VP of

operations. The VP of sales learned about a new budget shift from the

CFO.

Melissa explained to me that, indeed, based on new information that

each of those executives had brought in their 1:1s, she supported their

recommended decisions, and assumed they would loop in the requisite

peers rather than waiting for the next monthly executive meeting. In

her mind, she was empowering her team to accelerate needed decisions

rather than being the bottleneck or playing messenger to the other VPs, thus slowing things down. Clearly her focus on eﬃciency blinded her

to the disunity and conﬂict it might provoke on the team. In each case,

she’d only gotten part of the story.

I gave her the advice I’ve given countless CEOs and C-suite leaders: Stop

having so many 1:1 meetings.

## The Hidden Costs of Executive 1:1 Meetings

## In most large organizations, a typical CEO’s or senior executive’s

calendar is clogged with 1:1 meetings. These are usually seen

## as necessary for alignment, decision-making, or relationship

management. But at the top of an enterprise, the very structure of these

meetings is working against the organization’s best interests. While

there’s lots of information available about how to optimize or improve

your 1:1 meetings, no amount of improvement will help meetings that

shouldn’t be happening in the ﬁrst place.

Lower in the organization, 1:1 meetings serve diﬀerent purposes that

may make more sense when people are guiding middle managers,

supervisors, or individual contributors. But here’s the counterintuitive

truth: The more 1:1 meetings senior executives have, the more

fragmented and functionally siloed the organization can become.

It might be easy to conclude that Melissa should have known better not

to assume her functional VPs had consulted with key peers impacted by

their decisions, or that she simply should have said, “Before we move

ahead, why don’t you loop John in to make sure this doesn’t cause any

issues for him.” Fair enough. But even if that had happened, it wouldn’t

entirely eliminate the challenges of fragmentation caused by executive

1:1s. And worse, it may have led to ﬁve additional meetings she would

have had to referee.

At the executive level, no meaningful decision exists in a vacuum. As

was the case with Melissa’s team, what the engineering VP does is

signiﬁcantly impacted by a decision the VP of marketing makes. The VP

of operations’ decision had signiﬁcant implications for the VP of quality.

Yet Melissa’s meetings with those key leaders resulted in decisions—and

assumptions—that others didn’t hear, couldn’t weigh in on, or later

had to be retroactively briefed about. There was no intended malice or

attempt to usurp others’ inﬂuence. Just the natural centrifugal force of a

## myopic view of the world through one’s own function or region.

This creates four core problems:

Fragmented governance

Each 1:1 functions like a mini steering committee, but with no one else

in the room. Governance becomes informal and duplicative, requiring

rework and follow-up meetings just to keep others up to speed. Worse,

viewpoints that weren’t considered in the initial 1:1 then surface later

on, leading to friction that could have been avoided. When too much

time is spent in fragmented meetings, there’s little left for the work that

only senior leaders can do: stewarding enterprise priorities, developing

talent, and advancing culture.

# Functional bias

One-on-ones reinforce a view of the organization as a set of

departments rather than a web of capabilities. Over time, this

strengthens silos instead of creating cross-functional coherence. And

it forces the CEO or senior leader to act as the sole integrator of cross-

# functional perspectives.

Decision repackaging

Executives waste valuable time repeating, translating, or defending

decisions made privately. This not only slows momentum—it breeds

misalignment and friction downstream. Trust erodes over time, and

leaders become conditioned to use their 1:1s to game the system and

distort the truth to ensure their views prevail.

# Executive rivalry and collusion

Succession overhang and ambition can subtly foster competition among

## top leaders. One-on-ones become arenas for inside inﬂuence, where

leaders can imply advantage by referencing private access (“In my 1:1

with Bill this morning…”), creating a sense of secrecy and status that

# erodes collective trust.

CEOs can also be guilty of leveraging their 1:1s to extract information

about other team members, creating a false sense of “insider intimacy”

## with direct reports that ultimately undermines psychological safety.

One CEO I urged to reduce his 1:1s actually lamented to me, “But how

will I get all of the inside scoops I don’t get anywhere else?”

## A Better Way to Use Executives’ Time: Capability Meetings

The alternative is to re-engineer the way executive time is used.

Instead of relying on 1:1s for operational discussions, CEOs and

senior executives should convene small, cross-functional “capability

meetings”—1:2 or 1:3 conversations that reﬂect how value is actually

created.

For example, innovation isn’t owned by R&D, marketing, or customer

experience alone; it lives in the seams between them. Bringing

those leaders together—at the same table—ensures strategic clarity,

accelerates coordination, and strengthens shared ownership.

Here are ﬁve ways to begin:

# Reserve 1:1s for development.

Shift 1:1s to a quarterly cadence and use them solely for the individual’s

## growth, feedback, and career development. These conversations

deserve focused, undivided attention—not to be diluted by operational

# updates or real-time ﬁreﬁghting.

You can block 90-minute quarterly sessions that are clearly

labeled “development conversation.” Structure them around reﬂection,

feedback, and future goals. Avoid sliding into tactical issues. Use

prompts like “What are you learning about yourself as a leader this

quarter?” or “What would stretch you in a meaningful way next year?”

At one global consumer goods company, the COO redesigned her 1:1

structure by implementing a “career check-in” model: quarterly sessions

focused entirely on each direct report’s long-term goals, with zero slides

or project updates. This shift dramatically improved retention and

# succession visibility within her team.

# Convene around capabilities.

Map out your enterprise’s most critical capabilities like innovation,

## digital transformation, or customer loyalty, and structure standing

meetings around the cross-functional intersections that enable them.

Identify the ﬁve to seven capabilities that create diﬀerentiated value in

your business. For each, bring together the two to four functions most

essential to delivering that value. These “capability councils” become

the forums for near-term decision-making, trade-oﬀs, and shared

execution, saving the full executive team’s time for truly enterprise-

# wide strategies and opportunities.

Melissa worked with her team to reframe their strategic priorities

## into capability areas—like “virtual care experience” and “clinical

operations technologies”—and created standing 1:3 capability meetings

that included product, operations, and engineering leaders. As a result,

go-to-market cycles shortened by 20%, and duplication and friction

across teams dropped signiﬁcantly.

Ensure the right people are listening. One of the quiet ineﬃciencies of 1:1s is that they pull decisions

into private channels, where the people most aﬀected often aren’t

present. That means leaders have to replay discussions for others

later, or relitigate decisions once new information surfaces, leading to

misunderstanding, misalignment, or delayed action.

You can use capability meetings to bring together the speciﬁc leaders

whose functions intersect around a given issue. This ensures that the

people who need to understand and act on the information are hearing

it at the moment it matters. No one has to wait to be briefed later.

This kind of targeted presence builds sharper shared judgment and

eliminates the need to re-translate decisions across silos.

At a ﬁnancial services ﬁrm I’ve consulted with, the CEO replaced many

of his 1:1s with capability meetings like “go to market,” “operational eﬃciency,” or “enterprise talent,” convening various combinations of

## the heads of risk, compliance, sales, and human resources, as well

as the business unit general managers, to discuss capability-focused

topics. Because the right people were hearing the context in real

time, execution accelerated. Leaders no longer had to “sell” decisions

afterward or decipher what had happened behind closed doors because

they were in the room when it happened.

# Elevate executive team time.

When too many decisions happen in private 1:1s, full executive team

meetings often devolve into catch-up sessions, replaying decisions,

clarifying miscommunications, or managing interpersonal fallout. That

robs the team of the chance to focus on the truly enterprise-wide work

only they can do.

By using capability meetings to handle cross-functional execution and

trade-oﬀs at the right level, executive team time can be reserved for

## strategic sensemaking, cultural stewardship, and long-horizon bets.

Center agendas around questions like “What are the few issues that

require the full weight of this team?” or “Where does our system need

# realignment?”

One Fortune 100 company overhauled its monthly executive team

meeting after realizing that too much time was spent relitigating

decisions made elsewhere. By reassigning operational decision-making

to triads tied to core capabilities, they cleared the decks for their senior

team to focus on systemic enterprise priorities—like cultural resilience,

## the innovation pipeline, scenario planning for disruptions, and global

portfolio shifts. The result was faster execution at the edges and deeper

# strategic coherence at the center.

# Minimize executive rivalry.

Succession dynamics often create a subtle undercurrent of competition.

One-on-ones can exacerbate this by enabling power plays through

## implied exclusivity or “private access” to the CEO.

By moving operational discussions into small group formats, the

executive team begins to operate with greater transparency and mutual

accountability. The “I know something you don’t” dynamic is replaced

with shared context and visible contributions. Make it clear that real

inﬂuence comes from collaboration, not proximity. And the reduction of

back-channel gossip allows genuine trust to ﬂourish.

One CEO I’ve coached at a global logistics ﬁrm noticed rising tension

among his direct reports, often rooted in whispered references to what

was said in private meetings, including ways he’d leveraged what he’d

learned in them. He eliminated his 1:1s entirely. Within two quarters,

those “status ﬂexes” disappeared, and the team began naming a new

culture of “leadership without leverage.”

. . .

Ultimately, this isn’t just about meeting eﬃciency. It’s about leadership

eﬀectiveness. The role of senior executives isn’t to manage functions

in isolation. It’s to enable the organization’s full capacity to perform,

adapt, and grow. That requires seeing and leading the seams, not just

# the silos.

Minimizing 1:1s may feel uncomfortable at ﬁrst. But for leaders ready to

shape the organization they want, not just maintain the one they have,

it’s a powerful step forward.
