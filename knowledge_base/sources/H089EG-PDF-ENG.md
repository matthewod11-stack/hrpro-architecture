Tom, a client of mine, started our coaching session by placing his

three-page to-do list on the table between us. As a new leader in the

organization, he felt both excited about his role and overwhelmed by

the responsibilities he was now expected to take on. As we began to

review his long list of tasks, I asked, “Is there anyone you can hand a few

of these responsibilities oﬀ to?”

Tom paused. “These are all tasks that only I can do,” he said. “I’m really

good at them.”

As we continued the conversation, however, he revealed this wasn’t

necessarily true. In reality, Tom was hesitant to delegate because he

wanted his boss to feel conﬁdent that she had chosen the right leader.

He believed that taking on every task himself was the best way to prove

# that.

I encounter this situation often when coaching new leaders, particularly

people who are in their ﬁrst few months of the job. While some of the

pressures they put on themselves are rooted in real expectations, others

are driven by their own perceptions of what leaders are “supposed to

do.” My job is to break down those false perceptions and help them see

# the beneﬁts of delegation.

If you’re a new leader who is struggling with this issue, here’s how to

# work through it.

- 1) Change your mindset.

Many people are promoted into management for doing their previous

job well. This means, as an individual contributor, you may have been

particularly strong at delivering results and completing the tasks on

your to-do list. But once you’re promoted to a leadership role, you must

accept that you can’t do everything on your own — nor should you.

Though it may seem counterintuitive, the more senior you become in

an organization, the less you’ll be involved in doing the day-to-day

work. You’ll need to have a sense of what’s happening without directly

contributing to every project.

This shift, from “doing” to “managing” can feel uncomfortable —

especially if you’re used to getting recognition for carrying out tasks

quickly and well. The reality is, your job has changed now, and how your

performance is measured will change along with it.

## HBR / Digital Article / Learning to Delegate as a First-Time Manager

As a manager, your success is not equal to being the best performer

on your team. It’s determined by your ability to help your team grow,

reach their goals, and contribute to the larger company vision. That

involves helping them learn the tasks they’re working on, and when

appropriate, creating opportunities for them to take on more visible or

challenging work. If you resist this change, you’ll likely end up like Tom

— overwhelmed and (unintentionally) holding onto opportunities that

could be given to your team.

That’s why learning to delegate is so important. It can help you

gain back valuable time and give your direct reports more chances

to develop their skills. Delegating is all about loosening control and

increasing accountability. Once you embrace this, you will become more

comfortable doing it.

- 2) Determine what to delegate and who to delegate it to.

Once you accept that delegating is a part of your job, you can

realistically think about what work to take on, what work to hand oﬀ,

and who to hand it oﬀ to. Write out a comprehensive list of every task

or project on your plate this month. Then, ask yourself the following

questions to identify which items would be best to delegate:

What tasks or projects hamper my ability to work on the “high-level” projects that only I can carry out?

Be realistic with yourself about what “high-level” entails. Like Tom, you

may initially be biased, believing that most tasks can only be done by

you. To keep your biases in check, think through the responsibilities

of your role. “High-level” projects are often the ones that contribute to

your company’s longer-term strategic priorities and are less urgent than

a day-to-day task. A few examples might include: creating development

goals for your team members, setting quarterly benchmarks, or

contributing to a cross-functional initiative as a representative of your

department. This work requires your experience, input, and expertise as

a leader, and is typically not appropriate to hand oﬀ to a more junior

# employee.

Once you’ve identiﬁed what work is “high level,” cross it oﬀ, and take a

look at the rest of your list. The tasks or projects that are left are good

candidates to delegate.

Which tasks or projects might be learning opportunities that can help my team develop?

Whether it’s a one-oﬀ request or more elaborate project, every item you

hand oﬀ should do one of the following: contribute in some way to the

“high-level” work you’re responsible for, help your direct reports gain

visibility (internally or externally), or challenge your direct reports to

# learn and grow.

Ideally you can align a task or project with your team member’s

strengths, goals, or career development plan, which will advance both

the organization and the individual. For example, you may invite a

team member who you consider to be a future people leader to head a

brainstorming meeting on your behalf or present a pitch to your boss.

By providing them with an opportunity like this, you’re giving them

a chance to gain inﬂuence, build relationships, and contribute to an

organizational initiative. In turn, these projects contribute to your team

# member’s engagement and retention.

Which pieces of a project might leverage someone else’s strengths?

If you feel uncomfortable handing oﬀ an entire project to someone else,

consider what pieces of a projects might require skills that your team

members are experienced in. You can identify these skills by observing

people in action or asking questions during one-on-one conversations

such as: “What kind of work makes you feel energized?”; “What do

you consider your greatest strengths?”;“What makes you feel most

accomplished?”

As an example, one of Tom’s projects involved engaging with customers

and tracking customer conversations in a database. This work provided

the organization with important institutional knowledge. By pulling

a team member in to help enter information into the database, Tom

was able to shift his focus to preparing for and following up with the

customers, and his team member gained a learning opportunity. She

was exposed to information about customer relationships that helped

inform her work on this project, and on future projects as well.

In your own situation, remember that delegating parts of a project

can not only help you understand where people shine, but also where

they need to develop. For instance, you can test the waters by giving

someone a stretch project that aligns with their core job responsibilities.

From there, you can gauge their strengths and growth areas.

- 3) Clearly communicate the task or project to your team member, and clarify roles and next steps.

Now that you’ve got some ideas around what work you want to delegate

and to whom, thoughtfully approach the team member to share your

thinking. They need to know what you’re delegating, why they’re being

asked to do it, and what you’re expecting of them. Here’s how to go

# about it.

## Schedule a one-on-one meeting with the team member.

Typically, it’s best to schedule a meeting speciﬁcally focused on this

topic to ensure you have enough time to discuss your expectations

and answer any questions that come up. During your meeting, clearly

explain what the project is, how it’s contributing to the goals of your

team or organization, and why you’re asking this person to work on it.

Think of the conversation as a chance to recognize your team member’s

# strengths and potential.

You may say something like, “I’m excited about asking you to lead this

new initiative. It’s been a priority for the company this quarter because

it contributes to our goal of making our product visible to a wider

audience. One of your many strengths is bringing people together to

create a shared vision, so I look forward to seeing what you’re able to do

# as the project lead.”

Give your team member time to process the information.

Next, follow up with a question like, “What are your thoughts on this

project? What else would be helpful for me to share with you?” Then

pause and let your team member have the ﬂoor. They may have some

initial questions around the scope of the project or task, or wonder how

it will ﬁt into their current workload. As the manager, it’s your job to

help them reprioritize their to-do list and ensure they have enough time

on their plate to successfully do this work.

Be mindful not to characterize the work you’re delegating as “easy”

or say, “It will only take a few hours.” Though you may feel tempted

minimize to the eﬀort required, you may unintentionally minimize your

expectations by doing so.

# Establish roles and a timeline.

Having clearly deﬁned roles is often where I see clients get stuck.

If you’re delegating a project, for example, you’ll likely want to give

your team member a timeline of goals to reach and check in on them

regularly to track their progress. At the same time, you don’t want your

direct report to feel micromanaged. That’s why it’s helpful to deﬁne

# some guidelines upfront.

In this initial meeting, discuss a cadence for project check-ins that will

work for you both. Explain that you will use the time to discuss project

updates and help them troubleshoot challenges. Try to align on your

preferred communication styles. For instance, perhaps you’d like short,

## weekly updates in an email, and longer updates once a month.

You should also discuss their scope of decision-making on the project

— the choices that will require your consultation versus the ones they

can feel empowered to make on their own. Remember: Your job is to set

the goals and expectations. Your team member’s job is to determine the

process around how to meet them.

- 4) Celebrate progress and provide feedback.

During your check-ins, give your team member feedback on the

project or task you delegated, coach them, and provide them with any

resources they may need to move forward (if possible). That said, if

you have critical feedback, don’t immediately give it. It’s more useful

to ask questions that will help your direct report develop their own

understanding of what may need to be done diﬀerently. You can say,

“What went well from your perspective? What didn’t go as well as

hoped? What do we want to replicate (or not) next time?” Upon hearing

their thoughts, follow up with, “It’s helpful to hear your thinking on

this. Let me share with you what I see from where I am.”

Also use this time to recognize your team member’s eﬀorts, as your

encouragement may be just what they need to stay motivated. On longer

projects, if a milestone is reached, celebrate their accomplishments by

letting them know that you appreciate their work. Reiterate how their

eﬀorts are contributing to your team or larger organization. If the team

member likes to be praised in public, you can even write a brief team or

company-wide Slack message highlighting their work.

- 5) Review and reflect.

Once the project or task is completed, collaborate with your team

members on a retrospective review to reﬂect on how the process went

from their perspective. You can ask questions like, “What was this

experience like for you?” “What did you learn from this?” and “Where

did things get stuck?” Through these conversations, you may identify

things you can do to support your team member better going forward

and uncover new information about how to improve your delegation

# skills.

. . .

As Tom implemented these strategies with his team, he started to feel

clearer about what he needed to focus on and how his team could help

support his work, as well as the work of the his company.

In your own situation, be patient with the process. Learning how to

delegate well takes time, but it’s worth it — because if you can’t replace

yourself, you can’t move up as a leader. So, consider this an investment

in your team and in yourself. Stick with it, and soon, delegating will

become second nature.
