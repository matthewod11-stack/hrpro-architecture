Corporate training isn’t all fun and games, but maybe it should be.

Most of us have (often grudgingly) used corporate learning systems.

We skim through the 50-slide PowerPoint decks hoping to correctly

guess enough answers to pass so that we can get back to our “real

work.” Anything we learn may be forgotten by the time we receive our

certiﬁcate of completion. But a new study shows that gamiﬁed training

done right—lessons conducted carefully and over time, incorporating

## elements such as progression through challenges and levels, instant

feedback, points, and competition—can signiﬁcantly improve employee

# performance.

The research took place at the professional services ﬁrm KPMG.

“Leaders had developed a gamiﬁed training tool for their employees,

but they didn’t want to just roll it out and wonder whether it worked,”

## explains Ryan Buell, a professor at Harvard Business School and a

coauthor of the study. “They were committed to rigorously testing the

# eﬀects.”

The study was conducted among client-facing employees in 24 oﬃces

participating in the training, which was rolled out at various times

in a randomized order. Called KPMG Globerunner, the training

was meant to deepen employees’ awareness and understanding of

the ﬁrm’s products and services so that they could better identify

business opportunities. Employees designed a character for themselves

and “raced around the world” answering questions about the ﬁrm’s

oﬀerings. A correct answer earned travel points that enabled players to

progress. Employees could also complete mini-game challenges to earn

additional points and unlock new levels. Participation was optional and

open-ended; employees could engage with the platform as frequently

and for as long as they liked.

To determine the training’s eﬀects, if any, on each oﬃce’s performance,

the researchers analyzed ﬁve measures on a monthly basis over 29

months: fees collected, the number of clients served, total business

opportunities generated, opportunities generated from existing clients, and opportunities from new clients. To measure each oﬃce’s use of

the training, they looked at how much time employees spent playing

Globerunner and the number of questions they answered. To assess

employees’ engagement with their jobs, they calculated the share of people in each oﬃce who logged on to the platform at least once

(indicating an interest in furthering their skills to help meet KPMG’s

goals) and how quickly they did so once the platform was available. Finally, they analyzed whether and how much leaders in each oﬃce

played the game.

Analysis showed that the training helped increase fees collected by participating oﬃces by more than 25%. The number of clients rose by up

to 16%, and opportunities from new clients rose by as much as 22%. The

more that employees played Globerunner, the more likely they were to improve performance in their jobs. Oﬃces whose employees showed

a higher willingness to train increased fees collected by 16% more than others. Oﬃces in which employees were more engaged with their

jobs to begin with increased total business opportunities by 8% more,

opportunities from existing clients by 10% more, and opportunities

# from new clients by 7% more.

Leader engagement with the training was also important. The more oﬃce leaders who registered to use the platform, the higher the employee sign-up rate. And that improved results. Oﬃces whose leaders

participated more than others increased fees collected by 19% more and

grew the number of clients served by 7% more.

The researchers oﬀer three recommendations for using gamiﬁed

training to improve employee performance.

## “Rote Training Is Boring—but Games Are the Opposite of Boring”

Christian Gossan, a director at the advisory firm KPMG Australia, led the

creation of the gamified training platform described in the accompanying

article. He recently spoke with HBR about KPMG’s experience with this

learning approach. Edited excerpts of the conversation follow.

What problem was gamified training

meant to solve?

We have numerous service lines, so

we needed to deepen employees’

# understanding of all our offerings and

capabilities. Rote training is boring—but

games are the opposite of boring. And

their interactive nature means that people

can’t just click through to completion. We

started with a pilot for employees in our

# Nicole Reed

Australian offices. Australians are mad for

sport, so we used an athletics-themed

platform. When we decided to go global

with the approach, we made a more universally appealing one called KPMG

Globerunner, which is now used by employees in 100 countries. People

race around the world by answering questions and completing challenges,

and each year the top 10 scorers in every country participate in a global

tournament. The impact on sales has been substantial, and we believe

Globerunner has helped with employee engagement too.

What does a KPMG game look like?

Well, it’s never going to be confused with Grand Theft Auto! But we knew

that the digital trainings couldn’t look amateurish if we wanted people to

take them seriously, so we used expert developers. We stayed away from

animated graphics, which quickly become dated. You can focus too much

on glossy design and mechanics, though. You also need to ensure the

# participation of users.

How do you persuade employees to play?

First, make sure the experience is fun! Most employees—83% of them—

say they enjoy playing Globerunner. Second, emphasize that it’s a time-

efficient way for people to improve in their roles. Third, be aware of cultural

considerations. For instance, gambling elements of any kind are prohibited

in some countries. Finally, avoid a male bias, which is a real risk with game

design. We always include female designers.

How can leaders help?

It’s important that they are seen engaging with the trainings themselves.

Otherwise, junior employees might worry about being perceived as shirking

if they play while at work. Some of our CEOs have personally rolled out the

platforms in their member firms, and that’s led to some great interactions

## between our youngest employees and our most-senior ones.

Is there any risk of abuse?

You do need to monitor for that. Each year a small number of employees—

about 1 in 10,000—become compulsive users, and for their sake as well as

the firm’s, we need to intervene.

Do you have any “cheat codes” for organizations that want to try

gamified training?

Collect data on people’s play so that you can improve the user experience.

Don’t make the training only about the firm; think about the why, not just

the what. We’ve modified Globerunner to include content about purpose—

things that relate not just to our service offerings but also to the value

they bring to clients, along with elements to help our people discover their

personal purpose. And don’t be afraid to expand. We have another gamified

training that educates employees about specific clients and prospects. We

often include it in proposals to prospects to demonstrate our commitment

should they sign with us. Twenty years ago it would have been hard to

imagine that a game-like experience could help us win business—but here

we are.

## Communicate enthusiasm to managers and employees. Before

adopting gamiﬁed training, organizations should stress the importance of manager participation. Leaders who visibly play while in the oﬃce

are more likely to boost employee participation and business results.

“Prior research on digital gamiﬁed training platforms tells us that they

can be seen as a distraction,” says Tatiana Sandino, a professor at

Harvard Business School and a coauthor of the study. “But if the leader

jumps in and signs on to the platform, it gives employees license to sign

on as well.” It also encourages employees to see the training as more

important than they otherwise might.

Employees should feel comfortable using the training at their desks during oﬃce hours, free from concerns that others might think they are

gooﬁng oﬀ. “The fact that it’s fun may make it seem less permissible,”

Buell says. “Do I really get to play at work? The leader is modeling that

not only is it OK to play; playing is a good thing.” In other words, playing

should be viewed as a legitimate part of work, not as a break from it.

Measure outcomes ofﬁcewide. Performance improvements at KPMG were greater in oﬃces where many of the employees were already

engaged with their jobs. But the ﬁrm’s results also suggest that

organizations will see some level of improvement from everyone. “The

time spent on training and the number of questions answered boosted

performance even among employees who had low engagement with

their jobs, and regardless of whether their leaders used the training,”

says Wei Cai, an assistant professor at Columbia Business School and

# another coauthor of the study.

However, those workers’ results probably won’t be as robust or obvious

## as improvements among more-engaged employees; such trainings

aren’t a panacea for poor engagement. So organizations should set oﬃcewide performance goals rather than deﬁne success by how much

the least-engaged employees improve.

Be patient. Don’t expect same-day or even same-week results. Most

of the performance boosts at KPMG took hold in the second or

third quarter after the training was introduced, and they gradually

increased thereafter. This cumulative eﬀect will most likely continue

as employees improve their mastery of the lessons and their knowledge

of the ﬁrm’s oﬀerings. “When organizations implement this kind of

system, they need to give it time,” Sandino says. “People may not be

able to immediately apply all their new knowledge.”

KPMG’s employees continue to use and beneﬁt from the training

platform. Even though the study ended more than 18 months ago, “We

continued to track their performance,” says Cai. “And we saw that the

beneﬁts persist long after the rollout.”
