Many leaders prioritize their personal or departmental needs,

## especially amid disruption like restructuring, layoﬀs, and budget cuts.

While it’s natural to advocate for your success or support your people, it

becomes problematic when it comes at the expense of the organization.

A client of ours, “Elena,” came up in a company that had been bought

and sold several times over the past 20 years. With each merger and

acquisition came a change in leadership structure and ownership. This

left Elena feeling vulnerable, as she would often see prior leadership

teams — including her managers, mentors, and supporters — impacted.

Elena felt deeply bruised if she was layered under a new boss or her

team was restructured.

In fact, in times like this, Elena’s territorial instincts would kick in. On

this occasion, after being promoted to EVP-Americas of client success,

she held on to a key client relationship that needed to be transitioned

to one of her new peers. This territorial approach was preventing her

from operating at her full potential in her new role. She was preoccupied

with what she was “losing” to her sales counterpart by transitioning

these client relationships. Consequently, she struggled to capitalize on

the opportunity to make a broader impact on the customer experience

and gain the seat at the executive table she had long desired.

Elena’s experience is not unique. In our work as consultants and

executive coaches, we’ve observed many leaders who become territorial

## and overprotective of their teams, client relationships, and resources

to preserve their ability to succeed. It’s not uncommon for talented

leaders to compete internally with their peers for people, investment,

and attention; in fact, it’s often that individual drive that made them

successful in the ﬁrst place. However, when you’re looking to scale your

leadership and reach the C-suite, this “fend for yourself” mentality will

stop you in your tracks. Here are four strategies to help senior leaders

redeﬁne “winning” as a shared goal.

- 1. Enhance your self-awareness.

You must start by uncovering your role in the situation. Examine a given

circumstance from all sides to uncover what you may have overlooked

that’s contributing to the problem. This includes increasing your self-

awareness. Research has shown that only 10% to 15% of people ﬁt

the criteria of being self-aware, deﬁned as understanding yourself and

your goals and valuing others’ opinions. Conﬂicts don’t happen in a

vacuum, and it’s never too soon to hold yourself accountable for your

contribution to a given situation.

In Elena’s case, honest reﬂection prompted her to take a hard look at the

narratives she was telling herself and the biases she had formed about

her coworkers. Marliee Adams explains this concept in her book Change

Your Questions, Change Your Life. It’s easy to mistake being judgmental

(i.e., jumping to conclusions) with exercising judgment (i.e., creating

space to understand someone else’s actions). Adams explains that you

have a choice: to be a “judger” who’s inclined toward fault-ﬁnding, or a

“learner” who leads with curiosity to understand someone’s actions.

To increase your self-awareness, reﬂect on the following questions:

What narrative am I telling myself about the situation? What assumptions am I making about the circumstances and people involved?

Exploring the narratives you construct can reveal underlying biases

and preconceptions that may contribute to conﬂict. It also helps you

connect the dots between your judgments and your decisions and

# actions.

Create psychological space and reﬂect on what you may have inferred

## about someone else’s intentions, objectives, or anticipated response.

Often it’s the stories we tell ourselves that lead us to jump to conclusions

that may not be based on reality. For example, if you feel like a victim of

the circumstances, then you may craft a story to support that identity.

What would shift if I slowed down to understand my negative feelings?

It’s natural to pay excess attention to the negatives, which are typically

driven by our emotions. The next time you have a negative reaction,

consider what behavior or event speciﬁcally triggered it. This will help

you understand the internal or external source of what’s bothering

you, which may not be directly related to the current situation,

as past experiences and challenges can activate negative emotions.

Most importantly, you can delay taking action so that you’re not

disproportionately inﬂuenced by your feelings. As Ken Blanchard and

## Spencer Johnson shared in The One Minute Manager, “We are not just

our behavior. We are the person managing our behavior.”

What feedback can I solicit to expand my range of inputs?

Ask yourself, “Did I genuinely value others’ opinions, or did I primarily

rely on my own viewpoint?” Embracing diverse perspectives fosters

## a more comprehensive understanding of the situation and promotes

collaboration. Consider speaking with a thought partner such as an

executive coach, trusted colleague, or friend who can help you identify

misperceptions and oversights in a non-emotional way. Soliciting

constructive feedback should be treated as information collection, not

gossip or piling on to what you already believe to be true.

- 2. From win-lose to win-win.

An organization is only as strong as the sum of its parts. Now that you’ve

identiﬁed how you contribute to a problem, consider how to move

from a “me to we” mindset. This means that while stakeholders you

depend upon for your success have diﬀerent or competing priorities,

## as members of the same organization, you all share an overarching

# mission.

Elena found it incredibly useful to identify the interdependencies

between her team and other departments to fully grasp how hers

and her counterparts’ success were intrinsically linked to achieve a

# particular organizational goal.

A powerful exercise to clarify where to focus your energy to align

incentives is a “stakeholder evaluation map.” This will help you identify

which stakeholders are critical to your success in the near term. Then

you’ll be able to determine the actions you must take to move the

relationship forward to achieve a mutually beneﬁcial outcome.

To create a stakeholder evaluation map, start with a particular goal or

objective — for example, in Elena’s case, she was focused on increasing

revenue from existing clients year-over-year by 15% and new customer

referrals by 12%. Then ask yourself:

- Who are the key stakeholders I must engage in the coming three to six

months to be successful?

- What speciﬁc resources will I need to meet this objective, and by

# when?

- Who has the authority to make decisions about this objective?

- What’s the opportunity cost to the customer or organization if I don’t

get the resources I need?

Next, determine the concrete actions that will create mutually

successful outcomes for each stakeholder along with milestones to hold

yourself accountable. Here’s a sample of Elena’s stakeholder evaluation

operating in survival mode, it’s important to recognize that a low level

of trust has likely developed, and it’s critical to rebuild that trust with

your colleagues. You may observe symptoms such as coworkers lacking

initiative or struggling to make decisions or engage in healthy debates.

## As Frances Frei and Anne Morriss, coauthors of Move Fast and Fix

Things and Unleashed propose, there are three pillars of trust. They

write, “People tend to trust you when they believe they are interacting

with the real you (authenticity), when they have faith in your judgment

and competence (logic), and when they feel that you care about them

(empathy). When trust is lost, it can almost always be traced back to a

## breakdown in one of these three drivers.”

We asked Elena to reﬂect on the following coaching questions to

identify the root causes of the trust breakdown and devise strategies

to regain it:

# Authenticity:

- What can I do to demonstrate my values and intentions through my

# words and behavior?

- In what ways can I build trust by enhancing transparency and

# openness in my interactions with others?

# Logic:

- What strategies do I enlist to communicate my decisions and actions

clearly and logically to foster understanding and trust?

- What steps can I take to ensure that my decision-making process is

aligned with organizational goals?

# Empathy:

- How do I ensure that I’m actively listening to others and

demonstrating an understanding of their perspectives and emotions?

- Next time I’m in a meeting with others, what concrete steps can I take

to communicate that I value their success, either during or after the

# meeting?

Regaining trust will require both parties to take accountability for

what went wrong as a ﬁrst step to repairing the relationship. It also

won’t happen overnight. For Elena, this involved speaking to each

stakeholder individually to acknowledge her missteps and share her

desire to improve the working relationship and what that would mean

for her and the organization. She also made a conscious eﬀort to build

rapport and take action to support others’ priorities to demonstrate that

the partnership was not one-sided.

- 4. Create a shared commitment.

You must forge a collective agreement, including the working norms

and processes you and your colleagues will commit to. Creating a shared

commitment will increase the probability of success, as people naturally

rebel at expectations because they don’t consider the needs of the other

person. This can be established with working agreements that deﬁne

objectives and the commitments that must be upheld by all parties to

achieve them.

Here’s some sample language to begin this dialogue:

Given our shared goal of [insert goal], I’d like to achieve [insert milestone]

by [deadline]. This is needed because [explain rationale]. What help do

you need from me to make this happen?

Once you know what’s needed from each party and an agreement is

made to achieve a given goal, it’s time to proactively identify progress

milestones along the way, a cadence for communication, and preferred

channels. With a commitment to collaborative problem-solving, you’ll

not only create a more successful outcome but also foster an execution-

## as-learning opportunity for continuous improvement.

. . .

For Elena, transitioning from a “fend for yourself” mentality to a

shared perspective of “winning” enabled her to not only achieve her

goals as a newly promoted executive but also show up as the leader

the organization needed at that moment. While it can be hard to

let go of your default “territorial” response to a situation, adopting a

## collaborative approach will ultimately position you for greater success.

As Steve Jobs said, “Great things in business are never done by one

person. They’re done by a team of people.”
