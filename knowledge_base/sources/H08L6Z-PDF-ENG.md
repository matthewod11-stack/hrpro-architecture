Think about the ocean. On the surface it seems serene, but deep below,

currents guide everything that happens above. This is exactly how

power dynamics work in organizations. They may seem invisible, but

they shape everything from decision-making to company culture.

Power dynamics refer to the balance (or imbalance) between people

and groups when they interact. They determine whether your ideas get

implemented or ignored, whether you’re considered for projects, and

even how quickly you advance. While good work quality matters, far too

many professionals overlook the hidden dynamics that really determine

# their success.

Take Sarah, a mid-level marketing manager who found herself

frustrated after her carefully crafted digital campaign proposal hit

unexpected roadblocks. Her strategy was solid, her projections were

accurate, but the initiative kept stalling. While she had convinced her

direct superiors about the value of the campaign, she came to realize she

had completely neglected getting others’ buy-in.

Sarah’s experience isn’t unique, because understanding who to

inﬂuence is often just as important as knowing what to propose. This

is where power mapping comes in — a useful tool that can help you

make smart decisions about which key decision-makers you need to

build relationships with as well as who might block your progress.

Let’s walk through how to create a power map, using Sarah’s situation as

# an example:

- 1. Identify your potential stakeholders.

Brainstorm everyone who might be aﬀected by or have an impact

on your initiative. Include obvious players like your boss and team

members, but also consider “silent” stakeholders such as clients,

external partners, or gatekeepers who control access to information and

# resources.

Sarah listed everyone who might have a say in her digital campaign’s

success, including her supervisor, the marketing VP, and her team

members. She then added the legal team who would need to approve

messaging, the ﬁnance director who controlled the budget, and sales

leaders whose teams would eventually use the campaign in their client

outreach. Sarah also wrote down the head of digital operations, who

rarely attended marketing meetings but still had signiﬁcant say in

getting the campaign launched.

- 2. Rate each stakeholder’s level of influence and interest.

Next, on a scale of 1–10 (10 being the most, 1 being the least), rate how

much authority or input each stakeholder has (inﬂuence) as well as how

much they care about what you’re working on (interest).

Sarah’s immediate boss scored high on interest (8), since the campaign’s

success would aﬀect his own performance review, but lower on

inﬂuence (4) because he needed buy-in from those above him. The

marketing VP had both high inﬂuence (8) and interest (8) and was

already supportive. The head of digital operations scored a 9 on

inﬂuence, but only a 3 on interest. The legal team ranked moderately on

both scales (6 and 5), while the ﬁnance director showed high inﬂuence

(8) but low interest (4). The sales leaders varied, with the APAC director

showing high interest (8), while other regional heads scored lower (3–4).

- 3. Plot stakeholders on a power matrix.

Quadrant 1 includes your key players — those who have both high

inﬂuence and high interest. Place those with high inﬂuence but low

interest in Quadrant 2. They have lots of sway, but don’t care much

about the day-to-day work. Quadrant 3 (low inﬂuence, high interest)

includes stakeholders who should be kept in the loop. Deprioritize

contacts that fall into Quadrant 4 (low inﬂuence, low interest).

Sarah plotted her stakeholders on the matrix:

- In Quadrant 1 was the marketing VP and APAC sales director —

champions who needed to be kept closely involved.

- Quadrant 2 revealed why her previous attempts had stalled. She hadn’t

been engaging the head of digital operations and the ﬁnance director

# eﬀectively.

- The legal team and her immediate boss landed in Quadrant 3. While

supportive, their backing alone wasn’t enough to get the campaign

approved.

- Quadrant 4 included several regional sales managers and junior team

# members whose buy-in wasn’t critical.

- 4. Tailor your strategy.

Sarah developed a targeted engagement strategy for each group. For her

Quadrant 1 stakeholders (marketing VP and APAC sales director), she

scheduled bi-weekly updates that included detailed data and talking

points they could use to advocate for the campaign in meetings.

## For the Quadrant 2 players (the head of digital operations and ﬁnance

director), Sarah scheduled time to understand their priorities and

constraints. She learned that the head of digital operations was under

pressure to show how his team directly impacted revenue growth. So

she emphasized how the campaign would automate customer targeting

and potentially generate millions in new sales, which shifted his

interest level. For the ﬁnance director, she reframed the campaign’s

## beneﬁts in terms of cost savings rather than brand awareness.

For her Quadrant 3 stakeholders (her boss and legal team), Sarah sent

fewer frequent updates on progress and occasionally asked for speciﬁc

favors, like having them make key introductions. Sarah scaled back

her involvement with Quadrant 4 signiﬁcantly to free up time to focus

# elsewhere.

- 5. Regularly update as new information arises and projects evolve.

Sarah got approval for her campaign within three months because she

had strategically involved people in the right ways. She also kept a close

eye on how power dynamics evolved during that time. For instance,

when one of her Quadrant 3 supporters got promoted, she adjusted her

engagement strategy to match their new inﬂuence level. Similarly, when

she discovered that a seemingly low-inﬂuence IT manager actually had

the ear of the digital operations head, she revised her map and built that

# relationship.

Power structures shift. New stakeholders emerge. Priorities change.

When you treat your power map as a living document rather than a

one-time exercise, you’ll be better equipped to navigate organizational

politics and dynamics as tides change.
