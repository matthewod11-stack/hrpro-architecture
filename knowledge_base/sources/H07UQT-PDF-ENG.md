Most multigenerational family businesses eventually arrive at the same

decision point: the current generation realizes it needs to hire a non-

family-member to run the business.

This could happen for a range of reasons. Perhaps no members of

the next generation are interested. Maybe none have cultivated the

necessary skills or experience. Perhaps the family has begun to look to

## the business more for investment income than for employment. Maybe

the family owners recognize the best way to grow the business is to

## bring in a CEO with outside experience and perspective. Or maybe

the business has not devoted much thought to succession. Indeed,

one recent study found that 34% of family businesses lack a formal

# succession plan.

One of us (Rohit Gera) recently went through this exact scenario.

For 12 years, Rohit worked as managing director and CEO of

Gera Developments, a real estate development ﬁrm founded by his

grandfather in Pune, India. During that time, he helped grow the

## business into a leader in lifestyle-focused, child-centric family housing

in Western India. When he began to consider moving on, and with

no family members as potential successors, Rohit hired his coauthor

(family business management specialist Christina Wing) to advise on

the search and onboarding process.

Together, we led a two-month process that identiﬁed and hired Gulzar

Malhotra to be Rohit’s successor. Gulzar is a seasoned real estate

## professional with more than two decades of relevant experience. With

Gulzar in place, we began an equally important but often overlooked

process: onboarding the new leader.

Every new employee requires onboarding, but due to the complexity of

the role, the process of introducing and integrating a CEO hired from

the outside requires a unique approach. (For more on onboarding CEOs,

see “After the Handshake,” HBR, December 2016.) In a family-controlled

ﬁrm, the process must be especially bespoke, taking into account the

## unique dynamics between family employees, family and non-family

## board members, outside investors, other non-family executives, as well

as the family’s goals for the company, which may include more focus

## on community stakeholders, or stability of dividends, or the concerns

## of speciﬁc longtime customers, than a publicly-owned company might

# display.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Bring an Outside CEO into the Family Business

In this article, we outline the steps we used to onboard Rohit’s successor

— a process that can be a model when bringing an outsider in as CEO of

# a family business.

# A Month-by-Month Process

We think of the CEO onboarding process as consisting of ﬁve distinct

phases, each lasting approximately one month. We name the stages

according to what they look like from the incoming CEO’s perspective:

learn, listen, observe, own, and evaluate. We assume that during the

opening stages, the incumbent CEO remains in the role to facilitate the

hand-oﬀ, as is typical in most planned CEO transitions.

For each phase, we outline basic objectives for the new CEO, describe a

big-picture view of what will be necessary from the company to achieve

those objectives, and explain the unique dynamics that come into play

# in a family-controlled company.

The ﬁrst phase of onboarding, learn, begins a month before the new CEO’s oﬃcial start date. Because the successor hasn’t oﬃcially started the job, most of this work takes place outside the oﬃce. In this phase,

guided readings help the new CEO gain basic understanding and

generate a list of questions for the months ahead. Start with readings

that provide a panoramic view of the company — annual reports,

press coverage, etc. If the company is publicly-traded, the incoming

CEO might listen to recordings of recent earnings calls with investors.

As the month progresses, the readings should become increasingly

speciﬁc, potentially including internal memos, slide decks, or meeting

minutes. The depth of this process may depend partly on the new CEO’s

background; someone coming from a diﬀerent industry will require

## more background on product strategy and competitive dynamics, for

# instance.

Throughout the learn phase, the outgoing and incoming CEOs should

check in periodically. In partnership with administrative staﬀ, the

outgoing CEO should ensure that the incoming CEO has access to any

additional material they may require. And while this is happening, the

outgoing CEO works with the HR team to plan the schedule of meetings

for the incoming CEO that will begin during the Listen phase. At Gera,

as we planned this agenda, we thought deliberately about which family

members should be met casually versus which ones required an in-

depth, more formal meeting. Although the family members’ preferred

style factored into these choices, we focused on what would be best for

the incoming CEO, and which format would maximize his chance to

learn. (In the end, the agenda featured more formal, in-depth meetings

# and fewer casual ones.)

The second month, listen, begins on the new CEO’s oﬃcial start date.

During this month, the outgoing CEO should meet weekly with the new

CEO, who will spend much of their time in a series of meetings with key

executive team members. At ﬁrst, these meetings should be high-level,

with the aim not only of sharing information, but also letting the CEO

begin to build relationships. At the 30- day mark, the new CEO will meet

## with some of these people a second and third time, with discussions

becoming more speciﬁc and detailed. During these meetings, the new

CEO should only ask questions and listen. The goal is to determine

how things work, why things are done the way they are, and to absorb

the answers without passing judgement. (Making snap judgements too

quickly can undermine legitimacy.) To manage expectations, the people

meeting with the new CEO should be prepared for this approach so they

don’t expect the CEO to make decisions at this stage.

The listen month is also a time for the new CEO to become more

familiar with how the executive team has typically interacted with

family shareholders and family employees. Each family business has

unique features for the new CEO to learn. At Gera, for instance, Rohit

has a 28-year-old daughter who has studied real estate. Although she is

relatively young, she is a member of the executive team and hopes to

increase her skills and knowledge by working with the new CEO. The

new CEO will need to account for that as he plans for the future, so

meeting this daughter was an important step during this stage.

At the end of the listen phase, we asked the new CEO to prepare

## an analysis of the company’s strengths and weaknesses in the “4Ps”:

portfolio, processes, people, and partners. This memo provided the

## setup for the third phase of CEO onboarding: observe.

During the observe month, the new CEO’s daily programming remains

similar to the previous month, with a steady diet of meetings and site

visits. But the new CEO should now be gradually transitioning beyond

listen-only to a more active role. During this stage, the incoming CEO

should be free and encouraged to voice his opinions and observations

both in private and in group meetings. During this phase, however,

the outgoing CEO is still in charge, and decisions are still made by

them. This is a good time for both the outgoing CEO and incoming

CEO to create a good rapport and for the incoming CEO to get a better

understanding of the how and whys behind the decision making in the

# organization.

For the incoming CEO, who is beginning to understand the family

dynamics, opinions and observations must be sensitive to how the

family and its legacy might inﬂuence business decisions. In a publicly

traded company without controlling family stockholders, a new CEO

might feel free to suggest a division or product line doesn’t make sense

or a decision made a decade ago looks unwise in retrospect. In a family

business, that division may have been started by the founding great-

grandfather and be run today by a third-generation cousin; similarly,

the person responsible for the unwise decision may be a family member

who is still on the board. These dynamics may require the incoming

CEO to be especially diplomatic when oﬀering criticism. The incoming

CEO should also realize that outgoing CEOs who are family members

(and therefore large stockholders) probably wielded more power than

a traditional executive CEO, so questioning decisions made by the

outgoing CEO should be done with special care and consideration.

At Gera, the observe stage was when we knew for sure that we had

hired the right person as our new CEO. Gulzar engaged fully in company

meetings, and while he was willing to advance his proposals through

vigorous debate, he respected and embraced all perspectives (including

those of the controlling family) as a consummate team player.

By the fourth phase, own, your new CEO should be feeling like a leader

and gradually taking over daily management and accountability. The

new leader should be supervising their direct reports and implementing

their own processes for supervising the areas of the company outside

their direct control. As the month progresses, the outgoing CEO should

meet less frequently with the new CEO, and eventually only as needed

Even as the incoming CEO takes the helm, they must have awareness

of how the power dynamics may be diﬀerent in a family-controlled

## company. In a business without family shareholders, an exiting CEO

typically leaves immediately, or may remain on the board for a short

period. In a family-owned business, it’s common for an outgoing CEO

to stay on as an executive chairman or board member. Indeed, at Gera,

after Rohit stepped down as CEO, he remained a full-time managing director. Although he vacated the CEO’s oﬃce and moved to a diﬀerent

part of the headquarters to give his successor literal and ﬁgurative

space, he remained an inﬂuential voice.

## By the ﬁfth phase, evaluate, the new CEO’s transition into their role

should be complete, and it’s time for them to be given the latitude

necessary to evaluate the company’s needs and pursue them boldly.

While it can be helpful for the outgoing CEO to remain reachable for

consultation, by this phase, the new CEO should be in charge. As the

new CEO becomes accountable for performance, they must be aware

that performance may be judged diﬀerently in a family-controlled

company. While public company CEOs are typically measured by

total shareholder return (TSR), family-owned businesses may prioritize

## growth of dividends, development of next-generation family members

who have management potential, or the company’s reputation within

the community. So as they think about performance, CEOs must learn

# which metrics matter.

At Gera, one of the changes we made during the evaluate change was

the format and frequency of monthly reviews. In moving to a hands-

oﬀ role, Rohit felt the need to be in the know of what was going on

monthly. Previously, the leadership team had held a half-day review

once a month. Under Rohit’s successor, that shifted to four half-days of

review per month, with three of those days doing in-depth reviews of

# speciﬁc teams.

On that note, a word of caution. One of the hardest things about

onboarding a new CEO is the reluctance of outgoing CEOs to let go

of the reins. Having played the role of outgoing CEO himself, Rohit

knows how hard it is, particularly if the outgoing CEO is remaining at

the company in a diﬀerent capacity, as he did. But letting go is vital.

The new CEO will have a diﬀerent perspective on the company than

the outgoing CEO does and will inevitably recommend changes the

outgoing CEO would not recommend. It is important to accept that this

is the new CEO’s job. For the new leader to gain the respect of both the

executive team and family shareholders, they must have the freedom to

make decisions and, yes, to make mistakes. Things will turn out alright.

After all, this is why they were hired.
