Last year, for the ﬁrst time in two decades, the gender wage gap

widened, with men’s median earnings rising 3% while women’s grew

only 1.5%. This backsliding surprised some, in part because it deﬁes

widely held beliefs in the U.S. that social progress unfolds automatically

and steadily over time. Such conventional wisdom holds that each

successive generation will become more egalitarian and enjoy more

opportunities than the last. According to this view, reaching gender

equality is “inevitable”; it just takes time.

But the research tells a diﬀerent story. In fact, social scientists ﬁnd that

the movement toward gender equality has actually stalled in recent

decades: Women’s labor force participation has leveled oﬀ, men and

women remain concentrated into diﬀerent occupations, and women

continue to shoulder signiﬁcantly more housework and childcare than

# men.

This slow — even stagnant — pace of change is a key ﬁnding

## from the new 2024 Women in the Workplace 10th anniversary report

by LeanIn.org and McKinsey & Company. The report, which we co-

authored, provides a 10-year lookback at the state of women in

corporate America. It draws on data from more than 1,000 companies

## and over 480,000 employees in professional jobs from the entry level to

# the C-suite.

The report gives corporate America a mixed scorecard over the past

decade. On the one hand, women have made important gains in

## representation at every level of the corporate pipeline, especially in

senior leadership. But those gains are fragile. Even at this current rate of

progress, it will still take almost 50 years to reach parity for all women in

corporate America — and that’s if everything goes right, which it almost

never does. As Ruchika T. Malhotra discussed in her HBR article “How

## Work Has Changed for Women in Corporate America Over the Last 10

Years,” there’s concern that the next decade may not bring as much

# progress as the last one.

## Why Reaching Gender Equality Will Take More Than Time

Our team uncovered even less progress when it came to women’s

lived experiences in the workplace. And most concerningly, we found

almost no improvements across generations. In fact, not only are the

experiences of women under 30 similar to those of women 50 and older

— in some ways, they’re worse. Companies must do more to address the

distinct obstacles that stall women’s progress early in their careers. Here

are some troubling ﬁndings from the research, as well as speciﬁc actions

companies can take to better support the next generation of women

# leaders.

Younger women get stuck at entry level.

Younger women continue to encounter workplace barriers from the get-

go. Women are underrepresented from the start of their careers, making

up just 48% of entry-level employees despite holding 59% of bachelor’s

# degrees.

Soon after, they run up against a “broken rung”: Compared to men,

they’re far less likely to get their ﬁrst promotion to manager. This

gender gap has not improved much over time. In 2018, 79 women were

promoted to manager for every 100 men. This year, just 81 women were.

Sexual harassment is a persistent problem.

Disturbingly, sexual harassment remains as prevalent in corporate

America as it was six years ago, suggesting that even in the wake of

#MeToo, bad behavior and misconduct persist in the workplace. Indeed,

despite younger women’s much shorter tenures, a third of them have

experienced some form of sexual harassment over the course of their

careers — the same as older women.

Younger women do a disproportionate amount of housework and childcare.

Things are at a standstill on the home front as well, with younger

women with partners reporting that they’re doing the same amount of

housework and childcare as older women. Across the generations, over

a third of women with partners continue to take on most or all of the

# household responsibilities.

Younger women face ageism.

Finally, younger women are the most likely to confront ageism at work.

While unfair treatment based on a person’s age is most commonly

thought to harm older adults, we found that “youngism” is just as

signiﬁcant a problem. Almost half of younger women say their age has

negatively impacted their careers — that’s more than any other age

group. And younger women are nearly twice as likely as younger men

to report unwanted attention being drawn to their age. Ageism impacts

older employees, too, but to a lesser extent, and older men and older

women experience it at fairly similar rates.

Given the current state of aﬀairs, perhaps it’s not surprising that

younger women are twice as likely as older women to say their gender

will make it harder for them to get ahead.

Younger men don’t prioritize gender equity.

What’s more, the next generation of men doesn’t appear to be pushing

for change. While the younger women in our study stand out as the

most committed to gender and racial diversity issues, younger men are

clearly the least. And over the past ﬁve years, the percentage of younger

men who claim gender and racial diversity as high personal priorities

also declined signiﬁcantly. This is all consistent with other research

suggesting that Gen Z men may care even less about gender equality

# than their older counterparts.

# What Companies Should Do

It’s not only younger men whose commitments to diversity are

declining; companies’ commitments are also the lowest they have been

in years. This deprioritization is worrisome given our report’s stark

reminder that gender equality won’t simply be achieved by the passage

of time. Indeed, what history shows us is that social change requires

deliberate and sustained eﬀorts. Thus, instead of scaling back, it’s

incumbent on companies to continue to push forward and take action.

All too often, eﬀorts to advance women are targeted at the C-suite. But

achieving gender parity in corporate America demands action at the

# beginning of the pipeline as well.

Companies should start by monitoring representation at every level.

Using existing data, they can determine whether or not women are

underrepresented at the entry level and if so, why. Adopting tried-

and-true approaches, like inclusive hiring and recruiting, can help

companies ensure that younger women are entering the workforce at

# rates equitable to younger men.

Second, companies need to address the broken rung, given that the

greatest barrier to women ascending to the top is getting stuck at the

entry level. Fixing the broken rung will require that companies take a

closer look at their people processes to ensure fairness. Best practices

involve tracking promotion rates by gender, race, and level to uncover

hidden barriers, then working to mitigate and block the biases that

can drive gender and racial disparities in performance evaluations and

# promotion rates.

Third, companies need to broaden the conversation about ageism to

include youngism. As companies work to foster a culture of respect and

inclusion, they should address the distinct microaggressions and biases

that younger women face at work and how these may undermine their

advancement. When interviewed about their workplace experiences for

this report, younger women talked about not being taken seriously and

having their ideas ignored, which speaks to the ways in which women’s

leadership potential is often overlooked and dismissed.

. . .

Rather than subscribing to the conventional — and incorrect — wisdom

that social progress is inevitable, it’s time for organizations to step up

and do the real, hard work required to achieve it. If we want daughters to

have it better than their mothers and grandmothers, we need to take oﬀ

our rose-colored glasses and roll up our sleeves.
