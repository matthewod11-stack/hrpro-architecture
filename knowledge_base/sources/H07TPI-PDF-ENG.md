While many managers are attempting to improve inequalities facing

employees by implementing diversity, equity, and inclusion (DEI)

policies, these policies often have unexpected, negative consequences

for the employees — including those the policies are trying to help. How

can managers avoid this?

My research shows that there is a need to take a systems-level view of

inequality when implementing DEI policies. That is, when designing

and implementing a policy, managers must consider how it will

## reverberate throughout the organization — and how it might ultimately

# backﬁre.

# The Policy

At the midsize American professional services organization I studied,

leaders had the well-intentioned aim of implementing a ﬂexible work

policy that allowed employees more control over where and when they

worked. The company was already considered life- and family-friendly

by employees, and leaders wanted to cement this, both because it would

help current employees’ well-being and also because it could provide

the company with a competitive edge in hiring. Leaders also recognized

that these policies could help women in particular, because at this

professional organization — as in many others — women performed

# more family care than men.

Once the policy was rolled out, it did in fact help many employees.

And as anticipated, I found that the policy helped women in particular

integrate and balance work and life demands. For instance, it helped

them break up their schedule and spend more time with their kids, and

lessen the time they spent commuting so they could spend time with

# family.

# The Problem

However, what the organization’s leaders — and I — did not anticipate

was how the ﬂexible work policy harmed a speciﬁc group of women:

women managers. This was despite the fact that these managers were

almost all very vocal supporters of improving gender equality, and had

advocated for and supported a wide variety of other women- and family-

friendly initiatives, including backup childcare, onsite daycare, and a

# women speaker series.

How did this happen? My research found that many women managers

had developed a managerial style focused on close, day-to-day

interactions with subordinates. For instance, many would regularly

stop by the oﬃces of each of their subordinates daily, asking them how they were doing and if they could oﬀer any help or guidance

with their work. Others would work with their doors open so that

subordinates could stop by their oﬃce whenever they needed help. Employees appreciated these managers’ eﬀorts, not only because they

provided more immediate task-based assistance but also because, over

time, these managers came to know their employees very well and could oﬀer custom-tailored advice on project staﬃng, career training, and so

# on.

Importantly, the women managers did not develop this managerial style

in a vacuum. Rather, it seemed to reﬂect stereotypes they faced on the

job: They experienced pressure to be helpful and communal, rather than

## direct and assertive like their male manager counterparts.

The problem from the women managers’ perspective was that the

ﬂexible work policy would make the style they had developed diﬃcult to

maintain. While video calls were an option, managers did not view them

as an easy or natural way to spark interaction. Others pointed out that with their subordinates working diﬀerent schedules with varied hours,

this meant that they needed to be available at a broader range of hours

as well if they were to remain available and helpful to their workers. Not

only would this be diﬃcult for anyone to do, it also threatened to make

women managers’ own work-life conﬂict much worse because it made it

hard for them to have time with their own families.

# HBR / Digital Article / How to Avoid the Unexpected Consequences of Your DEI Policy

While my research was speciﬁcally on gender, what I found was

consistent with other research that emphasizes the need to consider the whole organization to eﬀectively implement a DEI eﬀort, as well as

research that highlights the importance of considering how individuals

## engage and interact with one another within the organizational system.

This is in addition, of course, to considering other important causes of

## DEI policy failure, such as various individual-level biases.

## Avoiding Unexpected Consequences from Your DEI Policy

Given that DEI policies can reverberate in organizations in unexpected

## ways — and potentially undermine hard-won progress on equity-

and equality-related outcomes — it is important for managers to

anticipate such issues. My research, and complementary research by

other scholars (some of which I detail below) presents three key

suggestions for how managers can limit the chance of their policies

backﬁring. These suggestions are all rooted in taking a systems-level

view of inequality when designing and implementing DEI policies.

- 1. Consider subgroups.

When designing a DEI policy, think about variation within the group

of people the policy is aimed at helping. In my research, there was an important diﬀerence between the experiences of most women

employees (who beneﬁted from the policy) and women managers (who

were harmed).

As another example, imagine if managers attempted to help Black

employees through creating a peer mentorship program. This program

might provide vital help, advice, and connection at work for enrolled

Black employees, who researchers ﬁnds are much less likely to have

internal sponsors when compared to white workers, despite the fact that

such aid is vital for career success. However, if there are relatively few

senior Black employees in a company — a common occurrence given

## historical patterns of systemic racism — then these few employees may

each have many mentees. The unexpected, unanticipated result may

be that senior Black employees end up spending a lot of time coaching

junior Black employees instead of focusing on pushing their own careers

# forward.

The lesson here is not that DEI policies should not be introduced, of

course. It is that with better planning, such negative results can be

anticipated and curbed. And once noticed — whether this is before

or even after rollout — solutions can be found. For instance, in our

example, could senior Black employees be relieved of other “helping”

duties so common in organizations to free up more of their time? Or

could these employees be given more “glamor work” to help them

shine? In general, the point here is to not think about a given group

— women, LGBTQ+ people, Black people, and so on — monolithically,

but rather to recognize the varying organizational ranks, roles, and tasks

## of employees as well as their intersectional identities.

- 2. Think big.

## A systems-level perspective draws attention to the fact that the

interactions and connections between people in organizations are

diverse and complex. As my research demonstrates, when policies

reverberate, they can harm groups or subgroups in ways that are

entirely unanticipated by organizational leaders and policy designers.

For instance, well-intentioned “ban the box” initiatives aimed at

preventing discrimination against people with criminal records — and

adopted by many companies and mandated in over a hundred states,

cities, and counties in the United States — have also been found to

in some cases increase racial discrimination against Black applicants,

because when these policies are in place, it seems employers are more

likely to incorrectly presume Black applicants have a criminal past.

Again, the solution here is not to disavow DEI policies. Rather, it is

important to think big when considering how policies could potentially

## result in unexpected negative consequences for workers, because you

never know where or when such consequences will arise. To do this,

gather a diverse group of employees to brainstorm what potential

challenges could come about from the introduction of a new DEI policy.

Also read about and research the experiences of other companies that

have implemented similar policies, to see what (if any) unintended

consequences may have arisen through their policy adoption.

- 3. Track closely. Monitor the policy as it is being rolled out for any negative eﬀects on employees. There are diﬀerent layers to monitoring. One is to get immediate, qualitative feedback on employees’ experiences through

focus groups or anonymous suggestion boxes that let employees provide

comments without fear of backlash. Longer term, it is important

to analyze internal administrative data to check that there are no

concerning or unexpected patterns. This includes looking to see if there

is variation between groups or subgroups (e.g., women versus men, or

## black women versus white women) on important markers of individual

## career success such as performance evaluations, salary, bonuses, and

# promotions.

Some organizations have even started piloting their DEI initiatives before rolling them out organization-wide, and such eﬀorts can

improve policy quality by identifying issues before the policy has even

been oﬃcially implemented. Ericsson, a global telecommunications

company, tested a policy intervention aimed at improving women’s

interest in internal job openings. This testing helped Ericsson identify

the message that seemed most likely to decrease the gender gap.

And before rolling out a ﬂexible work policy more broadly, Boston

Consulting Group tested it with smaller groups of consultants. Here, it is

important to collect data on employees’ experiences at baseline (before

rollout) to compare with their experiences after policy implementation

- • •

DEI policies remain important ways to achieve positive improvements

in equality within organizations. These three steps — which take a

systems-level view of inequality — are purposeful, meaningful changes that managers can enact to design eﬀective and impactful DEI policies.

Of course, the research I present here is just a starting point. More is needed — particularly that accounts for diﬀerent actors’ perspectives

and the connections between them — to understand how DEI policies

can be designed to best help employees.
