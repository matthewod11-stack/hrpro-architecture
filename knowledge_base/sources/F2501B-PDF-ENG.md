Why do incompetent people end up in positions of power? A team

of researchers led by Stanford University’s Shilaan Alzahawi thinks

it has at least part of the answer. The team asked 472 participants

at an executive education program to self-report their level of

ambition. The participants were then rated by peers, subordinates,

managers, and themselves on 10 leadership competencies, including

their ability to motivate others, manage collaborative work, coach

and develop people, and present and communicate ideas. The results

showed no relationship between ambition and leadership aptitude. The

conclusion: Just because you want to lead doesn’t mean you should.

Shilaan Alzahawi, defend your research.

Alzahawi: At ﬁrst, our research ﬁndings surprised us. Social scientists

have long believed that hierarchies are prevalent in society because they

are functional, meaning that groups allocate higher status to members

who contribute most to group success. Research led by Cameron

## Anderson, a professor at the Haas School of Business at the University

of California, Berkeley, reinforces this view: It found that people’s

perceptions of their own status in groups tend to be very accurate and

that individuals seek out a higher rank only if they believe they can

provide more value to a group. We would expect, therefore, that more-

competent people would have greater leadership ambition. But when we

considered how many incompetent people end up running companies,

schools, even countries, we realized, “Yeah, maybe leadership ambition

is not a perfectly eﬃcient predictor of competence.”

HBR: When incompetent people rise to levels that they can’t handle, doesn’t the organization give them that feedback?

Established research dating back to the 1960s shows that humans seek

out positive feedback and avoid and rationalize negative feedback. We

also are reluctant to give people bad news; instead of giving it to people

straight, we sugarcoat it. In the workplace, this leaves many employees

with an inﬂated sense of their own abilities—which might convince

them that they belong in a leadership role. Such misperceptions are

often compounded by what is called motivated reasoning: Leadership

roles come with large increases in compensation, autonomy, and status,

and the desire for those things can cause people to arrive at conclusions

about themselves that may not be accurate.

Your study involved managers in an executive education program at an elite U.S. university. Perhaps that group of people was just particularly overconﬁdent?

To avoid selection bias, we ran an additional study that was

## representative of U.S. adults in terms of gender, age, location, race

and ethnicity, and income. We asked participants about their level of

ambition, and their responses showed more variation than those of

the executives. Next, we randomly assigned participants to either a

leader role or a team-member role. After a leadership simulation, the

leaders were evaluated by the other team members. Again, we found no

## correlation between leadership ambition and competence.

What makes ambitious people more likely to be promoted to leadership positions?

In low-information environments like job interviews, it’s hard to

gauge a person’s leadership skills. Hiring managers might misread

an attribute like ambition as a signal of competence. For example,

because ambitious individuals exhibit motivation, dedication, and determination, interviewers assume that they will be more eﬀective

and thus are more likely to select those candidates for leadership roles.

Further, ambitious individuals are more likely to opt in to opportunities

for promotion, thereby increasing the odds that they will get ahead.

Your studies relied on subjective ratings rather than objective results. Is it possible that ambitious individuals are simply less liked than people with less ambition?

In our supplemental study, we randomly assigned participants to

either be in charge of a decision-making task (hiring a new chief

ﬁnancial oﬃcer from a set of ﬁnalists) or be a subordinate group

## member. Unbeknownst to the leaders or the group, various pieces of

information about the candidates were distributed among individual team members; each person had a diﬀerent piece of the puzzle. The

scenario looked at whether the leaders were able to surface the hidden information by eﬀectively guiding the group discussion. Using this

more objective measure, we again found strong evidence against a

## relationship between ambition and leadership aptitude.

Leadership demands sacriﬁce—a willingness to put in long hours, take responsibility for failures, and so on. Does ambition become more valuable over time if it drives leaders to “stick with it” when less ambitious leaders might give up?

Perhaps, but over time organizations receive more and more

information about a leader’s behavior and performance, so ambition

is likely to become less relevant to staying in power. But this is just

speculation—it’s a good area for future research. On a side note, I’m

from the Netherlands, where we prize work-life balance, so I’m not sure I agree that eﬀective leadership requires putting in particularly long

# hours.

Fair point. Does the research suggest a better way to select leaders?

We recommend that institutions de-emphasize ambition as a factor

in the selection process. Instead, they should focus on attributes that are known to predict leadership eﬀectiveness, such as intelligence and

sociability. Further, they should solicit a wider, more representative

pool of applicants and ﬁnd ways to target and inspire individuals who

have low ambition and high leadership potential.

Is there a risk that you will force people into leadership roles that they don’t want?

I don’t think forcing people into leadership roles is a sustainable

solution. However, there may be many people who would be perfectly

capable leaders but lack conﬁdence or just don’t recognize themselves

in the leaders they see around them. When discussing our research,

people often share with us that they know people who ﬁt that

description. Given the chance, those individuals may ﬂourish. We hope

that workplaces ﬁnd ways to target these low-visibility, high-potential

employees and boost their conﬁdence so that they don’t opt out of

# leadership opportunities in the future.
