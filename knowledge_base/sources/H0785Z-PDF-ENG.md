Organizations succeed over time only when they adapt to the speed and

character of external change. Every aspect of an organization — from

how it operates and is structured to how it is led — must match the

current yet ever-shifting context in which it exists.

As the world changes at a faster pace than ever before, companies must

change more rapidly as well. Yet the practices, structures, and behaviors

at many large companies are not designed for such responsiveness. A

century ago companies implemented such approaches because control,

consistency, and predictability were top concerns; core competencies

were cherished foundations to build on; and leaders viewed the world

from inside the organization looking out.

To thrive today, however, companies must be able to detect external

changes from the outside in and have a built-in ﬂuidity so they can

continually adapt. They need to focus on individual customers, make

their core competencies dynamic, and rely on teams instead of a

hierarchy — all by using the power of data and algorithms.

As we look back on a century of Harvard Business Review, we should

also take time to look ahead — and recognize what the next iteration of

a successful organization looks like.

# Where the Organization Has Been

Since its founding, HBR has sought answers to fundamental questions

such as these: What’s the best way to organize a business? What is the

right structure, and how should day-to-day decisions be made?

About a century ago Henry Ford had a world-changing answer to

these questions. He built a business around top-down management

and assembly line mass production. By standardizing his automobiles

and the steps taken to manufacture them, he lowered the cost per unit

across the entire end-to-end value chain. That innovation, combined

with his decision to raise workers’ pay to $5 per day, was adopted by

other companies. This change drove industrial activity — making it

possible for millions more people to own and enjoy everything from

cars to Coca-Cola — and raised living standards around the world. Even

as Ford’s company grew, though, its structure remained the same: a

hierarchy in which business decisions were made in the C-suite and

functions reported up to the president and chief executive.

## HBR / The Big Idea / What Defines a Successful Organization?

## Alfred P. Sloan, Jr., CEO of Ford’s major competitor, General Motors

(GM), decided to pursue a new strategy by oﬀering diﬀerent makes and

models of cars for every budget in a range of styles and colors. GM

used consumer research to segment the market, but it always kept the

focus on markets large enough to ensure the manufacturing would be

cost-eﬀective. To manage multiple products and brands, Sloan realized

that GM needed a diﬀerent organizational structure too — one with

divisions that each had a top leader responsible for proﬁt and loss (P&L).

After World War II, large companies became even larger as they

extended their sales and production and built networks of suppliers

(what we now call “ecosystems”) in countries and even on continents

other than their own. Many multinational corporations adopted a

P&L organization structure to maintain control of their sprawling

# businesses.

In the 1950s, as industrial manufacturer General Electric (GE) prepared

to adopt a P&L structure, it consulted with leading management thinker

Peter Drucker, who pointed out that executives would need training to

make the new system work. That led GE to create a 16-week course on

how to be a general manager, birthing its now-famous training center

in Crotonville, New York. Soon after, Harvard Business School created

an Advanced Management Program course (which I taught for 30 years),

and consulting ﬁrms created product lines around leadership training.

Companies continued to expand in size, breadth, and hierarchical

levels, yet they also needed to coordinate across their existing

structures. A host of companies — including TRW, Bechtel, Citibank,

and Texas Instruments — began to use a matrix arrangement in which

reporting relationships and accountability were shared across product,

# functional, and geographic structures.

In the 1990s, of course, the internet changed everything. Marc

Andreessen co-created a browser that made the web useful for

commercial purposes, coders began developing software and then

algorithms to make decisions more quickly than humans can, and

computer processing capacity became increasingly cheaper and more

# powerful.

Jeﬀ Bezos saw the internet growing at 2,300% per annum, left his

job at investment ﬁrm DE Shaw, and founded an online bookstore

called Amazon, which has since morphed into not just the “everything

store” but also the leading provider of web services to a host of other

# companies.

## What Makes a Successful Organization, According to HBR Readers

An organization that not only delivers on customers’ expectations today but also caters to their future, undiscovered demands.

# — Sahil, Riyadh, Saudi Arabia

An organization is successful when people enjoy waking up in the morning

to dedicate their skills and time to deliver the organization’s value.…Its

purpose and outcomes are human- and planet-centric, desirable and

## responsible, and innovative and versatile.

## — Daniela, Lisbon, Portugal, and Berlin, Germany

An organization that can satisfy a need in society and at the same time

provides satisfaction to employees in terms of purpose, compensation, and

# challenge.

# — Ricardo, Tijuana, Mexico

Understanding how people, process, and tech fit together, then enabling

## those for the benefit of the customer and society.

## HBR / The Big Idea / What Defines a Successful Organization?

A successful organization is one that considers all stakeholders in

decision-making — employees, customers, the community, shareholders,

and suppliers. The organization is not afraid to engage with stakeholders in

# two-way communications.

# — Kimberly, Brooklyn, New York, USA

An organization works to help employees have the right balance between

# work and family time.

# — Andrés, Bogotá, Colombia

# Goal-driven, not trend-driven.

# — William, Tokyo, Japan

An organization is successful when it can quickly adapt to give its

workforce what it needs as society and the economy change.  — Ute, Holle, Germany

These are lightly edited responses to a survey that HBR editors shared with

# Where the Organization Is Now

Bezos discovered early what every twenty-ﬁrst-century leader should

now know: We have entered an age of discontinuity in which breaks in

the external world are deeper and more frequent, rendering prevailing

organizational structures and practices ineﬀective, if not harmful.

Successful organizations exploit those changes, as Amazon has since

its inception, and take advantage of what’s new.

Current realities make it imperative that companies shift in several

# ways:

- 1. From mass market to markets of one. Bezos recognized that an online

retailer could oﬀer far more choices than a local shop could, along with

the convenience of delivery right to the customer’s home — all at a

lower cost. This kind of aﬀordable personalization and service was a

new value proposition. What’s more, each transaction provided Amazon

with data that its algorithmic engine could analyze to ensure that future

oﬀerings were better tailored to each consumer’s preferences, needs,

and desires, or what I call “markets of one.”

Businesses that use technology to predict and personalize what a vast

number of individuals want at low incremental cost can scale up and

increase cash gross margins. Companies that don’t make this shift will

ﬁnd it hard to compete.

- 2. From building on core competencies to routinely replacing them.

The conventional wisdom has been that companies should use their

core competencies to sustain a competitive advantage. But in an age of

## discontinuity, this approach doesn’t work for long.

Leaders of every company today must ask these questions: Given

changing external realities, is this core competence becoming less

important or irrelevant? Do we still need to expend resources to support

it, or are there new competencies we need to build and shift resources

# toward?

Right now, for example, if you don’t have a core competence in using

algorithms, you will need to acquire or develop this capacity. Amazon

eclipsed many retailers that were too slow to adapt, but now we

see brick-and-mortar competitors such as Walmart building their data

# analytics and e-commerce capabilities.

Recruiting the right people and deploying them in ways that allow them

to apply their expertise and energy are core competencies themselves

and critical in the age of discontinuity. In an escalating war for talent,

businesses that are the most skilled in acquiring and developing these

competencies will have a distinct competitive advantage.

- 3. From hierarchical layers to a team-based structure. Nearly every

company needs to reduce the hierarchical layers that have accumulated

in their organizations over time and channel more work to teams.

The beneﬁts of doing so are manifold. When teams include people who

are on the front lines, the information ﬂow is both faster and more

accurate; with this increased speed comes greater ﬂexibility to respond

to customer and market changes. The improved ﬂow of information also

creates transparency that removes a lot of organizational politics and

# encourages collaboration.

Fidelity Investments, the ﬁnancial services ﬁrm, recently restructured

its personal investing group in a team format. Each team has a clear

mission and much autonomy in how to accomplish it. The roughly

5,000-person organization now has just three layers below the president

and operates at lower cost and with shorter cycle times for innovation.

The control function that managerial layers used to perform is now

done through software that generates detailed metrics. Reports are

produced 24/7 and highlight any red ﬂags in the data.

- 4. From inside-out to outside-in management. To keep a company

competitive over the long term, leaders must know what is happening

far beyond their own industry, geography, and existing customers.

the best talent. Today, for example, it is impossible to ignore the

tricky issues raised by China’s intermixing of business and the Chinese

Communist Party, which has a presence in every major Chinese

# company.

Business leaders need a wide lens and a routine for detecting early-

warning signals of external changes. Some leaders set aside 10 minutes

in every team meeting to discuss any new dynamics people are

observing, sometimes prompted by a newspaper article or an outside

event. When leaders repeatedly ask, “What’s new?” — as Jack Welch

used to do when he was CEO of GE — they can help the organization

develop an awareness of subtle shifts that might indicate where things

are heading. The goal of such vigilance is to get the organization ready

for change so it’s poised to drop what won’t work in the near future and

# jump on new opportunities.

# The Path Ahead

Amazon is not alone in its adaptation to the age of discontinuity, but it

continues to lead the charge, always reinvesting in its future.

Others must choose: Adapt or die. Some may be getting a late start

in developing technologically driven personalization, dynamic core

## competencies, ﬂatter and team-based hierarchies, and an outside-in

focus. In many industries and geographies, however, there is still ample

opportunity to build the structures and processes that take advantage of

the new external realities. As companies start on that task, they should

recognize that the best way to organize and manage a business is always

changing — and that the answers to fundamental questions may be very

diﬀerent 100 years from now than they are today.
