Is Bad Onboarding Stifling Your New Senior Leaders? You hired them for a fresh perspective. Don’t force them to conform to the status quo. by Ron Ashkenas

There’s a problem inherent in the onboarding of new leaders into an

# organization.

Onboarding is traditionally understood to be a process of orienting

new employees to the existing people, rules, culture, norms, processes,

procedures, and behaviors that they will need to be successful in their

new job. The implication is that the organization works a certain way,

and the new employee needs to adjust to ﬁt in.

As a leader, however, your job is to continually improve your

organization. That’s probably why you were hired for the job: From

the organization’s point of view, bringing in new leaders (from outside

the existing team or organization) is one of the best ways to create

change and impact. New senior people bring fresh perspectives that can

challenge existing assumptions and renewed energy for making things

# happen.

Unfortunately, many senior onboarding processes discourage incoming

leaders from accomplishing these goals, however unintentionally,

because of the focus they place on ﬁtting in. It’s already an uphill battle

for new leaders to question the status quo: Natural psychology leads us

to want to belong to a social group and go along with colleagues just to

ﬁt in. The typical onboarding process emphasizes just how important

that status quo is and makes questioning it even harder.

The challenge is also a matter of simple time management. The typical

## crash course about a complex organization often results in information

## overload even for the best and most brilliant leaders, and, more

importantly, crowds out time for the new leader to reﬂect on what

they’re seeing and hearing and to have constructive dialogue about their

observations. But if they aren’t able to do that early on, they’ll be more

likely to accept the way things are done without question.

One new leader that I worked with, for example, was given a schedule

of back-to-back meetings for his ﬁrst month that included required

HR brieﬁngs, online compliance training, IT tutorials, meetings with

## direct reports (individually and as a team), meetings with heads of other

## functions, divisional all-hands meetings, and introductory meetings

with senior executives. (This is pretty typical, and often paired with

required travel to diﬀerent sites.)

At the end of the month, not only was he exhausted, but he was worried

that the kinds of changes he had initially thought about making were so

radical that they would face stiﬀ resistance and would need to be toned

down. So instead of starting oﬀ with conﬁdence, he began to doubt his

ability to change the status quo.

So what’s the alternative? How can your organization onboard leaders

in a way that fosters impact and not just integration? From my 30 years

coaching senior leaders and advising large companies about innovation

initiatives, I’ve seen three solutions that work. These can be deployed

# individually or together.

Set a short-term challenge

Setting a 100-day, short-term results challenge for the new person

right from the beginning can help them get oriented while achieving

something of real value. This could be streamlining or strengthening

a key process or helping a sales team increase uptake for a particular

product, for example. Then, shape the onboarding process around this

goal. Have the leader get to know primarily the people and processes

that are critical for achieving it, rather than trying to meet everyone

and learn everything about the organization. This is impossible anyway

— and there is always time to meet the others later. (Michael Watkins

is one among many who have written extensively about how the ﬁrst

100-odd days are critical for new employees to make an impact.)

For example, several years ago the CEO of a global engineering ﬁrm brought in a new chief human resources oﬃcer from outside the

industry; I’ll call him Rick (not his real name). Although experienced in

HR, Rick was a ﬁrst-time CHRO and came into the job with a mandate to

transform the company’s HR function — everything from building more eﬃcient processes and strengthening data-driven decision making to

creating partnerships with business units and upgrading the talent

review cycle. He had a lot to learn.

The CEO recognized that bringing Rick up to speed on every aspect of

the business involved in these items would require extensive education

and would keep him from making meaningful progress on any of them

for six to 12 months at best. So instead, the CEO suggested that Rick

spend his ﬁrst three months focused on just one aspect of the talent

review cycle: improving the talent assessment process.

To do this, Rick still had to meet his team and other leaders and

learn about the business, but he did so with an eye toward reshaping

the way successors and top talents were identiﬁed, and how plans for

development and retention were put in place. Within his ﬁrst 100 days,

he was able to create a much more professional talent process for the

company and the board — and he also learned a lot about the company

in the process. With that knowledge, and a better understanding of

what it took to make change happen in the company, Rick then was

able to better shape his plans and priorities for the next 100 days and

beyond. In this way, onboarding became a form of continuous learning

## and improvement, rather than a one-time exercise.

Customize around a question

A second approach is to ask the new leader to identify the most

important things they want to learn about the business and the

## organization and shape much of their onboarding around this. Most

high-level people who take new positions have done enough due

diligence about their new role that they have a number of smart

questions or areas that they are curious about, or assumptions they

want to test. So rather than force the new person to learn what you think

is important only, build the onboarding curriculum together.

Not long ago, for example, a health care company brought in a new

divisional CEO, whom I’ll call Esme (both the company and the CEO

have been disguised). The ﬁrm set up an extensive schedule of site

## visits, individual meetings, and group sessions as part of the onboarding

# for Esme.

Before running the gauntlet of all these meetings, however, Esme

paused the process and asked the outgoing CEO (who was still with

the company) to help her set up three half-day working sessions with

him and the appropriate people. The agenda of the ﬁrst was to go

through the divisional business strategy, how it was developed, what

assumptions were made, what data was used, etc. The second session

focused on key customers for the division: what they bought, what else

they wanted, who had the key relationships, and how proﬁtable their

business was. And the third session was about the new CEO’s direct

reports: a candid assessment of their performance, tenure in the job,

# career aspirations, etc.

With these sessions behind her, Esme started to go out and meet her

people with a much better understanding of what questions to ask

and what to look for. She was consequently able to develop a plan for

accelerating the division’s proﬁtability in weeks rather than months.

# Ask for critical observations

The third alternative is to ask the new person to keep a diary of

observations from each meeting and each day. Then set up a time for

them to make a presentation to you, or perhaps you and your leadership

team, about what they’ve learned, what didn’t make sense, what they

have seen done diﬀerently in previous jobs, and so on. This gives the

new person permission to think critically and to explore alternatives as

a normal part of the process. It also helps the leader to develop a change

# agenda right from the beginning.

For example, a new head of pre-clinical research for a division of a

pharmaceutical company made extensive daily notes during her ﬁrst

two months on the job and reviewed them every week with a trusted

colleague from outside R&D to help identify recurring themes. She

then organized her observations into a draft set of presentation slides

## about key opportunities for accelerated drug development, such as

more targeted use of computational science, better criteria for stopping

## projects, and a more intensive focus on new target identiﬁcation. This

presentation then became the basis for a series of discussions with her

boss, the overall head of R&D, and a number of other colleagues. By the

end of her ﬁrst 90 days, she had a focused and prioritized agenda for

change and already had buy-in from the key leaders in her area.

. . .

Whenever a new senior leader joins an organization, either from within

or from an external ﬁrm, they bring fresh perspectives, new ideas, and

energy for change. To take full advantage of these qualities, don’t mire

them in endless learning about the organization as it is now. Instead,

challenge them to ﬁnd opportunities for learning that will help them

# shape the future.
