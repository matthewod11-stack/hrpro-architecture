A lot of research has already been done on the signiﬁcant contribution

## of immigrant scientists and engineers to the U.S. innovation system. Less

research, however, has been done on the presence of migrant and

immigrant leadership in corporate America. While there has been some

research done on ethnic minorities’ representation in senior corporate

roles in the U.S. — for example the study of the ethnic composition of

## boards in corporate America by Richie Zweigenhaft — studies of

immigrant leadership talent are still scarce. This is despite the fact that

many well-known CEOs of American companies are immigrants, such as

## Elon Musk (Tesla), Sergey Brin (Google), Satya Nadella (Microsoft), and

# Dara Khosrowshahi (Expedia and Uber).

This lack of study is particularly troubling given that nearly 60% of

American companies are facing leadership talent shortages that are

impeding their performance. As of 2009, U.S. companies spent 24% of

their budget training on leadership development. This shortage is expected

to worsen given that demographic change in the U.S. and other advanced

economies is shrinking the size of the key age group (age 35-55) from

which leadership will emerge.

In short, we need to better understand the contributions immigrants make

as leaders in corporate America, as well as the paths they take to get there.

To shed light on these questions, we used name matching techniques. As

part of our research for a forthcoming INSEAD working paper, we made

use of data from the U.S. Security Exchange Commission and applied

name matching techniques (ﬁrst and surnames) to ﬁrst identify the ethnic

background of individual corporate executives. We then tracked down

their educational background, particularly whether they are U.S. or

foreign-educated, and the sector and industry in which they work. We

treat the location of an executive’s ﬁrst degree as a proxy for country of

origin; an executive who received their ﬁrst degree in India but now leads

## a U.S. company qualiﬁes in our data as an immigrant, whereas an

individual of Indian descent whose ﬁrst degree was from a U.S. university

does not. We focused on foreign-trained talent of Chinese, Indian, and

Middle Eastern descent. We chose these groups because our methods

make it easier to identify members of these communities through name-

# matching.

While this technique is not without its ﬂaws, our name-matching

techniques are robust enough to capture most individuals within a speciﬁc

ethnicity. It’s true that some immigrants could have arrived young to the

U.S. and enrolled in U.S. universities before they launched their careers.

# HBR / Digital Article / What the Data Tells Us About Immigrant Executives in the U.S.

Our analysis would not count them as immigrants, therefore our estimates

can be considered a lower bound on immigrants’ contribution to U.S.

# executive leadership.

We had access to other details about these individuals, so we could

double-check instances of potential overlaps or errors. We could also

double-check the information about the individual on the internet to verify

in case of confusion whether an individual belonged indeed to one group

or another, including conducting a global search on the ﬁrst or family

name. The result was that of a database of 147,336 corporate leaders for

which educational background was available, we could identify a sample of

## 3,098 corporate leaders of Chinese ethnicity, 3,095 Indian; and 1,395 of

MENA ethnicity. The remaining were 139,748 were from other ethnicities.

About 48% of Chinese ethnicity executives received their ﬁrst degree

outside the U.S., compared with just under 53% of Indian ethnicity

executives, and 43% of MENA ethnicity executives. (Interestingly,

executives of these ethnicities – immigrants and not – were more likely

than the average U.S. executive to be in possession of a PhD, an MBA or a

Master’s degree. Indian executives are signiﬁcantly more likely to hold an

MBA or a Master’s degree than average executive, while Chinese

executives are more likely to possess a PhD.) This means a substantial

share of ethnic executives in the U.S. have arrived as immigrants with

# university degrees.

While most immigrant executives arrive to the U.S. directly from their

home countries, our data shows that a small number of them are attracted

to the U.S. from other advanced economies. Canada is the top channel of

## foreign-trained executives to American companies with the UK as a distant

second. 4.1 % of Chinese, 5% of MENA, and 2.1% of Indian executives in

the U.S. have received their education in Canada. MENA immigrant

executives’ routes appear a bit different in this regard from Chinese and

Indian executives with about 10% of MENA immigrant executives arriving

# to the U.S. from Europe.

In fact, Europe is an important source of immigrant executives to the U.S.

Around 28% of all EU and 22% of all UK trained executives who have

worked at some point in their lives as executives in corporate America held

a doctorate degree. These include members of all ethnicities, making

## Europe the largest source of foreign trained PhD executives in the U.S.

Europe, followed by Canada, is also the largest source of foreign trained

MBA executives in the U.S. This is probably to be expected, since Europe

comes second to the U.S. in terms of being home to some of the world’s

# top universities.

Where do they work?

IT and healthcare are the two sectors with the highest concentration of

foreign-trained executives of all ethnicities. Consumer Products and

Banking and Finance are two other major concentration industries.

About 42% (or 61) of executives who received their training in the

Caribbean are employed in the Health sector; whereas 45% (or 328) of

executives trained in the Middle East are employed in the IT sector.

Healthcare appears as the main sector of employment for executives (ca.

27% or 965) trained in the EU and Europe more broadly. While a

concentration of immigrant executive talent in the IT sector can be

explained by higher level of internationalization (foreign investment and

export) in this sector, their concentration in healthcare can be explained

by the growth in demand for all types of talent in this sector globally.

Further research will be required to gain insights into the performance of

## immigrant leadership talent in comparison with the overall population of

business leaders. But given the disadvantage immigrants and ethnic

minorities still face in the labor market, we expect ethnic and immigrant

leaders to be high performers. This is important as research has shown

that organizations with the highest quality leaders were 13 times more

likely to outperform their competition in key competitive metrics

including ﬁnancial performance, quality of products and services,

employee engagement, and customer satisfaction. The U.S. has

traditionally had an advantage attracting immigrant talent from Europe

and elsewhere. Yet, stricter U.S. immigration policy can mean that other

governments will ﬁnd it easier to attract leadership talent that might

otherwise end up in America. However, with the anti-foreign worker

Brexit discourse in the UK, it is Canada that appears particularly well

suited to gain an advantage in the competition for leadership talent. If the

U.S. hopes to address its leadership shortage as its population ages, it

needs to embrace immigration, and acknowledge the signiﬁcant

contribution that immigrant executives already play.
