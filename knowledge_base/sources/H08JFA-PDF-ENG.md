“Can you take on this project?” Yes. “Can you lead this new initiative?”

Absolutely. “Can you organize the team lunch?” Of course.

# Yes. Yes. Yes.

This was me a few years ago, when I transitioned from my career as

prove my worth, I felt I had no other choice but to say yes to every

request that came my way.

How was I going to ﬁt all of this into my schedule? I had no idea.

Everyone on the team had more experience than me in working in

digital health. They had been embedded in the startup industry for

longer, and they knew so many things I didn’t know.

So, I believed that taking on more responsibility than I could handle

would show others that I was competent, reliable, dedicated, and

most importantly, valuable. What I didn’t realize at that time was that

overcommitting came with two major costs: the quality of my work and

# my health.

This realization came to me after I had hastily completed a report

(because there was so much to get done), and my manager said, “This

could have been a much better report if you’d spent a little more time on

it.”

The irony was hard to ignore. Doing more was making me less

productive. It was also leaving me overworked, overwhelmed, and

exhausted.

# Here’s Probably Why You’re Overcommitted

Early career professionals often fall into this fallacy: believing that

overcommitment — taking on more tasks or responsibilities than they

can realistically manage — will make them appear more competent

and indispensable. They may feel immense pressure to prove why

they were hired or to compare their achievements to more experienced

colleagues. Compounded by societal narratives of equating busyness

with success, and workplace cultures that reward overachieving, early

career professionals can ﬁnd themselves locked in a cycle of saying

“yes” to everything — at the expense of their health, creativity, and

# long-term productivity.

One factor driving overcommitment is our emotions that are working

behind the scenes to inﬂuence our decisions and behaviors. For early

career professionals (and anyone else, for that matter!), identifying and

understanding their emotions can help break the cycle of taking on too

# much.

Based on my insights and research for my book Toxic Productivity:

Reclaim your time and emotional energy in a world that always demands

more, there are three emotional dynamics that can lead you to

overcommitting in the workplace that impact how you feel or behave.

- 1. Desire for validation (especially from managers): You might be

taking on more than you can manage as you may have a strong need

to be recognized and valued and depend on external validation to see

the value of your work. But this dependence on other people’s opinion

may prevent you from developing important skills. For instance,

instead of seeing feedback as an opportunity for growth, you might

interpret it as a criticism of your value as an employee and feel

anxious instead of learning from it. Or you might not attempt new

projects or tasks at work, preferring to stay in your comfort zone,

instead of risking mistakes or failure.

- 2. Fear of rejection and failure: You might fear potentially

disappointing colleagues or being perceived as incapable. This fear

can push you to accept tasks beyond your capacity or capability,

believing that saying “no” will harm your reputation or career

# trajectory.

- 3. Comparison with others: Seeing peers handle heavy workloads can

create unfair comparisons and an internal pressure to keep up, even

if their circumstances diﬀer. For instance, a coworker who manages

a demanding workload eﬀortlessly might have diﬀerent resources,

experience, support systems, or personal circumstances that make

that possible. When you compare yourself to them, you discount

these factors and judge yourself unfairly. It’s essential to recognize

that everyone’s situation is unique — what works for someone else

might not work for you, and that’s okay. Focusing on your strengths

and limitations, and acknowledging your unique context helps you

have clarity about what is reasonable and possible for you.

Research shows that overcommitment increases stress levels, which

can lead to emotional distress, such as feeling overwhelmed and

anxious, and exacerbates physical health concerns such as sleep issues.

Overcommitment can also lead to “siege” mentality — where you feel

like you are always under pressure or attack, leading to increased

## disagreements with others and dissatisfaction at work.

Breaking out of this emotional cycle requires a shift in mindset:

understanding that sustainable success comes not from doing

everything but from doing the right things well.

# Signs You’re Overcommitted

You can’t change something you are unaware of. So, to make a

meaningful change, you need to know how overcommitment shows up

in your habits, and that begins with self-awareness.

Here are some signs you might be overcommitted.

- Saying yes to requests without considering your capacity: Your

manager requests a volunteer for a high-proﬁle client event. You

already have a packed week with three other projects, but you

immediately raise your hand to oﬀer your time. Later, you realize that

you have no idea how to ﬁt this into your workload and you may be

working the next three weekends to meet the deadlines.

- Avoiding prioritization and tackling whatever seems most urgent:

You log into your email in the morning and realize you haven’t really

cleared your inbox in the last week. You start responding to them

in the order they came in and end up spending the ﬁrst half of the

morning doing just that, In the afternoon you realize you also have a

client presentation to submit in a couple of hours. You rush through

it, only to end up getting a lot of feedback and making all the changes

your colleagues point out.

- Frequently working late hours or during weekends to “catch up”:

On a Sunday morning, you log into your work email to “just get ahead

and prepare a little before the week starts.” Before you know it, you’ve

spent her entire day at your laptop. By Sunday night, you’re exhausted

## and anxious about another busy week ahead.

- Experiencing anxiety or resentment when asked for help or

feedback: During a team meeting, a colleague asks for your support

on a new project. Outwardly, you smile and agree, but inside, you feel a

wave of resentment and think to yourself, “Why did I say yes?”

- Feeling worried or guilty when you have free time: After ﬁnishing a

big task early, you take a much-deserved coﬀee break. As you sit down

you start to feel guilty, and instead of relaxing, you open your laptop

and start reviewing next week’s tasks.

- Constantly second-guessing your decisions: You agreed to mentor

a new hire. A few days in, you start to fall behind on deadlines. Then,

you start to wonder, “Did I make a mistake by taking this mentee on?”

At the same time, the thought of stepping back makes you worry: “If

I ask to step out, will my manager think I’m not reliable and not call

me out for new projects?” The indecision stresses you out and you do

# nothing about it.

## Embrace Micro-shifts to Help You Find Balance

We all approach our work a certain way. And if it’s not working for

us, it’s time to make small micro-shifts to help us break out of the

overcommitting mindset.

# Regularly assess your workload.

Create an intentional habit of looking ahead. Once a week, look at

## all your current responsibilities and time commitments for the week

(or even a couple months) ahead. Then, reﬂect on which upcoming

opportunities realistically ﬁt in your schedule and are related to your

scope of work. Remember, your calendar doesn’t have to be jam-packed

for you to know you’re at full capacity. It should have some white spaces

for things that may come up at the last minute or for doing some deep

work when you need it. This will help you have an accurate idea of what

you are already committed to and how much time you really have.

## Practice regular emotional check-ins with yourself.

It can help to do an emotional check-in with yourself regularly. Self-

reﬂection will keep you connected to your emotions and give you

insight into the direction of your career. During your weekly workload

reﬂections (mentioned above), ask yourself:

- How am I feeling about my current responsibilities? This will show you

if you are aligned with your workload or feeling overwhelmed (and can

be a red ﬂag that you may have overcommitted).

- How am I feeling about my coworkers and work in general? This will

help uncover the emotional connection you have to your work. Feeling

disconnected, unsupported, or indiﬀerent can be a red ﬂag for a lack of

# boundaries.

- What am I excited about / feel dread about? This will help you

highlight parts of your work that energize you so that you can leverage

those aspects to increase a sense of joy and fulﬁllment at work. This

helps improve resilience and self-conﬁdence (thus, reducing the urge

to overcommit). Knowing which tasks drain you can help you reassess

your workload, or if you must do them, prepare better ahead of time to

get them done.

# Use pre-emptive communication.

Proactively schedule standing checkpoints of communication — a

weekly email or meeting with your supervisor. In this time, you can

let your manager know in advance about your capacity and discuss

# priorities and opportunities.

For example, you can say, “This week, I’m focused on completing [task]

and [task]. If you need help with other projects, I can assist starting next

week” or, “I am working on A, B and C over the next two weeks. If you’d

like me to do it, perhaps you can help me ﬁgure out what is highest

priority, and we can shift things around accordingly?”

Create a “decision delay buffer.”

Train yourself to never commit to a request immediately. Instead, use

phrases like “Let me check my current schedule and get back to you?”

or “I’d love to, but would it be okay to let you know by tomorrow?” to

buy time. When you reﬂect on the request, remember to consider your

current and upcoming priorities and deadlines. You might have time

this week, but what about in two weeks? Buying time allows you to

accurately review your capacity and workload. It gives you the time to

be thoughtful about your response, honor your boundaries, and decline

# in a polite way.

# Practice “micro-mastery.”

You might feel tempted to say yes to every opportunity that comes your

way, believing that all experience is good experience. While that might

be true sometimes, irrelevant experience should not come at the cost

of relevant experience. Micro-mastery is focusing on excelling in one or

two speciﬁc small areas of your role (tasks or opportunities), instead of

saying yes to everything.

## HBR / Digital Article / Why You’re Chronically Overcommitted

In order to assess which opportunity or task is relevant to your micro-

mastery goals, ask yourself these questions before agreeing to anything:

- Asses the relevance and impact on your long-term goals: Does this

directly build the skills I want to develop?

- Consider the cost: Will taking this on impact my ability to perform in

# other areas?

- Does it provide something (visibility, skill building, growth): Will this

allow me to showcase my skills to managers or does it allow me to reﬁne/

develop a skill?

If the opportunities or tasks aren’t related to what you want to

master, use the above skill of “decision delay buﬀer” to decline. If

the opportunities or tasks are related to what you want to master, use

the above skills of “preemptive communication” to alert your manager

about your interest and to help you re-prioritize if possible.

We often feel the pressure to say “yes” to every opportunity, believing

that missing out on anything could set us back. When you are feeling

overwhelmed, it is helpful to remind yourself that by letting an

opportunity go and not overcommitting yourself, you’re not failing,

you’re being thoughtful about your choices. This allows you to protect

your valuable time and energy resources to reserve them for things that

truly matter — your emotional wellbeing and professional growth.

The truth is: not every opportunity is meant for you, and sometimes

missed chances can make space for the right chances.
