As people slowly return to some form of hybrid workplace, bonds that

tie them to one another must be rebuilt. Over the past 18 months,

most organizations have experienced some degree of fracturing as social

connections and cultural cohesion have been strained. The challenges

of remote work, dramatic uncertainty, the clumsy process of ﬁguring

out what returning to the oﬃce could look like, and the mass exodus

of workers fed up with cultures that make them feel devalued have all

served to threaten a sense of community. On top of all that, most of our

remote work interactions have been with our immediate colleagues and

focused largely on the tasks at hand — research from Microsoft suggests

that cross-functional collaboration went down by 25% as interactions

within groups increased during the pandemic.

But fragmentation isn’t a byproduct of remote work. It results from a

lack of intentional bridgebuilding to link discrete groups and regions.

Silos were certainly prevalent before the pandemic — hybrid work has simply created new requirements for eﬀectively connecting teams that

must work together to achieve shared outcomes.

Working to rebuild bonds is especially important because most people

won’t be returning to work as the same people they were before

the pandemic; the last 18 months have changed all of us in some

way. Our values and priorities have shifted. Our senses of meaning

and purpose have broadened. Our anxiety has increased. For some,

tolerance increased while for others, it decreased. In short, we have to

get reacquainted with who we’ve each become. Otherwise, our natural

biases that formed about who each of us were will kick in, creating

unhelpful dissonance as we react to each other as we did prior to the

pandemic. For example, one executive said of his colleague, “She used

to have the best sense of humor, but now quips I make that she would

always laugh at get no reaction at all.” He’d failed to consider that she

was emotionally exhausted because her family was hit especially hard

# by Covid-19.

Here are three approaches I’ve seen help leaders and their teams

## reestablish strong connections across organizational boundaries as

they’ve shifted to hybrid work environments.

Create new shared identities

Humans are naturally tribal beings. We bind with and narrowly identify

ourselves as one of our immediate group. By default, those outside

the group are “other” — and likely not to be trusted. This type of

we-they thinking will intensify if cross-functional connections aren’t

strengthened. Enabling people to establish new shared identities that

bind them to one another more broadly helps reorient their brains to

new relationships, seeing colleagues who were once “they” with fresh

# eyes.

Research from NYU’s Jay Van Bavel found that our brains quickly

shift away from previously held biases when we work together in

solidarity. In one experiment using brain imaging, a set of people

whose amygdalas revealed a variety of implicit biases about certain

types of people showed that those biases were dramatically reduced

when participants were told those same types of people were now

“on your new team.” The closer we aﬃliate with our “we” tribe, the

more outsiders become “they.” The solution requires broadening the

# deﬁnition of we.

In one organization, to break down unhealthy tribalism, we established

cross-functional teams to take responsibility for various aspects of the

organization’s cultural health. Teams focused on things like learning

## and education, innovation, community building, and hybrid work

health and were composed of members from numerous functions and

regions, all resourced and empowered to act. Creating an aﬃnity to a

team with broader purpose immediately helped improve cohesion and

# collaboration across the organization.

# Accelerate solidarity

Recent research from McKinsey revealed that the strongest drivers of

people quitting was not feeling valued (in other words, like they and

their work mattered) and lacking a sense of belonging. They lacked what

I refer to as organizational solidarity: creating strong ties to one another

and to a shared purpose so people never question either.

Relationships across functions are especially challenging to form with

solidarity when you haven’t seen or spoken to one another in a long

while. In one client organization where there had been a lot of change

in one division during the pandemic (a new organization design,

new people, and shifts in people’s roles), we did a comprehensive re-

onboarding of everyone in the organization. Leaders realized that if we

didn’t level the playing ﬁeld for everyone, trust would take too long

to build. In a two-day session of round-robin conversations, people

gathered to “meet for the ﬁrst time…again.” Each person came prepared

to share their responses to ﬁve prompts:

- 1. The most signiﬁcant thing that’s diﬀerent about me since the

pandemic started is…

- 2. The thing I’m most concerned about returning to work in our hybrid

# approach is…

- 3. I’m most excited about this team’s ability to…

- 4. The help I need to be successful on this team is…

- 5. The contribution I feel I can make to your success is…

It was a heartfelt two days full of emotions and surprises for the group.

Most notable were the many comments from tenured employees about

seeing their long-standing colleagues in a fresh light while accelerating

trust with their new colleagues. One participant said it well: “My

default position with other departments has been to assume the worst.

But when they showed up with that level of commitment to me, I

knew I had to trust them.” These results are further evidence of what

my own 15-year longitudinal study revealed: Stronger cross-functional

relationships are six times more likely to produce trustworthy behavior.

As you begin bringing people back to work in whatever form that

takes, invest the time to reset relationships not only within your team,

but also between your team and key organizational partners. Use the

opportunity to shed old baggage with rivaling cross-functional partners

and start new by strengthening weak ties.

# Build leadership learning cohorts

The ultimate determinant of cross-functional health is the quality of

leadership over the teams that must cooperate to get things done.

Leaders who model empathy, curiosity, proﬁciency with conﬂict, and

a genuine desire to create widespread shared success build the strongest

cross-functional partnerships. But these leadership skills don’t often

come naturally, especially to highly results-oriented leaders who’ve

been raised in overly hierarchical environments.

I’ve found the fastest way to build strong, consistent cross-functional

leaders is to immerse them together in cohorts of leadership

development. In nearly a dozen organizations, we’ve built cohorts of

12–16 leaders who journey together in their own learning and formation

for 6–12 months. The content is focused on key skills and knowledge

they need to drive the shared results their functions must produce.

Recently, we’ve oriented content to how the organization needs to

rethink leadership in a hybrid workplace. Small sub-teams spend time

on real projects aligned to strategic goals that create added value for the

organization, and pairs of “peer-coaches” are assigned to meet weekly

to exchange feedback and advice on identiﬁed development areas. I’ve

found that the relationships that form during these cohort journeys

## remain deep for years beyond their initial time together.

As you bring leaders back to your “new normal,” invest in their

development by establishing cohort learning communities that will

bind them to one another — and their shared organizational

aspirations. They will naturally cascade their newfound broader

orientation down to their teams, who in turn will connect more eﬀectively with their cross-functional peers.

. . .

The coming year of inventing our way toward whatever our workplaces will look like oﬀers a marvelous opportunity to refresh and reinvent the

## most important relationships in our organizations: the ones between

## those who, together, create results and cohesion for the enterprise that

no one team could create on its own. Don’t squander it.
