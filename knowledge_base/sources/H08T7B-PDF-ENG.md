Have you ever sensed your company’s innovation eﬀorts stalling—not

## because of a lack of eﬀort, but because something in the process

feels oﬀ? Most leaders understand that innovation requires learning.

Yet too often teams juggle multiple learning activities—ranging from

interviewing customers to brainstorming ideas to after action reviews

—without clarity on how they intersect, causing confusion and

# undermining innovation.

Through our research involving more than 160 teams, we found that

successful innovation hinges not only on how much teams learn, but

## on when—and in what order—they engage in speciﬁc forms of learning.

## Just as music relies on rhythm and harmony, eﬀective team learning

requires structured, harmonious sequencing.

## Four Essential Ways Your Team Should Be Learning

Innovation is not accidental. Our research highlights four distinct types

of learning behaviors used by high-performing teams and examines

## variations in the sequence and blend of these types of team learning.

Together, these comprise a toolkit that enables teams to innovate:

- 1. Experimental learning: A team deliberately tests ideas, expecting

failures along the way, as part of developing new knowledge and

occasional breakthroughs. Experimental learning includes activities

like brainstorming and prototyping.

- 2. Vicarious learning: Teams consult with other teams or individuals

who have done similar work to avoid reinventing the wheel.

- 3. Contextual learning: A team’s members scan their environment to

detect market shifts, emerging trends, or competitor strategies.

- 4. Reﬂexive learning: A team deliberately engages in self-examination,

such as by assessing strategies, revisiting goals, and discussing

# current challenges.

Our research reveals a likely culprit of stalled innovation: Teams are

blending incompatible learning activities at the wrong times.

Cognitive neuroscience conﬁrms what experienced leaders intuitively

know: Our brains need structured breaks to turn experiences into

actionable knowledge. Just as sleep helps consolidate daily experiences

into long-term memory, structured reﬂection allows teams to integrate

insights gained during exploration phases into strategies and plans.

Without these deliberate rhythms, teams risk becoming overwhelmed

by continual information intake—akin to endlessly inhaling without

pausing to exhale—leading to confusion and burnout. By intentionally

embedding reﬂective pauses within structured learning cycles, teams

can harness their full innovative potential.

## In two studies—one with 102 innovation teams in a Fortune Global

500 company and another with 61 MBA project teams—we found that

all combinations of team learning were not equally eﬀective. When

teams paired reﬂexive learning with vicarious learning, performance

improved. But when teams mixed reﬂexive learning with more

## exploratory activities—such as experimental learning or contextual

learning—in the same phase, performance suﬀered. The highest-

performing teams didn’t try to do everything at once; instead, they

separated learning activities into clear episodes, establishing a rhythm

that alternated thoughtfully between exploration and reﬂection. This

sequencing helped them reduce confusion, resolve tensions, and

# sustain momentum.

# Contrasting Stories of Team Learning

Consider two innovation teams from a large telecom company. The ﬁrst,

Team Alpha, delivered an innovative solution on time and on budget.

From the outset, team members set aside dedicated meetings purely

for reﬂection, where they openly discussed their project’s direction,

identiﬁed clear roles, and reﬁned their goals. When it came time

for creative thinking, they shifted gears entirely, launching energetic

brainstorming sessions ﬁlled with vibrant discussions and hands-on

experiments. Keeping these activities distinct allowed the team to

focus and avoid unnecessary tension. Each time the team regrouped

to reﬁne strategies, it made noticeable progress. Team Alpha’s careful

orchestration made innovation look smooth, predictable, and almost

# eﬀortless.

Team Omega, meanwhile, seemed caught in a perpetual storm.

Individual meetings toggled between high-energy brainstorming and

detailed task planning. Members attempting to reﬁne strategies

sometimes found their thoughts drowned out by teammates excitedly

pitching new ideas. At the same time, others brought in fresh insights

from the industry, further complicating the discussion. Meetings

started to feel chaotic, leading to frustration and confusion. Without

clear distinctions between learning activities, Omega team members

frequently experienced cognitive overload that sapped energy and

morale. Progress stalled, deadlines slipped, and promising ideas never

fully materialized.

# Creating a Harmonious Learning Rhythm

Our research shows that the highest-performing teams don’t just engage

in learning—they structure it intentionally. As a leader, here’s how you

can practically establish a clear, harmonious rhythm within your team:

- 1. Set a solid foundation for reﬂection.

Begin by consistently scheduling dedicated reﬂection meetings. Use

this time to revisit your team’s overall objectives, evaluate the eﬀectiveness of your current approaches, and reaﬃrm everyone’s roles

and responsibilities. Encourage open dialogue to uncover blind spots

and make necessary adjustments.

- 2. Clearly distinguish exploration from reﬁnement.

Establish distinct sessions dedicated exclusively to creative exploration

—such as brainstorming, experimenting, or searching the environment

to discover alternative ideas and technologies—and clearly separate

these from meetings dedicated to idea reﬁnement and detailed

planning. For instance, using clearly deﬁned sprints, you might

## dedicate one week to free-ﬂowing idea generation and external market

exploration, followed by another week strictly focused on reﬁning ideas,

selecting the best options, and formulating detailed strategies.

- 3. Implement predictable learning cycles.

Structure is key. Create a recurring schedule that alternates predictably

## through reﬂection, exploration, and reﬁnement phases. Clearly

communicate this rhythm to your team, set expectations, and enforce

boundaries around each phase. Doing this ensures team members can

mentally prepare, reduces confusion and cognitive overload, and helps

maintain a strong strategic momentum throughout the innovation

# journey.

You can think of a team’s learning activities as elements of a

## musical masterpiece. Just as great compositions—like Beethoven’s

## Fifth Symphony—skillfully balance moments of tension with moments

of powerful resolution, eﬀective team learning thrives on the

structured interplay between building up and then releasing tension.

Harmonious learning occurs when complementary activities, such

as team reﬂection and external expert consultations, reinforce one

another, creating moments of clarity and alignment. Conversely,

dissonance arises when conﬂicting activities, like simultaneous

## experimentation and detailed planning, collide and cause confusion.

## An unstructured approach—such as multitasking or forming multiple

sub-teams without clearly deﬁned goals—is akin to playing all musical

notes simultaneously, creating cacophony rather than harmony. High-

performing teams intentionally orchestrate their learning activities

to establish predictable rhythms that balance tension and relaxation,

driving sustained innovation.

Innovation thrives not through increased eﬀort, but through smarter,

more structured eﬀort. Clearly sequencing and distinguishing your

team’s learning activities—reﬂection, exploration, and reﬁnement—

turns potential chaos into strategic clarity, unlocking better decision-

making and sustained innovation. Like a conductor guiding a

symphony, mastering your team’s rhythm of learning transforms

everyday interactions into a powerful competitive advantage,

positioning your organization for sustained growth and innovation
