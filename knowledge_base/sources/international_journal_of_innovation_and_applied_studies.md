# INTRODUCTION

The twenty-one century is the era of technology and globalization, companies are no more working in isolation and large scale technology sharing can easily observed. Hence, business leaders’ start promoting such resources as human capital which can give them competitive advantage against competitor. Companies have now access to new technological developments with right kind of resources. The only thing that differentiates one company from the other company is utilization of human intellect. Organization’s performance and competitive advantage depends on intellectual employees. It is becoming inevitable for organizations to address this issue and to develop proper strategy [1]. However, the walk on this road does not turn out very easy due to the fact that human resource is available but skilled human resource is scarcely found. Hence, the scarcity of competent employees leads organizations to develop strategic schemes. This can be used to fill the gap of talented human resource within organization. In this era companies are facing the war of talent.

The idea of talent management starts taking its root in 1980s. Organizations were filtering out the best human resource from the rest. That era was considered as having more control over individuals and their career planning but that was changed after 1990s. That time employees were given the responsibility of their career planning. While after 2000, companies start talking the control of employee career development by giving them opportunity [2]. Watkins [3] coined the term talent management which indicates the importance of managing employee for the organizations. Companies are making it their strategic priority to recruit, retain and develop employees. Talent management is about analyzing the need of skilled employee and developing strategies to meet that need [4]. It improves their performance and financial position in the industry and accelerates organizational success. In 1990’s a research was done by McKinsey group who recognize employees

Makela et al. [6] indicated that there is a dearth of skilled employees which is now creating alarming situation in organizations. Managers need to enhance their ability to translate the business needs into talent strategies for the better performance of organization [7]. In 21st century, change is the only constant factor which makes talent management the only answer of organizations woes. Companies are facing the acute dearth of talented people. This era requires competitive strategies build with the help of intellectual capital. It will help the companies to better perform than their rivals. In this scenario retention, engagement and attraction of the competent employee is a crucial factor. Talent management plays an important role in this regard by placing the competent employees according to their job ability.

Rothwell [10] suggested that if organizations engage in strategic practices to retain and engage employees, it would be beneficial for the organization. Another, study Neill and Heinen [11] discussed that successful organizations always give importance to attracting, retaining and developing the talent and it also assists the organization in making the company’s strategy that align the business plan with skilled employees. However, if an organization fails to utilize human capital then the result will be in the form of business decline. There are different features of talent management like recruitment, selection, on-boarding, mentoring, performance management, career development, leadership development, replacement planning, career planning, recognition and reward [11], [12]. It is suggested that the organizations who wants to achieve competitive position and to increase its productivity should adopt the approach of attraction, recruitment, retention and development of intellectual capital [13]. Some researchers [14] summed up that talent management decisions lead towards the improvement of talent in organization and enhance the quality of business design that influences the choices regarding employees. Talent management polishes employee’s skills and career planning opportunities. It ensures companies that competent employees will enhance the organization’s reputation and performance [15]. Holland et al. [16] emphasized that the companies can improve their performance by using resource based view (RBV) in recruitment, retention and development process and can get competitive advantage. Hughes and Rog [17] elucidated that the CEO of the company plays an important role in the effective implementation of talent management. Talent management strategy must be integrated with all levels of organization and its objectives must be clear. The people assessment system must be analytical. It must be able to ensure that people have right skills according to their jobs. Managers need to enhance their ability to translate the business need into talent strategies for the better performance of organization [7].

Organizations ability to retain, to engage and to develop talent determines its position in the industry. Talent management has become a success or failure factor for an organization.

The good talent management program consists of recruitment, retention, development and promotion of talented employee and the companies with sound leaders were able to perform 13 times better than their competitor [24]. Hence, Kumar [25] recommended that the strategic use of talent management will result in better performance of the companies. A research highlighted that talent management considered strategically important in today’s competitive world as companies are competing on the basis of human capital and by searching, attracting, retaining, and developing talent companies will have competitive advantage [26].

Neal & Gebauer [28] indicated that the culture of an organization, in discriminatory decisions, an understanding management, work-life balance and employer branding considered important forces behind the employee’s retention in a particular organization. Motivational work, growing and learning environment proves to be a key to retain the talented employees. Managers play important role in this regard [32].
