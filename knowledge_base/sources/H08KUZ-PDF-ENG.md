## On July 19th, 2024, a single content update from CrowdStrike, a cyber

security software company, caused more than 8.5 million systems to

crash, disrupting operations for days across thousands of organizations

worldwide, including hundreds of Fortune 1000 companies. The

CrowdStrike “glitch,” as it became known, resulted in losses estimated

to be more than $5 billion. The CrowdStrike incident is estimated to cost

insurers around $1.5 billion in payouts, under business interruption,

cyber, and system failure coverages. It represents one of the biggest

## examples of the adverse impact of aggregated cyber risk accumulation.

## In October 2024, Delta, one of the many aﬀected businesses in the

incident, ﬁled a lawsuit against CrowdStrike claiming that the outage

was “catastrophic.” They claimed it was the result of CrowdStrike’s

“forced untested updates to its customers” and led to disruption of

7,000 ﬂights and 1.3 million customers over 5 days. The airline claimed a

# loss of more than $500 million.

CrowdStrike in response, while admitting the root cause was a fault in

its software update, claimed that “Delta’s claims are based on disproven

misinformation, demonstrate a lack of understanding of how modern

cybersecurity works, and reﬂect a desperate attempt to shift blame for

its slow recovery away from its failure to modernize its antiquated IT

# infrastructure.”

In this article we examine what managers and executives can learn from

this incident. We discuss the outage’s aftermath on the global state of

cyber risk management, and we detail what organizations should be

doing diﬀerently to prevent similar disruptions.

# Companies Aren’t Prepared

## The overall number of cyber incidents, and the magnitude of their

impact, continue to grow and worsen, despite advances in cybersecurity

## solutions and increased cybersecurity spending by organizations.

## According to IBM’s “2024 Cost of Data Breach Report,” the average

cost of a data breach in 2024 was $4.88 million, an increase of

## 10%. Verizon’s 2024 annual Data Breach Report analyzed 30,458

cybersecurity incidents, of which 10,626 were conﬁrmed data breaches

— a record high.

A recent cyber risk market survey conducted by Milliman identiﬁed

## important gaps with signiﬁcant market implications:

- A highly fragmented cybersecurity market: Multiple solution

directions with limited capabilities to unify these for credible

## comprehensive overall cyber risk management.

- Cybersecurity decisions are based on disjointed data points: A

variety of cyber scores, local assessments, and questionnaires with insuﬃcient end-to-end cyber risk perspectives.

- Ineﬀective assessments of cyber risk concentration: Limited

capabilities to capture cyber dependencies necessary for identifying

## systemic cyber risk and risk aggregation.

- A soft cyber insurance market: Cyber underwriting methods are hard to reconcile due to insuﬃcient historical data, fast evolving threats, and too much subjectivity in making assessments.

- Limited cyber risk transparency across organizations: Supply

chain cyber risk management is a big and growing challenge, and insuﬃcient visibility is impacting cyber risk decisions.

- New cyber risk challenges introduced by new emerging

## technologies: AI, quantum computing, cloud computing, and other

innovation, leads to evolving regulatory requirements and increased

# cyber risk uncertainty.

The CrowdStrike incident is an important demonstration of all of these

market gaps. Below, we use the CrowdStrike event to present four

fundamental questions that should be part of your regular cyber risk

reviews. Not only were these questions not adequately addressed by

CrowdStrike and other impacted parties, but the industry lacks the

appropriate methods to properly address such questions.

# Four Open Questions About Cyber Risk

- 1. What is the level of risk of a CrowdStrike content update? (Does it reduce or increase overall risk?) CrowdStrike’s Falcon software is one of the leading cybersecurity

solutions in the market. Content updates are CrowdStrike’s mechanism

for rapidly upgrading all its endpoint deployments to reﬂect emerging

patterns of new cyber threats. They are designed to improve overall

# protection.

Due to the rapid emergence of new cyber threats, CrowdStrike may issue

multiple such content updates per day. Since the market introduction

of the Falcon solution in June 2013 CrowdStrike has issued many

## thousands of content updates to its global customers, with almost no

reported problems.

But the risk associated with a content update is never zero. There is

always some likelihood that software bugs will be exposed and cause

disruption or other adverse eﬀects. Therefore, the risk associated with

implementing a content update needs to be assessed relative to the

risk(s) that are eliminated by the improved protections embedded in

the update. Eﬀective approaches for performing such systematic and

quantiﬁable analysis are currently not available.

In its lawsuit ﬁling against CrowdStrike, when referring to the content

update, Delta made claims such as:

- “By installing its exploit in Delta systems without Delta’s permission or

knowledge, CrowdStrike obstructed, interrupted, and interfered with

## Delta’s use of its computer programs and computer networks.”

- And, that as a result, “Delta suﬀered over $500 million in out-of-pocket

losses from the Faulty Update, in addition to reputational harm and

# future revenue loss.”

No reference was made to the fact that thousands of such “exploits”

(content changes) have been installed by CrowdStrike in Delta systems

successfully since it became a customer in 2022. No reference was made

to the overall business value that these “exploits” provided Delta over

## that period in the form of enhanced protection against potential cyber-

# attacks.

- 2. How should the risk of a CrowdStrike update be mitigated in an optimal manner? (Should it be applied immediately or delayed?) The answer depends on the nature of the update and the nature of the

target system (and its potential business impact). It requires a nuanced,

## systematic, and quantiﬁable balancing between the risk of adverse

## downstream business consequences due to a possible faulty update to

that system (risk reduced as the delay is increased) and the business

risk and escalation opportunities in case this system undergoes a

cyber-attack without the added protection (risk grows as the delay is

increased).

In its October 2024 lawsuit Delta claimed:

“When CrowdStrike deployed the Faulty Update, CrowdStrike even

forced its updates onto customers who had automatic updates

disabled, such as Delta. Delta had not enabled the automatic update

setting, because Delta wanted to maintain the proper type of change

management controls over how updates could affect its computer

# systems and networks.”

Indeed, CrowdStrike treated its content updates as zero-risk events.

Following the 2024 incident CrowdStrike realized its risk management

mistake and changed its deployment process for content updates to

reﬂect the fact that they are associated with a level of risk which should

be properly managed. Such improved transparency and customer

control is clearly required. But the industry has struggled to determine

what additional information should be provided and how customers

can use it to make appropriate business-risk aligned decisions.

- 3. How to ensure an optimal level of business resiliency when a content update is faulty? This question requires a subtle systematic risk management analysis

that captures all the various cyber dependencies involved. The industry

is missing eﬀective methods for systematic reasoning and much of

the current discussions are vague and ambiguous. For example, in its

lawsuit Delta claims that CrowdStrike knew that its actions could harm

## Delta, its computers, its computer networks, and computer programs.

But even the most high-quality development processes, testing, and

certiﬁcation, may occasionally result in some form of a faulty output.

Delta provided no speciﬁc details in its lawsuit on its infrastructure’s

## resiliency set-up beyond some very general statements such as, “As

part of its IT-planning and infrastructure, Delta has invested billions of

## dollars in licensing and building some of the best technology solutions

in the airline industry” or “Delta is known for its customer service, reliability, and operational eﬃciency.”

On the other hand, CrowdStrike and Microsoft have made general,

controversial claims suggesting that Delta may have had an inferior

resiliency set-up compared to other leading airlines, resulting in

a longer time to recover following the incident: “Our preliminary

review suggests that Delta, unlike its competitors, apparently has not

modernized its IT infrastructure, either for the beneﬁt of its customers

or for its pilots and ﬂight attendants,” according to CrowdStrike’s

# lawsuit.

No speciﬁc details are provided, but such cyber resiliency analysis and

comparison needs to be performed in a systematic and rigorous manner

to ensure credible conclusions and apples-to-apples comparisons.

# HBR / Digital Article / What the 2024 CrowdStrike Glitch Can Teach Us About Cyber R…

Furthermore, both Microsoft and CrowdStrike made some unusual

resiliency-related statements, indicating that in response to the

incident their respective CEOs tried to contact Delta’s CEO to oﬀer

# recovery assistance.

CrowdStrike claimed that CEO George Kurtz reached out to Delta

CEO Ed Bastian to “oﬀer onsite assistance but received no response.”

Similarly, Microsoft claimed that it “immediately oﬀered to assist Delta

at no charge and that its CEO Satya Nadella emailed Bastian, but never

got a reply.”

While commendable, it is not at all clear how valuable CEO-level

interactions are after automatic resiliency and recovery processes

should have been triggered (or indeed whether Delta’s CEO even

had access to his email system at that point or was it down due to

CrowdStrike’s faulty update).

- 4. How can we ensure accountability for losses?

CrowdStrike quickly took responsibility for its faulty update and

apologized to the market. With respect to its ﬁnancial liability in

particular disputes such as the one with Delta, CrowdStrike indicated

that “its contractual liability is capped in the single-digit millions,”

implying that it is not liable for most of the ﬁnancial losses which are

## due to ineﬀective cyber-resilience measures by its customers.

While such speciﬁc disputes will be resolved in the pending

lawsuits, we note that cyber information ﬂow boundaries and

accountability implications are generally ill-deﬁned and often

ambiguous. Furthermore, there are cyber dependencies on multiple

third parties that introduce additional accountability questions.

Consider for example Microsoft’s role in the dispute between Delta

and CrowdStrike. What is the precise relationship between Microsoft’s

commitment to test and certify all Windows kernel-access software and

CrowdStrike’s faulty update?

Delta indicated that it “has reason to believe Microsoft has failed to

comply with contractual requirements and otherwise acted in a grossly

## negligent, indeed wilful, manner in connection with the Faulty Update.”

Microsoft suggested that Delta’s ineﬀective cyber recovery may have

been due to its reliance in various ways on infrastructure providers

such as IBM and Amazon. Clearly, deriving cyber risk accountability

## conclusions in a systematic and credible manner among respective

parties requires eﬀective analysis frameworks that don’t yet exist.

## The Road Ahead: Explainable Cyber Risk Management

Although the CrowdStrike incident was not an actual cyberattack,

there are many common characteristics and important lessons for

all organizations related to such digital risk scenarios — whether

# accidental or deliberate.

Organizations should develop adequate capabilities to perform the

# following:

- Determine the “what-if” potential downstream business impact (direct

and escalated) of a cyber event at any supply-chain partner (cyber

compromises or errors). Delta and many other organizations may not

have considered a-priori important potential risk scenarios such as

## faulty CrowdStrike updates and their potential implications.

- Establish appropriate cyber resiliency business objectives and

## processes for any impactful cyber event at a supply-chain partner.

## The wide variations in recovery times and business losses in the

CrowdStrike incident implies that multiple organizations did not have

## adequate cyber resiliency measures in place for such scenarios.

# HBR / Digital Article / What the 2024 CrowdStrike Glitch Can Teach Us About Cyber R…

- Assess continuously the likelihood levels and inter-dependence of

cyber events (internal and external) and make timely adjustments

when required. CrowdStrike allegedly did not properly assess the

## likelihood of potential faults in its content update processes, and

consequently could not take appropriate corrective actions in time.

- Ensure eﬀective communication (internally and externally) to

provide adequate transparency as a basis for appropriate cyber risk

management decisions. CrowdStrike’s after-the-fact move to enable

customers’ control on when to apply content updates is a step in

the right direction. But additional information on the digital risk

attributes of each update needs to be shared as well, to enable

customers to make optimal decisions in each case.

- Specify well-deﬁned accountability boundaries between relevant

parties related to potential cyber risk scenarios and their

## business implications. The CrowdStrike incident highlights signiﬁcant

ambiguities and inconsistencies among counterparties regarding

respective cyber risk related commitments and expectations.

Most current cyber solutions in organizations focus on speciﬁc local

targets but fall short of providing end-to-end cyber risk insights in

a systematic, credible, and justiﬁable manner. A new paradigm of

explainable cyber risk management is required. It must enable end-to-

end scenario-based cyber risk analysis insights and maps between cyber

events and business outcomes. For example, with respect to incidents

such as CrowdStrike, a new approach would enable systematically

assessing the business outcome scenarios of potentially faulty updates,

and balancing mitigation processes and recovery processes accordingly,

## in a systematic and cyber-risk optimized manner.

Overall, we need better methods to develop higher levels of

## trust between users and service providers. Occasional unintentional

technology failures are inevitable. Malicious cyberattacks will continue

to grow in scale, scope, and impact with the increased global reliance

on emerging digital technologies. Much more eﬀective cyber risk

management approaches are therefore urgently needed — and they

must be transparent, structured, justiﬁable, and agile.
