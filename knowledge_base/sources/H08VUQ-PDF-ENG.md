AI entered mainstream consciousness in November 2022 when

ChatGPT burst onto the scene and scooped up more than a million

active users in one month. No longer just for tech giants and scientists,

AI was suddenly pitched as a transformative force that anyone

could use. The proliferation of advanced AI models like DeepSeek

that lowered costs and made AI integration easier has only further

heightened expectations of what AI might be able to do for companies.

## HBR / Digital Article / Make Sure Your AI Strategy Actually Creates Value

Amid the growing enthusiasm, many see AI as an integral part of their

future. One estimate suggests corporate investments in AI will triple by

2028.

But an unquestioning belief in the power of AI to radically transform

business is risky. It may cause leaders to make suboptimal decisions

that undermine their company’s potential for proﬁtable growth.

## When Companies Fall into the AI-Technology Trap

Take Snapchat. Founded in 2011, it quickly became popular—especially

with Gen Z—due to features like disappearing messages and casual

visual sharing. At its peak, Snapchat was one of the most downloaded

## apps in the world, with hundreds of millions of daily active users.

In 2023, Snapchat introduced My AI, a generative AI chatbot powered

by OpenAI. Jumping on the AI bandwagon, the company seemed to

assume that adding this novel feature would naturally enhance the user

experience and boost engagement.

Instead, the move triggered widespread backlash.

My AI was pinned by default to the top of users’ chat feeds and couldn’t

easily be removed. Users didn’t see it as an impressive, novel feature.

Instead, they perceived it as intrusive and creepy, like an unwanted

observer. The backlash was swift: App store reviews were ﬂooded with

one-star ratings citing the unwanted chatbot, and Snapchat’s ranking

and reputation suﬀered. The app’s U.S. iOS rating nosedived to 1.67

stars. Google searches for “delete Snapchat” spiked by 488% in the

months following the rollout, reﬂecting the widespread user discomfort

# and unhappiness with the service.

Snapchat is not alone. Nordstrom too learned the hard way that

AI is no magic bullet when it acquired Trunk Club, a personalized

styling service for busy professionals, and decided to embed AI into its

operations to help scale the business. In doing so, however, it diluted

## the company’s core appeal—a high-touch, high-end personalized

experience—triggering high return rates and sluggish sales. Unable to

cover operational costs, Nordstrom ﬁnally decided to pull the plug.

## Don’t Put the AI Cart Before the Strategy Horse

As the experiences of Snapchat and Nordstrom reveal, just adding AI

to your products doesn’t guarantee success; whether or not it creates

value rests on what companies do with it. When companies lead with

AI or treat it as the answer, they put the cart before the horse and risk

compromising their company’s strategy and the value it provides to the

# marketplace.

But when companies take the opposite approach, starting with strategy,

identifying how they can oﬀer buyers a leap in value, and then looking

to technology as a tool to deliver that leap, AI can be a powerful catalyst

to proﬁt, growth, and commercial opportunities.

## Consider Yunji Technology’s AI-powered delivery robots. Instant

delivery around the clock is the norm in China. From hot meals to fresh

ﬂowers to daily essentials, almost anything is just a click away—and

typically arrives within 15 to 30 minutes.

But a challenge arose for hotel guests who wanted to use delivery

## services to order late-night snacks, an extra toothbrush, or a forgotten

# phone charger.

Hotel security protocols restricted delivery workers from accessing

guest ﬂoors, leaving guests no choice but to get dressed and head down

## to the lobby every time an order arrives—a cumbersome and frustrating

process, especially for guests accustomed to placing multiple orders

over the course of a single night’s stay. In the rare cases when delivery

workers were allowed to deliver directly to the room, delivery personnel

lost time, the hotel faced a security risk, and guests had to open the door

# late at night to a stranger.

Seeing the clear, “last-inch” logisitics problem, Yunji Technology

developed a strategy to create cost-eﬀective, personable delivery robots

that would bring items directly to hotel rooms and then leveraged AI

to actualize it. These cute robots are able to navigate autonomously to

the guest’s door, gently announcing their arrival in a soft, childlike voice

that’s sure to bring a smile. Once the guest retrieves the delivery, the

robot cheerfully wheels itself away, even cracking playful jokes to other

# passengers in the elevator.

The robots quickly became popular, making hotel guests’ lives easier

and more fun, helping delivery workers save time, and improving operational eﬃciency for hotels while enhancing their appeal to guests.

In fact, hotels that use Yunji’s robots see a 27% increase in daily online

travel agency comments. The number of positive reviews related to

Yunji’s robots has exceeded 6 million, with 35% of reviews featuring

user-uploaded images—far exceeding the usual rate.

Today Yunji robots capture 90% of the market in hotel robotics in China

and are being used in more than 20 countries and 30,000 hotels. The

company created a strategy that addressed a real problem, oﬀered a leap

in value for all parties, and then turned to AI to realize their solution. To

thrive, like Yunji, companies need to get the strategy-value-AI sequence

# right.

Another successful example is Duolingo. The founders saw that in-

person language classes are expensive and subject to geographical and

scheduling constraints. Online platforms oﬀered greater ﬂexibility, but

## their one-size-ﬁts-all approach couldn’t adapt to individual needs, and

the lack of real-time interactivity meant that many learners dropped

oﬀ as the programs couldn’t hold their attention and didn’t meet their

# individual needs.

So the founders set out to eliminate these pain points to create a

breakthrough in value. Their strategy was to create a language learning

experience that would not only make geographic and scheduling

constraints irrelevant but it would also be fun, interactive, and tailored

to each person’s needs. Seeing the answer in an online platform with

tailored gamiﬁcation, the founders leveraged AI to actualize their

strategy. AI was the ideal tool to analyze and gamify user interactions,

creating leaderboards to add engagement while tailoring language

lessons and feedback dynamically to each user’s needs.

Duolingo could thus deliver the beneﬁts of tailored education at scale,

serving millions of learners simultaneously while making language

learning fun and engaging. The result: Duolingo’s strategy to oﬀer

unique value to the marketplace attracted a massive global user base

and proﬁtable growth. By the end of 2024, Duolingo had more than

## 116.7 million monthly active users, 960 million total downloads, and 575

million registered users, making it by far the largest language-learning

platform in terms of user base and reach. As for revenue, it pulled in

## $748 million in 2024—up 40.8% from the previous year—with a net

income of $86.9 million. While Duolingo faced backlash earlier 2025

when the CEO stated the company would be “AI-ﬁrst,” triggering angst

that AI would be embraced over human workers, its revenue in the year

continues to climb and is up 40%.

# AI Agents’ Magnifying Effect

As technology advances, AI agents themselves make it clear that

investing in AI technology, however fancy it is, without a clear strategy

that delivers compelling value is unwise, underscoring the need for

companies to put strategy and value before AI.

As studies show, shoppers are increasingly using AI agents like ChatGPT

to make purchase decisions. As AI answers people’s buying queries,

it scrubs data from every site—large and small, distant and close—to

detect options, summarize reviews and assess the objective value of

oﬀerings. This raises buyer discernment and purchase options, and

levels the playing ﬁeld between established players and lesser-known

companies that deliver superior value.

As AI agents pull back the curtain on whose strategy is and isn’t

delivering exceptional value, they magnify the importance of getting

the strategy-value-AI sequence right. A little-known, smaller company

that would have previously been overlooked or not even registered can

now more easily trounce established players and brands if they oﬀer

compelling value. This raises the need for all companies—large and

small—to stand apart with a strategy that delivers exceptional value

regardless of the AI embedded in a company’s operations. The very

## beneﬁts of AI agents to users—fast evaluation of all possible options—

ﬂip the industry game to one no longer solely about big brands, market

## awareness, or diﬀerentiation with fancy AI technology

## 4 Questions to Ensure Your AI Strategy Creates Value

While AI continues to evolve and its full potential is still unfolding, here

are four questions every company should ask as they reach for AI.

- Are we jumping on the AI bandwagon out of fear of missing out or to

deliver an objective leap in value?

- Are we adopting AI in hopes of staying relevant, assuming it will

deliver new growth without fully considering whether and how

it aligns with and supports our company’s strategy and value

# proposition?

- Are we conﬂating AI’s technological innovation with real value and

will customers be convinced of the value it delivers?

- Is AI helping us build a viable, sustainable business model aligned

## with our strategy, or will its impact on our value proposition risk

undermining our proﬁtability?

Ultimately, how you answer these questions will largely determine

whether AI will open new horizons for growth and proﬁtability, or

whether it will lead your business into a familiar trap of inﬂated hopes,

# just like the internet bubble.
