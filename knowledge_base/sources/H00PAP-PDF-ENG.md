## The U.S. Immigration Debate Isn’t Left vs. Right

High-skilled immigration is an unambiguously good idea. by Andrew McAfee

## Published on HBR.org / March 04, 2014 / Reprint H00PAP

I sometimes ﬁnd it hard to believe that America’s current immigration

systems weren’t designed by our enemies. More liberal policies

and streamlined procedures would bring technical talent and

entrepreneurial energy at a time when we clearly need them. Yet these

reforms remain out of reach.

Overwhelmingly, the best and brightest in the world still want to come

here to study, work, and start companies; a worldwide 2012 Gallup

poll revealed that the US “holds the undisputed title as the world’s most

desired destination for potential migrants.”

We make it overwhelmingly diﬃcult for them, however. As Darrell West

of the Brookings Institution summarized, “For many immigrants, it is virtually impossible for them to aﬀord the fees, handle the paperwork,

and navigate a complex bureaucratic process…. American immigration

is a 19th century process in a 21st century world.”

We’ve made some small progress recently but a recent bipartisan

attempt at comprehensive reform, which includes such great ideas

as a separate ‘startup visa‘ category to foster entrepreneurship,

is languishing in the house after passing the Senate last year.

There’s a belief in some quarters that this reform will hurt low-wage

American workers (who are already hurting enough) by exposing them

to more competition from immigrants and thus lowering their job

prospects and wages. But the evidence is mounting that this threat is

at worst pretty small, and most likely nonexistent. As the American

Enterprise Institute (among many others) has found, immigrants tend to take diﬀerent jobs than natives, and so are not rivals.

I spoke recently at two events in California organized by FWD.us, a

tech industry advocacy group that has to date been squarely focused

on immigration (FWD.us covered my travel expenses, but did not

pay me anything). At the events themselves, and at the meals and

other gatherings around them, the accents varied greatly but the

stories didn’t. They were all about enthusiasm and love for America,

a deep desire to build a life and make contributions here, and intense

frustration at how hard it was to do this.

My favorite quote from the trip was from a very successful (US-born)

technologist who said that immigration reform was “not about the right

vs. the left; it’s about smart vs. dumb.”

Which side are you on?
