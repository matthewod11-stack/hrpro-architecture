little anxious about the etiquette of it all. As a newbie, I didn’t wantto come across as “too bold” and take time off “too soon,” so I waitedat least a year before dipping my toe into the PTO pool. On the otherhand, I’ve observed new employees take PTO immediately afterjoining the organization.I guess I’m stuck in this way of thinking you need to earn credibilityto deserve taking PTO. As I write this, that sounds toxic. Pleaseteach me about workplace PTO decorum, particularly whenstarting out at a new job.With gratitude,Scratching My HeadWe reached out to

Mita Mallick, the head of inclusion, equity, andimpact at Carta, to answer the question.Dear SMH,Your concern is a valid one! When we start a new job, we are alleager to make a great first impression. We want our boss and ournew team members to know they hired the right talent for therole. So, when (and how) to take personal time off or PTO canweigh on our minds. We might think that not taking a vacation isa sign of dedication and loyalty to our jobs. You may also worrythat others will perceive you as undetermined, lazy, or easilyreplaceable.

But the truth is: We all need time off from work and there’s nosuch thing as “earning” a break.Remember that paid vacation is a benefit your organizationoffers. You’re entitled to that. Your relationship with youremployer is a transactional one. That means, your companyemploys your time and energy to produce the results in exchangefor certain benefits. Likewise, you should take advantage of theperks your organization can offer to protect your well-being.If you don’t use it throughout the year, you’ll likely end up with alot of time off and little or no time left to indulge in rest, recovery,or however, you choose to spend those days. Think of it this way:For you to be productive and motivated at work, you needconsistent breaks to take care of your well-being. That’s thepurpose of those paid vacation days.Even so, asking for time off when you’re new can feeluncomfortable or overwhelming. Here are a few situations thatyou might encounter — and strategies around how to navigatethem.1) You have a vacation planned before you accept a joboffer.Inform your new boss while accepting the offer.You may have planned a vacation months before taking on a newrole. In such a situation, know that it’s perfectly acceptable toshare your plans while accepting the offer. Let your boss knowwhen you’re likely to take time off, how long your break will be,and what you can do to ensure smooth onboarding.Alternatively, you can also let your new boss know as soon as youstart — preferably in the first week — about your upcoming plans.

You can say, “I’d planned a trip to visit my grandparents later thissummer. I haven’t met them since 2020 when the pandemic hitand I’m really looking forward to spending time together. I’d needthree vacation days during the second week of June. Since it’s myfirst month here, I want to check in with you. I’m committed toensuring that my work deliverables are on track.”Be sure to end by reiterating your excitement about the role andyour commitment to the company to reassure your boss of yourgood intentions.Plan out your work and delegate tasks.If you have a supportive boss, they will likely understand,especially if you’ve had your vacation on the calendar for a while.Most people understand that these things take time to plan andcan be a big financial commitment.If you have a regular one-on-one meeting with your boss to checkin and talk about deliverables, use this time to understand whatyou can do to cover yourself while you’re out. Are there tasks youneed to delegate? Are there a couple of projects you need toprioritize before you leave? Your boss should be able to help guideyou.If you aren’t meeting with your boss regularly, set up a one-on-one to catch up and bring them up to speed. In this case, it can behelpful to come up with a couple of ideas in advance around howyou plan to execute your tasks while you’re away.Finally, if you’re working with a specific team member closely, itwill be useful (for you both) to set up a meeting before you leave.Share your upcoming plans, leading with: “I wanted to let youknow I’ll be taking a week off next month.”

Follow up by explaining what you plan to do ahead of time to helplighten their load in your absence, and then ask if they might bewilling to return the favor when you’re gone: “Given that we’reworking on two projects together, I wanted to ask what I can doahead of time to keep us on track and if I may be able to delegate acouple of things to you in my absence? I will be sure to finish X, Y,and Z before I go, but I may need help with the day-to-day taskssuch as A and B. Do you think you’d have the bandwidth to helpwith those tasks for the three days that I’m out?”A reasonable teammate will be grateful for the heads up. You’renot the only person in the office who is going to take a vacationthis year. When the time comes, your peers will likely need to askthe same of you.2) You don’t have a pre-planned vacation.This seems like the situation you’ve been facing. When you don’thave immediate travel or vacation plans, my advice is to use thefirst 90 days to understand your company’s culture: learn aboutthe leave policies, observe others, and build trust with yourmanager.Here’s how to start.Educate yourself about the company policies.Some companies offer a specific number of PTO days from theday you join, while others may have unlimited PTO for allemployees. In yet other cases, you may accrue a certain number ofPTO days every month. In addition to this, more and morecompanies are now beginning to offer spontaneous employeeappreciation days, unlimited sick days, family wellness days, ormental health days. This is being done to recognize and addressemployee burnout and improve engagement.

When you start a new job, pay attention to what your company’spolicies are. The details of your policies should be included in thematerials that accompanied your original offer letter. It may alsobe available in the employee handbook or in your company’sinternal website. If you’re unaware or want to learn more, reachout to your manager or the human resources (HR) leader for moredetails. Learning about these policies will help you feel moreconfident in requesting time off.Observe others.One of the most effective strategies is to pay attention to howothers in the organization use their leaves. Ask yourself:

How often do your team members, as well as your boss, taketime oﬀ?

When do you see more people on leave?

What is the process of covering for colleagues when someone isout?

How comfortable are your peers, colleagues, and boss abouttalking about vacations or holidays with one another?Observing the attitudes and culture around leave policies will giveyou a sense of how early you need to communicate your leaveplans to your boss, who you can reach out to for help, and howoften you can take time off without any fear or guilt.Build trust and rapport with your boss and team.Another way to ease your anxieties is to spend the first threemonths of your new job building a foundation of trust with yourboss and immediate team members. This means that you show upfor meetings on time, ask thoughtful questions during the

onboarding process, communicate openly, raise your hand andpitch in when you can, and meet your deliverables.Even better, use this time to get to know your colleagues on amore personal level: have virtual or in-person lunch or coffeechats, look to discover your mutual interests, and pay attention towhat they value. Doing so will help you become a more proactiveand helpful teammate.The goal of building a good rapport with your team isn’t to makeyourself “deserving” of a vacation. Rather, it’s to create a genuineconnection with people and build a good reputation. If you knowthat your boss and peers respect your character, it will inevitablyease some of the insecurities you may be feeling about beingjudged for taking a break. In addition, understanding your teammember’s unique working styles will you to support each other inthe best ways possible during those times.Let people know sooner rather than later.Once you commit to taking a vacation, ensure that you let yourmanager and team know at least two-three weeks ahead of time.Be considerate to not overlap your leaves with too many otherteam members and figure out who can cover for you when you’reout. When others are out on vacation, you can also volunteer tocover for them.3) You work in an “always on” and a “no breaks” culture.Recognize that it’s them, not you.Even if you notice that your manager, team, or the overallcompany culture isn’t very supportive of vacations, know that youhave nothing to be guilty or ashamed of. As long as your policystates that you’re entitled to days off, you can and should be ableto take them.

If you sense hesitation from your boss upon asking to exercise thebenefits granted to you, don’t be afraid to make your case. You cansay, “Taking this time off is important to me since I haven’t seenmy family for over two years now. Is there anything I can do tomake you feel more comfortable with it? What concerns do youhave that I could help address for you and the team? I would reallyappreciate your support.”We’ve all seen the loss and grief that most of us have enduredduring the pandemic — with companies being pushed to includemore inclusive leave policies such as bereavement leaves,extended sick days, caregiving and wellness days, and childcareleaves. Should an emergency arrive, remind yourself that taking aholiday to look after yourself or your loved ones doesn’t make youdisengaged or unmotivated at work.Rather, asking for the time you deserve is a sign that yourecognize and appreciate the things (and people) that areimportant to help you work better: your health, your family, andmost importantly, yourself.
