Love it or hate it, ofﬁce politics is an inevitable part of organizational

life. Many people associate political behavior with backstabbing and

manipulation — but there is a constructive side to being politically

savvy. Being able to negotiate, inﬂuence, engage, convince, and

persuade others is how things get done in organizations — and how

organizations decide what’s worth doing at all. Developing political skill

reduces stress and enhances performance, reputation, promotability,

and career progression at work. A 2008 survey of 250 managers in the

UK revealed that 90% of them believed that political skill is required

to succeed and to improve one’s career prospects. This has been

further supported by numerous research studies that make the case for

engaging in oﬃce politics. While the link between political skill and

career success is ﬁrmly established, there is a problem: Oﬃce politics

## doesn’t work for everyone in the same way.

Although current research investigating gender or ethnic diﬀerences in

political skill is limited, researchers Pamela Perrewé and Debra Nelson

argue that women often overlook the importance of oﬃce politics and

rely on task accomplishment as the primary means of advancing their

careers. Many women are reluctant to engage with it, or even see it

as distasteful. Some people have called women and racial minorities

“politically naïve” for avoiding politics, and argued that training and

mentoring initiatives are necessary to help women see the value in

oﬃce politics and learn to play the game.

This argument, however, is built on the assumption that women and

minorities lack the political skills needed to navigate organizational

life. Recent research does not support this idea. A 2013 study published

in the Journal of Leadership Studies ﬁnds that men and women see

themselves as equal in relation to their political abilities. A 2015 study

published in the Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal discovered that

female students perceive themselves to be more politically skilled than

male students. If the issue isn’t a lack of skill, then why are women and

racial minorities less engaged in oﬃce politics? Unpacking this issue

is critical given the established link between political skill and career

# advancement.

# Same Game, Different Beneﬁts

Dominant groups in organizations generally set the standards for

behavior within their workplaces, and as Caucasian men hold most

leadership positions today, it can be argued that they set the norms

for political behavior at work. In one study, the researchers go as far as

describing oﬃce politics as a “white man’s game.” Based on a review of

the existing literature, this study ﬁnds that mentoring and networking

are indeed critical to developing political understanding. Women and racial minorities did not diﬀer from white men on their self-reported

levels of networking and mentoring; however, only white men beneﬁted

from these activities. It seems even if women and racial minorities

engage in political behaviors, they may not beneﬁt from them in the

same way that white men do.

The reason for this is that political behaviors are considered a more

stereotypical image for white men, and therefore the beneﬁts will be

selectively applied to white men who choose to engage in them. In

the research undertaken by Kate Davey in 2008, women described

oﬃce politics as an informal system that keeps power with those

who have it, while excluding those who don’t. In this study, women’s

descriptions of career barriers were in fact descriptions of political

barriers. Subsequent research has borne this out: Even though women

and racial minorities understand the political environment, they may

not gain the advantages white men do by engaging in it.

# The Political Double Bind

A key reason for this is that for women and minorities, engaging in

political behaviors means engaging in behaviors that are not their

own. Davey’s research, for example, found that women associate

political behaviors with traditionally masculine attributes — like being

aggressive and competitive. Engaging in this behavior is like walking

a tightrope for women or racial minorities. On the one hand, they

need to engage in traditionally white male political behaviors to

advance their careers, but on the other, engaging in these behaviors

challenges ingrained gender and racial stereotypes. As a result, the

person engaging in the behavior experiences backlash. Supporting

this argument is Perrewé and Nelson’s research, which suggests that

the range of acceptable political behavior both is very narrow for

women and often includes inherent contradictions. For example, a key

political skill is drawing attention to your accomplishments, but women are expected to be humble, communal, and self-eﬀacing.

# Playing the Game Comes at a Cost

The political double bind also inﬂuences individual motivation and

stress. Speciﬁcally, research published in the British Journal of

Management in 2013 ﬁnds that women view organizational politics

as an expression of masculine culture. Responses to it range from

reluctance to resistance and ﬁnally acceptance. This acceptance is

based on the awareness that these are the rules of the game. To obtain

functional beneﬁts, like access to lucrative relationships and coalitions,

women and ethnic minorities should engage in political tactics — even

if there is no guarantee of success.

Political behaviors are the standard for how things get done in

organizations, leaving individuals with little choice but to engage. This

comes at a cost. Research has found women who engage in oﬃce

politics often consider it emotionally draining, and anecdotal evidence

suggests that women may even reject leadership roles because of their

dislike of oﬃce politics. Future research needs to investigate whether

this holds true for minority groups as well as white men, as we may ﬁnd

that oﬃce politics is really an outdated game that no one wants to play.

Given the challenges that organizational politics creates for women

and racial minorities, perhaps we should stop implementing programs

aimed at improving political skill — since it doesn’t seem the problem

is a lack of skill — and instead focus on creating environments that

support individuals engaging in a diverse range of behaviors.

What would this environment look like? One place to start is

collaboration. Research published in the Journal of Applied Psychology

argues that women prefer work environments that foster cooperation,

teamwork, and support. Creating cooperative rather than competitive

environments will allow more women to thrive. This was further

supported by research undertaken by Accenture, which found 14 factors

that contribute to creating cultures of equality, and these fell into three

key areas: making diversity a top leadership priority, including men in

diversity initiatives, and ensuring employees feel comfortable creating,

innovating, and being themselves at work. In these environments

women are four times more likely, and men are twice as likely, to

rise to senior management positions. It seems that creating work

environments that are less competitive and more cooperative serves to

beneﬁt us all. Oﬃce politics may be a white man’s game, but it is a game

that beneﬁts only some white men.

One barrier to creating a more equitable system for everyone may be the

leaders in charge today. These leaders not only set the political norms

but also help create and maintain the political environment that favors

them at the disadvantage of everyone else. Creating cooperative work

environments is one way to ﬁx this, but that can only be achieved if

today’s existing leaders are willing to give up the game.
