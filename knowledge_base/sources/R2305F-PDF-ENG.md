When Diversity Meets Feedback How to promote candor across cultural, gender, and generational divides by Erin Meyer

## From the Magazine (September–October 2023) / Reprint R2305F

If you’ve picked up a book about raising organizational performance

in the past ﬁve years, you’ve almost certainly read about the beneﬁts

of developing a culture of candid feedback. Kim Scott, a former Google

executive, popularized the term “radical candor” in her 2017 book by

that name, arguing that even “obnoxiously aggressive” feedback was

better than “ruinous empathy” (keeping feedback that could otherwise

# help colleagues to yourself).

The hedge fund billionaire and Bridgewater founder Ray Dalio went

a step further in his book Principles, describing a culture of “radical

transparency,” in which employees rate and give feedback about one

another’s contributions to meetings on publicly shared documents as

the meetings actually take place. And in his 2020 book No Rules Rules

(which I coauthored), Reed Hastings, Netﬂix’s founder and executive

chairman, lists candid feedback as one of the top three ingredients of an

innovative organization. A popular motto at Netﬂix is “Only say about

someone what you will say to their face.” If an employee comes to the

boss to complain about another employee, the boss is to respond, “What

did your colleague say when you gave them that feedback?”

Most employees also recognize the beneﬁts of frank and honest

feedback, and they say they want more of it. In a 2019 survey by

Zenger Folkman, 94% of 2,700 respondents said they believed corrective

feedback improved their performance when it was presented well, while

nearly two-thirds agreed with the statement “My performance and

possibilities for success in my career would have increased substantially

if I had been given more feedback.” The survey’s authors conclude

that feedback—done right—can truly be a gift to individuals and

# organizations.

But there’s another movement in business that has increasingly gained

steam: diversity, equity, and inclusion. Bolstered by the Black Lives

Matter and #MeToo movements, DEI is perhaps the most overarching

organizational culture trend of the decade. Today every single Fortune

100 company cites DEI as a key priority on its website.

At ﬁrst glance, DEI seems compatible with a culture of honest feedback.

The more diverse the workforce, the more beneﬁcial it is to hear

everyone’s opinions, and the more we all succeed. When Satya Nadella

took over Microsoft, in 2014, he declared that he would work to turn

what had become a know-it-all culture into a learn-it-all culture. While

know-it-alls are focused on raising their status by showing oﬀ their

expertise and hiding their weaknesses, learn-it-alls have the courage

and humility to listen openly to constructive criticism and are eager to

hear the opinions of teammates who have diverse viewpoints.

When it comes to sharing feedback and advice, diversity often leads to complications, which, if not understood and managed, can create bad feelings.

## Unfortunately, a learn-it-all culture doesn’t arise naturally. And when

it comes to sharing feedback and advice, diversity often leads to

complications, which, if not understood and managed, can create

an environment rife with bad feelings, defensiveness, and ruptured

relationships. That’s because the vast majority of people aren’t ready

to receive criticism unless they feel safe with the person providing it.

Do the people assessing your work really mean to help you, or are they

surreptitiously trying to embarrass you, take your job, or usurp your

# power?

Diversity in the workplace, in fact, increases the likelihood that people

will interpret feedback as an act of hostility. That means that people

must be careful about how they provide it. Of course, diversity at

work today encompasses many types of diﬀerences, from race and

sexual orientation to religious and ethnic background. In the following

pages I’ll focus on how people can improve the way they deliver

feedback across three speciﬁc types of diversity: cultures, genders,

and generations. I’ll also describe strategies for fostering a climate in

which candor and diversity can coexist. I’ll conclude by looking at

how organizational practices can make frequent and regular feedback

a standard part of working life.

# Alarm Bells in the Brain

Giving feedback is tricky even before factoring in the complications that

arise from diversity, as an experiment I did with more than 3,000 executives

who were my students at INSEAD shows. In it I presented them with a

# simple multiple-choice problem.

# The Situation

You go to a meeting with a customer and a teammate. The teammate is

senior to you but isn’t your boss. You’re friendly but not close. In the

meeting your colleague speaks too loudly and is too intense. Your customer,

a reserved person, responds with evident discomfort. When your customer

speaks, your teammate often doesn’t look at her, giving the impression that

he isn’t taking her seriously. When the meeting is over, will you give this

# feedback to your colleague?

# Your Options

A. Yes. I’ll give it clearly and quickly. It will help him, the client, and the

# organization.

B. Maybe. He hasn’t asked for feedback. I’m not his boss, so it’s not my

responsibility. I’ll wait and see if the right opportunity arises.

C. No. Unless he asks me, I won’t provide it. I don’t know if he is open to it,

and I don’t want to risk hurting our relationship.

In my research, more than 90% of participants chose option A, giving

the feedback. This was consistent across industries, genders, cultural

backgrounds, and job levels. Surprised, I began asking a follow-up

question: “What about your teammates? Would they provide the feedback?”

This led to reflection and often laughter. Overwhelmingly, participants

responded, “No. My teammates would clearly not provide the feedback.”

(Follow-up comments included things like “In fact, I never receive any

## feedback at all, except occasionally from my boss.”)

This prompted me to tease them, asking, “Isn’t it interesting that only those

rare people who would provide the feedback participate in my sessions?”

Apparently, most managers, when faced with this problem in a classroom,

say they’ll give the feedback, but in real life they don’t.

The issue is that the scenario triggers a conflict in people’s brains between

the frontal cortex and the amygdala. The cortex, the most logical part of

the brain, loves candid feedback. But the brain’s most primitive part, the

# amygdala, doesn’t.

If you tell me I’ve acted ineffectively, it may trigger an alarm in my

amygdala: “Danger! I might get kicked out of my tribe!” The stress

hormones cortisol and adrenaline flood my bloodstream, throwing my

body into “fight or flight” mode. The fight reaction leads me to respond

defensively: “I’m not the problem. You are!” The flight reaction may result

in a comment like “Thanks so much for that feedback. That is very helpful,”

after which I try to never speak to you again.

The challenge with feedback, therefore, is to make sure that your delivery

succeeds in helping the cortex override the amygdala.

giving criticism to—or receiving it from—people from a wide variety

# of cultures and countries.

The risk of upsetting people in these situations is high. That’s because

what’s considered a constructive way to oﬀer feedback in one culture

is often perceived as destructive in another. It isn’t easy for outsiders

to understand the nuances around feedback in other cultures. For

## example, people across the world most often stereotype American

culture as exceedingly direct. In some aspects this stereotype is true.

Americans tend to place a high value on clear, simple communication

and on actions like recapping key points and conﬁrming decisions in

writing. This approach certainly feels straightforward to many. But the

story changes when it comes to negative feedback, whether in a critical

performance review or an evaluation of a colleague’s less-than-ideal

# presentation.

In those situations Americans tend to place an especially strong

emphasis on preserving the self-esteem of the feedback recipient,

leading to common American practices such as giving three positives

for every negative, catching people doing things right, and using

superlatives to accentuate the positive, even when the negative is the

key point. (“Overall it was excellent. To this part you might want to

make some small tweaks.”) This is downright confusing for people in

countries where managers are much more likely to tell it like it is (the

## Netherlands, Germany, Denmark, Israel, Russia, and France—where I

# live—to name just a few).

A case in point is Olga, a Ukrainian human resource executive who

attended my course at INSEAD. “In my culture if there is a problem, we

say it clearly,” Olga explained. “We don’t perceive it as demotivating or

unkind to say to a colleague, ‘This is not OK,’ or ‘This behavior must

change.’ We don’t talk about what we liked and appreciated before

getting to the point or start the conversation by talking about the

weather. We jump to the issue at hand.”

Olga hadn’t given cultural diﬀerences a lot of thought until she moved

from Ukraine to West Virginia. In her job there, she says, “My colleague

Cathy was responsible for payroll. Each month when the paychecks

went out, there were mistakes. It was causing frustration, so I invited her into my oﬃce and said, ‘Cathy, this absolutely cannot continue.

Your mistakes are creating big headaches.’”

In less-direct cultures the explicitness of the American approach to feedback is likely to be perceived as inappropriately blunt.

Later, when the seasonal-employee manager emailed Olga privately to

complain (“Unbelievable! Cathy got the amounts wrong yet again”),

Olga replied all, copying Cathy so that she could see the manager’s

comments herself and responding, “You are right. This is completely

unacceptable, and it won’t happen again.” To Olga’s surprise, her boss

stopped by to correct her behavior, which he referred to as “indelicate.”

He informed her that Cathy had been so upset, she had asked to change

jobs. He explained that Olga should not be critical of someone’s work

when other people are copied on the communication. He also suggested

she use “might” and “should” rather than “must” and “can’t.” For Olga,

this was a cultural eye-opener.

The complexity doesn’t stop there. Americans may be masters at

wrapping positives around negatives, but in some less-direct cultures

the explicitness of the American approach is still likely to be perceived

as inappropriately blunt. Take Jethro, a soft-spoken but forthright

American working in Silicon Valley. With little understanding of

cultural diﬀerences, he soon found himself in trouble for giving

feedback (by video) to coworkers in Thailand using methods common

in the United States. HR in Bangkok responded by complaining that he

was bullying his Thai colleagues.

Jethro describes the situation like this: “I’d thought carefully about how

to provide the feedback. My comments (both verbal and then in writing)

were speciﬁc, explaining what actions had led to positive results and

which had been problematic, and then outlining clearly what my

colleagues needed to do diﬀerently to improve client satisfaction.”

The head of HR in Thailand had some feedback of her own, however.

“The American tendency to give feedback by explicitly stating ‘the area

in need of improvement’ already feels aggressive to a Thai recipient,”

she told Jethro. “To make things worse, Americans frequently end

discussions by recapping key points in writing, which makes us feel that

you don’t trust us to do as we say or are trying to get us in trouble.”

She explained that Jethro would have more

success if instead of detailing what his Thai

colleagues had done wrong, he praised

what was good clearly and left out what

was bad. If he was speciﬁc about the things

that had worked well, he didn’t need to

Thai employees would understand that he

was not happy with what he hadn’t

mentioned. For example, when

commenting on a presentation he’d just

week.” He wouldn’t need to say, “The examples from this morning’s

presentation were not very good.” It would be implied clearly enough.

Jethro learned the same lesson Olga did: “I saw clearly that what

is normal and appropriate feedback in my culture may come oﬀ as

completely inappropriate somewhere else,” he reﬂects.

One way to gauge what feedback works best in another culture is

to listen carefully to the words chosen by your counterparts. People

from more-direct cultures tend to use what linguists call “upgraders”

when providing criticism. These are words that make criticism feel

stronger—like “absolutely,” totally,” or “completely.” For example, “This

is absolutely inappropriate” or “This is totally unprofessional.” By

contrast, more-indirect cultures use more “downgraders” when giving

negative feedback. These are words that soften the criticism, such as

“kind of,” “a little,” and “maybe.”

Another type of downgrader is a deliberate understatement—for

example, saying, “We are not quite there yet,” when you really mean

“This is nowhere close to complete,” or saying, “This is just my opinion,”

when you really mean “I’m certain this is obvious to everyone.”

With a little awareness you can notice when you’re using upgraders

and downgraders and when those around you are and make slight

adjustments to get the desired results. When it comes to providing

feedback internationally, the message is not “Do unto others as you

would have them do unto you” but “Do unto others as they would have

done unto themselves.”

## Feedback Across Genders: Give the Gift of Power First

Cultural diﬀerences represent only a small part of diversity in the

workplace. Gender diﬀerences add to the complexity. As a woman at

a business school where over three-quarters of the faculty members are

men, I began thinking early on about how gender aﬀects when and how

# we share our opinions.

Research shows that leaders who are women, much more than their

male counterparts, are expected to be warm and nice (traditionally seen

as female traits) as well as competent and tough (traits traditionally expected from men and leaders). This line is diﬃcult to walk, and

women who provide frank negative feedback risk being perceived

as combative. One 2020 study conducted at Stanford University

demonstrated that while women and men are equally likely to be

described as having technical ability, women are signiﬁcantly more

likely to be described as aggressive. That’s why women who provide

candid feedback risk being perceived as on the attack.

The dynamics are just as complicated but completely diﬀerent for men.

In 2008 an essay by Rebecca Solnit inspired the term “mansplaining,”

which describes situations in which a man explains something to a

woman who knows more about it than he does. “Manvising” hasn’t

made it into our lexicon yet, but most women ﬁnd the phenomenon

equally familiar. The term describes moments when men give women

advice that they have neither asked for nor want. Solnit herself provided

this very simple illustration in an article she wrote in 2022: “A few years

ago, a friend of mine got married, and when I pulled up to the rustic

wedding site, a man I didn’t know positioned himself behind my car to

make dramatic hand signals. I didn’t need or ask for help, but he was

giving it, and I’m sure he thought the credit for my success in parking

my small car in this very easy spot was at least partly his.”

While providing advice can indeed be generous and kind, it also creates the impression that you’re putting yourself above the person you’re giving it to.

Solnit’s implication is that this man provided unsolicited advice

because he thought that his skills were superior to hers since he was

a man. That could have been his thinking, but research reveals that

men are as likely to give unsolicited advice to other men as they are to

women. Research also reveals that women give considerable amounts

of advice to other women. It’s with cross-gender feedback that the

discrepancy becomes clear: One research project showed that men are

ﬁve times as likely to give unrequested advice to women as women are

to give it to men.

That’s a problem because while providing advice can indeed be

generous and kind, it also creates the impression that you’re putting

yourself above the person you’re giving it to. In my own research

I’ve interviewed dozens of men and women about this phenomenon.

I’ve found that although most men don’t believe they’re guilty of

manvising, well over 90% of women report that they have recently

received unsolicited advice from their male colleagues.

One of my interviewees, a software industry marketing VP I’ll call

Cassandra, provided an example. At an all-hands meeting attended

by 2,000 colleagues, she had to give two presentations about a major

project she was leading. In the ﬁrst she presented the results of nine

months of work. She was anxious because the reception she got could

make or break the project. Despite her fears, she felt she’d aced the

presentation and, elated, made her way to the speakers’ lounge to wait

for the second presentation. There she bumped into her colleague Miles,

who had spoken earlier that morning.

Here’s what happened next: “I was pleased to relax and have a chat,”

Cassandra recalls. “After a few friendly exchanges, Miles surprised me

with feedback: ‘Your presentation was 90% perfect. The audience was

eating it up! I do think you spoke a little too fast, which made you sound

nervous. Also, maybe your mouth was too close to the mic because your

voice somehow sounded tinny.’ Although Miles’s feedback in retrospect

was actionable and meant to help before I went back onstage, I felt like

he had hijacked my self-conﬁdence. I had been feeling great about what

I’d accomplished, and now I felt like an inexperienced child receiving

coaching from a teacher. I noticed my body physically shifting back in

my chair to get as far away from Miles as possible.”

As Cassandra’s story demonstrates, even when feedback is provided

with a genuine desire to help, it clearly gives the person dispensing

## it emotional power over the person on the receiving end. One study

has found that when people get spontaneous feedback, their heart rate

jumps to a level that indicates moderate or extreme duress. It’s no

wonder that when one person oﬀers feedback to another, the recipient’s

composure is shaken.

Research also shows that the act of

providing advice makes people feel more

powerful. One study asked 94 library

employees how often they gave advice

during their workday. The more advice

someone gave, the more powerful that

individual reported feeling. In another

study the same researchers asked 188

students to read and respond to a written

account of a student struggling to choose a

major. Both the act of dispensing the advice and later being told that the

student had read the advice increased the subjects’ feeling of power.

All this makes cross-gender feedback tricky. A member of the majority

(a male colleague, for example) who provides feedback to someone from

an underrepresented group (like a woman in a management position) is

likely to come oﬀ as belittling—even when sincerely trying to help.

History isn’t destiny, however. Using what I call the “three A’s of

feedback,” you can teach your workforce how to oﬀer advice in a way

that gets the useful input out there while still balancing the power

dynamics. The ﬁrst A is that feedback must be intended to assist. (It

should always be provided with the genuine intention of helping your

counterpart succeed and never be given just to get frustration oﬀ your

chest.) The second is that it must be actionable. If it’s not crystal clear

from your input what your counterpart can do to improve, then keep it

# to yourself.

The third A is to ask for feedback before you provide it. This is

## especially important with cross-gender interactions. Unless someone

has speciﬁcally requested your advice (in which case jump in and give

it), solicit suggestions about your own work before you oﬀer anyone

your insights. If Miles had started his discussion with Cassandra by

saying, “I’d love to hear any thoughts you have about my presentation

this morning,” he would have put her in a position of power before

turning the tables, which would have led her to treat his advice as

valuable help rather than an attempt to assert dominance.

## Feedback Across Generations: Create an Explicit Team Culture

Generational diversity in the workplace has increased signiﬁcantly

over the past decades, as people are living longer, healthier lives and

retiring later. In today’s organizations people might be collaborating

with colleagues from four generations all at once—something unheard

# of a few decades ago.

I started to become interested in age diversity at work 25 years ago in my

ﬁrst management role. I had hired a woman who was exactly the same

age as my mother to join my team. A pharmacist by training, Carole

was elegant and worldly and was taking on her ﬁrst job after spending

18 years raising children. I still remember how awkward I felt when she began having diﬃculty with a client and I had to give her corrective

guidance. The age diﬀerence hadn’t seemed a problem when things

were going well, but I couldn’t ﬁgure out how to avoid coming oﬀ as

obnoxious when I outlined which behaviors she needed to change.

The experience I was having is sometimes referred to as status

incongruence. This basically means that the status accorded your role in

society doesn’t match the part you’re playing in the current context. One

research project with 8,000 employees in Germany showed that when

younger managers supervise older workers, status incongruence has a

measurable negative impact on employees’ happiness. It’s not just that

I feel strange treating my elder as my subordinate. As the researchers of

this study concluded, the role reversal constantly suggests to the older

subordinate that that person has somehow “failed to keep pace.”

To complicate the challenge further, each succeeding generation has

developed its own ideas about who should give feedback to whom, how

formal or spontaneous that feedback should be, and how much praise

versus criticism should be articulated. One member may expect that

feedback will be given annually from boss to subordinate, for instance,

and another that real-time feedback will be given in all directions. Here

are a few of the key diﬀerences:

## Baby Boomers (now in their late ﬁfties and sixties and seventies)

were the ﬁrst to get graded in school on “works well with others.”

They were also the ﬁrst to have work discussions about interpersonal

eﬀectiveness and emotional intelligence and saw feedback as a way to

improve both. Though previous generations were more likely to hint

at what should be done diﬀerently than to state feedback outright,

Boomers introduced the annual performance review. According to

## the generational researcher Lynne Lancaster (coauthor of When

Generations Collide), they learned that feedback should be formal

and documented and given in annual meetings between boss and

# subordinate.

Each generation has its own ideas about who should give feedback to whom and how much praise versus criticism should be articulated.

Gen Xers (in their forties to mid ﬁfties) grew up with rising divorce

rates and two-income families. Left to fend for themselves at home,

these “latchkey kids” learned to get along without an authority ﬁgure.

Do-it-yourselfers, they relied on notes from Mom explaining how to

cook pasta. They tend to be considerably less formal than their Boomer

colleagues and don’t want to wait all year to know how they’re doing.

They are the ﬁrst generation to begin giving upward feedback to the

boss. And according to Lancaster, they’re more likely to want feedback

# instantaneously.

Millennials, or Generation Y (in their late twenties and thirties), were

raised when child-rearing psychology focused on building self-esteem.

A product of helicopter parenting and the philosophy that “every

child gets a trophy,” they’re sometimes referred to sarcastically as the

“snowﬂake generation” (because they’re sensitive and easily crushed).

But according to the generational expert Neil Howe (who coauthored

Generations), this stereotype is misleading. Millennials do have high

self-esteem, he says, but their self-conﬁdence seems to be correlated

# with emotional resilience.

Research conducted in 2019 showed that when it comes to accepting

feedback, Millennials are less sensitive than their older colleagues are.

Though members of this generation expect and appreciate frequent and

copious praise, don’t expect them to wilt when the criticism is tough.

# Walter Chandoha/Trunk Archive

Zoomers (in their teens to mid twenties) were the ﬁrst generation to

grow up surrounded by social media. With YouTube channels and

TikTok platforms they came of age in a world of constant informal

feedback. Zoomers learned to post something on social media in the

morning and watch reactions come in all day long. They are more

likely to expect to give and receive frequent, real-time feedback in all

directions (subordinate to boss, peer to peer, and so on).

The cross-generational tensions these diﬀerences engender are

captured nicely by the experience of Richard, a business writer in his

late ﬁfties who works in a major media group. Recently he attended a

session where all the members of his department took turns giving one

another feedback on their current projects. First a couple of other senior

colleagues gave Richard both praise and tips for improving his work.

Then it was Connor’s turn.

A talented writer in his mid twenties, Connor was less ﬂattering. “This

is all right,” he told Richard, “but you completely left your personality

out. Your audience wants to feel that you’re with them, but your

individual voice is absent.” Richard took it badly. “Something about

getting feedback from this kid who has decades less experience than

me felt very uncomfortable,” he recalls. “My immediate reaction was to

reject his comments. I wasn’t ready to listen to what he was saying, let

alone collaborate with him again.”

Not only was Connor decades younger than Richard, leading to status

incongruence, but in Richard’s Baby Boomer generation, feedback from

someone who is not your boss is infrequent and inappropriate. Richard

left the meeting shaking his head at this inexperienced kid telling him

his writing was missing a clear voice.

If you’re leading a multigenerational team, the best way to deal with

diverse expectations about feedback is often to outline explicit norms

for how and when it should be given. That creates a common platform

on which all can converge.

Despite the discomfort Richard felt when receiving criticism from

Connor, he understood that Connor was behaving in line with the

culture of the team. This pushed him to stop and reﬂect. “After I got

home, I started to think about the feedback I’d received,” Richard says.

“It became clear that Connor’s had been the most valuable. The guys

who come from my generation have a similar perspective to my own,

but Connor’s diﬀerent perspective pushed me to see how to make my

writing richer. He was right. My experience as a journalist had taught

me to leave myself out of my writing, and in this case it made the

piece feel sterile. The fact that Connor comes from a generation where

people self-disclose more openly made it easier for him to pinpoint

# Getting Everyone in the Feedback Loop

Most recent research has focused on the beneﬁts of real-time feedback.

See the problem, correct the problem. That’s OK if you’re the

boss passing feedback on to your staﬀ. But if you’re younger and

less experienced (or working on any highly diverse team), stopping

colleagues in the hall to tell them how they could do their jobs better

is likely to put your teammates on the defensive, make you a bunch of

enemies, and maybe even stunt your career.

There is one mechanism that eﬀectively surfaces all the diverse

feedback learn-it-alls need to thrive. If you build regular loops for

feedback into collaborations, your team will recognize it not as a sign

of condescension or malevolence but as an integral part of the job. This

involves setting aside speciﬁc moments for mutual exchanges: I know

I’m expected to listen openly as you give me actionable feedback about

what you think I’ve done well and what I could do to improve. Then I

will do the same for you. Just like brushing our teeth, we do it regularly,

to keep team performance high.

In setting up any loop, you need to clarify how much positive versus

constructive feedback each teammate should supply. You can, for

example, have people structure their feedback as one thing they feel

that the other person is doing well and one thing the other person could

do to up his or her performance. Alternatively, you can use a “start, stop,

continue” structure, describing one thing to start doing, one thing to

stop doing, and one thing to continue.

Given the maturity and cohesion of your team, you may institute loops

that are more or less public. Here are three possible approaches:

One-to-one chats. If your team members have never given one another

feedback, a good initial step is to ask your immediate reports to meet

individually with each of their team members in the coming month to

share feedback, following the ground rules just described. The feedback

# remains between the two teammates.

“Speed-dating” sessions. If team relationships are closer, you may be

ready to share a little more openly. Ask participants to prepare rapid-ﬁre

feedback for one another. Send them oﬀ in pairs for six minutes of

discussion, with each giving feedback for three minutes. Then have

everyone move on to another colleague. At the end of the meeting have

all team members report back to the group on one helpful piece of

feedback they received that they will act on.

Live 360-degree feedback circles. If you have a mature team with

strong relationships, get members together over a meal and take turns.

If I’m up ﬁrst, the person to my left gives me feedback (in front of the

group). I listen and say thank you. Then the person to the left of that

team member gives me feedback. Once we’ve completed the circle, we

move on to the next recipient. At the end each person reports one key

takeaway from the feedback received.

Exchanging feedback in front of a team requires courage but oﬀers clear

advantages. It stops members from whispering behind one another’s

backs and encourages the entire team to see feedback as a normal

and healthy way to achieve success. One person who experienced a 360-

degree circle told me, “Getting publicly ripped apart sounds like torture.

Each time I go to a live 360, I’m nervous. But after you get started,

you see it’ll be ﬁne. Because everyone is watching, people are careful

to be generous and supportive with the single intention of helping you

succeed. No one wants to embarrass or attack you. Everyone gets a lot of

tough advice, so you’re not singled out. When your turn comes, it might be diﬃcult to hear what people have to say, but this is one of the greatest

developmental gifts of your life.”

. . .

Once you have the right feedback loops in place, you’re on your way to

building a team full of learn-it-alls who thrive on diverse perspectives. If

your group is made up of people from a variety of cultures, genders, and

generations, getting your employees to give feedback to one another

frequently and openly allows each to get myriad ideas for how to

improve, pushes the team toward excellence, exposes blind spots, and

promotes greater cohesion. That’s how you can make sure DEI and

radical candor converge rather than collide.
