Managers and organizational leaders are currently exploring the best

ways to conduct in-person and hybrid work, striving to make the oﬃce

as inviting as possible while leveraging in-oﬃce time for collaborative

## activities. In this moment of reﬂection about when, where, and how

work should be done, it’s an opportune time to explore out-of-the-box

# ideas.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: The Benefits of a Pet-Friendly Workplace

Let us propose one you may not have considered yet: Your oﬃce pet

policy. Based on a new article in the Journal of Management, published

## with our colleagues Carisa Lam at University College London and Kai

Chi Yam at the National University of Singapore, we make an evidence-

based case for welcoming four-legged companions as a competitive

# advantage.

## Pet-Friendly Offices as a Recruitment and Retention Tool

Today, 66% of American households include a pet. The numbers are

even higher for millennials and Gen-Zs. Almost one in ﬁve families

added a pet during the pandemic shutdown. Over the past three years,

employees have happily settled into work arrangements that involve

their four-legged companions: snuggling up during a Zoom call or going

# on a mid-afternoon walk.

Force employees to pick between their pet and returning to the oﬃce

and you may not like their choice. One study highlighted intense

## feelings of guilt and job dissatisfaction among veterinary nurses most

bonded to their own pets when forced to separate. Indeed, surveys

suggest that an increasing number of employees plan not only their

## workday routines but also their career decisions with their pets in mind.

Online discussion forums feature many a confessional like this one from

The Dodo: “I left my full-time job in Chicago to spend more time with

Cody — and I have no regrets.”

In contrast, welcoming pets has tangible beneﬁts. Studies in diverse

settings — traditional oﬃces but also universities, prisons, hospitals,

and courthouses — demonstrate that the presence of animals increases

employee commitment and career satisfaction and reduces turnover intentions. These positive eﬀects hold even for employees who have no

pets or do not actively interact with animals at work. Why? Because

pet-friendly policies are seen as evidence that organizations prioritize

employee well-being. For this reason, job seekers also prefer pet-friendly

workplaces. Welcoming pets can help attract and retain the employees

you wish to bring back to the oﬃce.

## In-Office Pets Enhance Workplace Well-being

## In academic and U.S. national surveys alike, the majority of employees

express beliefs that pets contribute to a more pleasant and social work

environment. They are on to something. Various studies we analyzed

found that the mere presence of animals provides employees comfort, buﬀers against stress, enhances work engagement, and improves

## work-life quality. For instance, in one study, the presence of facility

dogs in hospitals was associated with increased employee sense of

## accomplishment, positive job attitudes, and greater mental health.

# In-Office Pets Spark Collaboration

Most surprising to our author team was the mounting evidence that

pets function as a social lubricant and conduit for collaboration. In

interviews, employees describe pet-friendly workplaces as facilitating

## better communication and information-sharing and contributing to

coworker bonding and friendships. This seems to be the case because

pets increase employee interactions, reduce feelings of isolation, and

serve as the catalyst for fruitful conversations. Perhaps you can relate

if you’ve ever stopped by a colleague’s cubicle to pet a visiting dog and

found yourself in serendipitous chats. In one series of lab experiments,

psychologists found that participants working on decision-making tasks

in the company of a dog (versus a dog’s absence) rated their teams

as more friendly and attentive, which increased their subsequent

# cooperation and interpersonal trust.

Companion animals play an especially crucial role for employees

who have chronic health problems, disabilities, and mental health

challenges, providing them with nonjudgmental companionship,

opening up opportunities for social interaction, and enhancing their

sense of independence. As a side note, this is also (if not more so) true

for service animals, who, of course, fall into a legal class of their own. In

short, welcoming pets can make the oﬃce a more social and inclusive

place, key conditions to foster creative collaboration.

## The Challenges of an Inclusive Workplace Pet Policy

We hope to have given you some reason to be excited about welcoming

pets. Let us now be transparent about the challenges.

A documented minority of employees view pet-friendly workplaces

as unprofessional, unclean, or unsafe. Objections range from cultural

and religious traditions; past encounters and phobias; health, hygiene,

## or allergy concerns; or simply personal preference. Even employees

who like the idea will sour on a pet-friendly workplace when the

reality involves sharing their space with noisy, disruptive, or aggressive

animals. As one redditor wrote: “I used to work in a WeWork and

we’d have our workspace door open for ventilation — I lost count of

the amount of time someone’s dog from elsewhere on that ﬂoor came

bounding in and disrupted everyone. I mean I like dogs so I was amused

at a soppy old boxer begging for attention, but it’s just not appropriate in

# a workplace.”

## These concerns multiply in organizations where employees frequently

interact with outside stakeholders, such as business clients, contractors, and consumers. Oﬃce Labradors, coﬀee shop kitties, bodega cats, and

even barbershop roosters have all been praised for improving customer

mood, but we must be mindful that these outcomes may not generalize

# elsewhere.

While some people who aren’t comfortable with pets in the oﬃce

express their concerns freely, many may not. Conﬂicting inquiries for

conﬁdential advice from both those who favor and those who oppose

oﬃce pets have been posted to askamanager.com for years. One study

sought to understand what to do about this tension by analyzing ﬁve

organizations that had instituted dog-friendly policies within three

months to 20 years ago. They found that harmonious co-existence, as

well as acceptance by those who would prefer the oﬃce remain pet

free, is diﬃcult but possible when three criteria are met. Employees

must have suﬃcient job autonomy; for example, the agency to take

their dog out when it needs a break or to distance themselves from a

bothersome pet. There must also be a culture of open and respectful communication, so no one suﬀers in silence. Finally, employees must

all buy into a “trial-and-error mentality” and be willing to update any

agreements as needed.

## Practical Guidance as You Form Your Pet Policy

As organizations experiment with hybrid work arrangements or a

gradual return to the oﬃce, the time is ripe to implement a successful

pet policy. Let us highlight some important considerations:

## Understand the unique needs of your workplace and all stakeholders.

Be clear about when, where, and which animals are welcome, owner

responsibilities, and how to handle infractions. Extensive resources are

available for guidance. For instance, we now know that speciﬁc breed bans are ineﬀective and do not improve safety. Instead, it is best to

## implement behavioral-based guidelines (i.e., don’t ban Dobermans; ban

# disruptive dogs).

Consider local and legal requirements.

As one redditor joked, “no Burmese pythons in the lobby.” Review

liability for accidents, specify hygienic requirements of areas such as

cafeterias, and communicate all this to employees. Again, you don’t

have to go it alone. Insights are readily available from industries like

hospitality and air travel that have already made the jump to welcoming

certain companion animals. Hilton oﬀers ideas of what supplies to keep

on hand for accidents while the Department of Transportation has

addressed signage and safety questions. Exemplary guidelines can be

found in the Pets Work at Work toolkit.

# Start off small and pilot.

Limit pets to certain days of the week, or select spaces to respect the

needs of those with concerns, to ease the transition to the oﬃce. Be

ﬂexible and open to feedback from all involved. For managers with

limited bandwidth, employee resource groups dedicated to pets (e.g.,

the Doogler Group at Google, or even participants in a pets Slack channel), can be a great ally in this eﬀort.

Anticipate that other requests may come up.

Our emphasis has been on bringing pets into the oﬃce. Managers

should be aware, however, that this may open the door to other

pet-friendly considerations. Pet owners may lobby for hybrid work

arrangements and non-oﬃce days with pets that cannot come to the

oﬃce (something researchers already endorse for deep thought and

non-collaborative projects). Those with an injured, lost, or aging pet may request time oﬀ to care or grieve for their four-legged family

## member. Younger employees, who increasingly own pets but delay

having children, may lobby to expand beneﬁts (e.g., negotiating a group rate for pet insurance). All may oﬀer organizations a competitive edge

but come at a cost.

. . .

A diverse and increasing number of workplaces are considering

welcoming companion animals. The majority of employees, whether

pet owners or not, are on board and seem to beneﬁt from enhanced

workplace culture and quality of life. A minority, however, have

reasonable concerns. So, consider all the documented beneﬁts and
