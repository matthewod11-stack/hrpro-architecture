Investment has become global. That’s not news, of course, but the

extent of the phenomenon might surprise you: Foreign funds today hold

more than eight times more stock in listed companies than they did in

2000.

To reach this increasingly international group of investors and the analysts

who follow their markets, many companies are turning to live earnings

conference calls. The stakes are high: Earnings calls often prompt large

trading volumes and stock-price movements. As a result, managers often

receive extensive coaching on how to run them, but even with all of this

coaching, many don’t grasp the important cultural factors that affect how

their calls are received, assuming the numbers will speak for themselves.

But our work has shown that they don’t.

In two recent studies, we analyzed how managers discuss ﬁnancial news

## during earnings calls, especially during the unrehearsed Q&A portion, and

we discerned an important pattern: Even when the underlying news being

reported is a constant, markets often react differently depending on the

native language and cultural background of the person leading the call.

What matters in earnings calls, it turns out, is not just the what but also

# the how.

Language Barriers and Firm Value Globalization, ironically, demands standardization — and like it or not,

when it comes to communication in the world of business, English is now

the standard. Executives around the world have to use English when

communicating with their investors today, and an increasing number of

those executives are non-native speakers of English. How well they speak

the language has meaningful capital-market consequences.

We demonstrated this in one of our studies by reviewing the transcripts of

earnings calls conducted by more than 4,500 non-U.S. ﬁrms, all of which

hosted conference calls in English between 2002 and 2010. We didn’t

analyze the presentation portion of the calls, because it tends to be

scripted, and instead focused on the answers that managers gave

# spontaneously during the Q&A portion.

In evaluating how clearly managers communicated during these calls, we

paid attention to two measures.

The ﬁrst was linguistic complexity, which refers not to sophisticated

expression but rather to how often a speaker violates the principles of

plain English, as deﬁned by the SEC’s 1998 Plain English initiative. We

assumed speakers to be communicating clearly if they spoke in relatively

short sentences and used relatively short words; if they avoided the passive

voice, negative compounds, and superﬂuous phrasing; and if they used the

## personal pronouns we, us, our, you, your, and yours. When speakers

violated these principles frequently, we classiﬁed their language as

# complex.

The second measure we used was erroneous expressions, which refers to

how frequently speakers made grammatical errors, used the passive voice

incorrectly, and deployed articles abnormally. These three measures

represent errors typical of non-native speakers, as described in the

## linguistics literature. Speakers from countries with a greater language

distance from English tend to make more of these mistakes.

When we analyzed the data using a regression model, we found that the

## use of non-plain English and erroneous expressions, which together we

classiﬁed as linguistic opacity, had real consequences. Controlling for the

actual earnings news, we found that executives who spoke opaquely

suffered various capital market consequences, including lower trading

## volume, restricted price movement, and inconsistent analyst forecasts.

To assess the economic signiﬁcance of these effects, we benchmarked them

against the effects of issuing management earnings guidance, another

important disclosure event for ﬁrms. And what we found was remarkable:

If you lower your linguistic complexity by one standard deviation, you can

achieve a greater uptick in trading volume than you can by issuing

# management earnings guidance.

If this makes you think about hiring an interpreter, think again.

Interpreters rarely have the level of understanding about business

fundamentals that executives have, which means much of the information

in a call gets lost in translation. The data seems to bear this out: Calls that

used interpreters showed higher levels of linguistic complexity than those

that didn’t. This is probably why companies almost never use interpreters

# for their calls.

Cultural Barriers and Firm Value Firms today raise considerable capital from investors outside the domestic

## markets. Increasingly, as a result, managers and investors from different

cultural backgrounds now need to communicate effectively with one

# another.

In a study published in the most recent issue of the Accounting Review, we

examined to what extent the cultural background of managers affects how

well they communicate with investors. Drawing on research from cultural

psychology, we began by positing that executives whose ancestry is more

individualistic (primarily Anglo-Saxons) use more optimistic and self-

## referential language than those from a more collectivist background

(primarily Southeast Asians). To test our hypothesis, we studied more than

50,000 earnings-call transcripts, which contained detailed answers by

## almost 25,000 executives, mostly CEOs and CFOs, whose ethnicity we

could infer from their names, based on several widely used algorithms. We

then relied on the widely used work of Geert Hofstede to assign a cultural

# individualism score to each executive.

To measure optimism (or “tone”), which an extensive literature has found

to be robustly associated with accounting and stock performance, we

measured how often speakers used words that have positive and negative

connotations in a business context, and then we took the difference. To

measure self-reference, we used a simpler measure: We counted how

many times our speakers said “I.”

What we found conﬁrmed our main hypothesis. The more individualistic

the cultural background of the executives we studied, the more optimistic

their responses to analysts were, and the more frequent their use of the

word “I”. This held after we controlled for a battery of executive-, ﬁrm-,

industry-, country-, and conference call characteristics — most notably,

the underlying ﬁnancial numbers being discussed.

The range was dramatic. When an Anglo-Saxon executive and a Chinese

executive discussed the same ﬁnancial results, the difference in their tone

tended to be the same as the difference you might ﬁnd when two

executives from the same cultural background discuss two substantially

different results, one in the top 10% of the distribution and the other in the

bottom 10%. (This corresponds roughly to the tone those executives might

use when one is discussing performance that has beaten the consensus by

several cents per share, and the other is discussing performance that has

fallen short by the same amount.)

Some foreign executives are new to the art of earnings calls, so you might

be tempted to attribute their performance to nothing more than a lack of

preparedness. But you shouldn’t. Our ﬁndings on this front held, in

somewhat muted form, even when we only looked at U.S-based ﬁrms and

executives: U.S.-based executives with non-Anglo-Saxon roots still showed

signs of their cultural ancestry in the way they spoke but less so than if

they had not been exposed to the U.S. environment. We didn’t try to

determine at what point the executives or their ancestors immigrated to

the United States, but other studies show that cultural heritage persists

over time and difficult to shake off even after several generations.

Do investors see through these cultural differences? They generally do not.

If an Anglo-Saxon and a Southeast Asian CEO both report ﬁnancial results

that meet the consensus estimates on Wall Street, the former will elicit a

## more positive stock-price reaction than the latter, with the market

rewarding the optimism in the tone of the Anglo-Saxon manager. This

means that executives whose cultural inclination is to use fewer optimistic

words may not get full credit for their ﬁrm’s most recent performance.

The only exception was for investors who shared a cultural background

with the ﬁrm’s managers. These investors were better able to interpret the

nuances in cultural tone and adjust their response to the calls accordingly.

Having an investor base that understands your ﬁrm beyond mere

performance numbers is important.

Interestingly, we discovered similar differences between CEOs and CFOs

and between men and women. When we set ethnicity aside, we found that

CEOs and male managers used relatively more optimistic and self-

## referential language than CFOs and female managers.

As different as they are, both of the studies we’ve discussed in this article

make the same point: Earnings calls matter, and for different reasons than

most people assume. The news being reported in the calls is obviously

important — but so is the manner in which the calls are conducted,

especially during the Q&A period. Because the English language and

Anglo-Saxon cultural behaviors are now the norm in the global world of

business, executives conducting these calls need make sure that they

communicate their news clearly, optimistically, and self-referentially.
