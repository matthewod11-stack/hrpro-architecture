## Despite recent record employment gains for disabled employees in the

U.S., the hiring of disabled people continues to be a pain point for both

Disabled job candidates want to know where to work and whom to

trust, but they must also manage concerns about bias and when to

disclose the need for accommodations. They are advised to “control the

narrative” and build trust by sharing their stories and needs, but at the

same time to withhold any information that might be used against them

until employment is secured and ﬁrmer legal protections are in place.

Companies want to do better, but there is the steep challenge

of attracting candidates and convincing them that they truly are an

## equitable employer, from the owners of the smallest businesses on up.

Our research over the past ﬁve years has looked at both sides of this

equation and oﬀers some insights on how to move forward.

## Expressing Commitment to Disabled Employees

In recent years, there has been a trend to move away from basic boilerplate statements and legal aﬃrmations of fair treatment toward

## warmer, more personal language in job advertisements and websites

## about a company’s commitment to equity and inclusion.

For example, Microsoft states: “We strive to create an environment that

brings the power of diversity to life.” According to Meta: “Diversity isn’t

optional. To bring the world closer together, diversity is a must-have…

not an option.” Nike proclaims: “…we know the greatest ideas come

from a variety of lived experiences, which is why we are committed

to a workplace that is diverse, equitable, and accessible. Where our

teammates feel seen, heard, and included. Where they belong and can

become their very best selves.”

## Indeed, our own research conﬁrms that job candidates with disabilities

do respond more positively to “heartfelt” language, as opposed to the

traditional “legalese” type of statement. We tested two versions of

## the same job advertisement but with the inclusion of diﬀerent DEI

# statements:

- Standard boilerplate language: Galaxy Retail is an Equal

Opportunity/Aﬃrmative Action employer. All qualiﬁed applicants will

receive consideration for employment without regard to race, religion,

color, national origin, ancestry, age, physical or mental disability,

## sex, sexual orientation, gender identity/expression, pregnancy, veteran

status, marital status, creed, status with regard to public assistance,

genetic status, or any other status protected by federal, state, or local

# law.

- Heartfelt language: Galaxy Retail is an Equal Opportunity Employer

— By Choice. We believe we are best equipped to help our associates,

customers and the communities we serve live better when we really

know them. That means understanding, respecting and valuing

## diversity — unique styles, experiences, identities, ideas, and opinions

— while being inclusive of all people. Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion

(DEI) is more than a box to check or a target to hit. That’s why we’ve set

a goal to make Galaxy Retail the most diverse, equitable, and inclusive

workplace on the planet. We would like to discuss ways to provide the

accommodations that you may be entitled to.

We also tested whether the placement of these sentences mattered — at

the bottom of the job ad (which is common practice) or at the top.

Using a sample of 812 working-age disabled people from within the

U.S., we found that participants responded more positively to the

company when they had seen the heartfelt language, especially when

it was placed at the beginning of the job ad. However, in response to

open-ended questions about what they thought of the DEI statement,

participants also expressed a healthy dose of skepticism that these

companies had learned to “talk the talk” without guaranteeing genuine

follow-through. What, these respondents asked, actually happens once

you’re employed? If only, some participants lamented, they had shown

us actual disabled employees commenting on their workplace or even

statistics showing their accomplishments. As one participant noted,

## “Prove by your actions, not by your words.”

Our newest study aimed to answer precisely that question. What can a

company do, say, or show to be more convincing?

To explore this question, we created multiple versions of a

ﬁctitious company’s website. A standard version included high-level

commitments to “Embrace diversity, ignite unity” and “Cultivating a

culture where everyone belongs,” while other versions added some

# combination of the following:

- A personal statement from the CEO about the importance of disability

# inclusion in his life

- Testimonials about the workplace from two disabled employees

- Statistics on the hiring, promotion, accommodation fulﬁllment, and

retention of disabled employees, along with awards recognizing the

company’s accomplishments in the DEI space

Our results show that disabled people responded positively to the

websites that included more concrete details about the company’s

commitment and actions. It didn’t even seem to matter whether

the addition was a CEO’s message, employee testimonials, or the

presentation of awards and statistics. Each of these helped bolster

conﬁdence in the company and increased our participants’ willingness

to apply for a job there.

However, when it came to evaluating trust in the company, the

presentation of statistics and awards didn’t do the job by itself — it took

the addition of some kind of personal language from either the CEO or

current employees through testimonials to be convincing.

Including all of these elements together led to a signiﬁcant boost in how

prospective job candidates with disabilities rated the company: Roughly

65% rated it more highly, 63% thought it was more trustworthy, and 54%

showed greater intent to apply to a company like this, as compared to

the average rating given by participants who saw the more basic version

## of the website without these personal additions.

## Helping Job Candidates Feel Comfortable with Disclosure

Understandably, disabled job candidates feel disempowered to advocate

for their accommodation needs without fear of bias. In a study for which

we interviewed 43 college students and alumni, some reported that they

felt the need to ignore their disabilities by, in their words, “brute forcing

it” to appear nondisabled, to “play the game” and “walk the tightrope”

in order to get a foot in the door.

But what can level the playing ﬁeld so they don’t need to hide at

all, or for those who don’t have that option? Our studies show that

emphasizing their hard skills for the job (such as proﬁciencies with

speciﬁc technologies) during the interview process can help a disabled

candidate, as can delaying the conversation about accommodation

needs until after some rapport has been built.

In another study, we explored the potential eﬀect of the job candidate

using a personal assistive device (in this case, a mechanical exosuit that

assisted with lifting). Though the presence of the device increased trust

in the candidate, it did not, in the end, reduce risk or raise the odds

of employment, even when the candidate spoke about the device with

enthusiasm or provided a detailed backstory about their disability.

In our most recent study, we asked 636 managers to review the

application of a ﬁctitious candidate who similarly used the mechanical

exosuit. We created six diﬀerent versions of the candidate’s application:

- The standard condition contained a resume, cover letter, and pictures

# of the assistive device only.

- The other conditions added some combination of the following:

- A letter of recommendation (either with or without reassurance that

the device itself is helpful and not problematic)

- An oﬀer to work for a trial period to demonstrate skills and ability

- A video of the candidate using the assistive device

Of these, it seemed that either the letter of recommendation (with

or without the extra language addressing the disability and assistive

device) or the oﬀer to work a trial period seemed to reduce bias. Neither

the pictures nor the video was reassuring on their own, and stacking

multiple extras at once did not lead to further gains. External support

and personal dedication seemed to be keys to unlocking a greater

appreciation for the candidate’s true potential.

# Recommendations

Given the history of bias in this area, it takes more than lip service to

convince qualiﬁed disabled job applicants to engage with a company.

Improving the signaling in job ads and on websites is one place to start.

There are also additional opportunities for inviting candidates to make

the strongest possible impression and reduce bias earlier in the process.

The phrase “trust needs touch” applies here as well — the touch, in this

case, refers to something genuine that rings true to both employers and

job candidates. Employers need to understand what works to structure

# their recruiting eﬀorts around them.

In addition, the disability community’s mantra of “nothing about us,

without us” remains relevant in this context. Given this, alongside

## the recommendation by the Americans with Disabilities Act for

companies to engage in interactive processes with those requesting

accommodations, managers may want to signal openness to ongoing

discussions on what works best and why for each individual employee

# in need.

This is a collaboration. Considering the real risk of individual people

ﬁnding themselves on the wrong side of an employment decision,

change needs to be addressed at multiple levels. No one small

adjustment is going to resolve these concerns, but the tide is turning,

and companies are showing the will to improve. Understanding some

of the elements that make a diﬀerence for disabled job candidates is an

important place to start.
