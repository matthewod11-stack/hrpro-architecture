## As someone with more than 50 years of experience in both industry

and academia who also happens to be a person with autism, managers

in charge of DEI at major corporations often invite me to give lectures.

These companies range from steel, pharmaceuticals, computers, and

consumer products to cattle and livestock handling, transportation,

and social media. I always get asked the same basic question from

management: What do they need to do to make their workforce more

# inclusive?

## HBR / Digital Article / When Great Minds Don’t Think Alike

It’s a big step forward that corporations are striving to make their

## workforces more diverse with respect to race, gender equity, and

people with disabilities. Now it’s time to apply these same strategies

to diﬀerent kinds of minds. Doing so will increase creativity, ignite

problem solving, and lead to more cohesive workplaces.

## Different Kinds of Thinkers in the Workplace

First, leaders simply need to increase their awareness about the

diﬀerent types of thinking that exist and how we all beneﬁt from these

diﬀerent minds and the skills that go along with them. This may sound

basic, but in our verbally dominant culture, visual thinkers often get left

# behind.

I am an extreme visual thinker, meaning that all my thoughts resemble

## photorealistic pictures and short video clips, like those on TikTok. My

visual recall is a full vocabulary of images that come from memories

of places I’ve visited, movies and pictures I’ve seen, and printed text

I’ve translated into pictures. When I’m asked to assess a cattle-handling

system, for example, video clips of every system I’ve seen run through

my mind. I sort these images into categories, and I have the ability to

combine them into new things. With age and experience, my visual

“vocabulary” grows the way a verbal person learns complex ideas

# through words.

Visual thinkers like me process information diﬀerently; we use hands-

on problem solving and visual perception. I often point to a moment at

the beginning of my career when my visual orientation aided in solving

some behavioral issues in cattle. The animals had suddenly halted and

refused to move forward, causing work delays and compromising proﬁt

margins. Handlers hadn’t been able to ﬁgure out what was causing

the cattle’s behavior, and they were using extreme methods, such as

prodding and bullhorns, to keep the animals in line.

When I witnessed this phenomenon, I jumped into the chute to get

the cattle’s-eye view. The ranchers and suits alike thought I was being

ridiculous. But for me, as a visual thinker, it was the obvious thing to do.

I immediately picked up on the little things the handlers had missed.

## Shadows, reﬂections, even something as seemingly insigniﬁcant as a

piece of chain or a fabric cutting dangling inside the chute could slow

down the cattle’s movement. It was a simple ﬁx, but no one else saw

it. To me, these small obstructions were glaring. That’s how my mind

# works.

I am not the only kind of visual thinker. It turns out there is another

type, with its own unique perspective and skill set: spatial visualizers.

This distinction was identiﬁed by Maria Kozhevnikov and her team

of researchers at Harvard. People like me, who think in photorealistic

pictures, are known as object visualizers. We tend to be good at design,

## mechanical engineering, animal handling, and other hands-on jobs.

Spatial visualizers tend to think in patterns and abstraction, and are

often skilled in mathematics, computer programming, and music. We

have distinct approaches to problem solving: Object visualizers can see

how mechanical devices work, while spatial visualizers calculate how

they are supposed to work. I’ve made the analogy that object visualizers

make the trains, and spatial visualizers make them run. We need both

# kinds of thinkers.

## A good example of a successful collaboration between diﬀerent kinds of

minds is the partnership between Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak, who

famously developed the Apple computer. Jobs conceived of a computer

that was beautiful and simple to use, and Wozniak made it work.

According to his biographer Walter Isaacson, Jobs wanted a “seamless

user experience.” Wozniak, the techie, wanted lots of features, but Jobs

knew that too many features would make the computer more confusing

to use. This is an example of an artistic visual thinker working with a

more technically oriented partner to create a very successful product.

When diﬀerent kinds of thinkers get together and recognize the value of

their diﬀerent approaches, great progress can be made. Organizational

## psychologist Anita Williams Woolley and her colleagues at Harvard and

Stanford undertook a study in which they asked object visualizers and

spatial visualizers to navigate a Pac Man–style virtual maze. Some of the

teams were pairs of same-style thinkers, others were diﬀerent thinkers.

The research found that the teams of mixed thinkers outperformed the

homogenous teams. When the teams were mixed, the visual spatial

thinkers tended to work the joystick and the object visualizer zapped

the greebles. The homogenous groups tended to spend more time in

conversations that didn’t lead to results. (If you have been in one of

those endless company meetings where nothing gets resolved, this may

ring familiar.) It turns out that great minds that do not think alike are

more likely to yield towering innovations.

## How to Harness Different Kinds of Thinking

First, business leaders and policy makers need to encourage schools to

address the fact that visual thinkers who cannot sit still or cannot do

abstract math, such as algebra, are screened out of the U.S. educational

system. Thomas Edison was at the bottom of his class and described

as “addled” by a teacher. His mother took him out of the classroom

to be homeschooled. Today, Edison might have been diagnosed with

ADHD, as are nearly one in seven American boys who appear bored in

the classroom and get labeled “disruptive.” These kids need to be doing

# things.

We need to nurture and invest in students with hands-on classes,

## mentoring, internships, and apprenticeships in ﬁelds where visual skills

are essential. I learned to sew in home-economics classes, designing

patterns and sewing costumes for the school play. In shop class, I

learned to build things and made our sets for the school play. Those

foundational skills set the stage for my future.

Hiring practices also need to change. As a visual thinker who has

autism, I wasn’t going to succeed in a typical job interview where being

articulate and looking people in the eye was important. In order to get

jobs, I let my technical drawings and photos of completed projects in

my portfolio “talk” for me. I couldn’t sell a job by describing it, but I

impressed potential employers with what I came to call my “30-second

wow,” a visual presentation of my work. I learned to sell my work and

not myself. The same goes for educational credentials: For instance,

I couldn’t pass the mathematical requirements to pursue a career in veterinary work, but given my visual aﬃnity with animals and insight

into their behavior, I now train veterinarians.

The business and industrial worlds need all kinds of diverse minds.

There is an increasing number of examples where neurodiverse

employees have been the key to successful implementation. For

example, a company that was critical to the success of the latest

Mars rover is Illinois-based Forest City Gear, which worked with NASA

to create the tiny gears that turned the camera. Precise tolerances

were required to survive the harsh Martian conditions. To execute,

extraordinary attention to detail was needed. The perfect candidate for

the job could be a person with autism.

Today, we’re starting to see exciting new eﬀorts to create job

opportunities for all kinds of thinkers. For example, Dr. Ivan Rosenberg

started a unique program with the College of the Canyons in Santa

Clarita, California to train autistic students to run computerized metal

## machinery equipment in many diﬀerent factories. These students

would have the qualiﬁcations to work at Forest City Gear.

Highly specialized work calls for highly specialized minds. For these

programs to work, we need to understand that accommodations are not

special favors. All workers, visual and verbal alike, perform according to

# their strengths.

In conclusion, the business world needs all kinds of thinkers. When they

work in teams with complementary skills, they will be very eﬀective.

The ﬁrst step is that managers need to be aware that diﬀerent kinds of

thinking exist.
