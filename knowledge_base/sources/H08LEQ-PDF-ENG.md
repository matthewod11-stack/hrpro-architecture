Legendary computer science pioneer Douglas Engelbart is said to have

observed that “the digital revolution is far more signiﬁcant than the

invention of writing or even of printing.” Such revolutions occur when

a new technology transcends the limits of previous technologies, as

the printing press did the tedious copying of manuscripts by hand.

Digitization smashed through limits on the gathering, analysis, and

communication of vast amounts of information and resulted in greatly

## accelerated business processes, innovative business models, and the

globally wired world of the internet. Now the digital revolution is

being overtaken by the AI revolution. And this time the speed, scale,

and scope of industrial transformation will dwarf previous upheavals.

According to our economic analysis, advances in AI and the tech/IT

sector will create as much value in the next ﬁve years as it did during

the previous 10, signaling broad-scale transformations across other

# industries.

## 3 Areas Where AI Will Be Game-Changing for Business

Built on the foundation of IT and digitization, the AI revolution is

transcending limitations in at least three highly consequential areas

for business: 1) enabling continuous enterprise reinvention instead

of periodic transformation, 2) using real-time intelligence instead

of depending on episodically-updated software, and 3) synthesizing

multiple modes of data instead of being restricted to a single type

of input like text only or visual only. Today, leading companies are

leveraging these game-changing attributes of AI into strategies that

separate them from their competitors and, along the way, redeﬁne how

humans and machines work together.

# Continuous enterprise reinvention

## Due to rapid changes in consumer sentiment, geopolitics, and global

ﬁnance, the static nature of the digital era has come under intense

pressure. Companies no longer have the luxury of staged periodic

transformation dictated by the rhythm of software upgrades. They must

now adapt dynamically to conditions that can change almost overnight.

Consider how Netﬂix, despite signiﬁcant competition, stays ahead in

the streaming industry by leveraging AI to continuously reinvent its

business and deepen user engagement. For instance, AI algorithms

analyze user data, such as viewing history, preferences, and even the

time of day that users watch content. This allows Netﬂix to oﬀer highly

personalized recommendations, ensuring that each user’s experience is

unique and engaging. This AI-driven level of personalization has been

wildly successful, with up to 80% of content watched on Netﬂix coming

# from recommendations.

Even the thumbnail images for each title oﬀered on a Netﬂix viewer’s

screen are personalized: AI is used to create and select which thumbnail

images — drawn from the tens of thousands of still frames that

each movie comprises — would best engage which viewers. Further

personalization is achieved through adaptive bitrate streaming, using

AI to dynamically optimize the quality of streaming based on the

user’s internet speed and device capabilities. This approach minimizes

buﬀering, ensures the kind of smooth viewing experience that’s

essential for maintaining user satisfaction, and reduces customer

# churn.

AI also helps Netﬂix analyze viewership patterns and feedback to

identify the kinds of content and themes that are popular with

viewers. But using this AI-driven data to produce content that resonates

with Netﬂix’s diverse audience requires the experience and creativity

of humans, who must make the ultimate decisions about content

# investments and marketing strategies.

Over the 27 years of its existence, Netﬂix has reinvented itself a number

of times. In 1997, it began as a mail-order DVD rental service, added

a monthly subscription model two years later, went public in 2002,

introduced its streaming service in 2007, and by 2013 began producing

original content. Today, Netﬂix is a major player in the entertainment

industry and boasts more than 280 million subscribers around the

world. Not surprisingly, founder Reed Hastings titled his 2020 book

of Reinvention. But now those periodic reinventions, occurring every

few years, have given way to AI-enabled reinventions taking place over

## billions of data points and individual personalizations every second of

# every day.

# Real-time intelligence

Traditional intelligence systems operated on a delayed basis, whether

quarterly, monthly, or even daily. In contrast, AI is always on, listening,

learning, and adjusting instantly to new data. Companies can now

respond to shifting demands and evolving customer expectations with

unmatched precision and agility. The old model, built on instructions

from programmers, is simply no match for AI’s real-time, adaptive

intelligence focused on the individual needs of users.

Consider the innovative ways the video platform TikTok uses real-

time intelligence technology to induce users to spend an average of

34 hours per month on the app, outpacing all other social media

platforms. TikTok’s recommendation algorithm, known as the “For

You” page (FYP), uses real-time data to analyze user interactions, such

as likes, shares, comments, and viewing time. This allows TikTok to

continuously update and reﬁne the content it shows to each user,

ensuring a highly personalized and engaging experience. Meanwhile,

real-time AI systems, working with human moderators, monitor and

## ﬁlter content for compliance with community guidelines and local

cultures. AI also analyzes trending topics and hashtags in real time,

uncovering the most relevant and popular content for users and keeping

them engaged with the latest trends and viral challenges. In addition,

real-time data is leveraged to predict user behavior and preferences,

ensuring that users remain engaged and advertisers achieve better

targeting and ROI. For content creators, Tik Tok provides real-time

AI-powered tools, such as automated video editing, augmented reality

(AR) eﬀects, and music synchronization. These tools help creators

produce high-quality videos quickly and easily, fostering creativity and

# engagement.

TikTok’s use of real-time intelligence and AI represents a signiﬁcant

evolution in human-computer interaction. Unlike earlier technologies

that rely on static data, TikTok’s system continuously learns and

adapts to user preferences — in essence collaborating with users to

create dynamic and engaging experiences. Users also help drive the

training of the platform’s algorithm, which learns from user behavior

to reﬁne its recommendations. In the platform’s hybrid system of

content moderation, humans are empowered, not replaced, by AI tools,

producing results that neither machines nor people could achieve

alone. Similarly, the AI-powered tools that TikTok provides creators

marries machine intelligence and human creativity to enhance the

# overall content quality on the platform.

Synthesizing multiple types of data

The digital era focused on bits and bytes; the AI revolution is “multi-

modal.” That is, AI systems can now process information from diﬀering

modalities, including text, images, audio, video, and other sensory

input. Of course we humans have always been multi-modal, processing

and synthesizing all kinds of information in the real world we inhabit.

Now, with multi-modal AI, we have a technology that mimics our ability

to interpret and integrate a broad spectrum of information and that can

communicate and interact with us wherever we are, engaging with us in

a way that ﬁts our preferences, surroundings, and intentions. No longer

## the exclusive domain of sentient creatures, multi-modal intelligence

is being deployed by a number of leading companies across industry

# sectors.

In retail, major “bricks and clicks” companies leverage multi-modal AI

systems, including natural language processing (NLP) and robotics, in

innovative ways to enhance the customer experience and the company’s

operations. One company’s AI-powered customer support technology

not only understands and responds to customer queries in a natural,

conversational manner but also takes action, like ﬁnding orders and

managing returns. AI-driven self-checkout systems use computer vision

and machine learning to recognize items and streamline the process, reducing wait times and improving overall eﬃciency. The company

is also transforming human-machine collaboration. AI-powered smart

carts equipped with cameras and sensors scan shelves and monitor

inventory levels in real time, alerting staﬀ when items need to be

restocked. In the company’s warehouses, robots transport goods,

reducing the physical strain on human workers and working alongside them to increase eﬃciency. In its distribution centers, the company

is rolling out robotic forklifts, enabling human workers to shift from

manually unloading pallets to managing and coordinating the most eﬃcient way for the robots to unload trailers. Through these multi-

modal AI technologies and human-machine collaboration, the company enhances both the in-store experience for customers and the eﬃciency

# of its operations.

In the pharmaceutical sector, leading companies and research

organizations are employing multi-modal platforms to accelerate the

drive toward personalized medicine — treatment tailored to the

individual’s circumstances, symptoms, and genomics. For instance, a

major global drug company employs a cloud-based platform to unify

and scale analysis of clinical trial data, imaging, pathology, radiology,

## electronic health records (EHRs), wearables, and genomic data to

generate a precise view of the patient. EHR datasets are processed in

minutes, and image ﬁles that previously required days to process are

synthesized in hours. The technology supports the company’s 1,300

scientists around the world, who use data analytics tools to generate insights from the data, leading to more eﬃcient R&D, better design of

clinical trials, and improved matching of patients and therapies.

## In manufacturing, one of the world’s largest makers of everything

from home appliances to advanced technology uses multimodal

AI to monitor and enhance every aspect of the production

## process. Multimodal technology collects and analyzes such disparate

## information as audio signals, visual data, and sensor inputs from

production processes. Audio signals might include the sound a

component makes as it is installed. Sensors may report the weight and

temperature of parts made to very precise speciﬁcations. The amount of

data is enormous: at one plant, the equivalent of more than 40 million

sheets of paper per day. Self-optimizing algorithms synthesize the data,

enabling production personnel to monitor the health of equipment,

## perform predictive maintenance, and work toward zero-defects.

The emergence of multimodal AI — the capability to reason about how

the world works across diverse types of sensory inputs — is one of

the key breakthroughs bringing us ever closer to human-level artiﬁcial

general intelligence (AGI). Long thought to be many decades away, some

experts have recently argued that the timeline could be much shorter.

## Though still a controversial claim, the willingness on the part of some

leaders in the ﬁeld to assert it suggests how fast the AI revolution is

moving.

# The Future of Work With AI

As the AI revolution enables continuous enterprise reinvention, real-

time intelligence, and multimodal intelligence, employees must evolve

their roles alongside ever-improving AI systems. In an AI-driven

workplace, those who can learn and adapt continuously will thrive.

Flexibility, creativity, and strategic thinking will increasingly be prized.

With the right training and a dedication to lifelong learning, workers

can capitalize on this transformation, positioning themselves as

essential contributors in AI-enabled companies. This shift marks a new
