Stacey, the chief executive of a nonproﬁt focused on energy eﬃciency,

wanted to bolster her leadership team by creating a chief operating

oﬃcer position. Her ﬁrst two hires to ﬁll the role were unsuccessful:

Neither lasted a full year on the job. These were time-consuming and

# resource-intensive mistakes.

Determined to move forward, Stacey asked Jordan, her human

resources leader, to begin recruiting again for the chief operating

oﬃcer opening. However, she worried she wouldn’t trust the candidates

Jordan identiﬁed because he had recruited the two previous candidates

who had crashed and burned. How could she feel conﬁdent that things

would turn out better this time?

I had worked as an executive coach with Stacey for several years. When

she came to me with this problem, I immediately asked her how she was

rethinking her hiring process after the two failures.

Her answer: She wasn’t.

There’s an old saying that the deﬁnition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a diﬀerent result. What I’ve seen over

and over again with my clients is that most of us behave like Stacey

more often than we care to admit. In part, this behavior stems from

wanting to be eﬃcient, leaning on well-worn and largely unconscious

# mental pathways.

What I’ve also learned in my work researching and writing about

decision-making is that too often we don’t want to spend time

and mental energy revisiting the past, especially if it contains

uncomfortable missteps. But stopping and looking carefully at those

mistakes is exactly what can help us make better decisions moving

# forward.

Think of your past decisions as a dataset that you can mine for insights.

They can help you identify biases and assumptions that may be holding

you back, develop strategies to shift your behavior going forward, and

ultimately feel more conﬁdent that your process will lead to positive

# outcomes.

# HBR / Digital Article / How to Learn from Your Mistakes and Make Better Decisions

To apply lessons from your past decisions to your current situation, I

recommend asking the following questions:

- 1. What is the decision you’re facing now?

The ﬁrst step in a thoughtful decision process is to get clear on

the current problem that you want to solve. While this may sound

straightforward, I often ﬁnd that people skip this step which may lead

to an incomplete or unsatisfactory solution. At times people begin

problem solving from inside the problem and deﬁne it too narrowly,

or they even skip over the problem itself to a solution they’d like to

# achieve.

For example, Stacey initially deﬁned her problem in the following

way: “I want to create a new chief operating oﬃcer position and hire

someone who is well qualiﬁed for the role, who is a good ﬁt for our

organization and who will remain in the position for years to come.”

But this statement was more about her hopes and dreams. It didn’t get

at the problem she actually needed to tackle.

I guided Stacey to step back to look at the context of her decision. Stacey

was then able to identify that the real problem she needed to solve

related to the hiring process itself: “I want to make a decision about

how to move forward with the recruiting and hiring process for the new

chief operating oﬃcer position so that I can ﬁnd someone who is well

qualiﬁed for the role, a good ﬁt for our organization and who will remain

in the position for years to come.”

- 2. What is it about the current decision that is stressful for you, and what is your go-to approach for solving it?

This question helps you reduce uncertainty in two ways. First,

identifying what’s uncomfortable about the decision you face brings

the uncertainty forward so that you may explore it more fully as you

complete the reﬂection questions. This is useful because stress can aﬀect decision-making in negative ways as it puts demand on our

cognitive resources. That, in turn, may limit our ability to make novel

decisions and adapt to change, guiding the brain to resort to habitual

# decision-making.

Second, research suggests that stress may strengthen our existing

cognitive biases. Taking the time to identify particular stressors allows

us to confront mental short-cuts and unhelpful assumptions.

In Stacey’s case, she was worried that based on the two prior

unsuccessful hiring attempts that she wasn’t going to get qualiﬁed

candidates for her role if the organization cast a wide net. She was

convinced the best approach was to narrow the process and “only

interview candidates who have directly applicable qualiﬁcations and

had been in the role before.”

- 3. What are one or two previous decisions that you want to learn from? What didn’t go well? Why do you think it didn’t go well?

You cannot begin to change any of your behaviors – including decision-

making behaviors — until you confront them. These questions help you

look directly at past mistakes to articulate what went wrong.

Stacey chose to examine the two recent unsuccessful hiring decisions closely. “I learned diﬀerent things from each failure,” she said. In the

ﬁrst case, she had hired someone without relevant industry experience.

“I assumed the candidate would take the initiative to learn the industry

experience,” she said. “He did not do that.” The mistake with her second

hire was that the person “was not direct and communicated poorly.”

- 4. With 20/20 hindsight, what assumptions did you make that might have contributed to the outcome?

Answering this question gives you an opportunity to extract lessons

from your past decisions. Your answers may lead you to feel more

conﬁdent about some aspect of a decision you liked, and to make a change if you prefer to do something diﬀerently.

With her previous hires, Stacey thought that she was choosing the best candidates from the pool that was oﬀered. So, when the hiring decisions

didn’t work out, she blamed the broadness of the applicant pool.

But as she reviewed her previous decisions, she realized the pool wasn’t

the real problem. With the ﬁrst hire, Stacey acknowledged she didn’t ask

how the candidate would get up to speed on the industry. “I assumed

that if he was applying for the job, he’d do what it takes to learn the

industry. By assuming and not asking, I didn’t give myself a chance to

# properly vet him.”

When it came to the second hire Stacey realized that she had ignored

signs of poor communication. “When we emailed the candidate, she

ghosted us until we followed up three times,” she said. “When we ﬁnally

connected, she admitted that she didn’t think we were serious about

her. I dismissed the red ﬂags that the response raised, and again missed

a chance to properly vet the candidate.”

- 5. How might you apply your learning to the current decision you face?

This question allows you to turn what you learned into insight and

action for a better future. By analyzing and explaining problems in the

past, you are now better positioned to see actions, habits and patterns

that might otherwise be invisible in the present. This crucial perspective

can help you avoid making the same mistakes again in the future.

Upon reﬂection, Stacey saw that the broadness of the applicant

pool wasn’t her real problem. Responsibility also lay with how she

interviewed and assessed candidates — actions she had a lot more

control and inﬂuence over. “The past-decision review showed me that

my actions contributed to the poor outcome,” she reﬂected. “It was

within my power to conduct more in-depth interviews and make better

# reference checks.”

- 6. What is your solution now?

As you answer this question, you should see your growth in decision-

making. You’ve inspected and evaluated your thoughts, feelings, and

behavior, enabling you to make observations about your past that

provide clarity and insight to move forward in a new direction.

As she geared up for another hiring process, Stacey decided not to

narrow her applicant pool to only candidates who had held the same

position previously. She wanted to cast a wide net.

Instead, she made two changes to her vetting process. “First, I plan

to ask candidates for detailed speciﬁcs about how they will get up to

speed for the role they’re interviewing for so that I’ll have a better

sense of their understanding of the position, their skill set, and their

commitment to succeeding in the role,” she said. “Second, I will more

## thoroughly check references for candidates’ strengths, limitations, and

ﬁt for our organization.”

. . .

I’ve written extensively about how strategic stops can enable us to

mine the data of our past to help us to move forward with decisions more mindfully and eﬀectively. This set of questions can give you an

actionable plan for making decisions with greater conﬁdence.

Stacey was so surprised at how quickly she gained insight into her

decision-making that she shared the questions and her responses with

her HR colleague Jordan, who made adjustments to the interview

process. Top candidates are now asked to write out speciﬁcs about how

they will fulﬁll their new role and responsibilities, and all references are

checked fully. The result is that Stacey’s most recent hire – who had

never held the COO role before — recently celebrated her successful

## one-year anniversary at the organization.

We all have scores of decisions to make every day, and we often want

to move quickly, telling ourselves that speed equals eﬃciency. But

true eﬃciency sometimes requires slowing down, being mindful, and

especially looking back at the decisions we’ve made that didn’t go as

we’d hoped.

A mistake is only a mistake if we don’t learn from it. When we

take the time to learn from past decisions, those past regrets and

disappointments become stepping stones to a better future.
