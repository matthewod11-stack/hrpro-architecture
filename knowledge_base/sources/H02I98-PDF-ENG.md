Need a Good Parental Leave Policy? Here It Is. Four ways to make everyone happier. by Joan C. Williams and Kate Massinger

With parental leave policies in ﬂux, and not a lot of federal guidelines

in the United States about what to oﬀer, executives are often left on their

own to design the right policies for their companies. Here’s a brief guide,

to designing a leave that will both retain your talented employees and

reduce the potential for legal liability.

First, ﬁgure out the maximum amount of time your company can aﬀord

to oﬀer. Then, oﬀer that time to both men and women. Early, often,

and consistently give the message that you expect everyone to take the

leave. At Facebook, for instance, employees scold their peers for taking

only two months oﬀ instead of the full four. It’s all about culture.

But that’s only the beginning. Here are four elements of best practice.

- 1. Use the three-meeting model for oﬀ-ramping.

Too often, poor planning derails leave-takers. Colleagues may feel that

extra work is being forced on them unexpectedly. Leave-takers may

have a tough time getting assignments again after they return. Both

scenarios are easily avoided with a three-meeting protocol.

The ﬁrst meeting occurs shortly after the announcement is made. The

employee’s supervisor celebrates and reassures: “Congratulations! It’s

an exciting time, and you need not hesitate to take your full leave. We will

develop a transition plan together.”

With biological children, there are months ahead to talk. If your leave-

taker is an adoptive parent whose child could arrive at home with less

notice, the next two meetings will be on an accelerated schedule.

The second meeting typically occurs three months before the leave is

scheduled to begin. “Come with a list of all the projects you are working

on and who you think might be suitable to transition them to when you go

on leave. If no one comes to mind, don’t worry. We can ﬁgure someone out

or hire extra help. Your list will only be a beginning.” After this meeting,

the supervisor should develop a transition plan, talking with the people

who will be picking up the leave-taker’s work or hiring temporary help if

need be.

The third meeting occurs as the due or adoption date approaches. In it,

ﬁnal tweaks are made to the plan; afterwards, transitions begin. At this

time, the supervisor should ask for the leave-takers’ current thoughts

about post-leave. Is he or she thinking about returning on a part-time or

ﬂex schedule? (It’s important for legal reasons that the same question be

asked of everyone, male or female.) This doesn’t need to be a binding

decision—it’s just a chance for a supervisor to get an initial heads up.

- 2. Have a protocol for on-ramping.

In FMLA-bound companies (which is all large ones), employers can’t

require an employee on FMLA leave to work during his or her three

months of protected leave. So it’s safest to wait until an employee

returns to work to develop a plan for on-ramping. During the leave,

the supervisor or HR should be in touch so the company knows when

the leave-taker plans on returning to work. This will enable the leave-

taker’s supervisor to develop an on-ramping plan. On the ﬁrst day after

the leave-taker returns, his or her supervisor should hold a meeting to

discuss the plan, which should include check-ins during the ramp-up

period to ensure that the returning employee is getting enough work,

# and appropriate work.

This is important: women returning from parental leave persistently report diﬃculties getting enough work, or enough good work.

Colleagues’ reluctance to give them work may be benevolent (“With the

baby, I knew it wasn’t a good time for her”) or hostile (“I need someone

whose ﬁrst priority is work, not home.”) This is gender stereotyping, and

represents a legal risk if left unchecked.

- 3. Design a gradual return-to-work.

While some mothers get too little work when they return from

leave, others get too much. Setting a still-nursing mother against an

insurmountable wall of work is a sure path to attrition. Best practice

is a gradual return-to-work policy: for example, providing all returning

leave-takers with a 50% schedule that gradually builds back to full time

(deﬁned by their target schedule.) Absent a formal policy, companies

typically ﬁnd that some departments have little trouble with returning

leave-takers while others with less supportive supervisors face high

attrition. The gradual return-to-work policy means that inﬂexible

supervisors do less damage.

- 4. Designate leave liaisons.

Here’s a cheap, but eﬀective solution: a volunteer program that assigns

leave-takers, both men and women, to mentors. These mentors act as

leave liaisons, answering questions about oﬀ- and on-ramping and,

more generally, the transition to parenthood. McCauley Tetrault is

one ﬁrm with such a mentorship program. They bolster it with six

external coaching sessions for new parents and paid travel expenses

for a care assistant so that nursing mothers can bring their infants on

# work-related travel.

Again, it’s all about culture: it never hurts to arm leave liaisons with

cute company logo infant onesies. Little things can do a lot to signal

# acceptance.

To make this best-practice package work, companies need to address a

gut-level concern. Why encourage parental leave when—let’s be frank—

it’s a damn nuisance when people take it?

Parental leave is inconvenient. So are heart attacks. It would be far more

convenient if employees had neither babies nor bodies.

But the bigger nuisance is losing valuable team members, over and over

again, due to outdated policies. Hiring’s a crapshoot; anyone who has

done a lot of it knows that. Leaves, while inconvenient, are far better

# than the alternative.

Why do we see dealing with heart attacks as an inevitable cost of hiring

a workforce, whereas family leave seems an optional, avoidable cost?

It’s because we still, secretly, believe that the ideal worker is someone

who is always available for work—not a mother or, for that matter, a
