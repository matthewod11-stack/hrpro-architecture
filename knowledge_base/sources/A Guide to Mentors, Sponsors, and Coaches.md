A post shared by HBR Ascend (@hbrascend)When you’re just getting started in your career, it can be helpful toform a personal “board of directors” to guide you. Your differentmentors will likely have different insights that can help you inyour career journey. Alexis Redding in her article “

How to Find a

Mentor at Your Company” highlight three types of mentors youshould be on the lookout for:1. Guiding lights: Picture a senior leader (perhaps a departmenthead, or your boss’ boss). These mentors — while they may notknow you especially well on a personal level — have a depth oflong-term industry experience that can help you with big-picture career planning.2. Window mentors: These types of mentors are colleagues whohave already navigated the terrain in your company orindustry. They’re often mid-level professionals (perhaps yourboss or a friendly more senior colleague) who can help showyou the range of options where your strengths will shine andwhere you can have the most impact.3. Mirror mentors: These are peers (or even supportive juniorcolleagues) who know you well and can help you identify yourstrengths and weaknesses. They can help you answerfundamental questions like: What am I looking for in a career?

Research shows that 71% of executives choose to mentoremployees who are of their same gender or race. One way toaddress this disparity is for companies to prioritize “bridgementorships,” or mentorships that intentionally connect diverseindividuals to help level the playing field and provide more equalopportunities.Unfortunately, bridge mentoring is still relatively uncommon atmost companies. While it’s ultimately on organizations andleadership teams to implement more bridge mentoring programs,

author Christopher “CJ” Grossthere has some advice on how youcan connect with bridge mentors and get the support you need:

You can join employee resource groups (ERGs) within yourorganization to meet potential mentors and allies in seniorpositions who understand or have been educated on yourunique challenges.

You can attend industry events in your ﬁeld, or those aimed atcultivating connections within your particular communities.This may help you gain access to diverse leaders who have risenthrough the ranks and are familiar with your culturalbackground.

You can explore online platforms that focus on matchingmarginalized individuals with mentors, such as

Mentoring Her,

# Woman to Woman Mentoring, and

# Muse Mentorship.

You can participate in cross-functional projects within yourorganization and introduce yourself to leaders in otherdepartments. Cross-collaborating is a great way to meet senioremployees who may be good mentorship candidates.

A post shared by HBR Ascend (@hbrascend)You have valuable knowledge too — insights that when sharedwith senior colleagues can have a positive impact on yourorganization. This is called reverse mentoring, and while it canhelp you (and your company) advance, it’s not always easy. RikNemanick highlights the pros and cons of reverse mentorship inhis article “

Are You Ready to Mentor a More Senior Colleague?”Cons: Let’s talk through the negatives first. Being a reversementor can feel intimidating, especially if you’re new to theworkplace. Most junior employees aren’t accustomed to being in aposition to teach their senior colleagues, which can make theexperience somewhat uncomfortable for those involved. For thisreason, you may hesitate to take on the role of a junior mentor,feeling it isn’t your place to instruct someone more experiencedthan you.Pros: But there are also a lot of positives to reverse mentorship.What you’ll gain from the experience is usually worth the initialdiscomfort. The relationship you form through your reverse

mentorship can also lead to opportunities for a more traditionalmentoring relationship. By being open to mentoring seniorleaders, you’ll have the opportunity to build connections andlearn about company politics, career options, leadership, strategicthinking, and more.So how can you get started as a reverse mentor? Often, seniorcolleagues will ask for your mentorship directly. But don’t beafraid to raise your hand to share insights on a topic you’repassionate or knowledgeable about. And always remember tostart any mentorship relationship with questions. Before sharingyour knowledge, you should always spend time exploring whatyour mentee already knows and what they want to learn.

A post shared by HBR Ascend (@hbrascend)Mentors are great — but you need more than a few mentors togrow in your career. You need a sponsor. While a mentor typicallygives you advice or feedback and coaches you on specific skillsets, a sponsor goes a step further. They go out of their way to helpyou gain visibility and land opportunities that can advance yourcareer.The idea of finding a sponsor may seem overwhelming, but don’toverthink it. Jovina Ang, in her article “

# Turn Your Boss Into a

Sponsor,” suggests starting with a senior leader who knows yourwork and track record better than anyone — your boss. Here’show to turn your boss into a sponsor:1. Build credibility. Perform your tasks well and take on projectsand responsibilities that increase your visibility in theorganization. Take the time to understand what theorganization’s larger goals are and how they align with yourown interests and aspirations.2. Understand your boss’ priorities. Asking your managerwhat’s important to them can give you clarity on what youneed to focus on and where the opportunities lie for you withinthe organization.3. Make the ask.
