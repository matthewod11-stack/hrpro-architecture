Stepping into a chief executive role is exhilarating. At the same time,

the reality of leading an organization hits diﬀerently when you’re

actually in the seat. Employees, clients, board members and the media

all want to know: Who are you as a leader? What’s going to change?

What’s your strategy? Where are you taking the organization? The

temptation to act quickly is real.

# HBR / Digital Article / What New CEOs Should Ask Themselves in Their First 100 Days

In the face of those expectations, it’s important to remember that the

ﬁrst 100 days aren’t about having all the answers—they’re about setting

the foundation for long-term success. And while there may be urgent

decisions to make, you want to use this time to ask the right questions

and get clear on where you want to go and how you’ll get there.

From our experience working with hundreds of CEOs, we’ve seen four

themes emerge as top priorities for the ﬁrst 100 days. And we’ve

identiﬁed 17 critical questions new leaders should ask themselves as

they navigate each priority. This list is just the beginning. The real work

is in owning the questions—and your answers.

# Building a Leadership Team

Successful CEOs we’ve worked with don’t follow the usual playbook

when it comes to building their team. They look beyond familiar

names and past relationships to identify who they need for what’s

ahead. They’re looking for candidates with strong track records—not

## just sales numbers or project deliveries, but those with true leadership

# capabilities and traits.

They also make a deliberate choice to bring in a mix of perspectives,

including both fresh voices bringing new ideas and experienced leaders

who know the ropes. And while they are fair in assessing the leadership

team they inherit, they are focused on moving deliberately and making

the tough choices for who will drive the company forward. The result? A

leadership team built with intention.

As you’re building your leadership team, ask yourself:

- Who will drive change from the trenches—coaching, empowering, and

elevating their teams, as opposed to just managing the business and

tracking metrics?

- Is my team inclusive of leaders who have diﬀerent viewpoints?

- Do I have leaders on my team who will challenge old ways of thinking

and drive towards where the business is headed?

- What signals am I sending to the organization and clients with my

# leadership choices?

# Engaging Stakeholders

Real trust and alignment doesn’t happen by accident—it needs to be

intentionally built. A key task for new CEOs is to build relationships

with stakeholders including your employees, customers, shareholders,

# board members, analysts, and community.

Leading CEOs often start with a few critical priorities and form working

groups of inﬂuential voices—those culture carriers who can shape

opinions, rally teams, build trust, and ease concerns during change. By

engaging the right voices early, the best CEOs foster alignment and real

input, building momentum from within rather than relying solely on

# top-down direction.

As you’re building relationships with stakeholders, ask yourself:

- Who are the most important stakeholders based on where the

organization is going, not where it’s been?

- Do your stakeholders have a clear understanding of what the

organization’s priorities are?

- Who are the culture carriers in this organization? Are their voices

involved early enough to build alignment, not just communicate

# decisions?

- How are we measuring whether trust in leadership is growing or

# fading?

# Building Your Vision

New CEOs invariably will be asked dozens of times: What’s your

new strategy? In the ﬁrst few months, employees don’t expect a

new CEO to have all the details ﬁgured out, but they do want

clarity on direction. We’ve found that the most successful CEOs

articulate the big strategic questions the organization must address,

while simultaneously launching focused actions—for example, shifting

delivery to be more AI-driven, expanding into certain markets, or

creating enough room in the P&L to invest in growth. They use these

early, no regret, moves to signal where the organization is heading, even

as the vision and related strategic actions are still being developed.

These leaders also recognize that their teams want clarity of purpose—

why does the organization exist, and how, you, as a leader will create a

vision that will help to address these fundamental questions. As you’re

preparing to introduce your vision, ask yourself:

- What actions can we take now that will drive immediate impact for

where the organization is headed?

- Is the organization currently clear about how it creates value and the

big strategic questions that must be addressed?

- Who has the insight and foresight to shape the vision—and how fast

should we move to stay ahead?

- How are priorities being balanced to deliver results today while driving

# future growth?

# Staying Focused

New CEOs often ﬁnd themselves pulled in multiple directions, reacting

to problems instead of driving their own agenda. It’s easy to lose sight

of what matters most. Staying on course requires making time for your

own work and developing the conﬁdence and respect to help keep the

organization moving forward. To stay grounded and in control, CEOs

# should:

- Choose a few trusted advisors who speak openly and help them stay on

# course.

- Track and balance how much of their time is spent leading vs.

responding. Block time for strategy and focused work to avoid getting

lost in constant meetings and requests.

- Regularly check in on the vision to make sure priorities remain aligned

—and make adjustments quickly when they are not.

- Consider other feedback loops to tap regularly for clear insights; for

## example, luminaries, geopolitical consultants, customers, or employee

listening sessions. Successful CEOs ﬁnd a way to be genuinely open to

feedback and self-reﬂection, conﬁrming they’re addressing the most

# important questions.

One mechanism to conﬁrm they’re hearing direct feedback is establishing a tight-knit executive oﬃce—a group of fewer than ﬁve

## to 10 trusted team members outside the formal leadership team who

have the respect, inﬂuence, and ability to make things happen. Most

importantly, this group is willing to say it like it is to the CEO. A mix

of strategic thinkers and tactical operators, they work to clear obstacles,

keep things moving, engage with the leadership team to surface issues

early and keep momentum strong, all while conﬁrming alignment with

# the CEO’s vision.

To conﬁrm you’re staying focused, ask yourself:

- In which areas can you truly move the business? (As opposed to letting

what’s most visible or urgent capture your attention.)

- How will you plan to listen broadly enough to see the full picture—and

how will you act boldly to shape it?

- How are you managing your time between reacting and leading—and

what needs to shift?

- What are you concerned you might be missing—and who will you trust

to tell you the truth?

. . .

When you step into the CEO role, the pressure to have all the answers

is real. But no one expects you to solve everything overnight. What they

do expect is leadership that tackles the most important questions facing

the business and clear communication about what you’re focused on,

what you’re learning, and where challenges lie.

Taking the time to ask the right questions during your ﬁrst 100 days

can help you build a stronger foundation of trust, alignment, and

excitement to build on when it comes time to execute.

And as you reﬂect, one ﬁnal question is worth asking: Are you showing

up the way you intended—and would your team say the same?
