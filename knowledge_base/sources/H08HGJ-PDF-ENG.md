For some time, scale and scaling — meaning that a business grows to

ever-greater size — have been the holy grail of the startup and corporate

world. Implicitly many believe that if something doesn’t scale, then

it’s a failure. Bigger means better, and not-bigger means failure. For

example, we know one entrepreneur who created a popular social

network, but because it did not scale to become one of the major social

networks, for some time he saw his business as a failure even though

it throws oﬀ millions in revenue and brings together communities

who all enjoy the same game. Likewise, we have written about the

experimentation process that led to Rent the Runway, but because this

business has inherent limits to scale tied to renting physical assets,

some have pushed back on the example because “it didn’t really scale.”

While we all understand the motivation for these questions, somehow,

these critiques also feel slightly misplaced. But can we say it out

loud? Can we say why getting bigger does not always equal success?

Others have done so, including famed economist E.F. Schumacher in

his book, Small Is Beautiful. There is a ﬂaw at the heart of the concept

of scaling, though it can be hard to articulate in the face of “bigger is

better.” Looking back to the roots of “scale” can help us pinpoint what

conventional wisdom might be missing.

# How We Think About Scale

Many of our ideas about scaling rest on foundational economic ideas

eloquently espoused by Adam Smith in The Wealth of Nations, such as

the division of labor and specialization. Smith opens this canonical text

with a description of a pin factory in France, where he argues that the division of labor has enabled unprecedented eﬃciency and increased

production with scale. In Smith’s example, one worker pulls a wire to

create the body of the pin, another worker hammers out the head, and

so forth, using division of labor to produce many times more pins than

one worker could produce alone. The beneﬁts of the approach are self-

## evident in the example, and the bigger the factory the better.

But there is a twist to the story — and thus to the foundational economic

thinking it makes up — that has important implications: Adam Smith

never actually visited the pin factory on which he builds his argument.

In fact, Smith only saw an illustration in Denis Diderot’s Encyclopedie.

But Diderot also never visited the factory. The essay in Encyclopedie was

written by M. Delaire, a philosopher who also did not visit the factory,

but rather wrote the article based on an illustration! In essence, one

of our most foundational economic principles is based on fourth-hand

# knowledge, at best.

Given this fact, it’s hard not to wonder whether Adam Smith might have

missed something. To ﬁnd out, my coauthor Susannah Furr, Oxford

economist Sir John Kay, and I decided to visit the last pin factory that

## exists in France — several centuries later, with about the same number

of employees as the one about which Smith ambiguously claimed “I

have seen a small manufactory of this kind where ten men only were

employed.”

# Rethinking Scale

## The ancient building sits at a low point between two hills, where

the river could turn early manufacturing machines, which were later

powered by electricity and then themselves replaced by machines with

ever-greater automation. Today there are a few workers in the factory,

most of them skilled workers maintaining the machinery or performing

the many tasks that machines cannot do. What struck us most when

looking at the factory is what Smith — and those of us raised on his

doctrines and the endless beneﬁts of scale — are the lessons we may

have missed about the division of labor.

## First, modern work thrives on boundary-crossing and integrative

thinking that create beneﬁts far beyond those ascribed to simple

## conceptualizations of division of labor and specialization. In other

words, the machines that populate the factory today were developed to

manufacture pins but draw on knowledge from diverse areas, including

mechanical engineering, manufacturing operations, heat dynamics,

vacuum handling, and dozens of other domains, all of which had

to be recombined to create the modern pin factory. Moreover, the

most valuable workers in the factory today have broad knowledge

## of electronics, automation, materials, and other knowledge areas to

maintain the machines. Work that is segmented and specialized like

that described in the pin factory has been or will be automated by

machines or AI. Work that is robust against replacement by automation

like AI is diﬀerentiated, cross-functional, and integrative.

Second, because Smith never visited the factory, he never thought

through the tradeoﬀs involved when we mechanize people through

specialization. Smith’s contemporary, Adam Ferguson, did worry about

what happens when we down-skill people and treat them like machines.

In his essay, “The History of Civil Society,” he wrote about the

downsides: “many parts in the practice of every art, and in the detail

of every department, require no abilities, or actually tend to contract

and to limit the views of the mind.” Not only do these people lose

the very thing that diﬀerentiates them from machines — creativity,

integrative thinking, etc. — but they make themselves more vulnerable

to replacement, and more dissatisﬁed. In the opening of Studs Terkel’s

respected ethnography Working, Terkel states, “This book, being about

work, is, by its very nature, about violence — to the spirit as well as to

the body.” I had a ﬂashback to a recent taxi ride in San Francisco. As

we passed a Waymo self-driving taxi, the driver mumbled, “Well, there’s

my replacement.” What happens when a generation of people who have

down-skilled to become drivers are replaced?

Third, although scale undoubtedly produces beneﬁts in some

circumstances, when do we need to look beyond scale to other metrics

of success? Critics of scaling have pointed out that exaggerated returns

to scale are often used to bulldoze other valuable outcomes like well-

being. As Sir John has pointed out elsewhere about Adam Smith,

“There is little evidence that bigger plants produced marked increases

in productivity. [Smith’s claims] would not be the last time in which

## the human diseconomies of scale oﬀset the exaggerated technical

# economies of scale.”

What are these human diseconomies? As an example, scaling farming has proven eﬃcient, but an increasing number of voices — including

those in big agriculture — are warning that it is devastating our long-

term health and the future of the planet. Today you need to eat between

eight and 21 oranges to get the nutrients your grandparents received in

a single orange because soil has been stripped by fertilizer, pesticide,

and monocrops of the microbiological community that creates ﬂavor

and nutrition. Anyone who has tasted mass-produced strawberries

and tomatoes knows ﬁrsthand that they often taste like bags of water

compared to their more delicate, ﬂavorful cousins raised in good soil. In the pursuit of scale, we have created eﬃcient food that can be shipped

long distances but is not delicious. How can we bring these measures

into the conversation — not just in food, but across all of business?

# Alternatives to Scaling

We recently worked with Blue Hill at Stone Barns, one of the world’s

top restaurants, to understand how they are trying to rearchitect the

food industry to support life and nutrition in the long run. Their biggest

challenge in getting attention in the business world for an approach as

audacious as Space X or Tesla? Critics who immediately dismiss it with

the question, “Does it scale?” Ironically, one of the challenges Blue Hill

faces is to reinvent the food industry to be smaller, rather than bigger.

In an ecological community, a system that integrates multiple types of

crops, animals, and systems works better with nature and provides more

nutrients and long-term viability. So what are the alternatives to our

traditional view of scaling? Here is what leaders may want to consider as

they think about their reasons for taking a given path.

# Scaling a Model, Not a Company

As we have helped Blue Hill wrestle with how to address themselves to

a business community that struggles to understand alternatives to one

company getting bigger, we’ve asked: Can a “model” scale rather than a

single company? In other words, if one develops an idea, or a business

model, that inﬂuences and changes the world for the better, could

that not be as good, or sometimes even better, than a single company

scaling to do so? For example, the team at Blue Hill wants to spread

new economic models for small farms that are ecologically sound, and

are doing this by developing new sources of economic value for small

farmers, such as new cuts of steak that increase the value of grass-fed

cows, new products like their grain sausage that stretches the use of

the animal increasing its value, new processes such as ﬁnishing retired

## dairy cows for use as high-value beef rather than for low-value ground

beef, and encouraging the consumption of soil supporting rotational

# grains like buckwheat.

As they do so, they are not only scaling a model by sharing and

dispersing their knowledge — they are laying the foundations of

communities that work. Small farms are not only ecologically sound,

they also create stronger communities and greater well-being. To date,

Blue Hill is ﬁnding increasing success — for example, with the spread

of a new generation of vegetables bred for ﬂavor that support small

farms, encourage crop rotation, and incentivize healthier eating, now

being sold at Whole Foods. In this sense, Blue Hill thinks about an idea

spreading, rather than scaling in the traditional sense.

# Scaling Impact, Rather than a Company

Likewise, we visited the factory of Huit Denim revitalized by

entrepreneur David Hieatt. After a successful career in advertising

and creating clothing brands, Hieatt moved to the west coast of

Wales, which he discovered had once been the jeans manufacturing

headquarters of the UK. However, the industry had collapsed as work

ﬂed overseas to low-cost locations. Hieatt launched the Do Lectures,

an inspirational conference for entrepreneurs, and then Huit Denim,

producing high-quality “jeans for life” in a bid to bring employment

# back to the region.

As their success has grown, many have pushed Hieatt to expand

into other product lines. But at a recent conference for “Makers and

Mavericks,” Hieatt challenged the assembled group: Can a company

scale in other ways than size? For example, in impact? Since this

time, Huit Denim has become an advocate for treating employees well,

dealing with microplastics, and manufacturing sustainably.

## Scaling Humanity, Instead of Scaling Companies

Although leaders often feel pressure to grow, is that always the right

path for its employees, and their communities? Some time ago, the

famous evolutionary biologist Stewart Kauﬀman attended a major

conference for strategy scholars. He challenged the assembled crowd:

“When will you start asking how GDP can serve humanity rather than

humanity serving GDP?”

Kauﬀman’s question haunts us to this day, because he touched on the

other dimensions that could be considered in our deﬁnitions of scale.

What is best for our happiness, for our community, for ecology? What

could that world look like? What would it look like if we got it right?

As economist R. H. Tawney once wrote, “The existing economic order

and too many of the projects advanced for reconstructing it break down

## through their neglect of the truism that, since even quite common men

have souls, no increase in material wealth will compensate them for

arrangements which insult their self-respect and impair their freedom.”

. . .

If we could broaden the lens of what we consider success and scale, we

might be able to create more space for a healthier, happier economy.

Sometimes we think that because something happens on its own —

Adam Smith’s famous invisible hand — that makes it good. But cancer

gets bigger on its own. There are places where scale makes sense, but

places where it does not. Perhaps one day we could celebrate a company

like Huit Denim changing the conversation or an organization like Blue
