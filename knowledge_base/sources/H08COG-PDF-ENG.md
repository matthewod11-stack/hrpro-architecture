Picture yourself in a meeting where a new idea has just been

pitched, representing a major departure from your company’s standard

practices. The presenter is conﬁdent about moving forward, but their

voice is quickly overtaken by a cacophony of opinions from ﬁrm

opposition to enthusiastic support. How can you make sense of the

noise? What weight do you give each of these opinions? And what does

this disagreement say about the idea?

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: How to Build Consensus Around a New Idea

In a recent paper, published in Nature Human Behavior, we explored

why people disagree about an idea’s value. Through a mix of

experimental and archival studies, we found that the more novel an

idea, the more people disagreed about its worth.

We also found that people often interpret disagreement itself as a

sign of risk, lowering their belief in an idea’s value, and making them

less likely to support it. The bad news is this newness-disagreement

link forms a barrier to innovation by making more creative ideas

seem less appealing. But understanding why this problem occurs

creates opportunities to address it. We evaluate our ﬁndings to propose

research-backed strategies to help your team build consensus when

evaluating new ideas.

## How Criteria Can Affect Perceptions of Value

Previous research has described creativity as “novelty that is useful,”

where novelty is deﬁned as the distance of departure from existing

oﬀerings or practices. The newer the idea, the harder it is to compare

to what already exists. In other words, the newer an idea, the less likely

there will be a common reference point or criteria by which to evaluate

# it.

Lacking a clear evaluative template or criteria, each person will be

forced to create their own, idiosyncratic version, considering diﬀerent

stakes or potential rewards. This can result in diﬀerent conclusions

about the worth of the same idea. We proposed that the more novel an

idea, the greater the number of diﬀering criteria used, resulting in a

## wider spread of beliefs about an idea’s value.

# Comparing Novelty and Value

To test our hypotheses, we conducted ﬁve studies. In the ﬁrst, we used 1,088 business pitches from the reality show Shark Tank and asked

1,927 U.S. participants to rank the novelty of the pitches. Pulling their

250 most novel pitches and 250 least novel, we asked 1,000 new U.S.

participants to rank the pitches’ value. As predicted, we found the more

novel the pitch, the more variability there was in its projected value.

Next, we examined the audience review scores for ﬁlms shown at

## the Sundance Film Festival from 2015 to 2022. Sundance helpfully

has numerous categories for ﬁlms, including classic genres like U.S.

## and world documentaries, and more avant-garde categories, like

their “NEXT” grouping for ﬁlms that use innovative storytelling

methods, and the “Midnight” group, which features ﬁlms that “defy

categorization.” We reviewed audience rankings for the 523 ﬁlms

that had more than one audience review and again conﬁrmed our

hypothesis that in the more novel ﬁlm groups, there was greater

variability in the ﬁlms’ perceived worth, or score.

# The Problem of Mismatched Templates

We next looked to evaluate how shared or diﬀering templates for

evaluation impacted beliefs about value. In our third study, we sorted

200 U.S. participants into two conditions, asking them each to evaluate

art made by an alien society on a faraway planet. Group one saw

paintings, highly acclaimed in the alien society, from Artist A; group

two from acclaimed Artist B. Each group then saw 20 paintings

containing a mix of pieces by the two artists. The groups were then

asked to evaluate the value of the pieces they saw. We found that

each group thought the art by their own prototypical artist to be the

most valuable and the art by the other artist to be of lower value,

conﬁrming our theory that when people have diﬀerent reference points

## for evaluation, their judgements of value diﬀer, even for the same pieces

# of art.

We also tested whether associating value with novelty would impact

variability. In our fourth experiment, we asked 200 U.S. participants

who had experience working in hospitality to review 19 highly novel

sandwich ideas and 19 low-novelty sandwich ideas, determined through

a previous survey. We sorted the participants into two groups: baseline

and novelty-as-value. We asked both groups to evaluate the sandwiches’

value, but in the novelty-as-value group, we asked, “At a restaurant

specializing in sandwiches no one has tried before, how successful

would this sandwich be as a menu item?”

We found that, consistent with our other studies, there was high

## variability in value ratings of the sandwich ideas in the baseline group.

However, for the group who were told to evaluate the sandwiches

for a restaurant focused on novelty, we found that this eﬀect went

away, suggesting that providing people with clear criteria for evaluation

muted the tendency for variability in people’s judgments of the value

of novel ideas. The spread of scores diminished further when we

controlled for subjects who had worked in restaurants speciﬁcally,

providing further evidence that shared context and reference points can

## help limit contention in perceived value.

# How Disagreement Affects Evaluation

Finally, to test the impact that disagreement, or variability, itself has

on perceived value, we recruited 401 U.S. participants with experience

in investing. We told them they would be asked to rank how willing

they would be to invest in an innovative electronic product, but ﬁrst

they would receive ratings of the product from their close friends and

advisors. One group saw a wide variability in advisor ratings, with some

ranking the product very highly and others giving it a low score. In

the other group, their advisors had a narrow range of opinions, with

most people ﬁnding the product to have middling worth. Participants

were then asked to rank how valuable the investment would be, their

likelihood to invest, how risky they viewed the investment, and how

novel or unique the product sounded.

## HBR / Digital Article / Research: How to Build Consensus Around a New Idea

Conﬁrming our hypothesis, participants in the high variability group

were less likely to say they would invest and found the investment

riskier, though both groups found the idea equally novel. This conﬁrms

## our theory that variability, or disagreement itself, rather than just the

novelty of an idea, makes people less likely to invest in it.

Our research supports that idea that diﬀering templates for evaluation

can lead to major diﬀerences in perceptions of worth for the same idea,

and that the conﬂict caused by diﬀering beliefs in worth can also lead

to negative evaluations of new ideas. So how do managers cut through

this disagreement and get their evaluators on the same page? We oﬀer

# the following suggestions:

# How to Build Consensus

It might be tempting to interpret conﬂicting feedback about an idea as

a sign that the idea is a bad one and should be rejected — imagine the

contention in the 3M conference room when Spencer Silver proposed

creating a product with an extremely weak adhesive (Silver went on to

# invent Post-It notes).

However, viewing contention as a sign of ambiguity rather than

negativity may help you also see hidden opportunity, in addition to risk.

We propose using conﬂicting feedback as a sign that you need to explore

the criteria upon which evaluators are making decisions about an idea’s

# worth.

Gather information on evaluators’ reference points.

Ask evaluators questions such as: What ideas are you comparing this

new idea to? On what grounds did you ﬁnd those reference points

successful or unsuccessful? What would success look like with this idea?

What would failure look like?

By ﬁnding out what criteria evaluators are using, you can better judge

how well it maps onto the new proposal. Are some judgements biased,

such as by evaluators’ moods or other factors that are irrelevant to

assessing idea value? Discussing how someone is evaluating something,

rather than just weighing their opinion, can open up the conversation,

and help teams determine what criteria are the most important or

# relevant.

Previous research has shown that individuals often incorrectly assume

others share their thinking. By identifying strengths and weaknesses in

diﬀerent perspectives, evaluators can use discussion to build consensus

around the most pertinent factors to use in evaluating a new idea.

Develop criteria to focus discussions.

Another way to build consensus is to create and disseminate criteria

ahead of time. Ask employees to evaluate the idea based on speciﬁc

## factors, for example, logistical strengths and weaknesses or advantages

compared to existing oﬀerings. Are there case studies you can hand out

## beforehand that relate to the strengths or weaknesses of this new idea?

Oﬀering shared reference points can help focus discussion.

You could also create separate meetings meant to anchor conversations.

One meeting might be based on logistical feasibility or potential costs

of a new idea, while another could focus on what ways the new idea might impact eﬃciencies or improve client relationships, for example.

Focusing evaluations by oﬀering speciﬁc criteria, rather than opening

them up to wide-ranging discussion, could help make feedback more

focused and useful.

. . .

Creative ideas are important to keeping companies relevant and helping

them to grow and adapt. So, too, is diverse feedback. While our study

focused on ways that diﬀering criteria can stiﬂe new ideas, a limitation

of our study is it does not explore the opposite extreme of groupthink,

where new ideas may be hindered because evaluators agree too much.

Group discussions can lead people to converge too much, but this

research investigated people judging value separate from the inﬂuence

of others. Our research oﬀers useful ﬁndings for managers wading

through wide ranging opinions and contention around new ideas, and

oﬀers solutions for how to get employees on the same page, creating

avenues to submit meaningful evaluations for a novel concept.

Understanding why people are more likely to disagree about the value

of creative ideas creates opportunities to anticipate when a lack of

consensus may occur. Understanding lack of consensus is a signal to

investigate, assess, and weight the reasoning diﬀerent evaluators are

using will help facilitate thoughtful decisions, helping overcome what

otherwise can be a meaningful barrier to innovation.
