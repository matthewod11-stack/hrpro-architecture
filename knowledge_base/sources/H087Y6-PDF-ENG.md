The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) made history last week when

it passed a new rule that fundamentally alters the landscape of

employment agreements across the U.S. The agency’s noncompete rule

## adopts a comprehensive prohibition on the use of noncompete clauses

in any industry with any worker, including those at senior executive

levels. The rule is promulgated using the FTC’s authority to determine

practices that are unfair methods of competition. For those like me who

have long argued against the use of noncompetes, this moment has

been a long time coming.

## HBR / Digital Article / The FTC’s Noncompete Ban Was Long Overdue

In 2016, I was part of President Obama’s team when his administration

issued a call to action urging states to curtail the expansion of

noncompete clauses, recognizing growing empirical evidence that

noncompetes — terms or conditions of employment that prohibit a

worker from seeking or accepting work for a certain period of time with

a competitor or starting their own business after leaving their employer

— are harmful not only to employees but to the economy at large.

Since then, I have been among the voices calling on the FTC to act on

noncompetes and advising the Biden administration to give the FTC

the authority to promulgate a national ban. This has been driven by my

## work as a law professor and labor policy expert, and my research-backed

belief that noncompetes harm both workers and businesses.

Now that we’re here, questions still loom, as there are already challenges

in court to block the FTC’s action. But company leaders would be well

advised to understand what’s in the rule, its potential impact, and what

it could mean for employees. Far from being an anti-business rule, the

new FTC ban on noncompetes stands to actually spur innovation and

grow markets. Employers should plan for a new landscape in which only

true trade secrets are protected, while talent and creativity remain freely

# mobile.

What’s in the FTC’s Action

The FTC’s rule is broad in several ways. “Worker” is deﬁned not just

as an employee but also includes independent contractors, externs,

interns, volunteers, apprentices, or a sole proprietor who provides a

service. The rule also broadly deﬁnes noncompete clauses not only as

terms or conditions of employment that explicitly prohibit a worker

from competing with a former employer, but also to mean any other

clauses that “penalize a worker for” or “function to prevent a worker

from” competing. With this deﬁnition, the FTC also prohibits clauses

that operate as de facto noncompetes, including overly broad NDAs,

nonsolicitation clauses, and TRAPs — training repayment agreement

# provisions.

For example, if an NDA includes any information that “relates to”

the industry, or bars the use of any information the worker obtained

during their employment, including publicly available information,

such agreements are so broad and beyond the deﬁnition of a trade

secret that they are the functional equivalents of noncompetes.

The ﬁnal rule does create a carveout for existing noncompete

agreements with senior executives — those earning over $151,164 who

## occupy policy-making positions, a demographic constituting less than

1% of the workforce — that are permitted to remain eﬀective. All other

noncompetes with workers will become unenforceable when and if the

rule takes eﬀect. The rule should go into eﬀect 120 days following its

# publication in the Federal Register.

# Examining the Case Against Noncompetes

Banning noncompetes not just good for workers, it is good for business.

As I argued in Talent Wants to be Free: Why We Should Learn to Love

## Leaks, Raids, and Free-Riding, a competitive labor market, just like a

competitive product market, is an engine for innovation, investment,

and economic growth. By curbing the enforceability of noncompetes,

the FTC anticipates — based on research — several signiﬁcant beneﬁts.

For wages, the removal of noncompete constraints is projected to boost

worker earnings, with estimates suggesting an increase ranging from

$400 billion to $488 billion over the next decade. The FTC has state-by-

state modeling that projects that the average worker could see an annual

# wage increase of approximately $524.

This wage eﬀect happens because when workers are free to move

among competitors, and new employers are free to recruit and oﬀer

positions to their competitor’s employees, talent receives its market

value. Employers dynamically recruit and retain by competing over

## the best workers through better terms and conditions of employment.

## Competition over employees raises salaries just as competition over

# consumers lower prices.

For market innovation, the new rule is projected to spur an increase in

patent ﬁlings, as well as patent value, estimated at between 17,000 to

29,000 additional patents annually, reﬂecting an 11-19% yearly growth

over a 10-year period. For a vibrant entrepreneurial economy, the rule is

expected to encourage startup activity, potentially leading to a 2.7% rise

in new business formation, equating to around 8,500 new enterprises

# each year.

The health care industry is projected to see a reduction in costs by

an estimated $74 billion to $194 billion. According to the American

Medical Association, between 37% and 45% of physicians have signed

noncompetes. Noncompetes concentrate markets and have contributed

## to health care market consolidation and the rise of health care prices.

A national ban on noncompetes is poised to improve patient access,

continuity of care, and allow physicians to work for multiple hospitals.

Empirical studies provide compelling evidence that talent mobility,

especially at the higher echelons of management, plays a critical

role in fostering an innovative environment. This relationship can be

understood through several key dynamics. Fostering talent mobility

is not just about ﬁlling leadership roles but is also a strategic

innovation lever. The unimpeded ability to bring in new talent brings

fresh perspectives, less constrained by the status quo or groupthink

that hinder creative breakthroughs. Talent mobility means richer

experiences from diﬀerent corporate cultures and industries, giving

employees insights and an edge that can inspire new ideas and drive

## change more eﬀectively than long-tenured workers.

Moreover, when employees have the freedom to move within an

industry, they have more of an incentive to build their human capital

and develop their skills. Noncompetes reduce employee motivation,

## entrepreneurship and sharing of knowledge, fundamental elements of

# innovation.

In turn, mobility strengthens professional networks across

organizations and sectors. These networks bring in new ideas, accessing

cutting-edge research, and implementing best practices from the

industry at large. And when employers cannot conﬁne workers by

## threat of noncompetes, new carrots rise as an alternative to the

sticks of restrictive covenants: Employers use more performance-based

incentives, active retention eﬀorts, and stock options to encourage the

best employees to stay. All of these eﬀects together operate to create a

## more productive, competitive, and innovative ecosystem.

Until now, the enforceability of noncompetes has been determined

by the states, and there is a natural experiment that has brought a

wealth of research insights, documenting the eﬀects of noncompetes

on market dynamism. California and Massachusetts are often cited as

the paradigmatic natural experiment, as California has always banned

noncompetes, while Massachusetts has long enforced them, though

since 2018 are limiting their reach with a new law. California’s Silicon

Valley beneﬁted from the nonenforcement of noncompetes in fueling

its startup culture, drawing more talent from out-of-state,

The empirical evidence, gathered from diverse methodologies including

longitudinal and comparative regional studies, has helped bring a

## consensus among scholars and policymakers on the signiﬁcance of

ensuring that the labor market remains competitive. To that end, the

FTC received more than 26,000 comments on the proposed rule (I

submitted two), with over 25,000 of the comments supporting the

rule. In terms of wider U.S. public opinion, an Ipsos survey in 2023

found that most Americans supported banning noncompetes.

# What Happens Next

The FTC ﬁnal rule was approved in a 3-2 vote and is already facing legal

challenges in federal court. As of April 29, at least three lawsuits have

been ﬁled, from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce, and other business

groups. The challenges include, in part, that the FTC lacks authority

to promulgate such a rule, or any rulemaking authority altogether, that

the rule is arbitrary and capricious, and that it fails the favorite new

## doctrine of the current Supreme Court, the major questions doctrine.

Many predict that under the current court climate, the challenges have a

good chance to lead to the striking down of the rule.

Ever the optimist, I remain hopeful that the robust record of empirical

evidence about the beneﬁts of the rule will be heard. But if facts

don’t sway the court, then the action to protect talent mobility will

continue to be the purview of the states, and congress could pass

a law that statutorily bans noncompetes. Last year, I drafted a bill

to strengthen California’s longstanding public policy that voids all

noncompetes, signed into law by Governor Gavin Newsom. Other states

have recently moved closer to California’s policy, providing further

## support to the natural experiment that a ban on noncompetes boosts

# market dynamism.

During this period of uncertainty, businesses should take a page out of the California playbook: Be the best employer possible, use aﬃrmative

steps to attract and retain the best talent, and take a hard look at

what it is that is truly secret in your innovation landscape. Trade

secrets still need to be protected, and taking the right steps to identify

and secure this information, training one’s employees on how to protect

proprietary information, and conducting exit interviews to remind

departing employees of their continued duty to not disclose secrets,

are fundamental practices that companies should adopt. Still, keep in

mind that NDAs and other restrictive covenants cannot be so broad as to

# prevent competition by former employees.

The FTC’s new rule also emphasizes that — like all restrictive covenants

## — non-solicitation agreements, no-hire, and no-business agreements

are subject to the general prohibition of unfair methods of competition

under Section 5 of the Federal Trade Commission Act, which prohibits

“unfair or deceptive acts of practices in or aﬀecting commerce,”

regardless of whether the ﬁnal rule becomes the law of the land.

Companies should therefore continue to protect their intellectual

property through exercising reasonable measures to protect their

secrets and informing their employees about the need to keep certain

sensitive information conﬁdential. Companies can continue to use the

patent system to protect innovation. They may also continue to use

non-disclosure agreements as long as those do not attempt to overclaim

what is conﬁdential.

## Intellectual property laws — patents, copyright, trademarks, and trade

## secrecy — balance the protection of inventions and creativity with the

free ﬂow of ideas. The best businesses are already realizing that rather

than deny the mounting evidence about the harms of noncompetes,

they can lead the way in embracing a competitive talent market. With

the new rule, companies must move forward by attracting talent and

fueling innovation rather than preventing mobility. Entire industries

will beneﬁt.
