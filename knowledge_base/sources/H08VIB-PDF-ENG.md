We were recently invited to a workshop on AI strategy, led by the

company’s head of AI—let’s call him Marc. The session brought together

members of the organization’s internal AI community to discuss the AI

strategic priorities. Everyone in the room was well-versed in AI, and the

day was ﬁlled with discussions, brainstorming, and planning.

At the end of the workshop, Marc asked for our feedback. We responded

with a simple question: “Did you notice that AI wasn’t in the room

# today?”

Marc paused, surprised. “I hadn’t even thought about using AI in our

teamwork,” he admitted. Marc isn’t alone. Again and again, we see even

the most AI-savvy individuals reverting to pre-AI practices and routines

when they work in group settings like daily standups, brainstorming

sessions, oﬀsites, planning meetings, strategy reviews. This isn’t merely

a missed opportunity, it’s a systemic blind spot that spans every corner

of the organization. Teams are leaving value on the table: not only in

## productivity gains, but also in sharper thinking, faster decisions, deeper

# alignment, and more breakthrough ideas.

Reﬂecting on our feedback, Marc acknowledged that AI could have

## unlocked far more value before, during, and after the workshop. The

barrier, however, wasn’t technical. It was the mindset. He admitted that

using AI hadn’t even crossed his mind until after our question. And

that’s precisely the risk: when managers default to the status quo, they

## miss opportunities for deeper transformation of work—not just in a

single workshop, but at scale. Multiply this by the dozens of workshops,

meetings, and collaborative sessions happening across an organization,

and the cost of inaction becomes clear. Until these collective moments

are reimagined with AI, its impact in the workplace will remain limited.

The potential of AI to elevate collaboration isn’t just theoretical.

Some managers are already challenging traditional approaches and

embedding AI into the way teams collaborate, think, and make

decisions. In an eﬀort to discover the emerging best practices, we

conducted qualitative research and ﬁeld experiments, observing more

than 100 managers working in small groups of 3-4 people. What

emerged was striking: two thirds of these managers reported that the

quality of their output improved when they used AI in team-based

settings. A similar proportion noted that risks were mitigated more

eﬀectively. They were more likely to challenge the AI (“We questioned

AI output more proactively”), they experimented more (“We tried

diﬀerent approaches and compared prompts”), and they reﬂected more

deeply (“Team discussion encouraged a more thoughtful and less hasty

# use of AI”).

Our research uncovered that there are three main approaches to

consider when integrating AI into teamwork: AI sets the table, AI at

one seat, and AI at every seat. When you make AI part of your team, you

must consider team chemistry.

# AI Sets the Table

In the “AI sets the table” approach, AI is leveraged before a meeting

or workshop to generate materials, templates, or guidelines to be used

in the room. Anna, the regional head of strategy at an automotive

company, used generative AI to help her prepare for a strategy planning

meeting. Her goal wasn’t just to organize the session, but to elevate the

# quality of the team discussion.

To start, she used AI to curate preparatory content and co-create the

pre-read material. Then, Anna shared it with participants along with

this structured prompt: “Based on this document [upload, share or link],

guide me through a three-step dialogue to extract key insights, explore

strategic questions, and reﬂect on implications. You ask for my input

## and feedback after each step.” Interactive prompts like this one help

participants come better prepared to the session: they engage with the

content of the pre-read easily, reﬂect on key elements and surface early

ideas, thereby laying the foundations for more focused and productive

# group discussions.

Anna also leveraged AI to shape the meeting’s structure. She worked

with AI to frame the strategic questions to be discussed, design the

agenda, develop the templates and instructions for groupwork. She also

discussed with AI about the most popular facilitation techniques and

selected one based on the goals, but also on the proﬁles of participants

and their past group dynamics. Aware of existing tensions and diﬀering

perspectives on selected topics, particularly between Finance and IT,

she even used AI to reﬂect on and anticipate potential conﬂicts that

might arise during the group discussion.

It’s important to remark that Anne didn’t work with AI in isolation:

she actively involved topic experts to review and validate the pre-read

material she co-created with AI before sending it to all participants. She

considered the AI-driven meeting prep a success: “After the meeting,

participants approached me to learn more about the innovative way the

workshop was prepared with AI, but also to show appreciation for the

facilitation guidelines and the framing questions that eﬀectively steered

the conversation.” The participants’ feedback was enthusiastic, to the

point that it sparked the idea of systematizing this approach for future

use. The most frequently mentioned beneﬁt was the exceptional quality

of the discussion and the high level of intellectual rigor compared to

# traditional workshops.

Anna’s case is just one of many we’ve observed, which helped us

identify some practical tips and caveats. Here are some key dos and

don’ts when using AI to set the table for a teamwork session:

# Dos

Prompt the prep. Encourage participants to actively engage with

preparatory content using AI prompts, rather than relying on passive

reading. As Anna’s example illustrates, it’s not enough to simply invite

them to do so, you need to provide one or two ready-to-use prompts.

Ideally, the prompts should be carefully crafted to spark a dynamic,

personalized, and two-way dialogue with AI as a co-thinker.

Simulate team dynamics. Beyond content preparation, use AI to

reﬂect on the diﬀerent stakeholders, interests, and perspectives that

will be in the room, anticipating the interpersonal and group dynamics

that may emerge during the group discussion. Try this structured

prompt, “I’m preparing to present a proposal on [brief description] to

the following participants: [list names]. Based on their past interactions

with me (from emails, chats, or meeting transcripts), help me reﬂect on

how each participant is likely to respond and how their perspectives

may interact.” Prompts like this one are particularly eﬀective when AI is

embedded in the enterprise suite, i.e. it has access to information about

# participants and past group discussions.

Provide contextual nuances. Remember to bring your unique context

into the process, and not just at the beginning. Otherwise, AI may

default to a standard, surface-level output. You know your culture, your

team dynamics, and what made a valuable team collaboration in the

past. When you infuse your lived experience, values, and nuances into

the process, the results of human-AI collaboration become far more

## meaningful, not just for the organizer/facilitator, but also for everyone

participating.

# Don’ts

Don’t prepare alone. AI can speed things up, but don’t let that rush

you into working in isolation. Take time to pause, reﬂect, and share

your drafts with topic experts before distributing the memo to all

participants. This applies also to ready-to-use prompts you plan to

share ahead of the session. Pressure-test them with a colleague, gather

feedback, and ﬁne-tune before you hit send.

# AI at One Seat

The second approach to bringing AI into the room is “AI at One Seat.”

In this setup, AI runs on one device and joins the team discussion. This

may involve one person typing or dictating on behalf of the group, or

when the voice-to-voice feature allows AI to interact and contribute

to the team conversation in a more seamless way. Take the case of

John, an innovation manager at a retail company, who is leading a

project to develop a new service. In every team meeting, he brings

his laptop and leverages AI as a methodological guide supporting the

discussion, sharing best practice examples, identifying blind spots,

and consolidating key insights throughout the meetings. During team

brainstorming, he activates the mic, making the experience more

# spontaneous and natural.

Depending on the teamwork stage, AI can play diﬀerent roles, acting as

an additional team member at the table. While AI can support mundane

tasks, such as acting as a notetaker or timekeeper, it can also play more

situational roles, activated at speciﬁc moments to augment the team

workﬂow. When seeking insights, AI can be asked to take the role of a

researcher, explainer/clariﬁer, or simulate user personas.

Let’s go back to John’s case. At the start of each phase of the innovation

## workshop—from discovery to ideation, articulation, and prioritization

—he prompts AI using a consistent template: “We are now at this

moment in our workshop [explain], and based on what we have

discussed so far [share summary or intermediate output], we would like

you (Generative AI) to act as [specify role] and help us [specify goal or

task].” You can try John’s template for the various situations described

# here below:

- When converging the team discussion, AI can assist by clustering and

consolidating ideas—especially when a discussion begins to wander.

- When articulating business concepts, AI might take on the role of a

“Business Model Innovation Expert” helping the team structure their

# concept.

- When critiquing ideas, it can become a “challenger” representing the

other side of the argument, or an “expert.”

- When pitching a concept, AI can act as a “storyteller” or a

“communications coach” for the team to craft a more compelling

narrative, or as “jury member” to strengthen the concept’s value

# proposition.

- And for drafting the next steps, it can support as a “planner.”

Based on multiple observations of “AI at one seat” dynamics here’s some

# tips and pitfalls:

# Dos

Explain to the AI who is at the table. As you’d do in a traditional

setting, a roundtable introduction should be the ﬁrst step. Present

yourself and the other team members to the AI, and clarify everyone’s

role in the meeting. In this way, the AI will know who it is talking

with and what role each person has in the team discussion. Imagine

a cross-functional team discussion, if AI knows who’s participating,

it can better articulate and elaborate on each participant’s ideas and

contributions knowing their roles. It can also solicit diﬀerent domain

perspectives, making sure everyone is contributing to the conversation.

Furthermore, AI can augment the team discussion by providing

overlooked ideas and input, going beyond existing participants’ proﬁles.

Speak to the mic. In an engaging team discussion people debate and

talk to each other. Having to type on a keyboard might bring fatigue and

friction to the team ﬂow. As most models oﬀer voice-to-text or voice-to-

voice features, it is recommended to activate the mic, thus making the

# experience more ﬂuid and seamless.

Don’ts Don’t experiment with large groups ﬁrst. Embedding AI in a team

discussion works best with small groups of 3–4 people. It’s indeed more

practical to integrate AI in a team discussion with fewer people: either

by typing or dictating. If you have more participants, consider using a

large screen or splitting into sub-teams, each with their own “AI at one

seat.”

Don’t let the prompter dominate. The person interacting with the

AI on behalf of the team shouldn’t take over the session, either

from a facilitation/process or content perspective. This is particularly

relevant when typing. Make sure everyone’s input is captured. How? By

prompting AI to encourage active participation of all team members.

Here’s an example of a prompt: “Make sure that silent, quieter team

members contribute by asking open-ended questions like, ‘Jordan, what

perspective would you add to this conversation?'”

# AI at Every Seat

The third mode, “AI at every seat” refers to a setup where each team

member uses AI individually on their device during a meeting or

workshop. In speciﬁc moments, participants are asked to interact with

AI on their own devices, then bring those outputs into the group

# discussion for consolidation.

In many workshops, participants are invited to take a moment to think

individually, generating ideas, reﬂecting on key topics, or jotting down

thoughts before sharing with the group. Traditionally, these moments

have relied on pen, paper, and personal insight. Today, facilitators

can at certain moments encourage participants to engage AI as a

thought partner, asking questions, exploring ideas, and deepening their

# reﬂections in real time.

Take the example of David, a manager facilitating a workshop with

20 participants focused on identifying use cases for robotics within

their company. David asked everyone to bring their laptops so they

could access AI throughout the session. During the ideation phase,

participants run a prompt crafted by David, “You (Generative AI)

## engage with me in a step-by-step dialogue about how robotics could

be applied in my area of work. First, help me identify key pain points

or repetitive tasks in my area. Then, help me explore how robotics

might address these challenges or create new opportunities. Finally,

help me think which ideas seem most promising and why.” After each

participant completed their co-thinking dialogue with AI, David used

AI on his laptop to capture and synthesize the team’s ideas. This

approach proved more eﬀective than “AI at one seat,” for two reasons.

First, a one-to-one interaction with AI creates a psychologically safe

setting, allowing participants to brainstorm without having their ideas

be immediately judged by others. Second, when AI is accessed through

## a personal interface with memory or contextual awareness, it can

enhance personal reﬂection by providing more customized and targeted

suggestions based on the user’s past interactions.

Later in the same workshop, David shared this reﬂection prompt with

all participants, “You (Generative AI) help me reﬂect on an interesting

workshop I just attended, by engaging with me in a dialogue about the

most impactful messages and how I can apply them to my daily job.”

Each participant spent 10 minutes conversing with AI, and then shared

their insights with the whole group to wrap up the workshop day.

When introducing this mode in your workshop or meeting, here are

some dos and don’ts:

Dos Embed reﬂections with AI. Imagine that after a presentation on a new

trend, the meeting organizer invites all participants to interact with AI

on their own device to reﬂect on the implications for their unit or team,

before the group discussion. To guide the self-reﬂection, the facilitator

gives a ready-to-use prompt to participants. This keeps insights focused

and makes it easier to bring them back into group discussion.

Time-box the reﬂection with AI. Let participants work individually

with AI for a maximum of 10 minutes, then reconvene to share, discuss,

and consolidate ideas. This approach supports divergence ﬁrst, then

convergence. But avoid having too many pauses; interrupting the ﬂow

too much can kill the momentum of group discussions.

# Don’ts

Don’t let AI become a distraction. Human nature still applies:

devices can be a distraction during meetings. Make sure to clarify

when participants should keep their laptop open and interact with

AI. Discipline is the success factor. Otherwise, participants might

start checking their inboxes and detach themselves from the group

# discussion.

Don’t proceed without a human facilitator. You need someone to

orchestrate the team-AI collaboration, creating the loops between AI

and the team discussion—particularly when the team is large. Not

all managers are good facilitators. The good news is that AI can

support this too: it can suggest facilitation approaches and techniques,

act as a co-facilitator during the discussion, connect the dots from

the participants’ discussion, and take notes. However, some activities

always require a human facilitator, such as: steering team dynamics,

reading the room, feeding the contextual nuances, extracting insights

that are relevant for the leadership, etc. This cannot (and shouldn’t) be

delegated to the AI.

# How to Start

We hope these examples give you many ideas to inspire you to bring

AI to the table, beyond your individual use. As you start building team

chemistry with AI in various group settings, remember to:

# Be intentional.

Proactively ask, “What if we use AI in this group setting?” This allows

you to shift to an experimental mindset challenging the status quo of

how work is typically done in groups.

# Deﬁne the AI integration mode.

Before using AI in a group setting, think about why you want to

use it, and in which moments. Facilitators and managers should

make a deliberate choice based on several key factors: the number

## of participants, in-person or virtual, the sensitivity of the topic, time

# constraints, and technical feasibility.

# Move seamlessly between the three.

The three approaches explored in this article are not mutually exclusive.

They can be combined ﬂexibly, depending on the needs in the moment.

AI can help set the table, then later everyone might use AI during a

brainstorming session, and ﬁnally the facilitator alone might use AI to

# drive idea convergence after ideation.

. . .

While the use of AI in teamwork is still emerging, pioneers like Anna,

John, and David are already shaping best practices. The three modes

we’ve described—AI sets the table, AI at one seat, and AI at every seat—

oﬀer a practical framework to guide your experimentation.
