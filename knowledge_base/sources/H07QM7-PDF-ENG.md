Trust is one of the most essential forms of capital a leader can have.

When employees trust their leaders, it unleashes higher performance.

Employees are more engaged, productive, and innovative. They

experience lower levels of stress and burnout and are more likely to stay

in their jobs. Good leaders understand these beneﬁts and actively work

to earn and develop the trust of their team members and colleagues.

## But sometimes, a lack of trust ﬂows in the opposite direction, and

leaders ﬁnd themselves in the uncomfortable situation of distrusting

# someone on their team.

In this unique age of remote and hybrid work, it’s perhaps no

## surprise that a scarcity of trust among leaders for their employees

is now at an all-time high, a perspective conﬁrmed in the recently

published Microsoft Work Trends Index. Lack of trust in an employee

leads to troublesome outcomes. It can cause leaders to feel anxious

and frustrated, hesitant to delegate, and prone to micromanaging.

## Unfortunately, the adverse eﬀects of leader distrust can also

extend beyond the speciﬁc leader-employee relationship, stealthily

diminishing innovation, morale, and performance of the broader team.

## Steps to Take When You Don’t Trust Your Employee

Two-way trust is paramount to a healthy and productive leader-

employee relationship. If you ﬁnd yourself in the uncomfortable

situation of distrusting a team member, here are ﬁve steps to help you

address the issue and move forward.

- 1. Pinpoint the source of your distrust.

We often hear (and make!) comments like “I don’t trust them” or “They

aren’t trustworthy.” We talk about trust in all-or-nothing terms, but trust

is not some global entity — trust is situation speciﬁc. Rarely will you

distrust everything about someone. For example, you may trust your

team member’s technical expertise but not their ability to present their

# ideas to clients eﬀectively.

Research shows that trust can be broken down into three components:

- Competency

- Consistency

- Character

Trusting someone’s competence entails having faith in their ability to

do the job. Consistency is the belief that the person is reliable — they do

what they say they’ll do and perform as expected. Finally, trusting their

character is believing that they have integrity and care about others

and their needs as well as their own. Like the indispensable legs of a

three-legged stool, each component of trust is crucial in a relationship.

To move past the black-and-white impasse of “They aren’t trustworthy,”

ask yourself: Which component of trust is lacking here? What exactly

did this person do or not do that has led to my distrust? Separate facts

from assumptions and focus on speciﬁc problematic behaviors.

- 2. Identify the speciﬁc situations or assignments where you are willing to trust them. Make a list of the areas in which you do trust your employee, and

consider how you might incrementally build on these areas in low-risk

ways. Here’s how this might look like:

- If you trust your employee to communicate eﬀectively within the

team, try involving them in cross-functional meetings or broader

# discussions.

- If you trust your employee’s technical skills, try having them mentor a

newer team member or guide them through a complex task.

- If you trust your employee’s problem-solving abilities, try assigning

increasingly complex tasks or providing more autonomy in tackling

problems and coming up with their own solutions.

Focus on clear and frequent communication as you delegate and build

on their tasks and responsibilities. Communicate the purpose and

desired outcome of the task, your speciﬁc expectations and standards,

deadlines, and their level of authority in making task-related decisions.

It’s also important to maintain regular one-on-one check-ins to ensure

you remain aligned, oﬀer the right amount of support, and create

trust. To reduce hesitation in approaching you between these regularly

scheduled meetings, share that you have an “open-door” policy.

When we feel like we can’t trust someone, we fear what might

happen if we extend our trust, which often leads to more widespread

micromanagement. So it’s critical that you give this person the

opportunity to prove their trustworthiness. Excessive control and

scrutiny will likely reduce their motivation, productivity, and feelings

of ownership, which could result in behaviors that further erode your

# trust.

- 3. Provide feedback on the speciﬁc behaviors that are leading to your distrust. Recall which of the three components of trust is low (competency,

consistency, and character) and specify the behaviors that have

degraded your trust. For example, let’s say you identiﬁed that the source

of your distrust is a lack of consistency. What exact behaviors have you

observed that make you feel you can’t rely on them? Missed deadlines,

failure to follow through on a stated commitment, or failure to respond

# to you in a reasonable amount of time?

Provide descriptive and speciﬁc feedback on the problematic behaviors,

describe the resulting negative impact, and align on moving forward

productively. For example, you might say, “For the last two weeks,

you’ve missed the weekly project status report deadline. Consequently, I

haven’t been able to provide a complete project update to the executive

team. Can we discuss what’s causing the delay and create a plan to

rectify the situation?”

High-quality feedback strengthens relationships with your team

member and builds trust. Remember that no one considers

themselves untrustworthy, so avoid using the “trust” word during your

# conversation.

- 4. Reﬂect on what you might be doing (or not doing) to contribute to the situation. Each person shapes a relationship’s dynamics and outcomes, so it’s

essential to consider your role in the current situation. Trust can

erode when employees don’t have a clear understanding of their

roles, responsibilities, and expectations. Is it possible that you haven’t provided suﬃcient clarity or guidance?

Trust is inherently reciprocal. In other words, the more someone trusts

you, the more likely you are to trust them in return. As such, try

boosting trust in this relationship by shifting your focus away from what

this person needs to do to regain your conﬁdence to how you might

signal your own trustworthiness. Again, recall the three components

of trust. How might you demonstrate your judgment and expertise,

integrity and care for them, and your dependability? For example, could

you show your character by being honest, transparent, and accountable

# for a recent mistake?

Also, consider whether a lack of visibility might be contributing to your

distrust. With sparser in-person interactions, there’s more room to make

negative and baseless assumptions about others. Would scheduling

more face-to-face time with this person be helpful? Alternatively, do

you need to let go of “seeing” them work and focus on impact instead?

- 5. Ask yourself whether the breach of trust is irreparable.

While trust is a tangible asset you can create in a relationship,

sometimes a situation is severely beyond repair; for example,

discovering that your team member has lied, breached conﬁdentiality,

or engaged in deeply disrespectful behavior. If a team member has

crossed certain boundaries, the right course of action — for the integrity

of your leadership and the health of your team — might be to trigger an

immediate investigation or consider dismissal.

This unfortunate situation can also develop when the behavior is

less severe, but your dedicated trust-building eﬀorts haven’t led to

improvement. In these cases, consulting with HR and considering

parting ways may also be warranted.

Bi-directional trust is a fundamental aspect of a healthy-employee

## relationship; without it, the leader, the employee, and the broader team

suﬀer. Create a plan based on the steps outlined above, give it time, and

know that trust can be rebuilt in most cases, leading to a happier, more

# productive workplace for all.
