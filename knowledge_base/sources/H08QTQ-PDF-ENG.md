Shortly after earning her engineering degree from a competitive

undergraduate program, Kayla was hired to be a software engineer at

a large tech company. Two years into the role, however, she was still

stuck ﬁxing bugs and handling other tedious tasks—the kind of work, as

she put it, that “ensures everyone else can do their jobs more eﬃciently.”

When Kayla asked her manager about new projects, his response

surprised her. “I’m not really sure what you’re working on,” he admitted.

“I don’t bother you because you did great work last year, so we just

assume you’re continuing to do great work.”

What her manager saw as a compliment—hands-oﬀ trust—had the opposite eﬀect on Kayla. On her team, where men outnumbered women four to one, her male peers were regularly oﬀered stretch assignments

that helped them build specialized skills, gain management experience,

and raise their visibility. Despite having the same credentials, Kayla was

quietly passed over.

For organizations, stories like this should be a wake-up call: While

stretch assignments are often discussed as powerful tools for developing

talent and advancing careers, they don’t always deliver those beneﬁts

# equally in practice.

Kayla’s story comes from a large organizational case study conducted

at our lab, and her experience is far from unique. As employees

build their careers and climb internal ladders, stretch assignments can

play an outsized role in shaping their trajectory. These projects are

frequently tied to leadership visibility, skill development, and career

## advancement—all critical ingredients in any talent development and

# retention strategy.

That’s why it’s essential for organizations to treat stretch assignments

## not as ad hoc opportunities, but as a strategic component of talent

management. This means putting systems in place that support,

evaluate, and reward these assignments equitably. Kayla’s story

highlights what can happen when organizations rely on informal or inconsistent approaches: even well-intentioned eﬀorts to develop talent

can result in uneven—and inequitable—outcomes.

# What the Research Tells Us

For nearly a decade, we’ve studied how stretch assignments impact the

trajectories of early-career employees. While previous research focuses

on their importance at the mid- to senior-career level, we asked: When

do stretch assignments start to matter and who beneﬁts most from

them? To answer these questions, we designed two research projects

examining their impact on engineers in their ﬁrst few years on the job.

The ﬁrst was a qualitative study of 19 early-career professionals based

on two interview samples of recent graduates entering workforce.

Interviewees were predominantly women who reported being from

Asian, Black, Latina, or “other” racial/ethnic backgrounds, and were

asked to describe stretch assignments based on their own experiences.

They also reﬂected on how people were selected for these opportunities

and the outcomes of receiving them.

The second was a longitudinal, survey-based, quantitative study of

## over 600 graduates from U.S. undergraduate engineering programs

within three years of graduation. Of the sample, 65% self-identiﬁed as

men and 35% as women (these groups include individuals specifying

## “trans man/male” or “trans woman/female” in an open-ended option

on our survey). The majority (88%) were Asian and/or White, compared

## with 12% who were Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and/or Paciﬁc Islander.

These demographics closely—but not exactly—reﬂect U.S. engineering

bachelor’s degree recipients at the time of the study (2015-2017), with

women particularly overrepresented among our survey respondents.

In this study, we broke down a stretch assignment into two main

components and analyzed each one separately: assignments that are

visible to others in the organization (they are known and get you known)

and that involve new and unfamiliar areas (they get you “out of your

comfort zone” and help you learn new skills). We analyzed who had

access to these assignments by measuring how frequently respondents

engaged in each type. Survey participants were asked how often, since

starting their current job, their assignments involved either generating

interest and feedback from others (visibility) or working in unfamiliar

areas (new areas), using a ﬁve-point scale from “never” to “very often.”

We also examined how these types of assignments were connected to

each participant’s expectation of job rewards. Speciﬁcally, we asked how

likely participants thought they were to receive a raise or promotion in

the next year, using a ﬁve-point scale from “deﬁnitely not” to “deﬁnitely

yes.” While we didn’t ask participants to directly link their expectations

to stretch assignments, our statistical models allowed us to analyze these relationships—oﬀering insight into how stretch work may shape perceptions of career advancement. We looked at diﬀerences by gender

and race/ethnicity among engineers, controlling for academic and job-

# related factors.

Our ﬁndings surface a critical but underexamined pattern: The impact

of stretch assignments lies not only in when they begin to shape careers

(often, early on), but also in how they shape those careers—and that

impact is not uniform.

Speciﬁcally, we found that early-career stretch assignments—especially

those involving new and unfamiliar areas of work—were more strongly

linked to expected rewards for dominant groups in engineering: men

and engineers from White and Asian backgrounds. By contrast, the

same types of assignments were not linked to the same expected

rewards for similarly qualiﬁed and positioned women engineers or

## Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and Paciﬁc Islander engineers. In other

words, the same stretch assignments that can launch some careers may

do little—or even stall progress—for others.

## Disparities in the perceived value of stretch work—even among

engineers who have similar talent and experience—point towards a

larger, systemic issue that extends beyond the decisions of individual

managers. Our ﬁndings reveal that access to career-advancing stretch

work is not only uncertain, but that the returns on this work may be

inconsistent and unclear—especially for those who have long faced

## cultural and historical skepticism about their abilities and belonging.

# Where Organizations Go Wrong

## Our research, along with ﬁndings from related studies of disparities

## in work tasks, highlights two common pitfalls that organizations

should address when developing a talent strategy that includes stretch

assignments. If not managed carefully, these challenges can limit the growth of high-potential employees and weaken eﬀorts to build a

# strong, diverse leadership pipeline.

Below, we outline each issue and oﬀer practical steps senior leaders can

take to build fairer systems for assigning, supporting, and rewarding

early-career stretch work. While our analysis focuses on the engineering

industry, these lessons can be applied across sectors and functions.

- 1) Under-communicating the importance of a stretch assignment.

In our qualitative study, several participants knew what a “stretch

assignment” was but had diﬃculty describing how these opportunities

functioned in their organization. Many were even less aware of how

vital stretch assignments could be to their career growth. This reﬂected

## a broader lack of communication from managers about what it really

takes to advance.

One woman we interviewed, for example, explained that stretch

assignments on her team were often framed as optional or extra. She

and her peers only realized their importance after being passed over

for a promotion—at which point it became clear that these assignments

were “secretly mandatory.”

How to ﬁx it: To ensure stretch assignments are distributed and

pursued equitably, organizations must equip managers with clear

guidance around the role they play in early-career talent development.

This means not relying solely on informal coaching or mentorship,

but also providing structured tools and systems that help managers

communicate what high performance looks like—and how to help

employees achieve it.

A good start involves making the unwritten rules of advancement more

# visible.

Senior leaders can play a critical role by providing guidance and

training that help frontline managers communicate these pathways

to their teams. That includes encouraging initiative-seeking behaviors

such as expressing interest in stretch assignments, pursuing high-

visibility projects, cultivating relationships with inﬂuential colleagues,

and identifying opportunities for sponsorship and skill-building.

Just as important is ensuring those messages are delivered equitably

and systematically. Organizations should establish processes that

help managers track whom they’re developing—and whom they may

be overlooking. Tools for documenting development conversations,

prompts in performance reviews, or dashboards that highlight

participation in stretch opportunities are all good options. By

promoting consistent and inclusive communication across teams,

organizations can help level the playing ﬁeld and ensure all employees

have access to the same knowledge.

- 2) Overlooking which team member expects (and receives) rewards.

Our quantitative study highlighted a second pitfall: the relationship

between stretch assignments and expected job rewards was generally

## stronger for dominant groups in engineering—male, White, and Asian

engineers. In fact, although women engineers reported doing more

## stretch assignments in unfamiliar areas, the expected job rewards

associated with this work were less clear for them than for men.

These disparities became even more pronounced when analyzed by

race and ethnicity. For Asian and White engineers, stretch assignments

in new and unfamiliar areas were strongly linked to expected salary

increases and promotions. These same relationships were not observed

## for Black, Latinx, Indigenous, and Paciﬁc Islander engineers. This

suggests that professional gains from these opportunities are not

perceived equally across all groups.

Why might this be? It’s not due to diﬀerences in skill, conﬁdence,

or experience—our analysis controlled for engineering conﬁdence,

academic success, prior internships, and career exposure. Instead, we theorize that the diﬀerence lies in status within a highly technical ﬁeld

# like engineering.

Decades of sociological research show that people perceived as highly

competent in a given ﬁeld—often those from historically-advantaged

groups—are more likely to be given the beneﬁt of the doubt in

## ambiguous situations. Equally qualiﬁed individuals from historically

less-advantaged groups face more scrutiny and skepticism. Over time,

these advantages can become internalized, making some groups more

likely to expect career rewards, while others may be less certain that the same eﬀorts will lead to advancement.

Our ﬁndings also raise questions about why early-career women

engineers, in particular, reported doing more new area stretch

assignments than men. Were they being given these opportunities to

develop their skills rather than to position them for leadership? In other

words, do men get higher-value stretch assignments to advance, while

women get stretches to prove themselves? More research is required to

# answer these questions.

How to ﬁx it: Organizations should not only track who is getting stretch

assignments, but also clarify how these opportunities connect to career

growth. Simply assigning high-stakes work—or encouraging employees

to seek it out—isn’t enough. Employees need to know: What does

success look like? What speciﬁc skills will be developed? How will this

## work factor into future raises, promotions, or leadership consideration?

Too often, the value of a stretch assignment is assumed to be self-

evident—but our research suggests that, given widely held cultural beliefs and biases, diﬀerent groups perceive the payoﬀ of similar work very diﬀerently. Without systems in place to clarify the

purpose, expectations, and potential outcomes of stretch opportunities,

organizations risk undercutting the very advancement possibilities that

stretches are theoretically designed to open up.

One way to systematize this is through clear documentation and

performance frameworks tied to stretch work. At one multinational

company we studied, a manager introduced a simple but powerful shift:

integrating an “assignment review” into annual career conversations.

This reﬂection helped employees make more strategic decisions about

which opportunities to pursue. It also helped leaders ensure that

growth-oriented work translated into real advancement.

Organizations can also take steps to ensure that employees who excel in

stretch assignments are recognized and supported in ways that lead to

real career growth. Publicly acknowledging those who excel in stretch

roles increases visibility and signals their contributions to key decision-

# makers.

As an example, at another company we studied, junior employees

were matched with senior mentors who not only supported them

through challenging projects but also helped translate that experience

into broader career gains. This kind of mentorship, layered on top

of day-to-day managerial support, demonstrated an organization-wide

commitment to equitable development.

Ultimately, our research underscores the importance of designing

systems that make the value and rewards of stretch assignments clear,

consistent, and accessible. When organizations invest in structures

## that support managers—through training, communication tools, and

systems for tracking and auditing assignments—more employees can

beneﬁt from stretch work. This not only accelerates individual career

growth, but also strengthens the organization’s ability to build a diverse

# and prepared leadership pipeline.
