# ABSTRACT

Most employees need motivation to feel good about their jobs and perform optimally. Some

employees are financially motivated while others find recognition and rewards personally

motivating. Motivation levels within the workplace have a direct impact on employee

productivity. Workers who are motivated and excited about their jobs carry out their

responsibilities to the best of their ability as a result, production numbers. Employee

motivation has always been a central problem for leaders and managers. Unmotivated

employees are likely to spend little or no effort in their jobs, avoid the workplace as much

as possible, exit the organization if given the opportunity and produce low quality work.

On the other hand, employees who feel motivated to work are likely to be persistent,

creative and productive, turning out high quality work that they willingly undertake. There

has been a lot of research done on motivation by many scholars. Employers need to get

to know their employees very well and use different tactics to motivate each of them based on

their personal wants and needs. In this paper we would like to emphasis on the importance

of motivation in the workplace to improve the employee performance and productivity. Even

we would like to present the theories and techniques of the motivation in the workplace.

## KEYWORDS: Employee Motivation, Importance, Performance, Techniques and Theories.

# I. INTRODUCTION

# Motivation results from the interaction of both conscious and unconscious factors

such as the intensity of desire or need, incentive or reward value of the goal, and

expectations of the individual and of his or her peers. These factors are the reasons one

has for behaving a certain way. An example is a student that spends extra time studying

for a test because he or she wants a better grade in the class. Internal and external factors

that stimulate desire and energy in people to be continually interested and committed to a

job, role or subject, or to make an effort to attain a goal.

Most employees need motivation to feel good about their jobs and

perform optimally. Some employees are money motivated while others find recognition

and rewards personally motivating. Motivation levels within the workplace have a direct

impact on employee productivity. Workers who are motivated and excited about their

jobs carry out their responsibilities to the best of their ability and production numbers

increase as a result. An incentive is a motivating influence that is designed to drive

behavior and motivate employees to be produce quality work. Employers use several

types of incentives to increase production numbers. Employee incentives come in a

variety of forms including paid time off, bonuses, cash and travel perks. Incentives drive

employee motivation because they offer workers more to strive for than a regular

paycheck. Many employees need recognition from their employers to produce

quality work. Recognition and employee reward systems identify employees who

perform their jobs well. Acknowledging a job well done makes employees feel good and

encourages them to do good things. Employers recognize workers by tracking progress

and providing feedback about how they have improved over time. Public recognition is

also a motivating factor that drives worker productivity.

Some employees are motivated through feeling a sense of accomplishment and

achievement for meeting personal and professional goals. Many workers are self-

disciplined and self-motivated. Incentive and rewards have little effect on employees

who feel motivated only when they are confident in their abilities and personally

identify with their role within the organization. These individuals perform productively

# for the sake of the personal challenge their work provides. There are several ways

# employers can motivate employees and drive worker productivity. Because different

factors influence workers in different ways, employers can utilize motivation strategies

that encompass several techniques. For example, to influence workers who are money

motivated, an employer may implement a daily "spiff" that pays cash instantly to

employees who meet short-term production goals. To achieve long-term production

goals, an employer could implement a program that encourages friendly competition

between workers to meet production numbers. At the conclusion of the program,

employers can publicly recognize top performers for a job well done.

# II. CONCEPT OF MOTIVATION

The word motivate is frequently used in the context of management as a

transitive verb: motivation is by implication something done by one person or

group to another. A further implication of this usage is that the motivated parties need

to be induced to perform some action or expend a degree of effort which they would not

otherwise wish to do. That this is an issue of vital importance to the prosperity of

commercial organizations is emphasized by Lawler (1973): “Those individual behaviors

that are crucial in determining the effectiveness of organizations are, almost without

exception, voluntary motivated behaviors”.

Motivation concerns that “psychological processes that cause the arousal,

direction and persistence of behavior” (Ilgen and Klein, 1988). Whilst there is general

# agreement in the literature about these three components of “motivation” (eg: Korman

1974, Kanfer, 1990), the nature and place of motivation in a work-related context has

been the subject of a long and developing study. Theories have been propounded,

tested and superseded at a pace which has left organizational

Practice often several steps behind the researchers. The following pages will attempt to

document the main themes and the most widely recognized theories.

Employee motivation has always been a central problem for leaders and

managers. Unmotivated employees are likely to spend little or no effort in their jobs,

avoid the workplace as much as possible, exit the organization if given the opportunity

and produce low quality work. On the other hand, employees who feel motivated to

work are likely to be persistent, creative and productive, turning out high quality work

# that they willingly undertake. There has been a lot of research done on motivation by

# many scholars, but the behavior of groups of people to try to find out why it is that every

employee of a company does not perform at their best has been comparatively

unresearched. Many things can be said to answer this question; the reality is that every

employee has different ways to become motivated. Employers need to get to know their

employees very well and use different tactics to motivate each of them based on their

personal wants and needs.

Inspiring employee motivation requires much more than the old-fashioned

carrot- and-stick approach. Today’s manager needs to understand the reasons why

employees work and offer the rewards they hope to receive. Motivated employees have

a drive to succeed no matter what the project. Managers cannot “motivate” employees,

but they can create an environment that inspires and supports strong employee

# motivation.

# III. REVIEW OF LITERATURE

There has been a lot of research done on Motivation by many scholars. The

following are only a few of the research topics that have been done on Motivation:

Motivation theories, Ways to encourage employee motivation, Measures of Motivation,

Principles of motivation, Ways of making your firm more exciting, How to motivate

your people problem, The missing link in Strategic Performance, Salary is not a

motivator anymore, How to effectively reward employees, Turning Motivation Theory

## into Practice, Measures of Motivation, Self Theories and Employee Motivation.

## Of the many theories of work motivation, Herzberg's (1966) motivator-hygiene

theory has been one of the most influential in recent decades. Basically, the theory

divides motivating factors into two categories: Motivator factors, which have something

to do with the work itself, and Hygiene factors, which have something to do with the

surrounding context. According to Maslow, most of what we know of human

motivation comes not from psychologists but from psychotherapists treating

patients. He explains that these patients are a great source of error as well as of useful

data, because they constitute a poor sample of the population. The motivational life of

neurotic sufferers should be rejected as a paradigm for healthy motivation. Any theory of

motivation must deal with the highest capacities of the healthy and strong man.

## Hackman and Oldham's (1976) model of job enrichment propose that jobs can

# be made more motivating by increasing the following: skill variety (the number of

different skills required by the job), task identity (the degree to which the job produces

# something meaningful), task significance

(The importance of the work), autonomy (the degree to which the individual has

freedom in deciding how to perform the job), and feedback (the degree to which the

individual obtains ongoing. One psychological view suggests that very high levels of

intrinsic motivation are marked by such strong interest and involvement in the work, and

by such a perfect match of task complexity with skill level, that people experience some

kind of psychological "flow," a sense of merging with the activity they are doing

## (Csikszentmihalyi 1975).The major psychological view suggests

# that extrinsic

motivation works in opposition to intrinsic motivation (Deci 1975; Deci & Ryan 1985).

Extrinsic motivation takes place when individuals feel driven by something outside of

the work itself such as promised rewards or incentives. In general, these theorists

suggest that, when strong extrinsic motivators are put to work, intrinsic motivation will

# decline.

## IV. MOTIVATION IS THE KEY TO PERFORMANCE IMPROVEMENT

There is an old saying you can take a horse to the water but you cannot force

it to drink; it will drink only if it's thirsty - so with people. They will do what they want

to do or otherwise motivated to do. Whether it is to excel on the workshop floor or in

the 'ivory tower' they must be motivated or driven to it, either by themselves or through

external stimulus. Are they born with the self-motivation or drive? Yes and no. If no,

they can be motivated, for motivation is a skill which can and must be learnt. This is

essential for any business to survive and succeed.

Performance is considered to be a function of ability and

# motivation, thus:

- Job performance =f(ability)(motivation)

# 15 | P a g e

# Ability in turn depends on education, experience and training and its improvement is a

# slow and long process. On the other hand motivation can be improved quickly. There are

many options and an uninitiated manager may not even know where to start. As a

guideline, there are broadly seven strategies for motivation.

- Positive reinforcement / high expectations

- Effective discipline and punishment

- Treating people fairly

- Satisfying employees needs

- Setting work related goals

- Restructuring jobs

- Base rewards on job performance

These are the basic strategies, though the mix in the final 'recipe' will vary from

workplace situation to situation. Essentially, there is a gap between an individuals actual

state and some desired state and the manager tries to reduce this gap. Motivation is, in

effect, a means to reduce and manipulate this

gap. It is inducing others in a specific way towards goals specifically stated by the

motivator. Naturally, these goals as also the motivation system must conform to the

corporate policy of the organization. The motivational system must be tailored to the

# situation and to the organization.

## V. EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION SO IMPORTANT FOR PERFORMANCE

Managers need to find creative ways in which to consistently keep their

employees motivated as much as possible. Motivation is highly important for every

company due to the benefits that it’s able to bring. Such benefits include:

- 1. Human Capital Management

A company can achieve its full potential only by making use of all the financial,

physical, and human resources that it has. It is through these resources that the

A Monthly Double-Blind Peer Reviewed Refereed Open Access International e-Journal - Included in the International Serial Directories. International Research Journal of Human Resources and Social Sciences (IRJHRSS)

# 16 | P a g e

# employees get motivated to accomplish their duties. This way, the enterprise begins to

## glisten as everyone is doing their best to fulfill their tasks.

- 2. Meet Personal Goals and Help an Employee Stay Motivated

Motivation can facilitate a worker reaching his/her personal goals, and can

facilitate the self- development of an individual. Once that worker meets some initial

goals, they realize the clear link between effort and results, which will further motivate

them to continue at a high level.

- 3. Greater Employee Satisfaction

Worker satisfaction is important for every company, as this one factor can lead

towards progress or regress. In the absence of an incentive plan, employees will not fill

ready to fulfill their objectives. Thus, managers should seek to empower them through

# promotion opportunities, monetary and non-monetary rewards, or disincentives in case

# of inefficient employees.

- 4. Raising Employee Efficiency

An employee’s efficiency level is not strictly related to his abilities and

qualifications. In order to get the very best results, an employee needs to have a perfect

balance between ability and willingness. Such balance can lead to an increase of

# productivity, lower operational costs, and an overall improvement in efficiency, and can

be achieved only through motivation.

- 5. A Higher Chance of Meeting the Company’s Goals

Any enterprise has its goals, which can be achieved only when the following

factors are met:

- There is a proper resource management

- The work environment is a cooperative one

- All employees are directed by their objectives

# 17 | P a g e

##  Goals can be reached if cooperation and coordination are fulfilled at

# once through motivation

- 6. Better Team Harmony

A proper work environment focused on cooperative relationships is highly

important for an organization’s success. Not only that it can bring stability and profits,

but employees will also adapt more easily to changes, fact which is ultimately in the

company’s benefit.

- 7. Workforce Stability

Stability of the personnel is highly important from a business point of view.

The staff will stay loyal to the enterprise only they meet a sense of participation within

the management side. The abilities and potency of staff can be used in their own

advantage, but also in the benefit of the company. This may cause an honest public

image within the market which can attract competent and qualified individuals into the

# business.

## VI. INTRINSIC VERSUS EXTRINSIC MOTIVATION

There are many frameworks, models, and theories that focus on employee

motivation. A few of the most common are quickly summarized below. While they are

each based on good research and have some degree of universal applicability, none are

the absolute doctrine on motivation. In fact, few motivation concepts are universal.

However, one idea that is acknowledged by all frameworks that address motivation is

that there are extrinsic and intrinsic motivational factors.

- 1. Extrinsic Motivation

Extrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from things or factors that are

outside the individual. For example being motivated to work hard at the office because

you are looking for a promotion is a type of extrinsic motivation. Social recognition,

money, fame, competition or material achievements are all examples of extrinsic

# motivation.

# 18 | P a g e

# 2. Intrinsic Motivation

Intrinsic motivation is motivation that comes from within. It comes from the

personal enjoyment and educational achievement that we derive from doing that

particular thing. For example for people who love music, their motivation to practice the

instrument, attend classes etc, is intrinsic motivation. Intrinsic motivation is crucial in

today's work environment. Research shows that it is a key factor in performance and

innovation. At a personal level, intrinsic motivation makes your work fulfilling. It's a

major reason for deciding to stay on a job. It helps keep your stress level down.

# VII. TECHNIQUES OF EMPLOYEE MOTIVATION

Job enlargement, job enrichment and job rotation are three basic approaches;

- 1. Job Enlargement:

Job enlargement involves expanding the job of an employee that has them

doing more work of a similar nature to what they already do. This may be allowing

them to complete the whole task instead of just part of it, for example, packaging the

products as well as manufacturing them. This process ideally removes the boredom out

of the job by eliminating the repetitiveness out of tasks and allowing them to complete

the whole process, further increasing their responsibility.

- 2. Job Enrichment:

Job enrichment is an attempt to give workers more control over their tasks and

more responsibility for design, execution, and output. The worker assumes some

of the functions previously carried out by his or her immediate supervisor or by other

# staff.

- 3. Job Rotation:

Job rotation is a practice whereby each employee learns several operations in

manufacturing process and rotates through each in a set period. Job rotation has

important implications for firm learning. On one hand, when employees rotate, the firm

receives information about the quality of various jobs - employee matches. On the other

hand, without rotation, the firm receives only direct information about one match, but the

information it gets about this one match is very reliable.

## VIII. POPULAR THEORIES OF WORKPLACE MOTIVATION

Two of the most popular models of motivation are Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

and Herzberg's two-factor model. Both are widely accepted and most recent research

builds on the ideas presented in these two models.

# Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Abraham Maslow presented his model of motivation in 1954. The basic idea of

Maslow's model was that there are five levels of needs for humans and each level needed

to be fulfilled before someone could be motivated by higher level factors. Figure 1 is a

# graphical example of Maslow's model.

According to Maslow, you wouldn't be able to motivate someone with positive feedback

(an esteem factor) if their basic physiological needs aren't met. This makes sense

if you apply it to the workplace. If someone doesn't get paid enough to put food on

the table for his or her family, he or she isn't going to care too much about a 'good job'

# Hierarchy of

# Herzberg's two-factor model

# 20 | P a g e

## Herzberg came up with one of the more popular motivation theories. He felt that

# certain conditions, or 'hygiene factors', had to be in place for employees to be satisfied,

# but

# these

did

# not

# necessarily

motivate the employees.

# Herzberg's two-

# factor model

For example, if an employee is working below the minimum wage, it is not

likely that he/she will be motivated until a perceived fair rate of pay is given. At the

same time, if an employee is well paid, Herzberg believed that a pay rise would not have

# a lasting motivational effect.

Herzberg suggested that once the hygiene factors were met, employers should

focus on recognizing the achievements of the employee and providing opportunities to

learn and grow. So the motivation theories of Maslow and Herzberg were similar in this

# regard.

# IX. CONCLUSION

Manager’s duties in today’s corporate world are multi-faceted. Not only do

managers need to be versed in finance, economics, and information systems; it is now

essential for them to have a firm grasp on organizational behavior and psychology. They

must know how their people think and what makes them do so. Making sure managers

are aware of this psychology is the job of the human resource department, but all

managers of the organization have a responsibility to understand it. A key aspect of

organizational psychology is motivation. Managers must know why their people

# behave the way they do, so that these buttons can be pushed at the manager’s discretion.

## A motivator is that which impels or compels an individual to act toward meeting

a need. Some major motivational theories will also be explored. Practical ways of

applying these theories to real people will be considered.

When looked upon the first time, the link between employee motivation

and performance seems to be quite obvious. That’s because every time when we deem a

task to be important and valuable to us, we act with a high level of dedication and

enthusiasm to its completion. However, the relationship between these two things is in

fact a lot more complex. With that in mind, managers need to find creative ways in

which to consistently keep their employees motivated as much as possible. Motivation

is very important for every company to improve the employee performance and

# productivity of the organization.
