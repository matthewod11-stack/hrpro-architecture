The day after Election Day is sure to be emotionally charged. In many

organizations, employees have a wide range of political opinions. While

some people may be feeling relieved or enthusiastic about the results,

others might be feeling angry or anxious. And people’s feelings might be

even more intense if the results are unclear or contested.

So, what do you say, if anything, to your team about it?

You might wish to avoid the topic, but experts say that recognizing

## the emotional atmosphere within your team and the broader mood

of the country is important. “Name the elephant in the room,” says

## Wendy Smith, a professor at the University of Delaware’s Alfred Lerner

## College of Business & Economics and the author of the book, Both/And

Thinking. “And acknowledge the emotional complexity and intensity of

# the moment.”

After a contentious election, “people want to feel heard,” says Paul

Argenti, a professor of corporate communication at Dartmouth’s Tuck

School of Business. As a leader, your role is to help make sure that

## happens in a positive and productive way.

Keep your comments brief, respectful, and focused, advises Dorie Clark,

who teaches at Columbia University School of Business and is the

author of The Long Game, among other books. “There will almost

certainly be people who are upset no matter the outcome, but you can’t

allow that to derail the work you’re doing or spill over and aﬀect other

employees,” she says. “Your goal as a leader is to ﬁnd a balance between

recognizing that people have feelings about the election results, and

remembering that the collective reason we’re all there is to get our jobs

done.”

Here’s what our experts recommend you say and do on Wednesday.

Choose your words carefully.

Setting the right tone is critical. “Your role as a leader is to ensure that

everyone feels comfortable coming to work,” Argenti says. Acknowledge

what’s happening in a tactful way. And your message may need to adapt

based on the outcome — whether it’s a decisive result or a period of

## uncertainty with recounts and disputes. For instance:

If there’s a clear winner, Clark recommends saying something like:

“Good morning, everyone. I imagine many of you stayed up late last

night, and we all likely have personal feelings about the results of

the election. Some of you may feel pleased, while others might be

very upset. I want to emphasize that one of our core values as an

organization is to be thoughtful and respectful toward one another.

Let’s all be mindful of how we express our feelings, recognizing the

diversity within our team. Regardless of how we each feel about politics,

there’s one thing we can all agree on: our commitment to creating a

## supportive and respectful work environment for our colleagues, as well

as delivering excellent products and services for our customers.”

If the outcome remains unclear and we face a prolonged period of

uncertainty, Clark advises acknowledging the tension and confusion

and then pivoting to your business needs. You might say: “It’s stressful

for all of us that there’s no clarity about the election results. No matter

how it ultimately turns out, having a deﬁnitive outcome would provide

some comfort, allowing us to strategize and paint a picture of what the

next four years might look like. For now, though, we ﬁnd ourselves in

a state of uncertainty, which can be uncomfortable. While we all want

certainty, it’s important to set those feelings aside for the moment so we

can be there for our colleagues and customers.”

# Project stability.

The day and week (and weeks) following the election are going to be

trying for all of us. Be patient with your team and with yourself, says

Smith. She recommends thinking about your leadership in terms of

## what Ronald Heifetz and Martin Linsky of the Harvard Kennedy School

coined as being “on the balcony” — looking at the bigger picture, rather

than being swept up on the dance ﬂoor in raw feelings.

“This is a moment that calls for compassion,” says Smith. Your team

members may be distraught, distracted, and preoccupied, but “you

yourself have to be on the balcony,” during moments like these. This

means keeping a clear head and staying above the emotional fray. You’re

not detached from the situation, but you’re able to hold perspective and

see beyond the immediate turmoil.

Smith suggests leaning on your community outside of work as a way

to process your emotions and navigate your own partisanship, allowing

you to keep these feelings separate from your professional life. Research

shows that, ironically, the more we attempt to reject, resist, or conceal our diﬃcult emotions, the more likely these feelings are to emerge in

unexpected and potentially disruptive ways. “The challenge is not to

avoid your emotions, but to not let them hijack your leadership,” she

says.

Even though the political landscape may feel chaotic and

overwhelming, strive to maintain a sense of steadiness. Argenti

recommends letting your team members know they can come to you

with any concerns related to the work environment, the economy, or the

organization, and that you want to be open and available for those who

need support. “If, say, people are worried about how the new president

will impact your industry, remind them that economic ﬂuctuations

occur under both administrations. Emphasize your organization’s

resilience by saying something like, ‘We’ve faced challenges before, and

we will adapt to whatever changes come our way.’”

“I don’t want to downplay the strong emotions on both sides,” Argenti

adds. “But in the end, life will go on. We’ll get through this.”
