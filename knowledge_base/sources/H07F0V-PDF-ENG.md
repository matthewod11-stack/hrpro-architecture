We all know that layoffs are hard. They create stress, worry, and

ﬁnancial instability, not to mention grief over a job that you loved, or

colleagues you miss. Unfortunately, layoﬀs are fairly common. In the

U.S., approximately 40 percent of Americans have been laid oﬀ at least

once in their career. You don’t even have to be laid oﬀ to feel anxious

about it; simply knowing that you could be next, or saying goodbye to

colleagues can spark layoﬀ anxiety.

If this is you, you’re probably worried about a lot of things: your

mortgage or rent, grocery bills, and a job hunt, among other things. And

the stress only compounds when we realize this impacts not just our

own life but also each member of our family. The stakes are particularly

high when it comes to your kids. How will your layoﬀ impact them? You

might suddenly be worried about paying for soccer registration—and

# perhaps the orthodontist bill, too.

Layoﬀs, we must remember, are a family aﬀair. And facing the painful

reality of job loss as a family is necessary. This doesn’t mean your four-

year-old needs to know the details of your household budget, or that

your pre-teen needs to worry about transferring to a new (unknown)

school. But it does mean approaching conversations, and any problems

you have, in a clear and age-appropriate manner. Here are seven things

you can do to help your family weather a job loss together.

# Prepare for the Conversation

You’ll need to tell your family that you’ve lost your job, and probably

pretty quickly. Your emotions are likely raw, and you probably will

still feel very worried about what’s taking place. This is an exceedingly diﬃcult time to talk about what’s happened because the conversation

can quickly veer in a direction you weren’t intending. This is especially

true when kids throw curveball statements you don’t expect or ask a

question you can’t answer.

The best thing to do is to decide ahead of time what your goal of the

conversation is, what you are willing to share, and also what would be

better left unsaid. (You and your partner might game this out together.)

For example, while you might have real concerns about making your

mortgage payments, there is no reason to bring up the possibility of

having to sell the house if that is not a present reality. Think about what

would be beneﬁcial to tell the family without causing them unnecessary

# stress.

# Be Age-Appropriate

A conversation with a four-year-old will obviously be very diﬀerent

than one with a teenager. With younger kids, terminology matters a

lot. Try to speak in terms they understand — something like “Mom won’t be going into the oﬃce for a little while.” And try to avoid certain

## phrases. Ellen Galinsky, president and founder of the Families and

Work Institute in New York, warns that children might hear “I got ﬁred”

and think of guns. She also points out that “laid oﬀ” doesn’t hold any

meaning for most little kids.

Older kids, however, have a more nuanced understanding of the

implications of job loss. And don’t be surprised if they have a lot of

follow-up questions about how they will be impacted. At the same time,

realize it might take a while for their questions to come out. Reassure

them their questions are welcome at any time.

# Be Authentic

Your instinct might be to conceal what you’re feeling in an eﬀort to

protect the kids, but it’s actually healthy for them to talk about real

emotions. As clinical psychologist Dr. Julie Futrell explains, they know

if what you’re telling them doesn’t match the emotions they are sensing.

When parents model honest emotions, kids have an opportunity to see

mom and dad as human and to witness resiliency and healthy coping

mechanisms. You should share what you’re feeling, why, and how you

are managing those feelings. So you might say, “Daddy feels really sad

today. And it’s ok to feel sad. But I’m going to be alright and will do what

it takes to get back to feeling happy.”

Just a quick word of caution: Do not look to children for emotional

support. That’s not their role. Maintain a strict boundary and instead

surround yourself with trusted adults who can provide emotional

# support.

# Develop a Family Mantra

A layoﬀ can be a teachable moment. Think together about what deﬁnes you and how you face hard times. Make that a positive aﬃrmation about

who you are as a family. For example, “We are Colemans and we can do

hard things together.”

Studies show that these positive aﬃrmations change neural pathways

and light up the reward center of the brain. This also gives your kids

a sense of stability and teamwork. You’re in it together. You’ll ﬁgure it

# out.

# Be Consistent

Children thrive with a stable family routine. While modiﬁcations might

be necessary, keeping the week as “normal” as possible increases the

# sense of safety and security.

# Make Necessary Changes as a Family

While consistency is a goal, some lifestyle changes will likely be

necessary. Take the opportunity to involve the kids in brainstorming

and developing budget suggestions. Appropriate topics might be

thinking through the grocery budget, Christmas spending, weekend

activities, or a clothing allowance. This is a chance for everyone to

think outside of the box. What fun meals could you create together on

a budget? Develop a list of unique activities that are wallet-friendly.

A quick internet search pulls up countless creative ideas. Engaging

everyone gives the whole family a sense of control while also teaching

kids ﬁnancial skills they will use in the future.

# Serve Together

Research shows that service to others can help the participants to see

beyond their own situations and pain, so ﬁnding ways to volunteer

together can be hugely beneﬁcial. (And also, it’s free!) When done as a

family, the experience oﬀers quality time together, creates memories,

## and teaches children valuable lessons about altruism and compassion.

It has also been shown to make people happier.

# Teaching Resilience for the Long Haul

Remember, layoﬀs are common. This may be your ﬁrst time handling

one, or maybe you’ve been here before. Think back on your own

childhood: Do you remember one of your parents being laid oﬀ? If you

do, you probably remember how your family handled it. Now consider

your own children: How will they remember this experience? While no

one expects to look back on a layoﬀ fondly, this season doesn’t have to

sink an individual or devastate a family. But in fact, the experience can

be used to bind your family closer together and teach valuable lessons.

It’s an opportunity to model grit, resilience, positivity, and

perseverance. Having to model these traits might even make you feel

them yourself, and that can even help you land your next job.
