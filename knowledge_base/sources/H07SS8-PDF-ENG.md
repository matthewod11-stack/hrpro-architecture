One of the most lauded leadership characteristics today is the ability

to pivot — to change course quickly when a planned path is blocked

or revealed to be disadvantageous. This kind of rapid adaptation, often

referred to as agility, is critical in a fast-changing environment or when

innovating in unknown territory where old behaviors and management

practices no longer work. It’s considered by some to be a leadership

# superpower.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Avoid the Churn That Comes with Agility

Any leadership superpower, however, can become a weakness. When

leaders change course on projects frequently, their people can become

confused about what they are supposed to do (or at least need to spend

time re-planning and addressing the change), introducing ineﬃciency

and churn and impeding progress. It’s also demotivating: It’s like

telling someone to run north, then south, then north, and then south

again. After reversing direction so many times, the smart move for an

employee is to stand still until the leader ﬁgures it out.

The solution to this problem can’t simply be to “reduce agility.” Leaders

in these cases are largely doing the right thing in the face of fast-

changing conditions and high degrees of uncertainty. Rather than stay

committed to a path that might lead to a dead end or waste the

company’s time and resources, they’re pivoting their teams to what they

think will be a more productive direction, and then doing it again and

# again if necessary.

Based on my years of experience advising ﬁrms on innovation and eﬃciency, I believe that to counter the negative eﬀects of these changes, leaders guiding their teams through pivots should better diﬀerentiate

means and ends: They should be able to articulate an end goal that stays

constant even as the means to get there change.

Let’s look at two examples. At a tech venture that I advised, the

founder had created his core product through lots of experimentation

and improvisation, trying one thing after another until it became clear

what worked. As the company grew to over 100 engineers with multiple project teams all building oﬀ of the original product design, however,

the founder’s desire to keep improvising and shifting directions became more of a liability than a strength. One manager described the eﬀect as a

## type of paralysis where everyone just waits for the next instruction. “No

one is willing to take any initiative,” she said, “since whatever we do is

probably going to be changed.”

This dynamic of over-agility is an issue for small startups and large

companies alike. Several years ago, I worked with a multibillion dollar

personal care company that had made three midsized acquisitions as

a way of diversifying their product portfolio. Because each of these

acquisitions included well-known brands, the CEO planned to leave

them alone to operate as wholly owned but independent entities. But

after a few months, under pressure from the board to extract more

synergistic value from the acquisitions, he changed course and asked

his corporate functions (HR, ﬁnance, and so on) to align the acquired

entities’ processes and systems with those of the core company. But

having people from all the corporate functions descend on the acquired ﬁrms proved to be disruptive, so he then backed oﬀ and told the

corporate functions to just pick one or two systems to standardize.

By this time, the managers of the acquired entities were completely

confused about what their owners really wanted and told their people to

just sit tight and not do anything until things became clearer.

In both of the cases cited here, and in many other instances of over-

agility, leaders pay so much attention to the means of achieving a goal

that they (and their teams) lose focus on the end result. In the tech

startup, the founder wanted the experiments to reveal new product

opportunities but didn’t make clear his vision for the next generation

## of products. In the absence of a clear product vision, all possibilities

were valid. Similarly, in the personal care company, the CEO never

articulated an overarching goal for the integration of the newly acquired

ﬁrms. In fact, it seemed that he was making it up as he went along

and changing the goal depending on the reactions he was getting from

investors, his team, and the managers of the acquired ﬁrms. Little

wonder that this generated confusion among the people who needed

to execute.

The good news here is that the over-focus on “means” and under-focus

on “ends” is correctable, once the leader realizes that this is what’s

happening. It’s a matter of both goal-setting and communication. At

the tech company, the founder ultimately received strong feedback from

his team that the constant engineering changes meant that the teams

weren’t sure what they were supposed to do. In response, he worked

with his team to create parameters for what the next product should

look like — and then left the teams more space to ﬁgure out how to get

there. Today the teams are more productive and conﬁdent that they are

on a path to building a new product that will be commercially viable.

At the personal care company, the CEO, realizing that the company was

not getting the expected return on investment from its acquisitions,

asked the head of business development to do a brief study about how

the company should integrate new companies. One key conclusion was

that there should be a more speciﬁc goal and vision for each entity post-

acquisition — and that the integration team would then be empowered

to ﬁnd the right pathways to meet that goal. This approach was then

applied to the three acquisitions.

For example, one of the acquired companies had strong market share

## and brand recognition in a particular product category, so the goal that

the team developed was to accelerate this category’s growth. Early in the

integration process, however, the team realized that they were in danger

of losing much of the talent that came with the acquisition if they

continued to force everyone to follow the processes and methods of the

new owner. This would have put the growth goal in jeopardy because

the experience of this team was necessary to build on the success of the

category. So they changed course: Instead of integrating the acquisition

into the parent company, they adopted a “reverse acquisition” approach

in which some of the parent company’s people would report to the

acquired company’s management team. But the ultimate goal —

growing success in the core category — stayed the same. Managers were

no longer confused or demoralized, and eventually this new division

exceeded the growth expectations that were envisioned early on.

. . .

If you are on a project, or leading a project, that seems to be constantly thrown oﬀ by changing course, then step back and ask the following

question: Are we clear about our end-goal — the outcome we need to

achieve — and do we feel that our changes are getting us closer to that

goal? If the answer is not an emphatic “yes,” then you may need to work

on better deﬁning and communicating your goals so that your agility doesn’t get in the way of your eﬀectiveness.
