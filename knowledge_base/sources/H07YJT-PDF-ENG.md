Performance reviews are typically not the highlight of anyone’s to-do

list. Throw in a ﬂaky, shaky economy and a couple of rough quarters,

and they’re even less appealing. You want your employees to come away

motivated and enthusiastic about their work. But when business is slow,

they also need a clear understanding of how they contribute to the

company’s bottom line.

## So, how can you objectively assess individual performance when your

organization isn’t doing so hot? What can you do to inspire your team in

## the absence of typical incentives like raises and promotions? And how

can you balance realistic expectations for the future while also fostering

# a sense of leaderly optimism?

# What the Experts Say

Performance evaluations aren’t just tedious professional chores; they’re

also stress-inducing conversations that bring together high stakes,

## intense emotions, and a healthy dose of personal ego all in one

conference room (or Zoom, as the case may be). It’s no wonder then that

“end-of-year reviews are universally hated” by managers and employees

alike, according to Karen Sedatole, a professor at Emory’s Goizueta

Business School. “It’s uncomfortable for supervisors to give feedback

and corrective advice, and it’s not all that much fun for employees

to receive it,” she says. “And when things are bad from a ﬁnancial

standpoint, these tensions are exacerbated.”

The key is to be “very clear up front” about the challenges facing

the business and how they’ve aﬀected your employees’ goals and

expectations, says Tonushree Mondal, who runs a boutique HR

consulting ﬁrm. “If you’ve been realistic throughout the year, there

shouldn’t be any surprises,” she says. Your aim is not only to review

the past year but also to equip your employees for potential challenges

in the coming one. Here are some strategies to ensure a constructive

# discussion.

Prepare. Conducting a thoughtful performance review requires some

groundwork and reﬂection on your part, according to Mondal. “Too

often managers go from meeting to meeting without clear purpose,” she

says. “But for these conversations, you need to be prepared with written

# evidence.”

Outline your employee’s achievements—be it a successful project or an

adept handling of a demanding client—and make note of any areas

for improvement. Seek input from colleagues who work closely with

your employee, too. Preparation is paramount regardless of the state of

the economy, but in tougher times, providing accurate and insightful

feedback becomes all the more crucial, she says.

Provide a reality check. Dwelling on the economy might not

## feel like a productive (or even particularly pleasant) way to

start the conversation, but Sedatole recommends framing the

## performance review conversation within the broader economic context.

“Acknowledge that there are factors that drive performance that are

outside the control of the employee and the organization,” she says.

Be pragmatic but also supportive. “Say: ‘These are the realities of the

environment that we have to weather and we are in this together.’”

Talking about the challenges of the rocky economy also allows you

to provide context for changes, for instance, “why the bonus pool is

lower this year,” says Mondal. Hopefully, this open communication

has been ongoing, and you’ve “recalibrated expectations based on

macroeconomic circumstances throughout the year,” she adds.

Help connect dots. Helping your team members understand how the

wider economy aﬀects the company’s performance is a good ﬁrst step.

Next, you need to guide them to see how their speciﬁc roles ﬁt into

the organization’s long term goals. “You want to make them think like

the business,” says Mondal. As the conversation progresses, Sedatole

suggests talking about how your employee’s day-to-day tasks and

projects contributed to the organization’s ﬁnancial results. Connecting

those dots allows them to more clearly “see how what they did over the

past year supported or undermined what the company achieved,” she

says. Last year’s performance is in the books, but having this clarity

fuels future improvement. It also strengthens your employee’s sense

of purpose and commitment, and helps them see how to align their

priorities in the coming year with the organization’s objectives, she says.

Think like a coach. These discussions tend to be straightforward with

high-performing employees, but for those not performing at their best

expect some pushback or justiﬁcations for their performance. Sedatole

says that while you must “avoid making your employees feel penalized

or held accountable for things they don’t have any control over,” it’s

crucial to address their mistakes.

Mondal suggests adopting the approach of a football coach debrieﬁng

with a player after a challenging game played in bad weather. The player

might complain about the snow and the slippery ﬁeld, she says. “And as

a coach you need to say, ‘Yes, the conditions were tough. Here are three

things you did well during the game, and here are two things you could

have done better.’” By acknowledging what they did right under the

circumstances, but also where they can improve, you strike a balance

between recognition and constructive criticism. And remember: “If a

player is not doing well, it’s the coach’s responsibility to deal with it,”

she says.

Be transparent when addressing underperformance. How you

deal with an employee who’s consistently underperformed over the

year depends on many factors, including the nature of the job,

the employees’ capabilities, their willingness to improve, and your

bandwidth to support them and get back on track.

## In an uncertain economy, there’s often less patience for

underperformers, which is why Sedatole recommends frankness during

the performance review. “Don’t make promises you can’t keep,” when

it comes to matters of job security, though whether or not it comes to

that is another issue altogether. “You don’t want to unnecessarily alarm

people, but transparency is important,” she says.

Performance reviews oﬀer a prime opportunity to address exactly

where your employee is falling short of expectations. Oﬀer support and

encouragement where merited. “It can feel personal,” says Mondal. “But

a mediocre or poor review doesn’t make them a bad person; they’ve just

had a bad year.” It’s your job to “help them see it as part of their long

# term career trajectory.”

Explore non-monetary means of motivation. During tough times, your

role is not only to motivate and inspire your team members, but also

to keep them from becoming demoralized about the lack of raises and

promotions on the table. It’s disheartening when their year of hard work

and accomplishments are overshadowed by the business’s struggles.

“You might be thinking, ‘How do I keep people motivated when they’re

not going to get a bonus?’” says Sedatole. Thankfully, research is on

your side. “There are lots of ways to make people happy in their roles

by improving other aspects of their jobs,” she says. Studies suggest that

giving employees autonomy, growth experiences, and meaningful work

can be powerful motivational tools. During reviews, Sedatole suggests

asking your employees what would increase their job satisfaction. Some

might be interested in mentorship opportunities and cross-company

projects that oﬀer exposure to new disciplines and colleagues. Others

might care most about ﬂexible work hours and locations.

Pay special attention to your stars. Listen carefully to answers from

your star employees, says Mondal. “Your high potentials and top

performers are especially in need of inspiration,” she says. “They are

motivated by a steep learning curve. When they get bored, their curve

ﬂattens so you need to get creative and keep it at a steep angle.”

Mondal notes that stretch assignments and new challenges are highly

motivating. Explore, too, ways that you can help increase people’s

# visibility to senior leaders.

As you talk through possibilities, it’s important to emphasize that even

if a promotion isn’t imminent, opportunities for advancement will arise

once the economy rebounds. “Give them a sense that they play a critical

role in helping the organization pull through and when things do turn

around, they will personally beneﬁt,” she says. “If they can stick it out

and ride the surf, they can become future business leaders and grow

# within the company.”

End on positive note. Yes, the economy’s uncertain. True, your

competitors are giving you a run for your money. But as the manager,

your job is to rally your team members and inspire them for the year

ahead, says Sedatole.

Wrap up the review on an optimistic note. Don’t be glib, but emphasize

that economic shifts are cyclical. Show gratitude for their hard work

and remind them of “their true north star,” whether it’s delivering

top-notch services or products to customers or coming up with

innovative solutions to problems or creating a supportive work culture.

Recognition matters too, adds Sedatole. “Make sure they understand

that they are valued,” she says. “Tell them: ‘Your work matters and

# here’s why.’”

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Foster a pragmatic, supportive tone to the conversation by

acknowledging challenging economic conditions and the external

# factors beyond your employee’s control.

- Strengthen your employee’s sense of purpose by helping them

understand how their day-to-day tasks impact the company’s overall

# performance.

- Explore alternative means of motivation by oﬀering autonomy, growth

experiences, recognition, meaningful work, and increased ﬂexibility.

# Don’t:

- Be unprepared. Before the review, reﬂect on your employee’s

performance—the good and the bad—and ask other colleagues for

# their input.

- Blame your employee for factors beyond their control. Instead,

adopt a coaching role that balances recognizing achievements with

highlighting areas for improvement.

- End the conversation on a sour note. Show gratitude for their hard

work and remind them of why they are valued.
