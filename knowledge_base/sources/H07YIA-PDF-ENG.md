Advancing in a career can come with a variety of beneﬁts — the

more expert one becomes, the more one is sought out for guidance

and perspective. Invitations to give talks, serve in leadership roles, and

weigh in on big decisions begin to accumulate. And before long, others

come to you with requests for mentorship as they embark on their own

# journeys.

## Over time, however, the barrage of requests for mentorship from junior

members of the team can become distracting, tedious, and a source of

burnout, particularly when such interactions go unrecognized by your

organization. This is a phenomenon particularly familiar to those in

demographics underrepresented in the higher tiers of a profession.

Managing mentorship and preventing burnout requires speciﬁc tactics

for success. In this article, we present ﬁve solutions based on years

## of experience mentoring undergraduates, graduate students, post-

graduate trainees, and young faculty that have culminated in the

## creation of team-based mentorship programs in our ﬁelds. These ﬁve

strategies will help you actively manage mentorships more eﬃciently

# and sustainably throughout your career.

- 1. Divide your mentees into teams.

When mentoring numerous individuals at once, it is easy to feel

compelled to take complete responsibility for each mentee. However,

the cumulative burden can become overwhelming. This challenge can

be overcome by organizing mentees into subgroups consisting of three

to four mentees with varying degrees of experience and led by the

## mentee with the greatest expertise within the team.

Creating mentee teams enables them to operate semi-autonomously.

For example, teams can meet on their own on a scheduled basis.

More senior or experienced members of the team can help mentor

less-experienced members. Senior members beneﬁt from this structure

by learning how to properly mentor early on in their careers, while

less-experienced members beneﬁt from having a “go to” person they can

# easily access.

Although you are still responsible for mentoring each individual

long-term, creating subgroups allows you to mentor more eﬃciently

by creating a team-based support structure for everyone, delegating

day-to-day career development questions to each sub-group leader,

and protecting time to foster higher-level discussions with individual

mentees when needed.

We have found that mentees prefer these team-based mentorship

models because it increases their access to a larger pool of advisors and supports learning more eﬀectively while still giving them the

conﬁdence that they are under the watchful eye of an expert. It also

allows you to identify members of your team well suited to become

# future managers and leaders.

- 2. Set expectations with mentees early.

Working with a great mentee is rewarding for everyone. Conversely, a

mentee who does not follow through on expectations or whose vision

does not align with yours exacerbates mentor fatigue. The lack of

objective guidelines on when to end a mentor-mentee relationship adds

# to the challenge.

One way to standardize this process is to create a mentorship

contract for each mentee outlining your expectations. Communicating

expectations clearly from the beginning can prevent onboarding of

uncommitted mentees. Examples of expectations include timing of

response to emails, frequency of meetings, and speciﬁc areas that are “oﬀ limits” for discussion. Another approach to standardizing

your hiring and ﬁring practices is to give mentees a set number

of opportunities to demonstrate their commitment based on the

established expectations. The number of opportunities granted is determined by you, which oﬀers ﬂexibility in your approach to

# everyone.

For example, if you are committed to supporting women or people

of color, you might allocate more “mentee missed opportunities”

before ending the mentorship relationship. Separately, for someone less

promising, you might provide fewer opportunities. A failure to execute

the set number of opportunities gives you data that can support your

decision to cut ties with a mentee. This approach requires investment

up front to administer tasks that give the mentee the opportunity to

prove themselves — or not. Preserve yourself for those who follow

through on these tasks, and end the relationship with those who do not.

- 3. Use technology to your advantage.

For mentors who receive a high volume of mentorship requests,

technology can be used to promote eﬃciency during introductory

meetings. Having a ﬁxed time and web-based signup for meetings

during oﬃce hours every month will reduce the burden of scheduling,

and multiple mentees can meet with you at the same time. Such group

meetings also allow mentees to learn from each other and help them

make additional networking relationships.

You can also use technology to your advantage by recording videos of

your answers to frequently asked questions. Sending these videos out

prior to oﬃce hours increases the depth of conversations and serves as

an initial test of commitment. Posting this content on your website or

social media expands your reach.

- 4. Brand your efforts.

While many agree that developing the next generation of talent is

invaluable, most institutions do not formally recognize the time and

energy invested in mentorship in the form of ﬁnancial incentives or promotions. One way to overcome this is to brand your eﬀorts

strategically so that it aligns with key institutional priorities.

In our experience, passionate mentees are the best form of local and even national reputation building. Branding your eﬀorts by

highlighting your mentees online using social media is one approach;

this can also serve as an indirect but eﬀective tool for recruitment

of additional talent. Showcasing the successes of your mentees

within your organization can amplify your team’s ideas and status.

Establishing your reputation as someone capable of building a pipeline

of excellence is priceless.

- 5. Hold organizations accountable.

A true commitment to diversity, equity, and inclusion comes from

investment in grass roots initiatives focused on mentorship. As such,

organizations must provide dedicated time and funding for meaningful

# mentorship.

To promote equal access to opportunity and investment in such

obligations, institutions must recruit a diverse body of mentors and

avoid preferentially assigning unpaid tasks to underrepresented, early-

or mid-career managers (or, in the case of academic institutions,

faculty). Next, institutions must formulate objective metrics for

evaluating mentorship. Finally, it is important for them to dedicate

ﬁnancial resources to support and develop good mentors. Online

## educational modules and ill-deﬁned team-building activities will never

generate the return on investment that proper mentorship can.

By the end of our careers, we realize that our legacy is ﬁrmly rooted in

the relationships we have nurtured and the careers we have cultivated.

But in order to achieve those end-of-career goals, we must enhance the

current state of mentorship to make it more palatable, eﬃcient, and

## practical for both mentors and mentees alike.
