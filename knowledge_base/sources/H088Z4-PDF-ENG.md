## In the aftermath of George Floyd’s murder and the national reckoning

around racial injustice in 2020, many companies redoubled their

commitment to increase the diversity of their workforce. New practices

and policies were introduced to help reach diversity goals set by

leadership, and for quite a few, this commitment was broadcast widely:

centered in a CEO speech, a press release, a company town hall, on

## social media, or in internal messages to employees.

But as the months and years passed, and despite these public

## commitments and changes to policies and procedures, many

organizations have struggled to increase racial diversity.

These companies might seek to keep a lack of progress quiet. Revealing

lagging diversity numbers could lead people to view the organization

negatively, tarnishing its reputation. It could erode the credibility of

their professed commitment to diversity in the eyes of employees,

clients, suppliers, investors, and the general public — or provoke a

ﬁrestorm on social media, enrage activist groups, and be plastered in

unﬂattering news headlines. The recent backlash against DEI eﬀorts playing out across the U.S. is likely to aﬃrm the beneﬁts of not talking

# about diversity struggles.

To date, this silence has been the norm. As of January 2021,

## approximately 95% of the largest organizations in the U.S. — many of

whom publicly committed to increasing diversity — did not disclose the

diversity of their workforce to the public. And that’s not because they

didn’t have the data. In fact, for most large organizations, numerical

## breakdowns of their workforce data by race/ethnicity, gender, and job

categories are readily available because they are required to collect

and conﬁdentially report them annually to the U.S. Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission (for example, in EEO-1 reports). They did not

disclose the data because they chose not to.

In many ways, this is an entirely reasonable approach. Previous research

on impression management in organizations suggests that disclosing

negative information can be costly to an organization’s reputation

and may deter prospective applicants. However, this conventional

wisdom may not apply to the realm of diversity. In fact, our research

suggests that being transparent about companies’ struggles to increase diversity may actually enhance — not erode — their reputation. Why?

## Because such transparency signals the genuineness and strength of

their commitment, which is elusive in this arena.

## Why Disclosing a Lack of Progress Can be Beneficial

People are often deeply skeptical of organizations’ professed

commitments to diversity. Is it a PR stunt, “window dressing,” or plain

old BS? They question the authenticity of statements regarding diversity

because they could just as easily be chalked up to a superﬁcial eﬀort to

## portray an organization in a positive light.

When organizations that pledged to increase diversity later elect to

voluntarily disclose their lagging diversity numbers, however, people

may be hard-pressed to classify them as phonies attempting to augment

their image. After all, they are publicly disclosing unfavorable data.

Why would they do such a thing? This certainly is not consistent with

a performative act intended to hearten their reputation. Rather, being

transparent about unfavorable outcomes signals that organizations’

commitment to strengthening diversity is real.

This logic may seem counterintuitive, but consider how disclosure

## works in the context of interpersonal relationship building. We

know from decades of research that when people disclose personal

information, they are more apt to be liked and trusted. One reason for

this is that when we disclose sensitive information that exposes our

vulnerabilities, we communicate something more profound than the

content of the information itself — that we are willing to be genuine

even if means taking a risk. In the case of lagging diversity numbers,

## the act of transparency signals something beyond the particulars of

numerical representation. It signals that the organization is genuinely

committed to the goal of advancing diversity because they are willing to

be honest about their current standing, even if its risky to do so.

To examine this logic, in one study, we obtained real EEO-1 reports

— the previously mentioned numerical breakdowns of the racial- and

gender-makeup of companies by job category, including aggregated

totals from the previous year — from 30 large companies like Apple,

Chevron, Costco, Netﬂix, and Starbucks that were publicly disclosed

in 2021. Generally, these reports revealed low levels of racial and

ethnic diversity, particularly in senior management. The reports also

revealed that companies generally struggled to increase diversity from

# the previous year.

How would disclosing these unfavorable EEO-1 reports change how

people viewed these companies? We recruited a diverse sample of 2,000

people from the U.S. and asked half of them to share their impressions

of the company after seeing their respective EEO-1 reports. For the other

half of the people, we asked them to evaluate the companies but never

disclosed or made mention of their diversity numbers. We found clear

evidence that disclosing unfavorable EEO-1 reports led companies to

be viewed more positively than not disclosing them at all. Speciﬁcally,

people viewed these companies as more genuinely committed to

diversity and more trustworthy. They also reported being more likely

to say that they would promote this company’s diversity eﬀorts to their

network. Perhaps most striking, we asked people to what degree they

thought the company had made progress in their eﬀort to increase

diversity. People viewed the company that had disclosed the negative

data as having made signiﬁcantly more progress than those that had

never disclosed a single ﬁgure. The act of transparency meaningfully

changed the way in which people understood the company’s struggles

# and true motives.

In another study, we investigated the reputational eﬀects of disclosing

diversity data when these data were good or bad. We asked 819 working

adults to consider a case in which their own company had committed

to increasing diversity. We then presented people with one of two

ﬁgures that visually depicted the change in the representation of

racial/ethnic minorities in the year following this commitment. Half of

people saw a positive trend, which portrayed an eight percentage-point

increase, while the other half saw a line depicting zero change in the

representation of minorities over the same time period. But there was

one other wrinkle in the study: we told half the people in this study that

it was the company who decided to disclose these diversity data, but

told other half that it was a colleague in HR who privately showed them

these data (thus implying it was not the company’s decision to disclose

# this information).

The results were remarkable. When the diversity data were good, people

viewed the organization positively — and this was true regardless

of whether they had elected to be transparent in disclosing this or

not. However, when the diversity data showed no increase, a diﬀerent

pattern emerged: people were far more likely to view the organization

positively when it had transparently disclosed the stagnant diversity

numbers than when it had chosen not to. The results indicated

that people felt that the organization’s transparency about its lagging

diversity numbers signaled a genuine commitment to diversity, which

in turn, led them to take both the organization and its apparent

# struggles in good faith.

# The Limits of Disclosure

Our research points to the underappreciated beneﬁts to being open

about a lack of progress around diversity, but there are likely limits

to any feelings of goodwill. For example, it’s probably the case that

the presumption of best intentions has an expiration date. People will

not give organizations that disclose poor diversity numbers the beneﬁt

of the doubt forever. In the long run, an organization’s reputation

regarding diversity will hinge on its ability to actually deliver on its

goals. Transparency is not a tactic; it a signal that the company is

committed to their goals for better or worse.

It’s also important to consider what our ﬁndings mean in the current

climate of increased DEI backlash. Following the recent U.S. Supreme

## Court ruling that Harvard and the University of North Carolina cannot

use race as a factor in admissions, many companies have become

increasingly concerned about lawsuits challenging the legality of their

## DEI eﬀorts. In response to these pressures, many companies will likely

change how they approach setting diversity goals. For example, they

may shift to language anchored on “aspirational” future targets (e.g., to

get 50/50 male/female management by 2026) versus terminology that

could be construed as a hard-and-fast hiring mandate (e.g., to hire 15

# female managers this year).

Consider, for instance, how Johnson & Johnson communicates their

## aspirational targets (or KPIs) for various diversity dimensions and then

candidly reﬂects on the diﬀering degrees of progress they have made

## over the past year in relation to these longer-term objectives. The

current climate is likely to compel companies to more carefully consider

how they formulate and communicate their diversity goals in similar

ways, but this is unlikely to change the important role that transparency

and genuineness play when reﬂecting on a company’s progress towards

# these goals.

The prospect of publicly disclosing a lack of progress towards diversity

goals is likely unnerving for many. But maybe leaders’ intuitions about

the costs of transparency in this context are misplaced. Contemporary

leaders likely underestimate how meaningful it is to their employees,

customers, and a broader web of stakeholders to show that they have

the conviction to own their diversity struggles — and to hold themselves

accountable to making good on their commitments.
