Every leader faces challenges like establishing credibility, managing

up, and building strategic relationships when they start a new role. One

of the most sensitive and critical challenges is giving feedback, which

can feel like walking a tightrope: You haven’t had the chance to build

credibility with your new team, but you’re under pressure to prove your

value quickly. Moving too fast can lead to missteps, while waiting too

long risks inaction and meaningful opportunities lost.

## HBR / Digital Article / 4 Strategies to Help New Leaders Give Feedback

As a former C-Level executive turned CEO and executive coach, I’ve

faced this challenge ﬁrsthand and have supported many leaders in

navigating this critical phase. Here are four strategies to help new

leaders approach feedback with conﬁdence and clarity.

- 1. Assess the landscape.

A few weeks into his new role, I met Barry*, a divisional CFO, for an

executive coaching session focused on helping him maximize his early

impact. He reﬂected on a pattern from earlier in his career: his tendency

to act quickly in new roles, an approach that had created resistance and

strained relationships.

As a new leader, it’s tempting to jump straight into action, pushing for

quick wins to demonstrate your value. But without understanding the

broader context, even the most well-intentioned moves can backﬁre.

To navigate this tension between speed and context, new leaders can

beneﬁt from creating a structured learning plan across four domains:

technical, interpersonal, cultural, and political. This framework, drawn

from Michael Watkins’ The First 90 Days, helps leaders explore not just

systems and roles, but also values, norms, informal power structures,

and hidden dynamics. Within each domain, ask questions about the

past (What’s led to this team’s success—or setbacks?), the present (Who’s

inﬂuential? What’s the team’s operating rhythm?), and the future (What

changes are on the horizon? What barriers exist?).

You’ll rarely have complete clarity, but after you’ve triangulated

perspectives across diﬀerent levels and sources, the picture starts

to sharpen. If multiple people are raising similar themes and

that is consistent with what you observe, you’re likely on ﬁrmer

ground. The goal isn’t to gather all the information, but to gather

enough to give feedback that is informed, contextualized, and

constructive. Understanding the landscape—beyond the data—allows

you to deliver feedback that is informed and eﬀective. It helps you avoid

missteps that can erode trust before it’s built.

As he started his new role, Barry made a personal commitment to

notice his instinct to move quickly and take more deliberate action.

That opportunity came quickly when he noticed that his head of

accounting, Luis, lacked the strategic capabilities required for the role.

Avoiding his ﬁrst instinct to deliver tough feedback immediately, Barry

gathered more context. Over the next couple of weeks, he observed

team interactions, asked thoughtful questions, and sought input from

Luis’s peers. He learned that Luis was a 17-year company veteran who

was widely respected, collaborative, and instrumental in mentoring

younger talent. With this broader understanding, Barry delivered

candid feedback about the skill gap and oﬀered a transition into a

newly created role that honored Luis’s strengths while addressing the

# business’s needs.

- 2. Fast-track trust.

To ensure your feedback is not just heard but acted upon, you need

to build a foundation of trust. While trust naturally builds over time,

exceptional leaders take deliberate steps to fast-track it.

One strategy I recommend is inspired by Patrick Lencioni’s The Five

Dysfunctions of a Team, which emphasizes that vulnerability is a core

building block of trust. You could practice this by sharing your greatest

## strengths with your team along with the potential “dark sides” of

those strengths. For example, decisiveness can sometimes manifest

as impatience, while collaboration can inadvertently lead to slower

decision-making. When leaders acknowledge these inherit downsides

of their strengths, they signal to the team that it’s safe to be imperfect

# and self-aware.

I facilitated this exercise with a newly restructured leadership

team seeking to build trust and improve collaboration. Each leader

shared their top strengths and the downsides when those strengths

were overused or misapplied. Because everyone participated, the

vulnerability felt derisked. The result was faster trust, deeper

understanding, and a foundation for more candid feedback going

# forward.

By modeling openness and creating intentional moments of

vulnerability, leaders lay the groundwork for psychological safety,

making future feedback more likely to be received with openness and

# goodwill.

- 3. Understand your team members’ aspirations.

## In your ﬁrst few weeks, schedule one-on-one meetings with your direct

reports that are focused on getting to know them, their aspirations,

and their perspectives. What motivates them? What are their career

aspirations? What kind of support do they need from you to thrive? Ask

them about their best bosses and what those leaders did to help them

succeed. These conversations lay the groundwork for trust and make

future feedback easier to deliver, as it can be positioned around helping

them achieve their goals.

When my client Divya became the head of global sales, she

scheduled one-on-one career talks with each team member. During one

conversation Maria, a top-performing regional sales leader, shared her

ambition to one day lead a larger sales organization.

A few weeks later, Divya noticed that Maria tended to dominate

discussions in team meetings, unintentionally stiﬂing input from

others. When Divya gave her feedback, she framed it in terms of Maria’s

goals: “Leading on a larger stage will mean fostering collaboration and

creating space for others’ ideas to shine. Let’s work on strategies to

build that skill now.” Maria took the feedback to heart. In subsequent

meetings, she shifted her approach—asking more questions, drawing

out quieter voices, and consistently enrolling her team before oﬀering

her own perspective. When Divya checked in with a few of Maria’s

colleagues, they shared that they felt more heard and included. By

aligning feedback with Maria’s aspirations, Divya made it easier to

receive and more motivating to act on.

- 4. Set aside your ego.

It’s natural for a new leader to want to prove they were the right hire. But

this can lead to an ego-driven feedback trap, such as being overly blunt or aggressive to score quick wins, or overly passive to avoid ruﬄing

feathers. Exceptional leaders understand that you can be clear and

direct while showing care and respect— it’s not an either/or choice.

Take my client Michael, a recently promoted director at a tech startup.

One of his senior engineers, Shana, had missed several deadlines,

putting a key product launch at risk. Michael couldn’t avoid addressing

the issue, but he also didn’t want to come across as harsh in his

ﬁrst major feedback conversation. In their one-on-one, he began by

acknowledging Shana’s expertise and her signiﬁcant contributions to

past successes. Then, he shared his observations: “Shana, I’ve noticed

the missed deadlines on your recent deliverables. I know you’re

committed to the success of this product, and I want to make sure you

have what you need to get back on track. Can you share what’s been

challenging, and let’s talk about how I can support you?”

This combination of direct feedback and empathetic inquiry led to

an honest conversation. Shana explained that a new process had

created bottlenecks in her workﬂow. Together, they developed a plan to

adjust her responsibilities and streamline the process, preventing future

delays. By addressing the issue head-on with care and respect, Michael

reinforced accountability while strengthening trust.

To strike this balance, structure your feedback intentionally. Most

leaders naturally skew toward either empathy or directness. Knowing

your default lets you prepare in advance so you can dial up the side that

doesn’t come as easily. Striking this balance sets the tone for a culture

of honesty, accountability, and growth. Feedback becomes a tool for

## development, not a threat to relationships.

Giving feedback when you’re new to your role can feel like a mineﬁeld,

but it’s also an opportunity to establish your leadership foundation. By

assessing the landscape, fast-tracking trust, understanding your team’s

aspirations, and setting aside your ego, you can navigate this challenge

eﬀectively. In doing so, you’ll not only drive performance but also create

a team culture built on trust, candor, and mutual success—essential

ingredients for any leader’s legacy.
