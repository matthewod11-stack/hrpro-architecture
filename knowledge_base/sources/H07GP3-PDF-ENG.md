Ultimately, venture capital at the early stages is a people thing, I’m

betting on you. People are just more comfortable betting on somebody

that is more like them, looks like them, talks like them, went to the

same schools, eats the same food, goes to the same restaurant, drinks

the same wine, goes to the same country club, all these little things.

They’re not overtly racist or overtly discriminatory, it’s just comfort.

Ultimately it’s a comfort thing.

## — Interview with a male investor, August 2015

Venture capital is a man’s game. Women are massively under-

represented among both venture-backed entrepreneurs and VC

investors, with companies founded solely by women receiving less

than 3% of all venture capital investments and women accounting for

less than 15% of check-writers. It’s a vicious cycle: If VCs are more

comfortable “betting on somebody that looks like them,” it’s hardly

surprising that investors — who are majority male — are much more

likely to bet on startups led by men.

In response to these disheartening statistics, policy makers, business

leaders, and investor groups have advocated for getting more women

involved in venture ﬁnancing. The idea behind these eﬀorts is that if

men won’t invest in women, then women will do it themselves — and

will ultimately reap the beneﬁts of investing in female talent that would

otherwise have been overlooked.

At ﬁrst glance, this approach makes sense. Studies have shown that

female investors are indeed more likely than male investors to invest

in female entrepreneurs. But our recent research suggests that support

from female investors may be a mixed blessing, because it may actually

make it harder for female founders to raise additional rounds of

ﬁnancing.

We analyzed more than 2,000 venture-backed ﬁrms in the United States

and found that women-led ﬁrms whose ﬁrst round of VC funding was

raised exclusively from female VC partners were two times less likely

than those whose ﬁrst round included male partners to eventually raise

a second round. No matter the size of the initial funding round, the

## industry, the geographic location, or the prestige of the investor, female

founders were consistently less likely to close a second round if their

ﬁrst round only included women. Conversely, for male-led ﬁrms, the

genders of the ﬁrst-round investors had no impact on their ability to

attract future investment.

What drives this disparity? To ﬁnd out, we conducted an experiment in

which we asked more than 200 MBA students and investors to watch

a ﬁctional startup pitch narrated by either “Laura” or “David.” The

pitches themselves were identical, except that half of the participants

were told that the startup had already received funding from an investor

named “John,” while the other half were told the funding had come

from “Katherine.” We then had the participants evaluate the quality of

## the pitch and the competence of the founder.

As expected, when the pitch was narrated by Laura and her funding

came from John, she was rated just as highly as David was. But

when Laura’s funding came from Katherine, both male and female

participants evaluated the pitch less favorably, and rated Laura as less

# competent.

This is because of an eﬀect psychologists call attribution bias: the

tendency to assume that someone’s identity or character, rather than

outside factors, are responsible for the situation they’re in. When people

see that a female founder has a male investor, they assume she must

have received his investment because she is competent, and her startup

is strong. But when people see that a female founder has a female

investor, they attribute her investment success to her gender rather

than her competence. As a result, new potential investors assume that

a female founder is less competent if they see that she has only been

backed by female investors — regardless of her actual qualiﬁcations.

Interestingly, research has identiﬁed similar eﬀects with respect to aﬃrmative action. When people are told that a female employee was an aﬃrmative action hire, they perceive her as less competent than equally qualiﬁed men or women who were not aﬃrmative action hires. Even

if two women have objectively identical levels of competence, just the knowledge that one was hired as part of an aﬃrmative action program is

enough to make her seem less competent.

So, what does this mean for female founders looking to raise capital?

We are not suggesting that women should never raise capital from other

women. Female investors might be more responsive to female founders,

and more able to see their potential. Networking between women can

also be more comfortable and less fraught, and a female founder may be

more likely to establish a trusting mentorship relationship with a female

VC, which can bring substantial long-term beneﬁts to both.

However, this can be a risky strategy when it comes to a startup’s long-

term success. There are still very few female investors, and they tend to

be concentrated in funds that focus on earlier-stage investments, where

risk is higher and funds invested are smaller. Today, female VCs simply do not control suﬃcient assets to continue to invest in female-led ﬁrms

as they scale. This means that female founders will ultimately need to

attract male investors in order to grow — and if you’re a woman, our

research shows that’s a lot easier to do if you raise at least some capital

from men from the start. As one female founder we spoke to put it:

I think there’s deﬁnitely a problem, if you’re a female entrepreneur,

backed by a female investor, and you want to get more capital, and

now the only people around the table are these two women. It’s almost

like, you’d want to do the hard thing ﬁrst, and get a few men brought

# in.

Of course, as with any systemic inequity, it’s on those who’ve already

made it into positions of power to address bias and ensure founders

are evaluated fairly. In particular, VCs have a responsibility to rethink

how they evaluate investment opportunities and ensure that business

metrics rather than implicit biases guide early-stage funding decisions.

But for female founders faced with fundraising in today’s imperfect

world, our research suggests that it may be worth the extra eﬀort up

front to cast a wider net and try to recruit a diverse team of VCs

in the ﬁrst round. Indeed, beyond the eﬀects on future fundraising,

prior research suggests that mixed-gender coalitions tend to outperform

single-gender ones in advocating for gender equity. While there are

legitimate reasons why female founders may both have an easier time

attracting female VCs and reap more beneﬁts from those relationships,

there is also a lot to be gained by ensuring a diverse set of perspectives

# on the cap table.

Similarly, while VC ﬁrms may encourage their female investors to

identify and champion female entrepreneurs (perhaps even driven by

a desire to support women-led startups), this responsibility should

not rest solely on female VCs’ shoulders. Ultimately, both investors

and founders will beneﬁt if male VCs work alongside their female

counterparts to proactively support women-led startups — and do what

they can to ensure that the next generation of unicorns is a little more

# well-balanced.
