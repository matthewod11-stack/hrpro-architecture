The United States is the only industrialized country without a national

paid maternity leave policy, and one of six OECD countries without paid

leave for fathers. That leaves U.S. ﬁrms to decide whether to provide paid

leave to their employees who need time to care for themselves, new

children, or loved ones. Just 21% of the civilian workforce, typically white

collar workers at larger ﬁrms, have access to employer-provided paid

# leave.

Yet some recruiters and executives at small ﬁrms, especially tech start-ups,

say that providing paid leave to employees — or living in a state with a

public paid leave program — is increasingly making the difference in

recruiting and retaining top talent, especially as the Covid-19 pandemic

strains families to the breaking point. “I’ve had people turn me down

because of the paid leave,” said Patricia Sias, head of HR at a small STEM

ﬁrm that does not offer paid family leave. In a previous position, with a

large ﬁrm, she said the paid leave policy often sealed the deal, especially

for women and younger candidates. “Millennials brought [paid leave] up

right off the bat,” she said.

Men are increasingly bringing it up, too. Marcia Call, a recruiter with

TalentFront who specializes in small businesses, said paid leave was a

make-or-break issue in two recent cases, both men. “It was extraordinarily

important to these men that they have this beneﬁt,” Call said. Though the

ﬁrm she was recruiting for didn’t offer paid leave, the ﬁrm is located in

## Washington, DC, one of a handful of states and local jurisdictions that

have a public paid leave policy. That closed the deal.

Research has found that paid leave policies can help employers recruit top

talent, especially in the highly competitive tech sector. A 2016 Deloitte

survey found 77% of employees said that whether a ﬁrm offered paid leave

— and the length of it — had some bearing on where they chose to work.

Half said they’d rather have more paid leave than a pay raise. Jaime Klein,

founder and CEO of Inspire HR, calls it “the Google effect”: “Facebook,

Google, they’ve started doing these longer paid leaves, and in an effort to

## track with them, organizations, no matter their size, no matter their

industry, the best-places-to-work type organizations, the ones that have a

real focus on talent, have tried to extend their paid leave as well.” One of

her female engineer candidates with multiple offers told Klein she

speciﬁcally chose the company with the most generous paid leave.

Paid leave can increase retention, too, especially for women and diverse

talent. When Google expanded its paid parental leave policy from 12 to 18

weeks in 2007, the retention rate of women post-maternity leave

increased by 50%, as Susan Wojcicki, CEO of YouTube, a Google

subsidiary, explained in a 2016 speech to the Anita Borg Institute’s Grace

# Hopper Conference.

But many small ﬁrms, especially cash-strapped tech start-ups, often don’t

have the resources to offer paid leave. The Department of Labor reports

that just 15% of companies with 99 or fewer employees have access to

employer-provided paid leave, compared to nearly one-third of workers at

large companies. “But many small employers view their employees as

family,” says Katie Vlietstra Wonnenberg, a principal with public policy

ﬁrm Public Private Strategies. “They want to take care of their people.”

That’s a big reason why a coalition of small businesses in the United

States, led by organizations like the Small Business Majority and Main

Street Alliance, have been calling for a national public paid leave policy to

help them compete for talent with bigger ﬁrms. SBM’s polling found that

70% of small businesses support a national policy. Another survey in

October of 600 small business owners found widespread bipartisan

support for a national public policy. “Paid leave would allow small

businesses to compete with larger companies that have the resources to

provide such a beneﬁt while taking care of their employees,” John

Arensmeyer, SBM founder and CEO, wrote to the Department of Labor in

# September.

But until such a policy is in place, what can tech ﬁrms and small

businesses do to address their disadvantage in paid leave, so they can

attract and retain top tech talent? Here are six suggestions from long-time

human resources professionals and small business leaders who have been

navigating this mineﬁeld:

Do a cost-beneﬁt analysis. Providing a paid leave beneﬁt can be expensive, but so can not providing it. Failed recruiting efforts are expensive. For example, Resumelab.com reports that 43% of new hires

quit due to unmet expectations generally, costing 30% of recruiting time

and resources. Offering generous paid leave could help them think twice

about leaving before they do. Plus, the repercussions of losing top talent

“ripples through your organization,” Sias explained. It’s important to

## count the boost to productivity, engagement, morale, and ﬁrm reputation

that can come with a paid leave policy, too.

Talk to your employees. “I think executives really need to listen to the

feedback they receive from their staff,” Sias insisted, “you really truly have

to have a plan of action on how you’re going to address what those [pain]

points are. And if it’s … leave and beneﬁts, do them. It’s the low-hanging

fruit, and it goes such a distance. Staff feel heard. Staff feel appreciated.

Staff feel acknowledged…and if you’ve missed it, you’ve lost their trust.” If

you just listen but don’t act on their feedback or explain why you can’t,

they won’t believe you care, and they won’t trust you.

Include men. Paid leave policies shouldn’t be reserved just for women.

Todd Olson, founder and CEO of Pendo, a software services ﬁrm in

Raleigh-Durham, North Carolina, pointed out that making their paid parental leave available to all parents has been key to maintaining a diverse talent pool: “Supporting men also helps women get back to work, if that’s

what they choose to do.”

Plan handoffs in advance. The work goes on, even while employees are on leave. Plan ahead and get buy-in from those who will be covering

projects and tasks. The new team might need to be trained or brought up

to speed, too. Dan Najjum, CFO at edtech ﬁrm Signal Vine in Alexandria,

Virginia, said it’s not hard, but is important: “With enough time and

planning, you can ﬁgure out how this can be done….You want your

coworkers to care about each other.” If you don’t plan ahead, you risk

resentment that can backﬁre, or the work may be done improperly, which

could have seriously deleterious effects on your business.

Be consistent and communicate openly. Don’t just sweeten paid leave

beneﬁts for new recruits, Sias advised. Make sure the same beneﬁt is available to new talent and current employees. “As employers, it’s not just what you do to get people in the door, it’s the lifecycle of the employee,

and…people talk.” If you communicate about these and other policy issues

openly as they evolve and demonstrate you are being responsive to your

team’s feedback and needs, you’ll build a culture of trust.

Be a voice in the public policy debate. Small businesses employ 49.2%

of the U.S. workforce and 43% of high-tech talent. As more states craft

statewide paid leave policies and momentum builds for a national paid

leave policy, small businesses must become educated and involved in

crafting these policies to ensure their needs are addressed. Vlietstra

Wonnenberg said, “They have to ﬁnd a way to insert themselves in the

conversation — by they themselves being an advocate, or joining a

business organization that aligns with their view.”

It’s important to remember your organization’s leave policy affects your

reputation. Human resources executive Diane Irving, who has spent more

than 25 years in STEM ﬁelds, put it plainly: “Is this a generous

organization or is this not a generous organization? You get a reputation…

There’s a competition for talent and it may tip the scale.”

As the pandemic rages on, it’s becoming increasingly clear that if small

businesses and tech ﬁrms want to recruit and retain the best talent

possible, they need a competitive paid leave policy. As Nicholas Christakis

of Yale University states, “The dynamics of a contagious disease made it

abundantly clear…[that] paid sick leave…[and] such policies are likely to

endure after the virus subsides, either because companies see the wisdom

of it, lawmakers enforce it, or workers demand it.”
