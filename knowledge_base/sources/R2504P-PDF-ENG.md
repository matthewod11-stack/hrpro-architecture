Alex Rivera settled into his ofﬁce chair and stared at the pages

containing charts and projections that were spread across his desk.

Three years into his role as CEO of SolidTech Innovations, he was

thinking critically about the company’s future.

For more than 80 years the privately held SolidTech had been a leader

in elevator manufacturing. It was known for making reliable, durable

systems and installing and maintaining them in commercial buildings

around the world. But the internet-of-things era was indicating a new

direction for the industry. Smart buildings required smart elevators.

New entrants, backed by venture capital and private equity ﬁrms, were

selling models with predictive maintenance systems, touchless controls,

## AI-powered traﬃc optimization, and cloud-based monitoring platforms

that integrated with building management technology. The future of

vertical transportation seemed to be less about simply moving people

safely between ﬂoors and more about data, eﬃciency, and merging

# software with hardware.

“That’s the line you need to keep hitting home,” said Sarah Thompson,

the consultant sitting across from Alex. “Your people know everything

about cables, counterweights, and motor systems, but little about APIs,

machine learning, or user experience design, and that’s an existential

# problem.”

A former Bain partner who now ran her own ﬁrm, Sarah had a

reputation for both future-focused thinking and brutal honesty. It was

the reason Alex had hired her as an adviser.

“This is why SolidTech needs to move forward with the ‘Grand

Bargain,’” she continued, tapping the presentation in front of Alex.

“Reskill your existing workforce through an opt-in program. Employees

invest time in learning new skills, while the company secures the talent

it needs without trying to hire thousands of software engineers in this

tight labor market.”

Alex nodded slowly. “Online training, massive open online courses, community college courses—we can oﬀer it all?” he asked.

“Yes, most are covered by the company, but if employees want to ramp

up with extra courses, we’ll secure deeply discounted group rates,”

Sarah replied. “Those who adapt will have a future here. Those who

don’t…” She let the implication hang in the air.

“I see you’re suggesting potential demotions and pay cuts for those who

don’t participate,” Alex said, “but that feels harsh.”

“Reskilling is a balancing act,” Sarah replied. “To keep costs down,

there must be consequences for those who don’t embrace the change. Those measures—and voluntary attrition—will help oﬀset the cost of

the program.”

Alex stood up and walked to the window, looking out at the SolidTech

campus. Several buildings housed teams that had been with the

company for decades. He thought about the broader implications of

displaced workers—not just at SolidTech but across the country.

“You know, this isn’t just about our bottom line,” he said quietly.

Sarah nodded. “Which is why I’m suggesting a win-win plan. This is

## a new social contract between employer and employee. The company

provides the platform for growth, and the workers take responsibility for

their own futures.”

“Let’s talk to the owners ﬁrst,” Alex said. “If they balk, that sends us a

message.”

# Shareholder Pushback

“Our ﬁve-year plan hinges on a workforce transformation,” Alex

explained, the faces of the people who held a majority of SolidTech’s

shares staring back at him from the videoconference screen. “Given

the tight labor market, we’re therefore thinking about retraining our

existing workforce and creating a new culture of continuous learning.

This Grand Bargain will help us maintain our industry expertise and

stay competitive. Our adviser, Sarah Thompson, is here to help answer

# your questions.”

Rich Symond, who represented SolidTech’s founding family as head of

its investment trust, which still held a majority stake in the company,

unmuted himself ﬁrst. “Do we have evidence that programs like this

actually work in practice? Can we really get our existing employees to

the level they need to be so that they’re retainable? Or will we still have

to hire new software talent anyway and let other people go? I know that

the family won’t want to see us do that to longtime employees, but I also

worry that we’ll spend millions on retraining only to ﬁnd ourselves at a

competitive disadvantage relative to companies that hired young guns

# right away.”

Before Alex could respond, Akash Rao from RT Hinkley Capital,

SolidTech’s second largest shareholder, chimed in. “I actually see this

as a good way to get to downsizing at SolidTech. The company needs to

improve its margins, and if this reskilling program gives Alex cover to

make his workforce leaner, I’m all for it.”

Alex winced. The last thing he wanted to do was oversee mass layoﬀs.

He glanced over at Sarah, and she jumped in. “That is truly not the intent,” she said ﬁrmly. “It’s an eﬀort to hold on to our people

while recognizing we can do so only if they have the right skills,

and to preserve institutional knowledge and culture while evolving

capabilities. And, yes, we’ve seen companies like IBM and Amazon do

this with great success.”

Monica Chen from minority investor Meridian Ventures spoke next. “I

really like the idea of a reskilling program—and agree there is solid

evidence they work well—but I do have some practical concerns. First,

SolidTech’s largest business opportunity remains the refurbishment

of old elevators in old buildings. What’s more, many customers in

emerging markets are very cost conscious; they just want a box that goes

up and down reliably. I’m worried we are letting the buzz of innovation

crowd out common sense. Is this really where our focus should be?

Or should we be starting small with our smart, connected elevators, perhaps even under a diﬀerent brand?”

“I’m glad Monica raised the point about tech hype,” said Thomas Smith

from Falcon Capital. “Online universities and MOOC startups are high-

risk partners. I know they are all the rage in tech circles, but why should

we take on that risk? Frankly, is it even the company’s responsibility to

reskill employees? My friends on the right would say that sounds like

something individuals should be responsible for, and my friends on the

left would say that’s something the state should handle.”

After the call ended, Alex sat in the conference room, reviewing

his notes. SolidTech’s owners weren’t at all aligned. Sarah placed a

hand on his shoulder. “There were always going to be questions,” she

said. “Change is scary, especially when it seems expensive. But we

can bring them on board. Reskilling is the best way to execute this

# transformation.”

Alex nodded. “We should move forward with the key managers meeting

tomorrow. With you being around the past few weeks, rumors are

circulating. Better to get their input, too, as soon as we can.”

# The Employee View

As the leaders of engineering, manufacturing, installation,

maintenance, sales, and ﬁnance ﬁled into the room, Alex greeted each

with a handshake before sitting down at the head of the table.

To his right, Sarah whispered, “Remember, lead with the opportunity,

# not the threat.”

“Thank you all for taking the time to meet today,” Alex began. “As

many of you know, our industry is changing rapidly, and so, to secure

## SolidTech’s future—and that of all our team members—we’re thinking

about how to evolve.”

For the next few minutes, he outlined the Grand Bargain. “Those

who participate would be positioned to drive SolidTech’s future and

## beneﬁt from educational opportunities throughout their careers here,”

he concluded. “Those who choose not to would…have more-limited

prospects. Now I’d love to hear your thoughts.”

Jon Laurent, a 25-year veteran of SolidTech and chief of engineering,

jumped in. “Alex, in the years you’ve been here, we’ve always had an

honest relationship, so I hope you don’t mind me saying straight-out

that I don’t see this plan working,” he said. “Our company’s secret sauce

is in the tacit, hard-won expertise of our people. And what makes them

tick? It’s putting on their coveralls and working with their hands. I get

wanting to digitize and can see bringing in some new hires to help us do

that. But my guys don’t want to become computer nerds, and I suspect

that if you force it on them, they’ll leave, which means all that essential

knowledge and hundreds of years of cumulative experience just walking

out the door forever.”

Jon’s manufacturing, installation, and maintenance peers all nodded

vigorously and murmured agreements. He continued, “The service

technician arriving at a customer’s premises is a visible display of the

value we bring. We lose our frontline relationship with the customer

if we are just squirting software updates to them in the middle of the

night. There will be no loyalty.”

Alex felt a knot forming in his stomach. He’d had similar concerns but

pushed them aside. He was thankful when Maya Perrineau, his chief

sales oﬃcer, chimed in. “But that’s everyone’s knee-jerk reaction to the

idea of upskilling, right? ‘Is our industry really changing that quickly?

Does everyone have to do it? Can’t we just expand our digital team to handle that stuﬀ?’ But I can tell you that what customers want now

are the same great elevators we’ve always made upgraded with all the

modern conveniences—not layered on but integrated.”

Tony Wu, SolidTech’s chief ﬁnancial oﬃcer, spoke up next. “This

reminds me of ‘ghost oﬃces’ in Japan. These are the workplaces where companies that are committed to oﬀering lifetime employment send

their workers when their skills become obsolete. They’re still employed,

but they have no purpose. They’re ghosts.” He paused. “It goes without saying that we can’t aﬀord to do that. But also I don’t think it’s what any

of us want. We’ve got to work together to keep everyone’s skills relevant

—and Alex’s plan seems like a good way to do that.”

“But it’s not your teams that will need to reskill,” Jon countered. “It’s our

engineers and installers and maintenance guys. And I’m not sure they’ll all be able or willing to do that. So are we talking about layoﬀs for those people who don’t? And would you oﬀer job guarantees to the ones who

do, no matter how they perform?” The room fell silent.

“That’s why we’re framing this as a bargain,” Sarah said. “SolidTech

organizes the right training, which will help employees whether they

stay with us or not. In exchange, they commit to adapting.”

As the debate continued around him, Alex felt like a ghost himself,

trapped in limbo, unsure whether to move forward or back with the

Grand Bargain. In his gut, he knew that whatever decision he made

would deﬁne not just his leadership but SolidTech’s future.

Question: Should Alex push forward with a reskilling program?

HBR’s fictionalized case studies present problems faced by leaders in real companies and offer solutions from experts. This one is based on the HBS case study “AT&T, Retraining, and the Workforce of Tomorrow” (HBP Product 9-820-017) by William R. Kerr, Joseph B. Fuller, and Carl Kreitzberg.

A version of this article appeared in the July–August 2025 issue of Harvard Business Review.

The Experts Respond: Should Alex push forward with a reskilling program?

Paddy Hull is the global head of talent, culture and leadership at Heineken.

The question isn’t whether SolidTech should

reskill but how. Competitors aren’t waiting; they

are adapting. The choice is to evolve or face

# obsolescence.

SolidTech is on the right track in calling this a “Grand Bargain,” but

management needs to do far more in terms of employee outreach.

It’s a good start to have identiﬁed roles that need reskilling. Now, get

speciﬁc. Don’t just announce a program; outline exactly what it means

for each role. In my experiences at Unilever, where I oversaw a reskilling

program, and now at Heineken, I’ve learned that the “ﬁght, ﬂight, or

freeze” response is real. People are threatened when they hear the word

## “reskilling.” Counter that apprehension with clear, detailed plans. Show

them the “what,” “when,” and “how.”

SolidTech can do several speciﬁc things to help foster employee buy-in:

First, use carrots, not sticks. Incentivize employees to participate in the

reskilling program rather than threatening them with demotions or pay

## cuts. Retention bonuses, salary continuations during training, and clear

career progression opportunities would motivate people to embrace the

# change.

Second, be speciﬁc, not amorphous. Clearly communicate what the

program entails, including speciﬁc roles and skills that need to be

developed, to reduce uncertainty. For instance, when we rolled out

reskilling at Unilever, we showed how the procurement team could take

on sales roles with just a little training. We focused on helping people

see opportunity, not threat.

Finally, leverage trusted internal resources. Train respected inﬂuencers

in your organization, such as union representatives or experienced

employees, to mentor and coach others on thinking through their career

options. This approach builds trust.

Though it may seem more cost-eﬀective to have external providers

run reskilling courses, such partners often can’t provide the relevance

and speciﬁcity needed for a company’s unique situation. Instead,

organizations should leverage their existing resources and expertise to

# design and implement in-house programs.

While investors might focus on the cost savings from head count

reduction if people opt out of the reskilling program and leave

the company, Alex should focus on the beneﬁts. Reskilling ensures

retention of institutional experience, reduced recruitment costs, and

improved employee engagement. Other companies have proven this to

be the successful strategy to follow.

# Hayden Brown is the CEO of Upwork.

Alex has more choices than he realizes. He sees

only two paths: maintaining the status quo and

hoping for the best, or reskilling the workforce

at a potentially huge cost and risk to his existing

business. But there’s a third way: He can turn to

freelancers to address his critical skills gap, achieve early wins and

learning, and mitigate the risks that he is most worried about.

He doesn’t need to dive in with an all-or-nothing approach. He could

start by prototyping a new working model using small freelance teams

with the new skills he thinks are needed, spinning them up to test in

individual departments such as sales or industrial design. This way, he

can quickly gauge whether the investment will add business value and oﬀer proof points to his key investors and internal managers.

He may be concerned that the online freelance market won’t be able

to supply the expertise that he requires. But the opposite is true: He

can ﬁnd professionals with direct elevator-company experience or those

with experience in adjacent industries with obvious crossover who,

always hungry for new work, would be willing and able to add value

# quickly.

Those who are brought in shouldn’t just do the work and leave; they

should stand side by side with existing SolidTech employees, examining

workﬂows and skills gaps, and retraining the team along the way. If the

pilot works, Alex could ask those in-house people who worked alongside

the freelancers, and the leaders who saw the impact on their teams, to

help promote the program to other departments, explaining that they

have nothing to fear and, in fact, much to gain from such collaborations.

Alex is worried that any kind of reskilling will drive away some of his

longtime talent. But the risk of inaction is greater. Not only does he

need to stay ahead of the competition, he also needs to signal to his

future-focused employees that he wants to keep SolidTech relevant.

Otherwise, he risks losing one of his most critical talent assets—the

people who want to keep growing and learning new skills—to more-

# innovative competitors.

This approach—moving to a smaller full-time employee base

augmented by specialists—will bring in fresh skills and knowledge

at a much faster pace, while allowing Alex to retain and supplement

institutional knowledge and culture. By changing SolidTech’s workforce

mix in this way, Alex can avoid the continual cycle of reskilling or turning over expensive full-time staﬀ. By leveraging freelancers,

piloting new teams, and starting with small, achievable objectives, Alex

can begin to transform and reskill his workforce without implementing

## a massive, costly, potentially risky program.
