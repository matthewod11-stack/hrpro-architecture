senior leaders, colleagues, and clients that reflect yourcontributions to the company.If you’re making the case for a salary adjustment or correction,look at websites like Payscale and Salary.com to get anunderstanding of the market rate for a role like yours. You canalso look at recently posted job descriptions — policies in manyU.S. states now require companies to publicly post the salaries orsalary bands of new roles. It can be helpful to talk to recruiters inyour industry to see what they think of your salary asbenchmarked against your peers, your specialized skills, and youryears of experience.

It can be helpful to set aside some dedicated time for theconversation, such as during your regularly scheduled check-in orin a pre-planned meeting. You want to create a space where yourmanager can focus on your ask and provide their full attention.Consider how your manager best handles new information. Forexample, do they like to review on their own before going into aone-on-one discussion? If so, it may be best to email them beforeyour meeting and share your intention to ask for a raise. Whilemanagers should always be prepared for these types ofconversations, some will appreciate the chance to consider yourask ahead of time. On the other hand, if you think they will shutdown the topic (intentionally or unintentionally) if they know youplan to bring it up, it may be best to raise it for the first time inyour meeting.When you do approach the topic, follow these steps:

In the follow-up conversation with your boss, acknowledge thecompany’s offer and the difficult financial climate, while alsoreiterating your past accomplishments and future potential forthe company. You might draft a document to share with your bossthat includes your recent successes, references consistent strongperformance reviews, and a note from a senior leader or boardmember about your exceptional work, as well as salary data oncomparative roles.Even after all this, your manager may still say it’s not possible forthe company to consider your raise at this time. If that happens,ask if they’d be willing to revisit the conversation in three to sixmonths. If they agree, add the date to your calendar so you canremember to follow through. If your manager says no outright,remember that money isn’t the only thing that can be negotiated.You may ask instead for other benefits beyond salary, such as aretention bonus, a more flexible schedule, more vacation time,transportation reimbursements, or professional developmentfunds (such as for a conference or coaching).

In a business environment rife with budget constraints and layofffears, asking for additional resources can be complicated. Butthere is never a “perfect” time to ask for a raise — even when theeconomy is strong, many things can get in the way. Economicdownturn or not, don’t let your fear of hearing “no” be one ofthose roadblocks.
