“Speed Is a Leadership Decision” The HBR Interview with Andy Jassy by Adi Ignatius

## From the Magazine (July–August 2025) / Reprint R2504C

When Andy Jassy succeeded Jeff Bezos as CEO of Amazon, in 2021, he

stepped into one of the most scrutinized leadership roles in business.

Yet under Jassy’s leadership, Amazon has not only sustained its

momentum but accelerated. According to the company, revenues have

grown by more than $230 billion during his four-year tenure, and it

has made signiﬁcant leaps in its delivery capabilities and use of AI.

In a wide-ranging conversation with HBR editor at large Adi Ignatius,

Jassy reﬂects on what it takes to lead at scale, encourage risk-taking,

ﬁnd smart ways to embrace AI, and reinvent corporate culture in a

company with more than a million employees. Here are excerpts from

# that conversation.

HBR: You’ve said that you want Amazon to operate like a startup. How do you make that happen?

Jassy: Amazon moves very quickly. But as you get larger, all sorts of

things can slow you down. When we talk about operating like the

world’s largest startup, we mean that whatever we build or wherever

we commit resources, we make sure that we’re solving a real customer

problem. A lot of companies fall in love with their technology and build

things they think are cool, but in the end they haven’t solved anything

remarkable. Startups are missionary about trying to solve problems for

# customers.

How do you staff for that?

We need a lot of builders—people who like to invent, who like to dissect

the customer experience and ﬁgure out what’s wrong with it, even if it’s

pretty good, and then rebuild it. And we need owners—people who ask,

“What would I do if it were my money? What would I do if I owned all

the resources?” In other words, people who feel accountable.

How do you think about pace?

Speed disproportionately matters in every business at every time. I used

to speak with a lot of CEOs who would say, “We’re big. We have security

issues. We have compliance issues. We just can’t move fast.” I think

speed is a leadership decision. You can decide you want to move fast,

but you have to ﬁgure out what’s slowing you down and knock all those

barriers out. Then you’ve got to get the whole organization aligned on

moving really fast, even if you make mistakes along the way.

That’s a classic challenge: How do you move quickly in a big organization with so many layers of management?

You need to really try to root out bureaucracy. As you get bigger,

you have a lot of managers—well-intended people—who keep layering

in processes. And pretty soon you have process upon process upon

process, which slows people down, so they can’t get the real work

done. You have to be scrappy. You can’t put 50 or 100 people on every

new project. We started our cloud-computing business, Amazon Web

Services, with about 13 employees. With a small number of people,

you can build something that resonates with customers and then keep

iterating from there.

How do push your team to take chances and embrace failure?

As companies get bigger, they often get risk averse. If you hire

achievement-oriented, type A people, they are not used to failing. When

they want to pursue something new, they worry that if they get it wrong,

they’ll be ostracized. So they play to not lose. We stress that the only way

to build something unique is to do something diﬀerent. You have to be

willing to take risks and to fail.

Being customer-focused seems inconsistent with taking risks. If you know exactly what your customers want, you deliver that. It doesn’t sound risky. How do you square those two imperatives?

I think they’re pretty consistent. If you ﬁnd the right feedback loops,

customers will tell you what’s wrong with your product or with their

experience. And if you ask the right “why” questions about the problem

you’re trying to solve, customers will tell you what’s really constraining

them. They can’t always tell you how to ﬁx it, but if you’re listening and

you understand the need, then you can invent on their behalf.

You seem to be reinventing Amazon’s management and culture: You’re rethinking the role of middle management. You’ve adjusted expectations about how teams work together. What’s the unifying idea behind these steps?

Most companies that are successful for any period of time have a culture

that’s a key part of their success. We have a really strong culture, but

it’s not our birthright. Things change. The size of the company changes.

The scope of businesses you’re going after changes. The geographic

distribution of your people changes. If you want to stay successful, you

have to keep working on strengthening the parts of your culture that you

see being stretched.

So what does that look like in practice?

It comes back to the notion of wanting to operate like the world’s

largest startup. We looked at our culture and identiﬁed a few things.

Historically, Amazon has hired smart, ambitious, motivated people. We

let them make the lion’s share of what we call “two-way-door decisions”

—if you walk through it and you’re wrong, you can always walk back, no

harm done. (In a one-way-door decision, if you walk through the door

and you’re wrong, it’s really hard to walk back.) But as you get larger,

as we have, you end up logically with a lot of managers and a lot of

layers of managers. There’s a pre-meeting for the pre-meeting for the

pre-meeting for the decision meeting. And owners who don’t feel like

they own the decision to make a recommendation because they know

the decision will be made three levels up. We want them to own the

two-way-door decisions and be able to move quickly and autonomously.

It’s part of our eﬀort to increase the ratio of individual contributors to

managers by at least 15%. We want to ﬂatten the organization in order to

move faster and to drive more ownership.

What’s your advice for companies that want to break down their own layers of complexity in order to innovate quickly and effectively?

The ﬁrst step is to want to address it, which isn’t simple because you

get used to operating in a certain way. The leadership team has to

decide they actually want to change things and resolve to take action.

That requires getting visibility into what’s really happening. When we

announced that we wanted to ﬂatten and have fewer managers, we

started a “no bureaucracy” email alias, and we encouraged anybody

in the company who thought they were experiencing bureaucracy to

email me. I’ve received more than 1,000 emails in six months. Not all of

them are about bureaucracy—sometimes people just tell me they don’t

like their manager. But I’ve read every one and shared them with other

senior leaders, and we’ve already changed 375 processes. That visibility

has helped us address some of the red tape deep in the organization.

What’s behind your return-to-ofﬁce policy?

After the pandemic our people were largely working remotely. We brought them back to the oﬃce in May 2023, three days a week,

and noticed that a lot of things about how we were inventing and

collaborating got better. We were in meetings together. We were

iterating with one another. When you’re together, that invention is

stronger. People riﬀ on top of one another’s ideas better when they’re

together. It turns out, it can be useful to interrupt each other because

you get to a spot more quickly. You feel that energy. A lot of our best

inventions have come after messy, wandering meetings, when a few

people stayed behind and worked on a whiteboard to map out whatever

it was they couldn’t ﬁgure out. When you’re remote, the meeting ends

and you’re on to the next thing.

Are you now totally committed to in-ofﬁce work, ﬁve days a week?

We’ve realized the teaching and apprenticeship are much better if you

can walk over to somebody after a meeting and say, “That was a hard meeting. This is a really diﬃcult topic. Next time, think about these

three things.” You just don’t end up doing this as much when you’re

remote. And we realized that it’s much better for our customers and our

business if we’re together.

Data that we’ve published has shown that working from home can increase productivity and that the workforce by and large wants it. Do you think that data is wrong, or are you saying that there are intangibles that outweigh those ﬁndings?

I think it’s hard to measure these things, truthfully, and our data doesn’t

suggest what you’ve just described. When I look at the data, it’s hard

to measure. How do you measure how well you’re inventing? You don’t

actually know for a few years. I spend a good amount of my own time

are much better in person. People are realizing that they invent better

together, and I think they like being with one another.

Let’s talk about AI. Some analysts thought Amazon was relatively slow to get into AI in a big way. Are you happy with where you are now?

AI is probably the biggest technology transformation since the internet,

and it’s going to change every experience that we know. We have

substantial investments in the AI space. In the early days people

were excited about ChatGPT, which is a remarkable application, and

OpenAI’s model, which was a game changer. To pursue AI in earnest,

you need to invest in all three layers of the AI stack. We’re doing that. So

while there wasn’t a lot of attention early on—ChatGPT was kind of the

only large-scale generative AI application—I think people have slept a

little bit on the other layers of the stack, where we have big investments

and are doing really nicely.

Describe the bets you’re making in those AI layers.

The bottom layer of the AI stack is for model builders, and they care

about two things: the compute to do the training and the inference,

which is really the chip. And they care about services that can make it

easier to build models. We’ve built our own custom AI chip, Trainium,

that delivers high performance at low cost. We’ve also built a service

called SageMaker for people who are building their own models—to get

the data in, to experiment, to deploy into production.

I think people are excited about the middle layer, which is for people

who don’t want to have to build their own models but want to leverage

an existing frontier model and customize it with their own data. We’ve

built a service called Bedrock, which oﬀers a large selection of leading

third-party frontier models, including our own. It also has features that

can help you build your own high-quality generative AI app. Bedrock

has substantial traction. It hasn’t gotten as much public limelight, but

these services are part of why we have a multibillion-dollar annual

revenue run rate in the AI space.

How will AI transform the customer experience?

We’ve built a generative-AI-powered shopping assistant called Rufus

that can make recommendations, ask questions to help you narrow your

choices, and compare products. You can ask it any question, with any

amount of detail, and it will answer. And this sales assistant is not

going to move on to another career. It’s going to be with you and get

more personalized over time. If you’re a golfer, it can ask, “What’s your

handicap? Do you have a fast swing or a slow swing?” And it can explain

the beneﬁt of a graphite shaft versus a steel shaft. If you’re thinking

about buying apparel, you can ask, “Does this brand run large or small?”

We built a foundation model to compare all brands and identify which

ones run comparably small or large in order to recommend the right size

for you. Every part of our retail customer experience will be reinvented

# with generative AI.

Let’s play the projection game. In 10 years how will AI remake business?

I think almost every experience that we can imagine will be better. It

doesn’t mean there won’t be people working on these things. Humans

will work in conjunction with AI agents—especially in areas where

their unique capabilities and IQ can add value—but all the experiences

will be better. Great AI personal assistants will be accessible to almost

everyone. Robots will do a lot of the work that today isn’t safe or

that could cause injury from repetitive motion. It’s going to change

# everything.

You seem optimistic about all this. Is there any part of you that thinks, Uh-oh, if we’re not careful, there may be dire, unintended consequences?

I’m an optimist by nature, and I’m an optimist about this technology.

I also think that you can’t stop the progress of technology. You have to

ﬁgure out how to use it productively—for great customer experiences

and for societal good. The pace of this transition may be quicker

than other technology transitions. So we have to make sure that we’re

being responsible about the way the algorithms and models work.

The demand for software developers will go up exponentially with the

advent of new coding apps that allow you to use natural language to

describe what you want to build. It’s going to be very empowering,

but we have to make sure our education keeps up so that people are

# successful in this new economy.

How are you able to attract and retain talent when everyone is going after the same skill set?

You have to build a place where the talent you desire wants to work and

a culture where builders want to come. There are things that are unique

to our culture. A lot of companies talk about being customer focused,

but very few really are. We’re all customers, and we all know what it’s

like to be treated in a mediocre way. If you hire people who share a

customer focus, it’s very inspiring. It starts with customers and goes

# backward from there.

We like to invent. A lot of companies are more competitor focused or

product focused. Those can be successful strategies, but they’re not

ours. We tend to be inventors and ﬁrst movers. We take risks. If you’re

a builder, it’s fun to work with a clean sheet of paper and come up with

something that hasn’t been done before. We’re also long-term oriented.

We tend to be patient with the bets and customer experiences that we

think really matter. And we tolerate failure. If you aren’t failing, you’re

either not inventing enough or not pushing the envelope.

I want to talk about leadership. As you say, AI is reshaping everything. And it feels as if there’s never been greater political and geopolitical complexity. How do you manage through all the uncertainty?

There are a lot of things happening now in the world, in our country.

And it can be dizzying. I think it’s important to acknowledge that there’s

a lot going on, but you can only control the things that you can control.

And then remember what matters most. We’re here to make customers’

lives easier and better. We could get distracted by questions like “Are

there going to be tariﬀs? How high will be they be?” But at the end of the

day, we have a job to do, which is to ﬁgure out what customers want and

then deliver it.

For years, in HBR and elsewhere, the consensus has been that good leadership was deﬁned in large part by being attuned to the needs of all your stakeholders, of thinking about issues like sustainability and diversity. Has the deﬁnition of good leadership changed in your mind?

There isn’t one deﬁnition of what it means to be a great leader of a

signiﬁcant company. You have to deliver great customer experiences

for whomever you’re trying to serve, and with successful ﬁnancial

results. Over the past few years, at times some issues suddenly got a

disproportionate amount of attention. That’s because there’s still work

to be done. We’re still not where we need the environment to be. I

still think we want more-diverse teams. None of that has changed.

Sometimes those issues take up more of the conversation. But as a

leader, you have to create the right customer experience with the right

results to match it. The other pieces are parts of that.

You succeeded a very prominent and successful founder, Jeff Bezos. To what extent are you drawing from his legacy and to what extent are you advancing your own ideas and goals?

I was lucky to work for Jeﬀ directly for 20 years. He may be the most

impressive business leader of our generation. I share a lot of his values

and principles, and we still speak regularly. When you’re succeeding

someone, you may have to throw the plans out the window depending

on what’s happening in the world. I started this job in the middle of the

pandemic, and things took oﬀ. We grew about 40% year over year on a

$245 billion business. We took a fulﬁllment business built over 25 years

and doubled it in 18 months, then built out a last-mile transportation

work the size of UPS in 20 months. With that kind of expansion, you

now have a diﬀerent network on your hands.

I’m really proud of the team. My team rethought our closely held beliefs

and reinvented what our network looks like. Each era presents diﬀerent

challenges, and leaders have to address them and try to be themselves.

You’ve been at Amazon for 28 years and in the CEO role for four. What’s your best career advice?

First, pick something you’re passionate about or that you think you’re

going to be good at. You don’t need to know what your career will

be early on. Before I went to business school, I tried sportscasting

and sales. I worked as a product manager at a direct marketer. I tried

physical retail and investment banking, and I started two businesses.

Next, you can’t be terriﬁed of failure. Almost every important lesson I’ve

learned came from failure, from things that didn’t go right. If you are

self-reﬂective and learn from it, a failure can catapult you. And then,

you need to have a good attitude about the things you can control. Do

you work hard? Are you reliable? Do you want to be part of a team? Are

you a can-do person? Those things aﬀect how people perceive you and

how much they want to advocate for you and work with you.

Finally, you need to be a good learner. At a certain point in their careers,

many people seem threatened by having to learn again. They think it’s

a sign of weakness that they don’t know everything. But if you work in a
