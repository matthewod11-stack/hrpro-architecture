Lack of access to high-proﬁle work — the kind that sets you up for

promotion and leadership opportunities — is a key reason people leave

their organization. The costs of employee attrition are well-known and

expensive — up to twice an employee’s annual salary.

## But the gender and racial disparity in access to career-enhancing

work means this attrition impacts some groups more than others. Our

research across industries has found that 81% to 85% of white men

report fair access to desirable assignments, but that number falls to only

## around 50% for women of color, and 43% of Black women.

At the same time, high-proﬁle work is only one side of the story: Women

also tend to be burdened with the non-promotable oﬃce housework:

administrative work, like scheduling meetings; literal housework, like

cleaning up; emotion work, like being the peacemaker; or routine

everyday work that needs to be done but does not typically lead

to promotion. Women of all races report doing more of the oﬃce

housework than men, and our research has found the gap is large, on

average around 20 percentage points. Women in general, and women

of color even more so, are routinely placed in a position where they

have to work extra hours in order to have the same amount of time

for high-proﬁle work while carrying a disproportionate load of oﬃce

# housework.

If these diﬀerentials don’t seem notable to you, think again. Bias is

like compound interest — even small amounts add up over time to be career-deﬁning. A 5% diﬀerential can have devastating consequences: A

computer simulation study demonstrated that when a company starts

out with equal numbers of men and women at the lowest level, if there’s

a 5% gender bias built in at each level, only 2% of the C-suite will be

# women.

Luckily experiments we ran in four companies show how to use data to

## create fair distribution of opportunities at your company.

# Redistributing Office Housework

Bias in access to opportunities ﬂourishes in the dark: Once you bring

the problem to light, you can’t unsee it. Supported by a generous grant

from Walmart, our team, in partnership with The Conference Board,

administered a 10-minute Workplace Experiences Survey (WES) at four

companies — a professional services ﬁrm, an energy company, and two

ﬁnancial institutions — to establish a baseline level of oﬃce housework

allocation. Next, we ran our unique, interactive 90-minute Individual

Bias Interrupters workshop, then measured three months later to see if the training had an eﬀect. The results were dramatic.

## At the professional services ﬁrm, the disparity between white men and

women of color dropped from 27 percentage points to zero for literal

oﬃce housework (like picking up the cups after a meeting). Women of

color were not the only ones with improved outcomes: The disparity

between white men and white women reduced by nine points, and by

eight points for men of color, resulting in a more equitable distribution

## of this kind of housework for all groups.

The other three companies also saw more equality in oﬃce housework

after the workshop: A ﬁnancial institution saw the disparity in literal

## oﬃce housework between white men and Asian women decrease by

21 percentage points. An energy company saw a 13-point drop in the

## disparity between white men and women of color for emotion work

like playing the peacemaker. Another ﬁnancial institution saw a seven-

point drop in the disparity between white men and women of color for

administrative work, like taking notes in a meeting.

We were, frankly, astonished that our bias training proved so eﬀective. Our workshop is diﬀerent than most bias workshops in several distinct

# ways.

First, instead of discussing the cognitive bases of bias or sweeping social

issues like patriarchy and structural racism, we focus tightly on how

bias plays out on the ground in everyday workplace interactions. Each

company opted to use their own WES data in their bias training to

describe what was actually going on at the company in question – using

both survey data and quotes to describe experiences of bias in a matter-

of-fact, non-accusatory way. One participant said: “I’ve attended a few

too many wishy-washy trainings. I love that [the workshop] … had really

hard data to back everything up.”

Second, people leave our workshops with concrete strategies for

interrupting bias. We accomplish this through breakout sessions of six

people where we present a scenario depicting a pattern of bias that

has been documented at the company, asking participants to discuss

ways they each individually would feel comfortable interrupting that

particular kind of bias the next time they see it. A participant in one

training said, “We loved the breakouts, and they went by too fast!”

That’s the point: We leave people wanting more, so that conversations

will continue long after the workshop is over.

Third, we typically train everyone at the company or in a department,

or all managers at once, so that junior employees see senior managers

making a commitment to address bias proactively, spurring the creation

of new organizational norms. For example, after one workshop, a senior

leader at the professional services ﬁrm declared, “I’m doing the oﬃce

housework today!” which likely helped to create a cultural shift at the

ﬁrm by setting an example for other managers to follow.

As always, sunshine is the best disinfectant: When leaders saw real data

from their own companies, they understood what bias looks like and used the simple, eﬀective ways they felt comfortable with to interrupt it.

## Improving Access to Career-Enhancing Work

Oﬃce housework is only one part of the puzzle. We also worked

with the energy company to improve access to career-enhancing work

for women. At this company, we helped identify a typology of high-

proﬁle opportunities, which they used to build a tasking tool that

allowed managers to track the allocation of both career-enhancing and

non-promotable assignments over a six-month period. At the midway

point, we held a workshop for managers on ensuring fair access to

# opportunities, or ATO.

Again, the results were dramatic. Two departments participated in the

pilot. In department A, our baseline data showed 51% of men but only

38% of women were getting assigned core technical work before the

pilot began. After the ATO workshop and use of the tasking tool, the

disparity between men and women dropped sharply to 0, with 50% of

both men and women doing the core technical work. In department B,

our baseline data show that 37% of men but only 30% of women were

getting technical leadership opportunities. This disparity, too, basically

disappeared: After the intervention 34% of men and 35% of women were

being given technical leadership roles. In both cases, managers leveled

the playing ﬁeld for women without taking away opportunities away

# from men.

Interrupting bias in access to career-enhancing work is not one and

done. In both departments of the energy company, men initially

received more of another kind of career-enhancing work: opportunities

to work on corporate products. Post-workshop, department A took a

small step toward reducing this gap from 22 percentage points to 18

points. This is a move in the right direction, but more work is still

needed to reach parity. (There are many reasons why organizations

improve quickly in some areas and more slowly in others: focusing on a

## few key types of opportunities rather than all types, random variation in

## task prevalence throughout the year, or large all-hands-on-deck events

that can skew the distribution for a few months.)

Department B encountered a diﬀerent issue: Initially, opportunities to

work on corporate products were assigned to 20% of men and 22%

of women. After the workshop, more opportunities were created, but

only for women: now 20% of men and 26% of women got this type of

assignment. This kind of over-correction also needs to be addressed.

Although this pattern isn’t unusual, the ultimate goal is a level playing

ﬁeld for all groups, so both departments have committed to continue

tracking the allocation of work and making corrections over time.

Another important element of addressing access to opportunities is

ensuring equal recognition for successful performance of high-proﬁle

work. At the energy company, we delivered some good news: More than

90% of men and women across all racial groups reported that their work made a meaningful contribution. But fair recognition was a diﬀerent

## story: Pre-workshop, more than 85% of white men, white women, and

men of color reported that they received fair recognition for their work,

but only 68% of women of color agreed. After the intervention, this

stark disparity improved for women of color: 81% now agreed that they

# receive fair recognition for their work.

What were the bias interrupters that proved so eﬀective? In addition

to the ATO workshop, keeping metrics, and using the tasking tool, the

company decided to address an underlying driver of unfair access to

opportunities: the fast pace of their work, which left harried managers

sticking with the tried-and-true: someone already familiar with the task

at hand. This meant others never got the opportunity to learn new skills

and grow their careers.

The company started working on a development plan to help

employees access high-proﬁle opportunities, with the goal of improving

employees’ strengths both within their typical work area and outside,

in stretch assignments. This kind of upskilling will make the company

more resilient if someone leaves, eliminating the “single point of

failure” problem that exists in organizations that channel career-

enhancing work to the same few people over and over again.

# The EAC Model for Sustainable Progress

Interrupting bias sustainably requires three elements:

- Evidence: developing and tracking key metrics to pinpoint where bias

exists, establish baselines, and measure progress.

- Action: implementing evidence-based bias interrupters into existing

# business systems.

- Commitment: measuring progress and implementing stronger bias

interrupters until metrics improve.

The four companies we worked with are well on their way

with collecting evidence and taking action by implementing bias

interrupters, but time will tell whether they retain the commitment

to achieve year-over-year progress. Because bias is primed all the

time, bias interrupters need to be built into normal business processes

so that bias is interrupted all the time, too. The good news is that

they’re already collecting the metrics they need to continue pinpointing

inequality and identifying what needs to be ﬁxed.

Interrupting bias in access to opportunities won’t accomplish a

company’s goal of retaining talent if bias is allowed to ﬂourish in

other business systems, from hiring to performance evaluations to

compensation, and more. These business-system outcomes are often

## interlinked: For example, access to career-enhancing work should

be noted in performance evaluations and taken into account when

promotion decisions are being made.

This requires sustained eﬀort, but it pays oﬀ. After all, what’s the

point of recruiting the best talent if you can’t retain it? Upgrading your

business systems by integrating bias interrupters is a good investment

that will help every organization.
