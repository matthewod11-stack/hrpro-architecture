AI is changing the cost and availability of expertise, and that will

fundamentally alter how businesses organize and compete. At its most

basic level a business can be considered a diﬀerentiated bundle of

expertise organized to accomplish speciﬁc tasks. Expertise—which we

## deﬁne as a combination of deep theoretical knowledge and practical

know-how in a speciﬁc domain—can take many forms within a business. A doctor’s oﬃce requires not only a practitioner’s medical

knowledge to make fast and accurate patient diagnoses but also the

managerial capabilities to run a practice. A software company requires

expertise not only in software engineering but also in marketing, sales,

operations, and ﬁnance to bring its products to market. Companies create value by applying their expertise eﬃciently at scale to solve

problems for their customers. Typically they possess it in a variety

## of areas, but most diﬀerentiate themselves through their unique

proﬁciency in just a handful of activities that are fundamental to

how they create competitive advantage. Toyota’s superior expertise in

lean manufacturing has helped it become one of the world’s leading

automakers. Walmart has built superior expertise in distribution,

## Procter & Gamble in consumer marketing, and Nvidia in graphics

processing unit (GPU) design.

The evolution of expertise deﬁnes the evolution of business. Given

## the unrelenting nature of competition, companies must continually

improve how they deploy expertise to remain relevant. We’ve seen

the competitive advantage of many incumbents erode when new

expertise becomes critical for success in a market. In 2007 Nokia was

the global leader in mobile phones, commanding 40% of the market.

Its competitive advantage stemmed from expertise in hardware and

a highly tuned manufacturing process, which allowed the company

to achieve huge economies of scale and scope. The smartphone era

that followed required other types of expertise, especially in software.

Unable to build the expertise to design and foster a cohesive software

ecosystem, Nokia (along with the established phone manufacturers

Motorola, Sony Ericsson, and BlackBerry) quickly lost virtually all its

share to device manufacturers such as Apple and Samsung, which used

iOS and Android to run their phones.

# Two Fundamental Forces

Remaining on the frontier of expertise in important areas is

critical to any company’s success. Technological progress creates two

fundamental forces that complicate that challenge.

First, the overall body of expertise in the world is constantly expanding,

making it harder to stay at the leading edge in every relevant area.

For example, biotech companies are increasingly leveraging AI for drug

discovery—using it to analyze potential biological targets for new drugs,

to design new molecules, and to predict new drug-target interactions.

The ﬁeld is advancing rapidly, and the number of academic papers

referencing AI’s role and its application in drug discovery and other

areas of pharmaceutical research is growing exponentially. In 2001

fewer than 200 such papers were published. Twenty years later more

than 45,000 academic biology papers referenced AI. Staying abreast of

advances and insights is no longer possible for any individual scientist

or biotech company looking to use AI to accelerate discovery.

Second, the cost of accessing expertise is constantly falling. Although

that can beneﬁt existing companies, it can also lower the barriers

for new entrants. Think about how creator tools have transformed

the media landscape by reducing the cost of accessing expertise in

making and sharing high-quality content. Instagram and TikTok, for

example, provide video- and photo-editing tools, audio and music

integration, and analytics tools that enable amateurs to produce

professional content quickly and cheaply. Large brands have embraced

those platforms to reach their audiences, and individual artists and

inﬂuencers have adopted those tools to launch new businesses.

We believe that the interplay between these two factors—the increasing

amount of expertise required to create value and the decreasing cost

of accessing that expertise—shapes companies and aﬀects the scope

of their operations. The economist Ronald Coase, in his 1937 paper

“The Nature of the Firm,” argued that a company’s size and scope are

determined by the relationship between internal and external costs. If

internal costs fall, companies can expand their internal operations. If external costs fall, they will ﬁnd it more eﬃcient to source services from

# providers.

For most of industrial history Coase’s theory predicted the evolution of

businesses as the cost of access to expertise fell. During the Industrial

Revolution mechanization led to process standardization and labor

specialization, dramatically reducing production costs. Specialized

## expertise in areas such as machinery operations and maintenance

became more abundant and accessible, allowing enterprises to expand.

To keep pace with competition, they invested heavily in growing their

## internal expertise across product manufacturing, ﬁnance, sales, and

other functions, developing complex structures to manage sprawling

## operations. In recent years, however, the trend toward ever-expanding

operational scope has reversed as the breadth and level of expertise

needed to remain competitive has continued to grow.

Friedrich Hayek, a contemporary of Coase’s, believed that markets and

price systems would be more eﬀective than companies at accessing

and managing dispersed knowledge in society. Since the 1980s several

technological innovations have led companies to rely more and more

## on markets to access expertise far broader and deeper than what

could practically exist within a single entity. Those that use third-party

business and technology platform services have been able to narrow the

scope of their in-house expertise, allowing internal resources to focus on

the areas that drive their competitive diﬀerentiation.

The visual artist Enrico Pietracci digitally extends the pixels on the sides of his architectural photographs to see familiar forms in new and unexpected ways.

Developments in communications technology have played an

important role in this transition. As the cost of long-distance

interactions fell, companies found it increasingly viable to outsource

## customer service and other processes to specialists in low-cost

## regions. During the internet revolution technology platform companies

emerged, oﬀering businesses access to the expertise of expansive

ecosystems of partners. Today cloud platform companies such as

## Microsoft, Google, Amazon, and Alibaba provide cost-eﬀective and

scalable infrastructure and rich software solutions to their customers,

who no longer have to build custom applications and maintain large

workforces to run them.

A large direct-to-consumer retailer, for example, can now rely on

Shopify to build its e-commerce website, Google to advertise and

connect with consumers, Stripe to process payments, Amazon to

manage logistics and fulﬁllment, Salesforce and Workday to manage back-oﬃce applications, and Microsoft to provide secure cloud

computing and AI platforms. This modern commerce technology stack

is essentially an entire business platform. It allows retailers to focus

## their teams, management attention, and capital on the expertise

that truly matters for their brands—understanding their customers

and developing innovative products to suit their needs. The same

technology stack from the same providers also enables small and

medium-size businesses to compete with bigger players.

# What AI Will Mean for Companies

We are at an early stage in the AI era, and the technology is evolving

extremely quickly. Providers are rapidly introducing AI “copilots,”

“bots,” and “assistants” into applications to augment employees’

workﬂows. Examples include GitHub Copilot for coding, ServiceNow Now Assist to improve productivity and eﬃciency, and Salesforce’s

Agentforce for everyday business tasks. These tools have been trained

on a wide range of data sources and possess expertise in many domains.

Although the quality of expertise embedded in these tools is already

relatively high, the amount of it continues to grow swiftly while the

cost of accessing it decreases. (For example, the price for developers to

access OpenAI’s GPT-4 model from within their own applications has

fallen by more than 99% over the past 18 months.) In the relatively

near future more-advanced AI agents, equipped with greater capability

and broader expertise, will be able to act on behalf of users with their

# permission.

Companies that take advantage of AI will beneﬁt from what we call the triple product: more-eﬃcient operations, more-productive workforces,

## and growth with a sharper vision and focus.

Cost and time savings. Companies can transform many of their business processes and achieve new levels of eﬃciency by empowering

employees to leverage AI for discrete tasks.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Strategy in an Era of Abundant Expertise

Historically companies have looked to oﬀshoring and outsourcing

to reduce costs. However, they found it cost-eﬀective only if they

outsourced an entire process. Now, with AI assistants, people can access

expertise for individual tasks or steps within it, which allows them to

make improvements without having to move the entire process. The

ease and low cost of handoﬀs to AI mean that many processes can now be run far more eﬃciently. In the future workers at all levels

in a company may take on more-supervisory roles, approving actions

and managing exceptions as AI agents increasingly handle end-to-end

# execution.

Coding is an early example of a process undergoing transformation.

## AI tools such as GitHub Copilot, Amazon CodeWhisperer, Replit, and

Cursor enable developers to outsource manual, lower-value tasks,

including generating basic code, populating reference articles, and

suggesting unit tests to run. Developers can then focus on higher-value

tasks that require judgment and creativity, such as writing nuanced

code, troubleshooting, and performing security analysis, all of which lead to greater eﬃciencies and a better ﬁnished product. Many studies

have shown that developers using various AI coding tools are able to

complete tasks 20% to 55% faster. Most developers also reported that

they were able to focus on more-important work and felt more fulﬁlled

# in their jobs.

We already see a pattern in early deployments of AI assistants: They bring low performers up to levels previously considered average and boost the capabilities of high performers.

AI assistants are enabling process improvements in other domains as

well. A large real-world study found that generative AI assistants helped

customer service reps in a call center resolve 14% more issues per

hour. An experiment demonstrated that security professionals using

an AI assistant completed tasks 7% more accurately and 23% faster.

AI assistants are catalyzing transformation in many other processes,

including company-speciﬁc ones.

Moderna exempliﬁes how AI assistants can transform an entire

organization’s operations. By integrating advanced AI tools across its

business, the company has enabled its 6,000 employees to create more

than 900 specialized AI assistants that perform various tasks. Those

assistants are revolutionizing processes throughout the organization,

from optimizing drug doses for clinical trials to drafting responses to

regulatory inquiries. Tasks that once took weeks can be accomplished in

minutes, and Moderna’s employees can focus on higher-value activities.

Greater workforce productivity. We argue that today expertise follows a

normal distribution pattern within any given population of employees:

Some of them are simply more knowledgeable or skillful than others

owing to experience or inherent capabilities. As companies adopt

AI assistants, those assistants will eﬀectively put at least a base

amount of expertise into the hands of every employee who uses them,

enabling that person to perform better. We already see a pattern in

early deployments of AI assistants: They bring low performers up to

levels previously considered average and boost the capabilities of high

# performers (albeit to a lesser extent).

A recent randomized controlled trial conducted by BCG and researchers

## at Harvard’s Digital Data Design Institute (which Karim cofounded

and chairs) provides evidence of this pattern. It found that a group

of BCG consultants who used AI displayed greater productivity than

a control group did. The AI-augmented consultants completed 12%

more tasks, on average, and did so 25% faster. When BCG scored the

quality of each consultant’s output, it found that the use of AI led

## to improvements across the board—but especially with lower-skilled

consultants, whose scores rose 43% while the scores of the highest-

skilled employees rose 17%.

Using AI to augment the expertise and thus the capabilities of

employees has multiple implications. It may reduce the time and cost to

onboard new hires, broaden the pool of those who can perform speciﬁc

processes, and provide more ﬂexibility in how employees are deployed

to achieve outcomes. It also has implications for organizational

structure if median performance levels can be achieved with less

oversight from a manager and if any employee can eventually command

a range of AI agents to get jobs done. Some companies may adopt wider

managerial spans, while others may choose to operate with more tightly

scoped teams, with each team member managing a ﬂeet of AI agents.

More investment in activities that matter. As AI agents and bots

## transform business processes and empower workforces, companies will

be able to fundamentally rethink how they deploy their resources.

Smart ones will identify the handful of processes in which they can

provide world-class expertise and capabilities and reallocate resources

to deepen the moats around those processes. At the same time, they will

reduce employees’ focus on noncore processes by leveraging AI-enabled

platforms provided by third parties.

An early example of this shift can be seen at FocusFuel, a purveyor

of caﬀeinated gummies. Founded in 2023 by a trio of entrepreneurs

and marketers in partnership with a collective of gamers, athletes,

and content creators, the company has utilized gen AI technologies

across its entire value chain. The founders identiﬁed their core

competencies as understanding the needs of their target market

and developing innovative products. They then strategically deployed

AI assistants to handle noncore activities such as market analysis,

supplier identiﬁcation, packaging design, and marketing strategy. By

building on its AI-enabled platforms, FocusFuel was able to set up its entire operation in just a few months, eﬃciently outsourcing

## manufacturing and distribution to third-party experts. That approach

allowed the founders to focus their time and resources on reﬁning their

## product strategy and building relationships with their customer base—

areas where their unique expertise provides a sustainable competitive

advantage. FocusFuel’s rapid launch, lean operating model, and early

growth (the company says revenues “reached seven ﬁgures” in its

ﬁrst eight months) suggest that enterprises can thrive by strategically

leveraging AI platforms for noncore functions while concentrating their

## eﬀorts on diﬀerentiated, value-creating activities.

# Getting Going

Clearly the companies that are best at continually increasing their

triple-product return will have the greatest chance of competitive

success. But getting there is hard. It involves meeting digital

transformation requirements, aligning teams around a new course of

action, helping people across the company change their behavior to

maximize the beneﬁts of working with AI, and reallocating budgets.

So how should companies proceed?

Let’s start with the assumption that organizations should be far along

## on the digital transformation journey, especially with the digitization

## of data, the adoption of cloud computing, and the establishment of

security and governance protocols. Digital transformation can be a

long process; expecting to complete it before trying to realize any

beneﬁts from AI is unrealistic. It’s best to begin with a small number

of business processes, maybe even just one, in which AI can be easily

deployed and where it has already proved valuable for other companies.

## Coding, customer service, marketing, and general productivity tasks

are a few prime examples. Those processes usually have digitized

data and software-centric workﬂows that make achieving AI-based

# improvements easier.

AI safety and governance are foundational

to success as well. Given the risks of bias,

# misinformation, deep fakes, and

cyberattacks, companies have to establish

# clear guidelines and principles to

safeguard their AI eﬀorts. Again, these are

hard to create in the abstract and much

easier when a speciﬁc business process is

the focus. Trust and safety should be

# Enrico Pietracci

# among the top priorities for any

organization exploring artiﬁcial

# intelligence.

As with any transformation, persuading people and achieving

organizational change can be even more challenging than technical

## implementation. In addition to the tried-and-true principles of change

management, an eﬀective way to drive change in this case is to cultivate

a group of employees who are early adopters of AI in select processes

and empower them to become AI champions within the organization.

They can serve as role models and peer mentors, accelerating adoption

# at every level of the company.

However, the imperative that all employees learn AI cannot be

overstated. Moderna’s success in rapidly deploying gen AI across

its enterprise was enabled by the creation of an “AI academy”—a

mandatory internal course that included 20 hours of training on AI and

its business impact. Research shows that AI can fail at the front lines,

and employee training is an important way to avoid that outcome.

Finally, a budget should be allocated for even early activities. As

companies realize a greater triple-product return, the cost of using AI

will be more than oﬀset by productivity gains. Organizations will begin

to regard AI as a core element in the budgets of all divisions, be they

## lines of business, functions, or the corporate center.

Coursera provides a great example of a company that started with

a speciﬁc process—in this case coding—and now innovates rapidly

and broadly with AI across a range of activities. When ChatGPT was

introduced, Coursera’s CEO, Jeﬀ Maggioncalda, quickly recognized

the potential of gen AI and started bringing it into his company. He

believed that Coursera’s software engineers needed to better understand

emerging gen AI capabilities to truly create value. His company hired a

ﬁrm that specialized in gen AI coding techniques to conduct training

for its software developers. It also introduced an AI assistant that helped its engineers code more eﬃciently. Equipped with knowledge

and tools, the teams at Coursera were able within just a year to

incorporate AI capabilities into several products, such as translation,

personalized learning, and automated course creation. By learning and

doing, Coursera’s employees have positioned themselves to continue

innovating and to stay ahead of the competition as new AI capabilities

# become available.

# Implications for Strategy

If companies derive value from providing a diﬀerentiated bundle of

expertise, how can they continue to be relevant when improvements

in AI’s core capabilities make some or all of that expertise more easily

available to competitors and customers? What is the basis for value

# capture in an era of abundant expertise?

## HBR / Magazine Article / Strategy in an Era of Abundant Expertise

We believe that every company will need to reevaluate its strategy in

this changing era and will have to ask itself three questions.

- 1. Which aspects of the problem we now solve for customers will

customers use AI to solve themselves? Consider the work of travel

agents. For many years customers have been able to ﬁnd information

about travel destinations and book reservations online. Now they can

simply consult AI apps to create tailored travel itineraries based on

their unique preferences. As AI’s ability to take action improves, it

will be able to make reservations as well. Travel agents will need

to reinvent themselves—perhaps by organizing unique events and

# experiences for their clients.

- 2. Which types of expertise that we currently possess will need

to evolve most if we are to remain ahead of AI’s capabilities?

Companies must continue to develop their unique expertise to

provide value beyond what AI provides. For example, in the medical

ﬁeld AI can in some cases perform image-based diagnoses more accurately than physicians can. As doctors’ oﬃces enter this new age,

they will need to acquire nontechnical capabilities, such as empathy,

caregiving, and working collaboratively with a team of healthcare

professionals to design the right course of treatment for a patient.

- 3. Which assets can we build or augment to enhance our ability to

stay competitive as AI advances? As AI comes to oﬀer a broader

range of expertise, companies will need to look to other sources

of durable advantage. Those that AI is currently unlikely to aﬀect

include brands, customer relationships, ownership of scarce physical

assets, and network eﬀects. For example, a consumer-product

designer can now use AI to create new prototype designs to meet

certain speciﬁcations. The designs are informed by the quality and

nuance of the speciﬁcations, which will have been shaped by more

in-depth and insightfully designed customer research. The ability

to gather that research may eventually become more diﬀerentiating

than the raw ability to create designs. A deep and trusted relationship

with customers could be the best way to underpin and sustain that

# capability.

. . .

Without question, companies will continue to use bundles of

diﬀerentiated expertise and other hard-to-replicate assets to create and

capture value. But the expertise and assets that proved valuable in

the past will need to be reexamined as AI improves. Over time the

organizations that fully exploit AI to rapidly adapt their operations and

strategy are the ones that will thrive.
