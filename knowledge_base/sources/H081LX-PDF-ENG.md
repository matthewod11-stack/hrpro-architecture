Sunil, a seasoned executive at a leading tech ﬁrm, was known for

his humility. He rarely took credit for his achievements, preferring

to share praise with his team, and he would always seek consensus

before making decisions. While his approach fostered a positive team

environment, it also led to perceptions of indecisiveness, especially

during critical decision-making moments. This came to a head when

a delay, caused by his hesitancy to act without full consensus, cost

the company a lucrative market opportunity. It was a turning point

for Sunil, highlighting a complex truth: Humility, while a virtue, can

sometimes be a double-edged sword in leadership.

Humble leadership is characterized by a willingness to admit a

mistake or when you don’t know something, a tendency to share

## credit for successes, and an appreciation for others’ contributions.

This leadership style is built on self-awareness, respect for others,

and a focus on collective over individual success. Research has shown

that humble leaders foster increased employee engagement, trust, and

collaboration within their team. These leaders are seen as approachable

and open to feedback, which encourages a culture of continuous

# improvement and adaptability.

However, the adage “too much of a good thing” can also apply when

it comes to humility. As I have seen in my work as an executive

coach for both top corporate leaders and those newly taking the reins,

an overemphasis on humility can potentially diminish your perceived

authority. The challenge for leaders like Sunil lies in striking a delicate

balance between modesty and assertiveness to be eﬀective. Here are

three ways I’ve seen humility hinder a leader’s eﬀectiveness.

- 1. You may be perceived as indecisive.

## This common perception arises because humble leaders, in their quest

to value every team member’s input, may prioritize consensus over

swift decision-making. While their intention might be to democratize

the decision-making process, it can sometimes be misconstrued as a

reluctance to take a stand or a lack of conviction in their strategic vision.

Eﬀective leaders recognize that true humility isn’t just about

downplaying your authority; it’s about conﬁdently wielding it when the

situation calls for it. The challenge lies in demonstrating that seeking

input doesn’t mean you’re uncertain about direction but rather that

it’s a strength that can lead to more informed and comprehensive

# outcomes.

Recognizing this, I advised Sunil to reﬁne his leadership approach. The

goal was to maintain his humility while also cultivating the ability

to make and stand by strategic decisions, even when consensus was

# elusive.

I suggested that he start by setting clear decision-making frameworks

within his team, where the scope for input and the points at which

a decision would be made should be clearly deﬁned, as well as who

had ownership over the decision and whether it would be made with

or without full consensus. This approach allowed for a structured yet

inclusive process, reassuring the team that their insights were valued

but also setting the expectation that not all decisions would be made by

# committee.

I also encouraged Sunil to communicate his strategic vision more

assertively, framing decisions within the context of the vision to

illustrate how speciﬁc actions aligned with broader organizational

goals. This helped his team understand the “why” behind decisions,

enhancing their trust in his leadership even when they weren’t directly

involved in the decision-making process.

Over time, Sunil reported a signiﬁcant shift in both his team’s dynamics

and his own leadership style. His team began to appreciate the

clarity and direction provided by this new approach, which balanced

inclusivity with decisiveness. He found that his conﬁdence in making

tough calls was bolstered by the understanding that true humility

involves empowering others through clear leadership, not abdicating

## responsibility. This evolution in his leadership approach not only

accelerated project timelines but also reinforced his authority and the

respect he commanded as a leader, all while maintaining the essence of

# his humble leadership style.

- 2. You may hinder your career advancement.

You might think that deﬂecting praise or giving all the credit to your

team would motivate them and brand you as a selﬂess leader, but it also

can have detrimental eﬀects. For instance, one of my clients, the general

manager of a manufacturing facility, exhibited this tendency. When her team successfully implemented a new, more eﬃcient production

process that signiﬁcantly reduced costs and downtime, she attributed

## the success solely to her team during a company-wide meeting, even

though her strategic direction and leadership were pivotal in the

# project.

Furthermore, when praised by her superiors, she would often respond

with “It was nothing, just doing my job” or “I was just lucky to

have a great team,” eﬀectively erasing her own critical role in these

achievements. This consistent deﬂection not only diminished her

visibility but also inadvertently limited her political capital, essential

for her own future leadership opportunities and for cultivating the

organizational inﬂuence necessary to help her team, whether in the

## form of access to budget or promotion opportunities for talented

# employees.

When you’re seen as a successful and powerful force in the organization,

you’re far more likely to persuade others to support your agenda —

and you can ease the path for both ideas and staﬀ that you care

about. This requires ﬁnding the right balance between humility and

conﬁdence. Research suggests that dual-promotion, in which you

compliment a colleague, peer, team, or competitor while also sharing

your own accomplishments, can be a powerful strategy. For instance,

when you’re recognized for leading a successful project, you might

respond with: “Thank you. I’m proud of what we have achieved. It was a

collective eﬀort, and I want to highlight my team members’ innovative

approach that signiﬁcantly contributed to our success.” This way, you

acknowledge your role in the achievement while also uplifting your

team members’ contributions.

- 3. You may be limiting your team’s development.

Humble leaders often perceive themselves as equals with their team in

the trenches. They live by the ethos that their time is not more precious

than their colleagues’ time, and they worry that delegating could be

seen as oppressive or demotivating. This belief stems from a fear of

imposing on their team, but it can paradoxically stiﬂe their growth and

development opportunities. Excessive modesty can prevent you from

eﬀectively delegating tasks, leading to an unsustainable workload and

eventual burnout. True humility in leadership means acknowledging

your team’s capabilities and ensuring that you’re leveraging them

# eﬀectively.

Consider a leader who, in an eﬀort not to overburden the team, assumes

responsibility for administrative tasks, such as taking meeting notes

or planning team meetings. While the intention is to lighten the

team’s load, this approach inadvertently deprives team members of

opportunities to enhance their organizational and coordination skills.

The leader’s well-intentioned actions result in a heavy workload for

themselves while simultaneously limiting the team’s exposure to these

# foundational experiences.

Additionally, research by Zenger Folkman has shown that the most

eﬀective leaders delegate not merely to lighten their own loads but to

focus more on strategic initiatives. They understand that delegation isn’t strictly about oﬄoading tasks but rather about expanding the

# team’s capacity and resilience.

Seen through this lens, eﬀective delegation itself becomes an act of

humility: It requires a leader to empower their team, trusting them to

rise to the challenge and fostering an environment where everyone can

excel. This nuanced understanding of humility encourages leaders to

balance their responsibilities and liberate their teams to realize their full

# potential.

Being a humble leader is great — in most circumstances. But like

many things, taken to an extreme, it can end up harming your career

and the prospects of your team. Becoming aware of situations where

humility can extend too far enables you to guard against excesses

and leverage the power of your genuine desire to highlight others —

without sacriﬁcing too much along the way. The key lies in cultivating a

balanced approach, combining humility with assertiveness.
