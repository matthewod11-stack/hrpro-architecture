The anatomy professor scanned the room of medical students and

college women. Based on the majority women group, he joked aloud, “I

should be careful or this could be a #MeToo moment.” He pointed to the

pelvis mannequins positioned in the open leg position. They served as

## training simulators for the cervix, uterus, and ovary examinations. He

smiled at the undergraduates and motioned to the plastic models: “Don’t

worry, you won’t have to do this position.” Later, a male supervisor, who

was told of the anatomy professor’s behavior, described him as a decades-

long friend, saying: “Oh, he didn’t mean anything by that. He’s a good

# guy.”

## HBR / Digital Article / Stop Protecting “Good Guys”

At a national committee meeting, a woman physician proposed a policy

on patient safety and the challenges of hospital crowding. She presented

data and suggested language for the committee’s statement. Her male

colleague interrupted her mid-presentation, talked over her, and usurped

the conversation. He called her naïve, inexperienced, and an ineffective

## communicator, despite her 10 years of practice expertise. Six colleagues

witnessed the heated verbal exchange, including his personal attacks.

They remained silent. The meeting ended, and the committee chair pulled

her aside: “Don’t take it personally. Cut him some slack. I know he didn’t

mean it. He’s a good guy.”

These two vignettes are composites, based on real accounts, that

illustrate a common strategy for enabling and protecting perpetrators of

sexism and sexual harassment. Rates of sexual harassment in medicine

## outpace all other science, technology, engineering, mathematics, and

medicine (STEMM) ﬁelds. Although women comprise the majority of

the healthcare workforce, the majority of healthcare leaders are men.

The academic medicine culture in particular is historically permissive

of sexual harassment and bias perpetuated by men. More so, the

atmosphere of repercussion and retaliation makes it challenging for

women to speak up. Research suggests that men do not condone sexist

behavior, but at the same time, they are reluctant to confront other

men. Reasons include a fear of the wimp penalty (being seen as a wimp

or weak by other men) or of violating the bro code. This implicit rule

## of behavior governs many man-man relationships, both personal and

professional, and perpetuates a sexist workplace culture, compelling

men to support other men — including their bad behavior — at all costs.

We deﬁne the “good guy” defense as minimizing, excusing, or deﬂecting

the sexist or harassing behavior of a man by appealing to the utility

of this commonly used phrase. In calling someone a “good guy” as

an explain-away defense, men and medical institutions are oﬀering

an endorsement of the oﬀender’s moral character, suggesting his

innocence, and signaling an allegiance to him. The “good guy” defense

serves two salient functions: to gaslight women and to enable the

# oﬀender.

When a woman is interrupted, dismissed, made to feel incompetent,

sexually harassed, and subsequently decides to share her experiences,

it is too often that men — more often than women — respond with

invalidating statements. In our experience, these may include, “I’m sure

he didn’t mean anything by that,” “Oh, but he has daughters,” “Oh, but

he mentors women all the time,” “He ﬂirts with everyone,” and “It’s not

a big deal; you’re being too sensitive.” Men often are given a pass on

harassing behavior with statements like, “He doesn’t know any better,”

or “Things were diﬀerent when he was in training.” Referring to a man’s

character or older age as a get out of jail free card robs the opportunity to

help him overcome a blind spot in his leadership.

Each of these commonly related sentiments challenge the legitimacy of

the woman’s experience. As bad as these phrases are, they actually pale

in comparison to “He’s a good guy.” This phrase inherently deﬂects the

conversation to the perpetrator’s character, implying that a good man in

other contexts could only have intended good behavior in this particular

situation. Vouching for a man’s goodness also disarms the victim and

undermines a woman’s ability to hold the harasser accountable.

A second problem with the “good guy” defense is that it prevents

accountability for the oﬀender, while perpetuating a misogynistic

culture in which women feel devalued and unsafe. Motivations for dismissing a colleague’s behavior include reluctance to have diﬃcult

conversations with repeat oﬀenders, discomfort acknowledging that a

good colleague has behaved inappropriately or illegally, fear of violating

sexist workplace norms, or even anxiety. Calling out this behavior

may make men self-conscious about their own previous embarrassing

or improper conduct. Whatever the motivation, enabling bad actors

perpetuates a toxic culture of harassment.

The “good guy” defense is common in medicine, but it is not the

only ﬁeld with this problem. A study on enabling perpetrators of

sexual harassment across diverse organizations discovered “networks

of complicity.” In other words, perpetrators surround themselves with

networks of colleagues who minimize and excuse their behavior.

Publicly, we have seen the “good guy” defense used to excuse

sexism and sexually harassing behavior of men in the ﬁlm industry,

professional sports, and politics. Still, the medical profession has

inadvertently cultivated and ampliﬁed the “good guy” defense through

a reverence for the history and tradition of medicine, long dominated

by men. Even the strongest, bravest, most resilient women may stop

speaking up when they see these faux “good guys” systematically

protected.

We can do better. We need to shift workplace cultures from one that

protects and perpetuates sexism and misogyny to one that is notable

for men as authentic allies. Male leaders should set the example for

younger generations of leaders. They can start by validating women’s

experiences and follow this up by removing “good guy” as their knee-

jerk defense. Here are ﬁve ways we can begin to take back the term

# “good guys”:

Improve your situational awareness.

Learn how to identify sexist behavior — more speciﬁcally, harassment.

Research on mitigating the bystander eﬀect reveals that noticing and

correctly labeling the behavior is a key ﬁrst step. Men, in particular,

can deliberately build gender intelligence by reading and learning the

data through rigorously conducted reports, such as McKinsey’s Women

## in the Workplace 2021 and the Sexual Harassment of Women National

## Academies of Sciences Engineering and Medicine 2018 report. Start by

checking in with the target of this behavior when you witness it. This

validates her experience. For example, I noticed that your manager

dismissed you and the other women’s expertise in the meeting. It feels

sexist to me. Am I reading this right?

Check your own impulse to gaslight.

The next time a woman colleague reports a sexist or harassing

encounter, be sure that nothing you say might lead her to believe she’s

misreading the perpetrator’s behavior or blowing it out of proportion.

Try something like: I believe you. From what you’ve described, that

behavior doesn’t sound appropriate. Can you tell me more, and can I team

up with you to address it? These responses oﬀer support while allowing

you to gather more information about the occurrence.

Hold other men accountable.

## Active confrontation of other men for sexism, bias, harassment, and

all manner of inappropriate behavior may be the toughest part of male

allyship. But it is essential to eliminating the “good guy” defense. Don’t

tell the target of harassment or misogyny that the perpetrator is a “good

guy.” Address the behavior with the man in question. We call this the

carefrontation, contextualizing confrontation as an act of caring on the

part of a friend or colleague. Try: That comment was inappropriate and

demeaning. I found it offensive and it was clearly offensive to our women

colleagues. I know you can do better. Alternatively, you could say, You

and I go way back and we’re friends. I heard what you said/what you did.

We don’t do that here. You need to make amends and be more respectful.

# Use positive reinforcement.

Reinforcing people — especially men — for desired workplace

behaviors (e.g., disrupting sexism and harassment and holding others

accountable) is a powerful motivator. Try: I really appreciated it when

you spoke up about our coworker’s inappropriate and offensive joke.

Everyone saw what you did and it had a positive effect on the team. Of

course, reinforcement can have the added value of inﬂuencing others

when done in public. For instance, Thank you for saying that. I was also

uncomfortable with that comment and I agree that’s just not what we do

# here.

## Integrate these conversations into your organization’s culture.

Where the “good guy” defense is prevalent, engage team members in

discussions about the impact this phrase has on people. Encourage

## others to share their experiences with the “good guy” defense and

why we should drop it. Include vignettes or examples of the “good

guy” defense at training programs. Leaders throughout an organization

## need exposure and best practice refreshers regularly, so they can

better handle these situations. Inclusion in high-visibility programs

demonstrates a commitment to improving workplace culture.

The time is now to ask leaders, managers, and bystanders to stand

up and end the “good guy” defense. It is an ethical and professional

responsibility to do so. It’s time to take back the term “good guy.” Rather

than a tool for enabling and protecting the status quo, we should insist

it be used as an aspirational target for men collaborating with women to

create a respectful, digniﬁed, and inclusive workplace.
