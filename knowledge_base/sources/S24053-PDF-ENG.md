What could our senior leadership team achieve if we worked at full

potential? And what’s keeping us from achieving it? Those were the

questions the leaders at Root Capital found themselves asking in 2022.

Founded in 1999 by Willy Foote, the nonproﬁt investment ﬁrm provides

## small working-capital loans to farm cooperatives in Africa, Latin

America, and Southeast Asia. In its successful ﬁrst two decades, the

company was run by Foote and a team of passionate, energetic leaders.

But as it grew in both size and ambition, its management challenges

grew as well. In 2018, the ﬁrm added a chief operating oﬃcer to run

day-to-day operations so that Foote could devote more of his attention

## to organizational culture and stakeholder relationships.

In 2020, Root launched a ﬁve-year growth strategy, which included

new lending and advisory services. It required changes to certain

roles on the top team and the addition of several new roles. It also

required a high level of cross-functional integration and collaboration—

neither of which were strengths of the ﬁrm. Innovation often seemed

disconnected from the business, strategy execution was moving too

slowly, and too many decisions were bubbling all the way to the top,

slowing down the organization. Then Covid hit, and all aspects of

leading the ﬁrm became harder, with compounding repercussions for

## the inner workings of senior management and the organization as a

# whole.

By 2022, Root’s top leaders had lost the structure and discipline

of meeting, debating, and leading as a team. Some executives were

included in discussions about how to deploy new capital infusions while

others were not. Communication became siloed and inconsistent. The

broader organization was hungry for clarity of purpose and direction

from the top but was not getting it. “We were a team only in name,”

Foote says. “We were drifting, and the organization saw and felt it.”

Root’s leaders had arrived at a point of reckoning. So they held a mirror

up to themselves, and with vulnerability and humility they began to

focus on developing new collective behaviors that would help them be more eﬀective as a team. They examined everything from how often

they met and how they debated issues to how they developed strategy

# together.

Root’s investment in its top team had a big impact on organizational

performance. This is not surprising: A recent Bain & Company

study of 1,250 companies found that organizations led by highly eﬀective executive teams had revenue growth, proﬁtability, and total

shareholder returns that were three times higher than the study group’s average. Research also shows that highly eﬀective leadership teams are

correlated with consistently high employee retention, productivity, and morale. In short, they are force multipliers: Eﬀectiveness radiates from

## the top team throughout the organization.

But so does ineﬀectiveness. Poorly functioning top teams can

spread malaise across their companies, creating a powerful drag

on productivity, lowering revenue, and leading to higher employee

turnover. The problem is pervasive: Roughly two-thirds of the senior

executives surveyed in 2020 by the Center for Creative Leadership felt that their top team was ineﬀective, and only 20% felt that their

team was high performing. (We deﬁne a top team as any leadership

## team responsible for the creation of a strategy and accountable for its

## execution by others in its organization, business unit, or function.)

It’s easy to sympathize with the challenges that leaders face. Teaming

is diﬃcult at any level, but for top teams, the challenges expand

exponentially. They are responsible for addressing their organization’s

weightiest and most complex problems, so their struggles are almost

existential. As one expert put it, these teams “exist to get really hard stuﬀ done.”

Part of the problem is that companies prioritize the development of

individual leaders over leadership teams—an understandable choice,

given that business schools, management books, and the media all

celebrate leadership as a solo skill. Another obstacle to high-performing

teams is internal dynamics. It’s common for individual members or

factions to have opposing viewpoints or conﬂicting communication

styles; it’s also common for teams not to address—or even recognize

—those dynamics. To their detriment, top teams tend to keep such

diﬃculties secret, fearful that acknowledging their struggles could

shake the conﬁdence of their many stakeholders. Instead, they either

grind along in silent mediocrity, or the CEO tries to root out the problem

by replacing seemingly problematic team members.

Both paths lead to dysfunction. Instead, organizations need to prioritize the development of strong and eﬀective leadership teams that function

## as a collective behavioral unit rather than a loose aﬃliation of

individual leaders. That’s what the team at Root Capital did: The leaders acknowledged that the hard, deliberate, and sustained eﬀort that it

takes to become a team is actually part and parcel of being a team.

In this article, we’ll discuss the key traits of eﬀective top teams that we

## (together with our colleague Ineet Narula) identiﬁed in our research and

on-the-ground consulting work. Then we’ll lay out a four-step process to help you use those behaviors to boost the eﬀectiveness of your own

# team.

# Five Traits of Effective Top Teams

Not all eﬀective top teams are the same, of course. But after

studying hundreds of them across 11 industries and six continents, we identiﬁed ﬁve behavior traits that eﬀective top teams have in common:

## direction, discipline, drive, dynamism, and collaboration. These traits

are collective: They characterize the behaviors of the team as a whole,

# not those of its individual members.

Let’s consider each trait in turn.

Direction. How a top team works together to set the organization’s

direction—its purpose, vision, and strategy—is a cornerstone of its eﬀectiveness. Team members must be aligned on and share ownership

of their short- and long-term priorities. They must exhibit public

commitment to one another and their strategy, even when facing

## pressure from outside forces and other teams within the organization.

When a team is not aligned on the priorities that propel its strategy, it

can easily lose direction. That’s what happened at a rapidly growing

technology company in Southeast Asia that we worked with. As it

navigated a major scale-up, its top team lost its way. Although the team

members shared a bold long-term vision to achieve unicorn status, they

had not articulated their immediate and short-term strategic priorities,

and in that vacuum, they individually began pressuring the founder to

fund their particular strategies. This created divisions within the team and pulled the company in diﬀerent directions, causing collaboration, innovation, and growth to suﬀer. The team was very busy, but much of

its time and energy went to working on the wrong things.

When the top team recognized that it had a problem, the leaders looked

inward to address it. First they developed an inclusive list of all the

strategic priorities, and the members each ranked their top three. After

discussion and debate, they settled on the ﬁve most critical priorities

for the business overall. At subsequent meetings, they kept their focus on those priorities. If things got oﬀ track, every team member had

permission to stop the discussion and refocus the team. Through

practice this became a team behavior.

The team also built a stronger sense of direction through clear

communication and active listening. Together, they arrived at an

understanding of how individual and team goals related to the overall

business strategy and began to cultivate a culture of ownership and commitment. Those eﬀorts paid oﬀ: The team stopped funding

initiatives in isolation and began moving in a uniﬁed direction.

Discipline. In order to make and execute decisions consistently, have

## productive meetings, and practice healthy norms and routines, team

members need to have a clear understanding of their own and

one another’s roles—and all too often, they don’t. CEOs are often

perplexed to learn that members of their top team don’t suﬃciently

understand their peers’ strategies, objectives, and deliverables, or

how they spend their days in pursuit of them. When members don’t

know those things, they can’t fully support one another or identify

the interdependencies among their agendas that would encourage

cooperation. More concerning perhaps, team members are often not

clear on the role of the team itself. Many are unable to answer the

question “What kind of team must we become to lead our strategy and

people?” They may even struggle with a more existential one: “Why are

# we here?”

For many top teams, a lack of discipline, particularly in managing

meetings, can be at the core of problems. Meetings are a mainspring in team eﬀectiveness because they create the time and space for eﬀective traits and behaviors to ﬂourish. But getting meetings right

is deceptively diﬃcult, often because team members don’t appreciate

their importance to business performance and thus fail to give them

their due focus. To get the most out of meetings, each team member

must be disciplined in properly preparing for, participating in, and

following up after them. At Root, Foote and the COO introduced a seemingly simple procedural shift that had an outsize eﬀect: They

stopped cochairing meetings and deputized team members to preside over them instead. The eﬀect was to distribute leadership among the

members, giving the whole team a greater sense of shared ownership.

The new regime sharpened the team’s decision-making discipline and

produced better alignment between decisions and strategy.

Teams can further strengthen their discipline by coauthoring a one-

page charter clarifying the team’s purpose, focus, collective behaviors,

norms, and routines. This work is both pragmatic and symbolic. When

the members of the top team at Root Capital engaged in this exercise,

they found that it not only helped them improve focus and eﬃciency

but also gave them a powerful vision of themselves as a single cohesive

## unit rather than a collection of individuals.

Drive. Top teams with drive prepare assiduously, debate constructively,

and are industrious and resilient over the long term. They know how

to prepare for and surmount obstacles. As the COO of one global

consumer-products company told us, teams with drive do “the hard

work of doing the hard work.”

Drive is pivotal when a top team faces a crisis. That was the case for one

life-sciences company we worked with after it learned that it was being

investigated by the Securities and Exchange Commission. The CEO and

his top executives were certain that there had been no wrongdoing,

so they devised a plan for how they would behave as a team: They

would face every diﬃculty head-on, immediately, and with optimism.

When the SEC made a request, they would work together to address

it, regardless of whose domain was at issue. They would pay careful

attention to detail. Most important, they would be resilient, engaging in

## constructive debate throughout the process.

The strategy worked. “Our team lived and breathed these behaviors

for six months,” the company’s general counsel told us—and the SEC

ultimately cleared the company of any violations. In the process, the

team developed an enduring mindset and behaviors that have since allowed it to surmount other obstacles and to diﬀerentiate between

problems that can be solved and those that can be only mitigated.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Teamwork at the Top

Not surprisingly, our research shows that the top teams of many of the

companies that thrived during Covid exhibited high levels of drive.

Dynamism. Dynamic teams treat change as constant and positive. They

actively scout information from outside and inside their organization so that they can take advantage of opportunities and head oﬀ challenges.

They have a bias for action and respond with speed and ﬂexibility

to new scenarios, modifying plans and executing accordingly. They

invest in resources to accelerate innovation and protect initiatives from

anything that might undermine them. They set compensation and

incentives to support risk-taking and don’t penalize for failure.

In business, as in life, allowing for the possibility of failure is important

because it’s a prime source for learning and positive change. But top

teams typically avoid practicing this behavior. In the high-stakes world

they work in, failure can be a terrifying prospect, but aversion to risk undercuts dynamism and means that leaders can’t respond eﬀectively

to change.

A better approach is for top teams to publicly recognize the

opportunities for learning that failure provides. That’s what happened

at a major pharmaceuticals company we worked with. The team

that leads the ﬁrm’s center of excellence for talent—which serves a

## workforce of 80,000—spends 15 minutes of every monthly meeting

studying the “failure of the month.” It’s an agenda item that many look

forward to because it’s constructive and free of judgment.

Collaboration. The very heart of teaming is collaboration. It combines

direction, discipline, drive, and dynamism, and it thrives in an

## environment of connection, inclusion, and trust. Collaborative

behaviors include developing personal relationships, giving everybody

an equal voice, and sticking to commitments. Teams that excel at

collaboration create the psychological safety needed to give and

take feedback, listen actively, brainstorm, solve problems, and hold

themselves accountable. None of this just happens on its own. It’s hard

to collaborate well and consistently without instruction and practice.

Collaboration can be especially challenging during mergers or in

multicultural team environments. Consider the case of an Asia-

headquartered technology ﬁrm we worked with. After acquiring a

European competitor, it entered a prolonged period of integration,

during which a ﬁerce battle raged over who would become the

combined regional CEO. When the selection was ﬁnally made, the

new regional CEO was left with a fragmented, angry top team that

somehow had to ﬁnd a way to meet high-growth expectations from

the corporate center. For the ﬁrst six months the members of the team

chased individual goals, struggled to make decisions, and increasingly

avoided one another.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Teamwork at the Top

To break the cycle, the regional CEO scheduled a series of top-team oﬀ-sites designed to build personal relationships and foster mutual

empathy—two key enablers of collaboration. The ﬁrst meeting started

with the team sharing stories that highlighted their values and past

## experience. Anonymous quotes and data about the team’s functioning

were gathered from members in advance and shared to help build a

picture of strengths and gaps. Two things in particular helped the team

bond. First, the regional CEO modeled vulnerability by highlighting an

area in which he needed to improve. And second, the team created a

charter that identiﬁed their purpose, desired behaviors, focus areas, and

# priorities for the year.

Building cohesion was also a key priority. After the oﬀ-site, the team

began every meeting with a “team moment” during which members

talked about their behaviors and made plans for relationship-building

social outings. Within a year, the regional CEO saw a meaningful

improvement in collaboration. Mutual support and empathy were

clearly evident during meetings. Leaning on the team charter, the team

had begun to behave as a collective.

# Four Steps to Success

Top teams seeking to become more eﬀective can take these four steps.

- 1. Commit and invest. The ﬁrst step is to make a commitment that

teaming is a core skill at all levels of your organization—and that you

and your team will model the right collective behaviors. Your team must

make an explicit commitment to invest time and money establishing

and nurturing the ﬁve traits discussed earlier. Four hours once a year during the executive oﬀ-site won’t cut it, and funding can’t be patched

together from other budgets. You’ll need to secure resources and make

time on your calendar at regular intervals to work on capabilities so that

they become routine behaviors.

The price of not making this investment became clear to many

companies during the Covid era. In the two years of remote work that

followed lockdowns, one leadership team watched its cohesion erode.

“We lost our personal connections,” the CEO told us. “It felt like we

had disbanded.” When subsequently drafting a new team charter, the

team committed to routinely meeting in person. A sprint team devised

a budget for travel, accommodation, and other costs for two days every quarter, one half-day of which was devoted to team-eﬀectiveness

# training.

- 2. Hold up the mirror. To determine how you’re currently working together, conduct a team-eﬀectiveness diagnostic. Focus on understanding how your team views itself as well as how others see

it. Use a survey or interviews to get members’ opinions on their

## experience of the team—everything from its culture and climate to

its operations and routines. Survey your direct reports or run focus

groups to get an outside-in perspective. Ask questions about whether

the team is demonstrating the ﬁve traits or not. Whenever possible,

ensure anonymity and conﬁdentiality to encourage candor.

This process reveals truths that can help a team get better faster.

Consider the experience of one ﬁntech CEO who, on the basis of

anecdotal evidence and his own observations, was certain that his

team’s struggles stemmed from animosity between two business heads.

Anonymous surveys and conﬁdential interviews revealed that the

problems went deeper, however, including a general lack of agreement

## on the company’s overall strategy and the existence of in-groups and

out-groups. The CEO assigned the two business-unit heads to cochair

a series of strategy triage sessions and provided training in dilemma

management to help them identify interdependencies among their

respective objectives. They soon shifted from obstructing or ignoring

one another to collaborating. Six months later, a follow-up survey

showed strong strategic alignment among team members and decreased

# evidence of factions.

- 3. Map the journey and begin. Next, plan your team’s journey to new

collective behaviors. You can’t outsource this work to HR or anybody

else. Begin by asking: “How do we need to work together as a team to

help others achieve our strategy?” Start with the business goals that you

and your team have set for the ﬁrm, and then use the results from your team-eﬀectiveness diagnostic to identify which gaps most aﬀect their

execution. For example, if you’re launching a multiyear transformation,

it will be crucial to address deﬁciencies in the team’s dynamism that

might hold back change. If you’re a new team formed after a merger,

start by clarifying each member’s role to establish discipline and set the

# stage for collaboration.

- 4. Maintain momentum. Mapping out and embarking on the journey

are easy compared with sustaining it. Many teams quickly align around

priorities, convene for a launch event, and make plans for future

meetings—but then fail to follow through. Some call this “the boom

splat.” When it happens, ﬁrms often rationalize their inaction, insisting

that other work simply became more important. But maintaining

momentum—and correcting course when necessary—is critical to

changing behavior and making it stick.

# Enabling Factors

Following through on those steps is hard but rewarding. Several

enabling factors can help.

Get together. The potency of in-person sessions has no substitute. Build

your annual program around as many face-to-face gatherings as you can aﬀord. Save money elsewhere.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Teamwork at the Top

Build habits. In your regular meetings, dedicate a few moments

for team learning. And during your monthly or quarterly meetings,

dedicate an hour—or even a day—to yourselves as a team. The continual

dedication of time is more important than the amount of time.

Be opportunistic. Top teams struggle with time famine, so take

advantage of meetings that have been convened for other purposes to

work on teaming.

Be adaptable. Team members should agree on what skills and habits they need to learn and be ready to call on diﬀerent ones as the business

environment changes. When a team needs to power through a sudden adverse event, for example, it should pivot toward drive behaviors.

Make teaming real and applicable. Integrate the building of skills

with the execution of work activities. Practice constructive debate and

listening in the context of speciﬁc questions facing the business (about,

say, where to build a new factory).

Reinforce. Between working sessions, encourage subgroups to form

sprint teams to reinforce what they’ve learned—through after-action

# reviews, for example.

Measure. Regular measurement of the team’s progress will keep the

journey headed in the right direction. After six to 12 months, survey or

interview team members and others again. Then celebrate progress and

# stretch further.

Communicate. Over time, get used to making your goals public, and

share mistakes and successes along the way. If you can model this

behavior and foster a culture of continuous improvement, other teams

throughout the organization will feel that it’s safe and productive to

# change as well.

. . .

Since beginning its self-improvement work, the top team at Root has

become more purposeful. Members have more-constructive debates,

delegate more of the right decisions, and are more collaborative and

transparent. Communication is clearer. The company’s performance

has been excellent. Now Root is getting ready to launch another ﬁve-

year strategy review, and although senior leaders are still working to improve their eﬀectiveness as a top team, they now know that they’re

up to the task—because they’ve seen the results. Your team can do the

# same.
