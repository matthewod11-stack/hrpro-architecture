Ample research has shown that when people believe that their

managers and senior leaders are truly listening to their ideas and

concerns, work relationships grow stronger, engagement rises, and performance improves. That’s why bosses have regular one‑on-ones with their direct reports, new division heads go on listening tours, and

CEOs host all-staﬀ meetings and town halls.

However, studies also show that such practices often are ineﬀective—

in part because many managers simply aren’t good listeners. When

we conducted a comprehensive review of 117 academic papers on

workplace listening—whether it happened in individual conversations

or in team or larger meetings—we found that this skill is far easier to

describe than to display.

Why? Because listening is an intentional activity that requires empathy,

patience, and the ability to respond to what you hear. And because

it can be so mentally taxing, particularly when the subject matter

is complex or emotionally charged, people often take shortcuts or

# disengage altogether.

Take Google’s all-company TGIF meetings. For years these were

biweekly open forums where company leaders would share updates,

discuss strategic developments, and take questions from employees.

They played a critical role in maintaining a culture of trust at the

company. As Laszlo Bock, Google’s former senior vice president of

people operations, once explained, they covered “everything from

whether the mix of food in the cafés is too healthy to really sublime

## questions around whether our strategy with a particular country or

product is good or evil.” However, in 2019 Sundar Pichai, Google’s CEO,

decided that the meetings were no longer working. Employees wanted

to talk about contentious issues like the company’s handling of hate

speech and sexual harassment, and discussions were often leaked to the

press. Pichai made them less regular and changed their format. It seems that listening to everyone had gotten too diﬃcult.

Similar scenarios have played out at Activision Blizzard, where an

attempt to address harassment claims during a company town hall

led to a massive walkout, with workers complaining that leaders were

minimizing rather than meaningfully addressing their concerns, and

at Amazon, where employees said that a daily survey designed to

gauge their sentiment was being skewed by managers’ overt pressure

to give positive answers and by worries that responses wouldn’t be kept

# anonymous.

In our research we’ve found that even the most well-intentioned

leaders are sometimes guilty of being poor listeners. We’ve identiﬁed

ﬁve of the most common and damaging causes of that failure: haste,

defensiveness, invisibility, exhaustion, and inaction. In this article we’ll

explain how to avoid those pitfalls and become the kind of listener that

your team members need you to be.

- 1. Haste

In April 2023 MillerKnoll’s CEO, Andi Owen, held an online town hall.

Going in, she worried that morale was low. In order for the employees—

including her—to receive their annual bonuses, the company needed to

hit a revenue goal, and sales weren’t on track. But Owen believed that

with a ﬁnal push the employees could succeed. “My goal was to get them

to…say, ‘Gosh, it really stinks that we aren’t further along.’ And maybe

take a minute and feel bad about that, but then sort of leave that place

of feeling bad. We still have a quarter, we can still do this,” she later told

# Fast Company.

Toward the end of the meeting, Owen was asked the question on

everyone’s mind: What about the bonuses? And that’s when things went

awry. “Don’t ask about, ‘What are we going to do if we don’t get a

bonus?’” Owen replied. Workers should focus instead on making their

numbers, she said, adding: “I had an old boss who said to me one time,

‘You can visit pity city, but you can’t live there.’ So people, leave pity city!” A video of the response went viral, racking up nearly 6 million views and igniting a ﬁrestorm online.

Owen had fallen prey to haste. Her viral comment came in the ﬁnal

moments of a long meeting. She hadn’t left much time for questions

or formulated any responses in advance—so she responded quickly.

That often happens with busy leaders managing several people or entire

# teams.

But listening with haste can be worse than not listening at all. When

you respond to people too quickly, they’re likely to feel frustrated,

demeaned, or unimportant. And when you miss the message because

you’re hurrying, you may also make decisions based on incomplete

information, which can further demotivate your team.

Good listening is a demanding task that takes time. In our work we’ve

found that people feel heard only when listeners focus their attention,

demonstrate interest, and ensure that they’ve understood.

To avoid hasty responses, set aside adequate, distraction-free time for

conversations. This signals that you’re genuinely invested in hearing the

other person’s perspective and helps ensure that nothing important gets

glossed over. If there are issues you can’t address in the moment, plan

another time to follow up.

Though this approach may not apply in situations where you’re

confronted, as Owen was, there are other ways to slow down and listen

eﬀectively. One good strategy is to ask clarifying questions. Exploring

areas of ambiguity or seeking additional details will not only help you

fully understand what you’re being told but also encourage people to be

more thorough and transparent with you—because you’re showing that

you truly care about what they’re saying.

Finally, resist the urge to interrupt. Research, including a study from

Italy’s Second University of Naples, shows that interruptions are almost

always poorly received. Your ﬁrst job is to understand the message and

intent of the speaker. Respond only after that job is done.

- 2. Defensiveness

When employees raise concerns or oﬀer critical feedback, defensiveness can be a natural, knee‑jerk reaction. For instance, James Clarke, the CEO of Clearlink, reportedly became defensive when responding to complaints about the company’s return-to-oﬃce policy, which abruptly

required all employees within 50 miles of headquarters to work on-site

four days a week. Many people were surprised and upset, but instead of

listening to them, Clarke lashed out, questioning the motives of those

who disagreed with the policy, expressing doubt that working mothers

could be productive, and—bizarrely—praising an employee who sold

the family dog so that she could comply with the policy.

A similar pattern can be seen in Owen’s response. Instead of validating

employees’ worries, she responded defensively, telling people not to ask

the question. Pichai’s shift to TGIF meetings that focus on product and

business strategy rather than other issues also reﬂects defensiveness.

Such reactions are not just unproductive; they erode trust and morale.

Employees who feel dismissed are more likely to disengage, which

weakens relationships and leads to poor organizational outcomes. By

contrast, when listeners avoid being judgmental and instead express

empathy, speakers are less anxious and thus better able to handle

disagreement should it arise, according to research from Guy Itzchakov,

# Avraham Kluger, and Dotan Castro.

The lesson is to steel yourself against defensiveness by calming your

own emotions and seeking to understand the other parties’ intentions

before responding. Before you speak, take stock of yourself. If you feel

criticized or threatened, buy yourself time by simply restating what you

think the speaker has said or thanking that person for sharing. You can

also ask questions to get more information. Those moves will prevent

you from counterattacking and show people that you’re hearing them

out before voicing your own opinion.

- 3. Invisibility

One of the most common mistakes we see among managers is not

showing that they’re listening, which makes them appear indiﬀerent

and disconnected. Sometimes organizational leaders are working

behind the scenes to ﬁx problems identiﬁed in town halls or staﬀ

surveys but fail to broadcast those eﬀorts to employees. Or managers are

indeed hearing and understanding their employees but not providing

# any visible signs of engagement.

At Google, for example, Pichai hasn’t stopped listening to employees

or working to ﬁx problems they raise—he is by most accounts a caring

and attentive leader. But by changing the TGIF meetings, he removed

a very visible symbol of his willingness to hear feedback. Consider,

## too, the famous moment during the 1992 U.S. presidential debate, when

George Bush Sr., running for reelection, checked his wristwatch just

before a voter asked him a question about the national debt and the

recession. His response—“Of course, you feel it when you’re president

of the United States; that’s why I’m trying to do something about it, by

stimulating the export, investing more, a better education system”—was

overshadowed by the gesture, which many perceived as a signal he was

ready for the town hall to be over.

To avoid appearing indiﬀerent, leaders must be more communicative

and transparent. They can use body language known as “back

channeling”—behaviors that signal that they’re listening. They include

maintaining eye contact, nodding, and adopting an open posture (with

your arms relaxed at your sides rather than crossed in front of your

chest, for example). Research by Janet Bavelas and colleagues shows

that such cues make conversations more productive: When a listener

signals comprehension, it allows the speaker to move on; when a

listener shows confusion, it invites the speaker to rephrase or elaborate.

Verbal acknowledgments are important

too. Simple phrases such as “I see” or “That

makes sense” signal to your counterparts

that you’re following along, valuing their

perspective, and actively processing their

# messages.

Finally, you can demonstrate listening by

reﬂecting the ideas of speakers back to

them. Summarizing what you’ve heard

# Chiara Zarmati

is a powerful way to conﬁrm your

# understanding. For example, you might

say, “So what I’m hearing is that you’re

concerned about the deadline because it might not allow enough time

for testing.” This approach not only reassures the speaker that you’re

attentive but helps prevent any misunderstandings. C-suite leaders can

also use it in emails or other corporate communications after receiving

## employee survey results or after all-staﬀ meetings.

- 4. Exhaustion

Exhaustion is a silent killer of eﬀective listening. When leaders are

physically or emotionally drained, they lose their capacity to focus,

process, and engage productively with employees. Imagine a boss who

has just ﬁnished back-to-back meetings and skipped lunch and is now

on a late-afternoon call with a team member sharing a pressing concern.

Despite being present physically, her attention drifts, and she’s unable

to respond thoughtfully.

That’s probably how Google leaders felt as one TGIF meeting after another surfaced a slew of diﬃcult employee concerns. At a small

startup, a weekly meeting that allows all employees to talk to top management is realistic. At a company of 100,000, it’s more diﬃcult.

Similarly, Owen, Clarke, and Bush Sr. were no doubt tired—from

managing their organizations and the country, respectively—when they

made their listening gaﬀes.

According to research by Christopher Rosen and colleagues, managers

who listen to too many complaints eventually become so worn down

that they’re more likely to mistreat their subordinates.

The best way to avoid exhausted listening is to establish clear

boundaries. That might involve blocking out certain hours when your

door or calendar is open and others when it’s not, setting time limits on

discussions, or taking breaks during extended conversations.

Moreover, leaders should acknowledge their personal limits. If you’re

feeling weary, it’s both acceptable and beneﬁcial to reschedule for

a time when you have more energy. By acknowledging that quality

listening requires mental and emotional reserves, you’re demonstrating

transparency and respect, which your counterparts will appreciate.

Remember, too, that it’s OK to ask for help. While listening to employee

problems and concerns is an essential part of a leader’s job, it can be shared. Too often, one manager becomes the oﬃce therapist everyone

turns to for venting and advice. In such cases the overburdened

manager can ask colleagues and team members to check in with their

employees and peers to share the listening load. If your organization

has regular meetings like TGIFs where people voice suggestions and

concerns, the person running them should rotate. That will help prevent

individuals from being overwhelmed and foster a sense of collective

# responsibility.

- 5. Inaction

The ﬁnal pitfall is perhaps the most pernicious: receiving the speaker’s

message but then not following up on it. Google’s slow response to

employee concerns about sexual harassment in 2018, for instance,

led 20,000 employees to walk out—and contributed to increasingly

# contentious TGIF meetings.

Research backs up the idea that inaction after employees raise issues

erodes trust between managers and subordinates. In one study,

Michaela Kerrissey and colleagues interviewed nurses during the

Covid-19 pandemic; many reported feeling “unheard, frustrated, and

alienated from their managers” because nothing had come of numerous

meetings with them to discuss concerns.

. . .

Listening without subsequent action or explanation leads employees to

believe their eﬀorts—and yours—have been pointless. There is a ﬁx for this: Always close the loop. Before ending a conversation, aﬃrm what

you’ve heard, identify the next steps for action, and agree on a timeline

for checking back in. That emphasizes forward momentum and ensures

# accountability.

Be transparent about what you can or cannot act on, and in all cases

explain why. If you’re taking an employee’s suggestion, outline how

you want the team to make it happen. If a requested change can’t be

implemented because of budget constraints, company policy, or other

limitations, acknowledge that reality. Delineating the reasons behind

inaction can open the door to brainstorming alternative approaches.

Listening is a cognitively and emotionally demanding activity. It takes

deliberate attention and eﬀort to avoid the ﬁve pitfalls we’ve described

here. But if you master this managerial skill, you will build stronger

relationships, foster greater trust, minimize misunderstandings,

and create opportunities for meaningful change. Don’t let haste,

defensiveness, invisibility, exhaustion, and inaction keep you from

becoming a better listener and leader.
