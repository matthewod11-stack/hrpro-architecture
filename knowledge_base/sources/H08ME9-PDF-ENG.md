You probably know that to succeed in your role, you need to align with

your manager’s priorities. In an ideal world, all leaders would be clear

about their expectations and proactive about sharing what’s on their

mind. But in reality, most bosses can be frustratingly vague. They might

launch into a rambling explanation that leaves you more confused than

when you started. Or perhaps you’re told to “just keep doing what you’re

doing” or brusquely brushed oﬀ as they rush to their next commitment.

## HBR / Digital Article / 7 Questions to Decode Your Manager’s Priorities

Your boss likely isn’t trying to be diﬃcult. Many managers receive

unclear direction from their own leadership. Some have never learned

how to articulate a vision or translate big-picture goals into day-to-day

directives. Others are overwhelmed and simply don’t have time to think

strategically about what they really need from their team.

Learning to get into your boss’s head may sound like additional

emotional labor, but it actually puts you in control of your career

satisfaction. When you can decode their needs, you can prioritize

## promotable work and position yourself as a strategic partner to those

# above you.

Getting these insights requires asking smarter questions — ones that

help your boss open up about their challenges and deeper needs. Here

are seven you can try:

- 1. What goals do you discuss with your boss?

This question reveals what impacts your manager’s performance

reviews, bonuses, and career trajectory. Which metrics do they mention

ﬁrst? Do any diﬀer from what you typically track? Notice if they dive

into a speciﬁc calculation or become enthusiastic about certain ﬁgures.

You can use this insight to present your work in ways that matter to

senior leadership, making it easier to get resources and recognition for

# your team.

- 2. What keeps you up at night when thinking about our team or projects?

Unlike asking about general challenges, which often gets you a canned

response, asking this question tends to elicit a more candid answer.

It invites vulnerability in a way that builds trust and creates an

opportunity to help solve issues. You might ﬂag risks earlier, suggest

process improvements, or take work oﬀ their plate in stressful areas,

turning you into a trusted advisor who helps them sleep better at night.

- 3. What actions or changes would allow you to look back in 90 days and say “Wow, that really made a difference?”

The timeframe is key. Ninety days is long enough to accomplish

something meaningful, but short enough to feel tangible and speciﬁc.

If your boss gives a vague answer like “reﬁne our strategy,” ask, “What’s

one change we could make to our roadmap that would have the biggest

impact by the end of the quarter?” If they’re still unclear, oﬀer a binary:

“Would you be more impressed if we doubled our enterprise clients or

increased revenue per customer by 40%?”

- 4. What do you wish you had more time to work on?

This question uncovers what matters to your manager but keeps getting

pushed aside by urgent tasks. Maybe they wish they had more time

to create documentation, build relationships with another team, or

# analyze customer feedback.

Try to ﬁnd a win-win — a way your boss can reclaim time while you

get a growth opportunity. You might suggest: “I know you want to focus

on planning next year’s conference. Why don’t I run our team meetings

for the next few weeks to help you create space to do that?” or “I’d love

to work with the board more closely. I could prepare our department

updates so you can work on the budget they asked for.”

- 5. What does good performance look like? Great performance?

Let your boss lay out “good” expectations without jumping in. Then

pause and say, “Thank you. That’s helpful. Now tell me — what does

great performance look like?” That pause and emphasis often leads to

a discussion about how to exceed expectations and reveals what really

matters beyond technical skills. Your boss might start talking about how

great performers navigate oﬃce politics or explain complex issues to

# non-experts.

- 6. What emerging trends should we be mindful of and potentially capitalize on?

Your manager has conversations you’re not privy to about internal

shifts, industry changes, and executive concerns. They sit in closed-

door meetings, see ﬁnancial projections early, and hear market threats

months before they go public. Their answer gives you a sneak peek

into what might shape their motivation and choices in the weeks and

months to come. When shifts happen, you’ll understand why and be

ready to adapt.

- 7. Can you help me understand how [project or task] compares to other tasks on my plate?

This question tells you a lot about your manager’s decision-making

process, including why certain priorities rise to the top while others

get put on the back burner. When you need to set boundaries, you can

reﬂect their own logic back to them. Instead of simply saying, “I’m at

capacity,” you can say, “You mentioned the product launch should be

our main focus, which means I’ll need to deprioritize [new request] to

give it the attention it deserves.” Plus, you’re making them aware of your

bandwidth without sounding like you’re complaining.

Pay attention to what your boss doesn’t say as well. Notice which topics

they get excited about, they hesitate to discuss, and when their tone

shifts. Observation is often just as important as inquiry.
