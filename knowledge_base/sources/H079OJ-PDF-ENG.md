One of our clients has a sign up in their headquarters that reads, “As

far as everyone knows, we’re a big happy family.” It’s a reminder not

only of how they want the world to see them, but how they want to see

themselves, no matter what the reality is, a tacit acknowledgement that

no family is perfect.

When people think about conﬂict and family business, they tend to

think about the “ﬁreworks” kind of conﬂict we see on the front pages

of the newspaper or depicted in popular television shows. But far

more common is the exact opposite, what we call “fake harmony,” in

which families are so afraid of conﬂict that they avoid uncomfortable

# discussions of any kind.

# Why Fake Harmony Is So Destructive

Disagreement in a family business is natural over time. As a family

## grows, interests diverge and individual family member relationships

with the business can change. It’s healthy and expected for individual

owners (or future owners) to have diﬀerent perspectives, and the desire

to quash those perspectives, rather than risk rocking the boat with

diﬀerences of opinion, is often counterproductive.

If your family isn’t discussing any competing ideas, you’re likely

avoiding conversations about important issues. In our experience, fake

harmony can be far more damaging than ﬁreworks, because it causes families to avoid making diﬃcult, but important, decisions about the

# business or the family.

Fake harmony can also create resentment in the family. People don’t

feel like they can express their interests or opinions for fear of creating

conﬂict. Issues may be unspoken, but that doesn’t mean they’re gone.

Fake harmony also stiﬂes innovation. Families can be cornucopias

of great ideas, but when individuals don’t share ideas because they

are afraid to “rock the boat,” businesses and family owners miss

opportunities to innovate.

Fake harmony also delays generational transitions by limiting

## cross-generational conversations and collaboration. Absent those

conversations, the senior generation may not learn to trust the

junior generation and vice versa. And the junior generation may not

understand the senior generation’s intentions and approach, growing

frustrated with the pace of change.

Perhaps most importantly, fake harmony can lead to what we call a

“cliﬀ event” — an unaddressed conﬂict that builds and builds over time

until it erupts into far more serious and complex arguments. Cliﬀ events

can tear at the fabric of a family and limit the family’s ability to make

# important decisions together.

That’s not to say that fake harmony is irrational; most families have long

memories. A diﬀerent opinion received poorly or in the wrong context

can explode into harmful conﬂict. If you disrupt family harmony, your

family may hold that against you for the rest of your life.

So even if you recognize that fake harmony is holding your family

business back, you need to tread carefully. You don’t have to wade in

with a laundry list of grievances. Strategic avoidance can be a sensible

temporary negotiation tactic as you wait until the right time to bring up

# a tough topic.

Often, the cliﬀ event that triggers outright conﬂict after a long period of

fake harmony is seemingly small on its own. But the months or years

of keeping quiet over other disagreements are baked into that moment,

too. So, when it explodes, it can be hard to undo the damage. And when

that happens, months, years, or even decades of progress as a family

and an owner group can be undone. For example, one family owner we

know (all identiﬁable details have been changed) nursed wounds from

decisions by the other owners (his siblings) to wind down a favorite

R&D eﬀort and hire the “wrong” non-family CEO, but he said nothing

for months. His anger “irrationally” (accordingly to his siblings) boiled

## over during a seemingly innocuous discussion about a board meeting

date, leading to conﬂict that ultimately caused the business to miss out

on a lucrative acquisition opportunity as they were rehashing other old

# wounds.

Of course, what constitutes excessive conﬂict (as opposed to

constructive disagreement) depends on family culture and personal

interpretation. Some families can more easily tolerate conﬂict than

others, and the extent to which people will stoically put aside their

personal interests to support the common cause also varies. But the

signs of fake harmony are common, regardless of your family culture:

# Signs of Fake Harmony

- Opinions aren’t expressed. You have a big group together, you’re

having a conversation about an important topic, and everyone sort of

demurs. No one is willing to oﬀer a clear perspective on the matter.

- Constructive feedback is avoided. Sometimes it’s tough to receive

challenging feedback, but it’s also very productive and helps you

evolve as a family and as a group of owners of a business.

- Debate is suppressed. A family owner brings a strong opinion on

an important issue to your group of owners, and no one wants to

express a counter opinion. If everyone else sort of nods their head to

everything that’s discussed, you’re likely stiﬂing real discussion and

the introduction of new ideas. If everyone defaults to “sounds good,”

there’s probably something going on underneath the surface.

- Back-channel conversations are the norm. Family members appear

to agree in a meeting, but afterwards you hear a range of perspectives

in one-on-one conversations. If you ﬁnd that family members only

express their “real” opinions privately amongst themselves, rather

than bringing their thoughts and concerns to the appropriate forum,

you may be unknowingly heading towards your own “cliﬀ event.”

Several tools and approaches can be eﬀective in guarding against fake

harmony in a family business. For example, we often bring a metaphoric

“candid-o-meter” into meetings. During discussions we refer to the

candid-o-meter to determine whether we’re getting to the heart of the

matter or just glossing over the surface. And when it feels like we are

entering fake harmony, we ask each participant to rate the candor of

the conversation from one (low candor) to ﬁve (fully open). Perhaps not

## surprisingly, most people who rate the conversation at or below a three

are typically eager to share what is not being said or that they suspect

their family members are not being candid. That low rating can trigger

a shift in the conversation. While it may seem like a silly tool, most

people are glad to not be wasting their time in a “fake meeting” and to

be getting to the real issues.

Other helpful tools we’ve used to help families get past fake harmony to

# constructive conversations:

# Tools for Overcoming Fake Harmony

- 1. Start with easier issues.

If your family is struggling with fake harmony, you don’t have to dive

right into the most challenging issues. Start with conversations and

decisions that won’t incite highly emotional reactions.

We worked with one family that had an extraordinarily fraught family

history, so they had defaulted to a fake harmony as a survival strategy.

That left many issues unaddressed. To begin to move away from fake

harmony, they started discussing simple business decisions, instead of

diving into their list of emotionally charged issues. As a family, they

were all on the same page about wanting the business to thrive, so

discussing business strategy was a safe place to debate one another.

Once they had established that they could disagree with one another

respectfully, they were able to begin to work through some of the other

# family issues.

- 2. Use surveys to uncover opinions anonymously.

Have family members ﬁll out a quick anonymous survey before and

after a key meeting to create a helpful barometer. Set up a simple survey,

through a service like Qualtrics, that asks family members what topics

they want to address or explores what went well in a meeting and

what could be improved (we call these “plus/deltas”). Such surveys can

provide an easy, but helpful, opportunity to oﬀer constructive feedback.

- 3. Consider facilitated conversations.

Bring in an outsider to facilitate a challenging conversation. An outside

facilitator can set ground rules and boundaries for the conversation,

monitor those boundaries, reset the conversation if things are getting

oﬀ track, and ensure that everyone has a chance to be heard.

- 4. Strengthen transparency.

Fake harmony can fester because family members are feeling insecure

— afraid that asking questions will make them appear dumb or

uninformed — or that it will imply that they are challenging other

family members. They don’t want to expose themselves or oﬀend.

But if family leaders make a point of keeping their stakeholders

informed about both business issues and key decisions that are being

made, people are less likely to feel afraid to ask questions. Sunlight can

be the best disinfectant.

- 5. Set the right standard.

Remind your family members that your goal is to make great

decisions together. Fake harmony won’t help you do that. Constructive

# conversations will.

Both conﬂict and fake harmony are common in business families all

over the world. What they are grappling with is normal. Balancing the

two is an important part of making good decisions together, and it isn’t

always easy for any family, no matter how much they love each other.

Families can get so focused on wanting to present a perfect veneer to the

outside world that they build a false one on the inside, too. But there’s

# no such thing as a perfect family.

## Sierra Nevada Brewing Co., a family-owned beer company, revels in

that realization. Its tagline, which shows up on every can and bottle,

## is “Family Owned, Operated & Argued Over.” Ken Grossman, Sierra

Nevada’s founder, shared his family’s rationale for the slogan with our

## colleagues Josh Baron and Rob Lachenauer in the Harvard Business

Review Family Business Handbook: “It’s funny, but it’s the truth. We can

get together and argue over what’s best for us as a company moving

forward, but we all do it in good faith, knowing that everyone wants

what’s best overall.”

Can you say something similar about your family business? If not, you may ﬁnd yourself in a diﬃcult position precisely because you have tried

to avoid conﬂict.
