What do high-potential employees describe as their core challenges?

And what areas of development must they address as they climb the

# corporate ladder?

To better understand these challenges, we examined more than 3,000

applications and sponsor statements for those who were admitted

## to Harvard Business School’s ﬂagship High Potentials Leadership

Program (HPLP) from 2003 through 2021. The admissions team

asked applicants to identify their primary leadership challenge, their

objectives for attending the program, and their leadership style and

approach. Sponsors were asked to identify the applicant’s strengths and

weaknesses, outline their reasons for the nomination, and articulate

# their goals for the applicant.

Our analysis shed light on the ways in which companies assess the

## strengths and developmental needs of their executives on the fast

track, as well as the ways in which these executives deﬁne their core

challenges. These insights can inform how managers can support their

fast-track executives to reach their full potential and how organizations

can drive the content and delivery of leadership development programs.

# Key Challenges Facing High Potentials

Over nearly 20 years, the high potentials in our program have

## consistently identiﬁed ﬁve consistent leadership challenges:

- Leading teams

- Leading change

- Leadership style

- Leading at scale

- Driving business results

More than 30% of high potentials cited leading teams as their core

challenge. “My biggest leadership challenge is determining methods

for leading team members,” one 2005 executive noted. “Each team

member’s background is diﬀerent and each one is driven diﬀerently.

I must then manage diﬀerently.”

Fifteen years later, high potentials noted the added complexity of

leading global teams remotely. “Having enough time to develop

employees while advancing organizational goals is a real challenge

## especially in a virtual environment,” as one 2020 program participant

said.

For the most part, men and women cited similar leadership challenges.

However, women were more likely than men to cite “leadership style”

as a challenge. As one woman noted: “I struggle with my leadership

style. I am a very driven, see the end goal, and often think that everyone

else around me should be able to do the same. When giving direction

or communicating to members on my team, it can sometimes come

across as being parental and directive. Although I am highly regarded

and respected, I want to make sure that my leadership style continues

to be one of encouragement, motivation, and development versus one

that turns people oﬀ and they therefore do not want to follow me and

# my vision.”

# What Got You Here Will Not Get You There

Transforming from individual contributor to team leader can be quite diﬃcult. Over the past 20 years, sponsors pointed to two key strengths

— an ability to drive results and functional or technical expertise — as

the central reasons for identifying and nominating employees as high

# potentials.

But to reach the next level, high potentials who’ve been rewarded for

personal accomplishments must learn to recalibrate to a deﬁnition

of success based on the team’s collective performance. Relying on a

past track record of success will not be enough as high potentials

## grapple with the scale, scope, and complexity of more senior general

# management roles.

Stepping up to higher levels of leadership requires six key skills,

according to the managers in our data set:

- Strategic management

- Emotional intelligence

- Communication

- Leading at scale

- Leading teams

- Relationship management

As the sponsors in our data set considered the next step for their

high potentials, they often cited the need for high potentials to have

landscape. They noted that the technical and functional skills that

enabled high potentials to excel may in fact impede their ability to

see the “big picture.” As one manager wrote, “Calvin’s* weakness is

seeing the bigger picture of how what he manages aﬀects the entire

organization.”

In addition to widening their apertures, high potentials also need

to expand their emotional intelligence and communication skills.

A representative comment from a sponsor said, “John has very

strong hard skills. He is strong in operations, sales, and leading the

development of new technology, but he must improve his soft skills.

He has a big blind spot in terms of how he treats people.” Sponsors

in our sample were more likely to identify strategic management as a

## developmental opportunity for women and emotional intelligence as a

# developmental opportunity for men.

## How Organizations Can Develop High Potentials

As organizations search for ways to ensure that their high potentials

fulﬁll their promise, they must be prepared to equip them with

the ability to think and act more strategically, to lead with greater

conviction, and to cultivate and nurture relationships. In essence,

organizations must create the scaﬀolding that allows high potentials to

simultaneously develop the macro skills of strategy and the micro skills

# of interpersonal relationships.

Our analysis pointed to three clear priorities as organizations look to

develop their high potentials:

- 1. Measure high potentials against speciﬁc competencies to help expand their leadership style. While most high potentials have experience managing small teams,

their next career step will likely involve leading larger teams, where they

won’t have the ability to regularly interact with every team member. As

high potentials step up to leading at scale and scope, they must create

the conditions that enable the team to operate eﬀectively without their

daily presence. This involves developing the operational platforms and

incentives to reinforce positive behaviors; supporting and cultivating a

vibrant and healthy culture; and creating a context that enables team

members to grow, develop, and produce.

Managers can support this eﬀort by tracking high potentials’ progress

against key leadership competencies, such as team management,

relationship building, and communication. In particular, a high

potential’s ability to lead eﬀective teams, inspire and motivate others,

and articulate a compelling vision are dependent on their ability

to successfully communicate. While they may be eﬀective in small

team meetings or one-on-one interactions, they must also excel

at communicating at scale and scope. This requires demonstrating

# conﬁdence, conviction, and clarity.

- 2. Help high potentials increase their emotional intelligence.

As one moves up in their career, they must often rely on others to

get the work done, and that requires trust, support, and guidance.

In essence, it requires emotional intelligence, and two central tenets

of emotional intelligence that are critical for high potentials are self-

awareness and empathy. Numerous research studies have identiﬁed a

link between self-aware leaders and climates that are open, supportive,

## and productive. As such, programs and experiences that enable high

potentials to increase their self-awareness are critical. This can be

accomplished through feedback, assessments, role plays and video

# recordings.

Along with self-awareness, empathy is core to the ability to manage

conﬂict successfully, to coach and mentor subordinates, and to

motivate and inspire others. It’s also been shown to be essential to cross-

cultural teams. Despite its strengths, empathy can often be a victim

of one’s hyper focus on results and achievement. Paradoxically, while

empathy tends to decline as one moves up, that is when it is most

needed, especially when one is leading and not doing.

While many believe that empathy is something that you either have or

don’t, it can be learned, but it requires dedicated behavioral change. By

focusing on inquiry, developing active listening skills, acknowledging

diﬀerent perspectives, and demonstrating genuine concern, high

potentials can hone their skills in empathy.

- 3. Encourage a learning mindset.

Moving from a core technical or speciﬁc functional area to a

general management role requires high potentials to see how various

## functions interact and how their organization’s strategic imperatives

are inﬂuenced by and inﬂuence the prevailing contextual landscape.

Leaders would beneﬁt from the development of contextual intelligence

— the ability to understand the context and adapt one’s style and

approach. This requires moving outside one’s comfort zone (e.g., core

technical area) and adapting a learning mindset.

Developing and cultivating a learning mindset requires an openness to

## new experiences, a sense of curiosity and inquiry, and a willingness to

## question one’s assumptions, biases, and perspectives. Organizations can

support the development of these capabilities by fostering a culture

of psychological safety and risk taking. They can also provide high

potentials with the opportunity to contribute to strategic initiatives

outside their core functional area, allow them to participate in scenario

planning and projection analyses, and oﬀer them stretch opportunities

## in new markets or new product/service areas.

While high potentials have been recognized for their results-orientation

success will come from a heightened focus on emotional intelligence,

communication, and relationship management. To ensure the success

of their high potentials, managers and organizations must provide
