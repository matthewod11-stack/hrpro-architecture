The sociologist Arlie Hochshild introduced the concept of emotional

labor to highlight the emotional burdens of diﬀerent jobs. Bill collectors,

for example, must inure themselves from the emotional distress of the

people they must harass. Doctors must deal with the emotional trauma of their patients when delivering diﬃcult medical prognoses. Almost all

service workers must endure emotionally challenging encounters with

# upset customers.

## HBR / Digital Article / How CEOs Can Navigate the Emotional Labor of Leadership

A CEO’s role is not one we may readily associate with high emotional

labor. The people in these highly paid, all-powerful roles are often seen

as creating emotional stress for others rather than bearing that burden

# themselves.

In fact, the CEO’s role demands high levels of emotional labor, even if

many observers fail to appreciate it. CEOs are required to project public

conﬁdence even when they may have personal doubts. They must own the consequences of making diﬃcult decisions that inevitably make

some constituencies unhappy. They must bear the responsibility for

bad outcomes, even if others are responsible for these consequences.

They must absorb the disappointments people feel — from how they

were treated to how the organization is performing — because CEOs

personify the organization. They must be empathetic and comforting

when others are emotionally distraught. They must prioritize the

organization’s needs above their personal needs. They must be willing

to endure public scrutiny that may be exhausting and, at times, hurtful.

And they must do all this while being authentic, which requires opening

up in a manner that feels vulnerable.

Yet, one of the unwritten rules of the CEO role is that it’s unacceptable

to talk about the emotional toll the job takes. When a CEO breaches this

norm, the consequences come quickly. In May of 2010, with an oil well

run by BP spilling oil into the Gulf of Mexico, BP CEO Tony Hayward

gave a TV interview in which he said: “There’s no one who wants

this thing over more than I do. I’d like my life back.” The comment

caused widespread criticism because Hayward seemed to be asking for

sympathy amid a tragedy that killed 11 oil workers and caused extensive

damage to the Gulf ecosystem. A few weeks later, on a rare day oﬀ,

Hayward was photographed sailing in a yacht race with his son, a move

that drew criticism from the White House. Five weeks later, Hayward

was replaced as CEO.

## HBR / Digital Article / How CEOs Can Navigate the Emotional Labor of Leadership

Based on my work with business leaders — as a faculty member in

## the New CEO Workshop at Harvard Business School, as chairman of

a venture capital ﬁrm, and as a member of corporate boards — I

have observed CEOs facing enormous emotional strain over the last

few years. For many companies, the period from the end of the Great

Recession until the beginning of Covid-19 will be remembered as

unusually calm and prosperous, a period typiﬁed by low interest rates,

a steadily growing economy, and a buoyant stock market. In retrospect,

these were fantastic years to be a CEO. More recently, however, chief

executives have faced extraordinary challenges that have increased the

emotional labor required by the role.

# The Challenges of Being a CEO Right Now

I attribute this increase to three factors:

CEOs are steering organizations through what seems like an unending series of crises.

## From global health crises like the Covid-19 pandemic, geopolitical

crises such as the Russia-Ukraine conﬂict and the growing U.S.-China

tensions, to macroeconomic uncertainty marked by inﬂation, rising

interest rates, and supply chain disruptions, CEOs must lead with

conviction in the face of immense ambiguity. Balancing these demands

often leads to divided opinions within the organization, with the CEO

shouldering the responsibility of making ﬁnal, potentially divisive,

# decisions.

Consider, for instance, the continuing and contentious debate at Amazon around remote work versus mandated returns to the oﬃce.

Long after the health risks of the Covid pandemic have abated, Amazon continues to face serious resistance from oﬃce workers who petitioned

the company in writing and even staged a walkout at its Seattle

headquarters to protest CEO Andy Jasse’s mandate that they return to the oﬃce. Surprisingly, their insurgency was supported by Amazon’s

distribution center employees, who had been required to come to work

even during the crisis. Amazon’s travails show how crises can have a

long tail of continuing emotional toll. Similarly, the Russia-Ukraine war

shows no sign of ending and spills into ongoing anxiety about how

long and severe the strains between the U.S. and China will be and the

consequences it will have for businesses caught in the fray. Emotional

labor is more problematic when it feels unending — and that is precisely

how many CEOs now feel.

There is a growing expectation for CEOs to engage publicly with politically charged social and environmental issues.

In this era of “CEO activism,” leaders are expected to get personally

engaged in addressing a broad range of social challenges that

## extend well beyond the traditional understanding of corporate

social responsibility (CSR). However, this engagement comes with a

signiﬁcant emotional cost. Taking a public stance often places CEOs

in a precarious position, attracting criticism irrespective of the stance

adopted. CEOs are caught in a paradox where they must balance diverse

stakeholder interests while protecting their and the organization’s

reputations. Navigating this terrain can be emotionally taxing as CEOs

wrestle to reconcile and align their personal beliefs, corporate values,

# and external pressures.

One example of a CEO who failed to navigate these challenges is Bob

Chapek, who was ﬁred as CEO of Disney in November 2022 after

less than three years in the role. Disney is one of Florida’s largest

employers, and for that reason, various stakeholders expected Chapek

to take a stand on a controversial state law limiting discussion of

## sexual orientation and gender identity in Florida schools. Chapek

initially stayed silent, relying on Disney lobbyists to work against the

bill in private, but facing threats of a boycott and employee criticism,

he subsequently spoke out publicly against it. He then faced harsh

blowback from conservatives, with Florida’s governor, Ron DeSantis,

attempting to revoke beneﬁcial tax treatment on Disney’s Florida land.

One publication described Chapek’s ﬁring as the result of a “woke war”

— an example of an increasingly unwinnable dilemma facing CEOs.

The demand for authenticity in leadership has also surged.

Everyone expects CEOs to be more open, which includes sharing

personal stories and experiences. On the one hand, authenticity

can foster trust and credibility, potentially reducing the emotional

burdens of the job. However, it can also increase vulnerability and

emotional exposure, leading to stress. Disclosing personal information,

particularly on controversial matters, can elicit backlash or criticism,

adding to the emotional burden. CEOs must balance being authentic

and maintaining professional boundaries, a delicate act that, in itself,

# constitutes emotional labor.

One leader who’s met this challenge with grace is Satya Nadella, CEO

of Microsoft. Nadella, the married father of three children, has given

interviews about the challenges of raising a family while holding a high-

proﬁle job, welcoming reporters into his home to talk about limiting his

children’s screen time and caring for the family dog. In his book Hit

Refresh, Nadella wrote about his son, Zain, who had cerebral palsy, and

how parenting a child with this condition increased his empathy as a

leader. When Zain died in 2022, it was international news — turning a

## family’s moment of private grief into an event for the public stage.

Although allowing people to see the personal side of leaders can create

beneﬁts for the organization, expecting this behavior creates a new

demand for the CEO role. Not everyone is willing to share in this way,

and I worry that this requirement may screen out extremely capable

leaders who would make great CEOs — but who decline to pursue the

role because the clamor for authenticity can reduce their ability to keep

# parts of their lives private.

# CEOs Need Tools to Cope

So how can CEOs navigate the emotional labor inherent in their roles?

Based on my experience, I advise leaders to rely on four tools:

# Rely on close conﬁdants.

We’re all familiar with the cliché “It’s lonely at the top,” and phrases

like this become cliches because they are grounded in truth. When

the job becomes especially challenging, some business leaders tend

to withdraw into themselves and retreat into isolation. This is the

wrong instinct: Loneliness only compounds the stress. Instead, CEOs

feeling stressed by emotional labor should reach out to a close group of

## trusted conﬁdants with whom they can share their emotional burden.

In my experience, the people CEOs rely on for this are often outside

## the organization (and rarely on the board of directors that oversees

the CEO); instead, they tend to be lifelong friends, college classmates,

former colleagues or mentors, or family members. Talking through

issues with people who have some distance, who will speak candidly,

and who will keep conversations private is essential. It can take a big

# load oﬀ.

# Listen to Professional Advisors.

Particularly when facing a crisis, companies often hire teams of

external advisors and PR consultants. These people bring the beneﬁt

of experience: they understand the arc of a crisis, have seen

which approaches tend to work (and don’t), and often have trusted

relationships with media organizations. This makes them potential

sources of tremendous value, and CEOs should listen to them. At the

same time, CEOs should focus on the root of the word advisor, which

is “advise.” CEOs should be careful not to outsource or delegate in a

way that causes them to lose control or become distanced from the

controversy or challenge. In situations requiring emotional labor, CEOs

should hire and listen to the best advisors they can ﬁnd—but they must

remain in control and make critical decisions.

# Recognize It’s Not Personal.

When people are upset, they prefer to be angry at someone rather than

something. Corporations are abstract and faceless, so the CEO becomes

## the personiﬁcation and embodiment of the organization. Even though

the vitriol may feel personal and unfair, leaders must remember that

people are angry or distressed with the company and not at them

as individuals. While a CEO has no choice but to take responsibility

on behalf of the organization, they must avoid owning criticism too

personally. These are times when CEOs can beneﬁt from personal

habits and disciplines, like exercise, meditation, or hobbies, that are

# restorative and rebuild resilience.

# Anticipate Others’ Emotional Reaction.

Leaders must anticipate the eﬀect their actions will have and the

emotions they will induce, in others and on themselves. CEOs rely on

their own emotional intelligence for this sensibility, which gets better

over time, partly from gaining experience in dealing with stakeholders

to see patterns in how they react, and partly from gaining practice in delivering and living with diﬃcult decisions. Nevertheless, CEOs need

to be mindful that they and those closest to them may not always

appreciate how diﬀerent constituencies feel. To supplement their own

anticipatory skills, savvy CEOs rely on others who can serve as listening

posts and can help them understand and think through the nuance of

emotionally charged decisions.

. . .

The role of a CEO involves a broad spectrum of emotional labor,

from maintaining personal composure to managing the emotional

climate of an entire organization. This labor is intensiﬁed by the

rising expectations for CEO activism and authenticity, coupled with

the relentless crises they must navigate. However, with emotional

intelligence, and a mindful approach to authenticity, CEOs can manage

## the emotional labor inherent in their roles.
