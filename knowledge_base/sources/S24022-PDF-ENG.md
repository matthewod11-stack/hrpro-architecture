Delivering sustained growth is one of the hardest things a company

can do. A brilliant idea or product innovation can create a burst

of episodic growth, but few companies demonstrate growth year in

## and year out, especially amid the disruptions and uncertain economy

we’ve experienced during the 2020s. Some companies have cracked the

code on sustained growth, however, while realizing the elusive goal of

knowing precisely where next quarter’s revenue will come from.

## HBR / Spotlight Article / Create a System to Grow Consistently

To better understand the value that can be created when ﬁrms grow

consistently, we and our colleague Brett Davidson conducted a study of

2,142 publicly traded U.S. companies with annual revenues of more than

$200 million. We divided the companies into quartiles based on their

## ﬁve-year compound annual growth rates (CAGRs) over the period 2018

to 2022 and focused on the top quartile of growth performers. We rank-

ordered those 535 companies—we call them growth leaders—by revenue

growth for each year within the period and identiﬁed the ones that were

in the top half every single year. That’s remarkably consistent growth,

and for that reason, we call those 234 companies growth champions.

Both groups in the top quartile had similar average CAGRs over

time, but the growth champions demonstrated a consistency that was

signiﬁcantly more valued by the market, earning an average valuation of

4.2 times revenue versus 2.8 for growth leaders and 1.7 for companies in

# the lower three quartiles.

Next, we sought to understand what allowed the growth champions to

show such steady upward trajectories in revenue. Was it their business

models? Were they simply faster at putting diﬀerentiated solutions in

customers’ hands? Did acquisitions play a role in propelling consistent

growth? Those factors mattered, of course, but our study conﬁrmed

what we have observed in our work for many years: The highest-

performing organizations invested in a growth system, an integrated

collection of capabilities and assets that drove both short-term and

# long-term growth.

This approach is fundamentally diﬀerent from the way companies

tend to manage growth. Most are stuck on a treadmill, searching for

growth in places where they have no fundamental advantage (or, worse,

are disadvantaged). So even when they manage to increase revenues

the cost is often prohibitive. At the extreme, companies become

desperate for growth, viewing almost every customer acquisition as a

high-stakes endeavor. They squeeze out short-term growth by extending

price discounts, managing the endless churn of customers with new

promotions, pushing out innovations that wind up cannibalizing

existing revenue, or launching dozens of initiatives that they know are

underfunded or in target areas where they don’t have a diﬀerentiated

oﬀering. In the process, they become weaker competitors.

To deliver consistent growth over time, companies must get oﬀ the

treadmill, which invariably requires a big mindset shift: Leaders need

to focus less on tactics for achieving short-term growth and more on

building a fundamental engine of long-term growth.

# The Five Components of a Growth System

Our research—which includes interviews and case studies—shows that

a growth system has ﬁve components. We describe them below through

## the lens of successful companies—Toast, IKEA, Vertex, Adobe, and

Roblox—that have built eﬀective growth systems. No company we

studied has developed all ﬁve elements perfectly, but these companies

have a keen sense of how to improve their growth system over time.

Deﬁne a compelling customer outcome. The foundation of a growth

system is a diﬀerentiated and compelling customer oﬀering—a clear,

relevant, and unique promise that deﬁnes what you will deliver and

to whom. Consider Toast, a leader in ﬁntech that has achieved growth

consistency by creating payment solutions speciﬁcally for restaurants.

Toast is dedicated to helping restaurant employees delight their guests

by focusing on food and hospitality instead of payment logistics.

It continually hones and improves its oﬀering, with innovations

## such as self-service check-out kiosks and loyalty-program-management

technology that makes it easy for restaurants to design customer

reward programs and launch targeted email-marketing campaigns to

build engagement. By designing its growth system around a needed,

diﬀerentiated solution for restaurants, Toast has carved out a strong position in a crowded market and has made it extremely diﬃcult for

generic payment-solution providers to encroach on its turf.

Architect the right capabilities. Growth champions create highly

speciﬁc blueprints that detail how all the capabilities of their growth

system work together to create products, solutions, and services that

deliver the desired customer outcomes. These blueprints are much like

those for complex buildings, specifying all the resources, technology,

data, and processes required to do the work. Growth champions

invest heavily in these capabilities, taking resources from other places

as necessary. They also rely on their ecosystem business partners

to help build out key elements of the blueprint. These companies

spend a signiﬁcant amount of executive energy on the design and

implementation of this system; it is what deﬁnes the organization,

rather than the products and services that come and go.

IKEA has developed a clear growth system featuring highly speciﬁc

capabilities that deliver the promised outcome of home furnishings

that everyone can aﬀord. Its system includes superior design capability

coupled with deep knowledge about how to control cost and price.

## Nearly every aspect of a piece of furniture—from its dimensions to

material choices to the customer assembly process that’s integral to IKEA’s eﬃcient ﬂat packaging—is carefully modeled as part of the

design process. IKEA’s materials-procurement process balances a short-

sustainability. To improve the design of its products, the company has

invested in a “privileged insights” capability to learn how customers

go about their daily lives (including working with customers to

glean insights from cameras placed in their homes) so that it can

create innovative oﬀerings aimed at solving a wider set of customer

challenges. Another linchpin is IKEA’s store set-up capability that improves customers’ browsing and shopping experience by eﬃciently

organizing collections of merchandise. Thanks to these carefully

architected capabilities, IKEA has expanded its oﬀering globally while

growing sales with existing customers.

Create the right operating model. Operating models constrain growth

when they promote silos around key functions such as marketing,

sales, product development, pricing, and customer service. In too many

companies, each function creates its own operating model, which

impedes collaboration. To build the kind of integration necessary in

a growth system, companies must rethink how they organize the most

important parts of their businesses, setting up outcome-oriented, cross-

## functional teams with the right expertise.

Vertex is a global biotech ﬁrm that has grown by delivering on its

purpose to provide novel treatments in specialty disease areas such

as cystic ﬁbrosis, diabetes, sickle cell anemia, and acute pain. It

has designed a novel end-to-end operating model that breaks down

## silos across internal groups (R&D, clinical delivery, and commercial

delivery, for example) and external constituents (academic researchers,

## smaller biotech ﬁrms, patient advocacy groups, hospitals, insurers, and

manufacturing partners) to accelerate drug discovery and development.

It continually invests in and tunes the model as the company grows. For

example, as Vertex expanded globally and became more decentralized,

it created new ways to promote innovation, such as tournaments,

training programs, and facilitated lectures by leading scientists. To

improve its breakthrough cystic-ﬁbrosis treatments, it works with

health care providers to optimize care pathways from hospital centers

into patients’ homes, creating better patient experiences and outcomes.

To scale drug production while maintaining quality, it works with

select manufacturing partners to develop continuous manufacturing

technology (the ﬁrst such program to secure FDA approval). Vertex’s

operating model also includes a culture that promotes breaking the

status quo and learning from failure, which is central to developing new

treatments, delivering better patient outcomes, and propelling growth.

Renew insights continuously. Growth champions anticipate how trends

will aﬀect customers and revenue generation, now and in the future.

They realize that timing matters: Spotting the right trends early is

necessary to make investment plans and shift product portfolios. But

make no mistake: We’re not talking about generic trend analysis.

Growth systems aren’t unidimensional or temporal; they do not rely

## on dutiful, check-the-box customer-satisfaction surveys. Instead, they

are built on integrating direct exchanges with customers as part of

the value delivered, including open-ended dialogue with people about

## their likes and dislikes across the product development and use cycle.

Companies that build these next-generation insights capabilities look

for all opportunities to engage with and learn about their customers,

from the ordering and delivery of products and services, to postsale

interactions like warranty support. Growth-system companies use those

insights to ﬁnd the “white space” where opportunity lies, improve

features, ﬁne-tune service models, and understand what competitors

are doing to capture mindshare and wallet share.

Adobe’s system of customer engagement is dynamically linked to the

experience of using the ﬁrm’s software. Many Adobe products, such as

Photoshop, oﬀer tremendous functionality, but their complexity can be

daunting to users. So Adobe has embedded technology that provides

instant feedback and tips for users according to what problem they are

trying to solve. At the same time, Adobe learns where customers are

spending their time, what unique problems they are bringing to the

software, and what capabilities they may need in the future to solve

them. Our study showed that simply identifying insights—using market

## research, for example—is not typically a successful path to growth.

Companies that build processes to engage customers not only learn

more about their users but also create the type of value that drives real

loyalty and translates directly into growth.

Measure return and reallocate investment. Growth champions allocate

resources to capabilities that help them achieve diﬀerentiated customer

outcomes, and they reinvest the proﬁts in those resources. They also

carefully measure the relationships between inputs (investments) and

outputs (performance). While key metrics include R&D growth, asset

## growth, revenue growth, margin growth, customer satisfaction, return

## on invested capital, and total shareholder returns over a ﬁve-year time

period, one of the most important metrics for these companies is simply

how much they are funding their growth system. Because budgets tend

to be based on a year-over-year process and closely tied to a siloed

functional model, most companies struggle to meaningfully shift their

investments to the most important capabilities for growth. To propel the

growth system, they need to ask, How much of our budget is going to

those areas? Are we making progress toward the goals of each part of our

# system?

Growth champions build next-generation capabilities to engage with and learn about their customers, from ordering and delivery to postsale interactions like warranty support.

in-platform user-to-user call features to expand engagement. Roblox

also looks for ways to embed its platform in devices with active gamer

populations, such as Sony PlayStation, and in emerging domains such

as virtual reality headsets. When people use these assets, they generate

in-game, easily convertible currency, called Robux. That allows Roblox

to connect the number of daily active users and engagement hours with

revenue growth. And that, in turn, helps the company decide where to

make its next wave of growth investments.

# Putting It All Together

Designing an all-encompassing growth system is not easy. A prime

example of a company that has demonstrated sustained success by

creating such a system is Salesforce, one of the growth champions in our

study. Salesforce is laser-focused on customer outcomes, diversifying its

oﬀerings to respond to an evolving market while grounding innovation

in what is important to its customers—something some rival tech

companies have been slower to do.

Over the past decade, Salesforce has supplemented its ﬂagship CRM

capabilities with cloud-computing and AI services, while also acquiring

## Tableau (visual analytics) and Slack (real-time messaging). Salesforce

continually collects customer insights through its IdeaExchange

platform, which allows users to propose new features or changes to

products. Trailhead, Salesforce’s learning platform that engages with

users through gamiﬁed training and resources, has been instrumental

in building a knowledgeable, proﬁcient user community, fueling

innovation and driving revenue. Salesforce’s basic operating model—

customers pay subscription fees, with charges increasing the more

they use its software—aligns top-line growth with customer success.

Salesforce aims to make it easy for customers to use its products,

and as they do, revenue per customer and the number of multimillion-

dollar accounts naturally grows. What’s more, Salesforce’s revenue is

remarkably consistent, thanks to multiyear subscription agreements.

The software-as-a-service (SaaS) model also naturally generates data on

how and how much customers are using the software—a key metric for

measuring ROI. The entire growth system creates network eﬀects that

lead to not only higher sales of new products and more cross-selling but

also a high retention rate—a number Salesforce publishes to reinforce

# its commitment to customer success.

So where to start? In studying companies that have successfully

built elements of a growth system, we observed four behaviors that

help create momentum. First, growth-system companies have the full

support of the CEO, who is often the person instigating the work

and who plays a vital role in getting companywide buy-in. They

also have real collaboration among executive team members, who are

committed to building a system together rather than just focusing on

# their individual areas.

Second, they acknowledge that growth systems require a multiple-year

journey to build and scale. CEOs and executives prioritize investment

in the system even as they strive to meet near-term targets. As Frans

van Houten, a former CEO of Philips, says: “We talk about the need to

both perform and transform. If you only transform but don’t perform,

you have no here and now. If you only perform but don’t transform,

you have no future. Therefore, in our scorecards we measure both. In

our reviews we talk about both. And the targets that I give to all my

executives…always [include] some transform objectives.”

Third, these companies create a three- to ﬁve-year timetable, listing

milestones and deliverables against the blueprint, and they inspire their

teams to create the most-diﬀerentiated and -valuable capabilities to

propel the system forward over the long term. This is not a ﬁnancial

forecasting exercise; it’s a well-conceived road map of how the portfolio

of products and services will evolve and what capabilities must be

developed to deliver on current and future growth targets.

Lastly, growth-champion leaders provide continual and dedicated

support. This work can’t be a side job for a few high performers; it must

be a central focus of the company, with a management structure that

supports it and an ongoing cadence for reporting to the leadership team

# on progress.

. . .

Executives are exhausted from the ongoing search for growth. If your

team spends its time tactically eking out revenue increases, it’s time

to step back and understand the power of a growth system. Great

innovation can create the next market, and great insights will uncover

new opportunities. Companies should not and cannot wait for markets

to be deﬁned or disrupted. Even when products and services become

outdated, the system’s capabilities can be extended or repurposed to

shape and transform your future.
