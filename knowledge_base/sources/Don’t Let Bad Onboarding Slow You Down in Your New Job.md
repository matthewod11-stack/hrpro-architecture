But there’s a problem. By the end of your second week, you startto feel disconnected from your team. Many of the basics thatshould have been covered in your initial onboarding — peopleyou should be meeting, tasks you should be prioritizing,technologies you should be learning — have gotten swept underthe rug. Your manager hasn’t been much help, and the lack ofcommunication feels isolating.Unfortunately, this scenario is fairly common. I see it often withpeople working in hybrid or remote environments.

When you start a new role, it’s crucial to grasp yourresponsibilities, the company’s policies, and the team dynamics.When this information is scarce or missing, it’s a bad sign. Youmay find yourself guessing your manager’s expectations,confused about the purpose of your role, and uncertain aboutteam project or priorities. This ambiguity often leads to mistakesand stress that you could otherwise avoid.A lack of access to basic tools.Every organization has a few essential tools and technologies thatemployees use to interact, work, and communicate. This could bea specific program used for scheduling meetings or a hub whereyou can access company updates and employee trainings.Navigating a new job without clear instructions on how to usethese tools can make you feel lost, as if you’re constantly confusedabout things that come easily to everyone else. This not onlyreduces your productivity — it can also foster feelings ofinadequacy.A lack of communication with your team.Regular interactions with your team and supervisors should gobeyond “good morning” messages on Slack or quick updates onthe tasks of the day. These interactions should help you integrateinto the company culture. When your manager and teammembers are difficult to get in touch with, it isolates you from thegroup’s rhythm. This is even more true in remote and hybridsettings, when you have less opportunities to interact in-person.Isolation can lower your morale and dampen your ability to buildrelationships essential to your career growth.How to Onboard Yourself If you notice one or more of the red flags above, it may be time totake things into your own hands.

giving up on the organization, there are a few thing you can do tosee if the situation can be improved. In my experience, a goodapproach is to craft an onboarding plan tailored to your needs,with defined goals and timelines. This will also help you figureout if the problem is your manager or if it’s a larger company-wideissue (in which case, you may need to move on).Your personal onboarding plan should include a few basics likelearning the company’s tools and systems, connecting with yourmanager, and getting updated on team projects. But it should alsoinclude a few less obvious steps — understanding the companyculture and building connections with key stakeholders.Step 1: Get on your manager’s calendar.Regular communication with your manager will be essential toyour success, particularly in settings where face-to-faceinteractions are limited. You need that face time to get aligned ongoals, advocate for yourself, seek feedback, and keep themupdated on your projects, progress, and challenges.To start, request a weekly one-on-one meeting. Send them a shortSlack or email, such as: “Hi [name], I was hoping we could set up aweekly one-on-one meeting to make sure we’re aligned on mytasks and initial goals while I’m getting up to speed witheverything. Would it be okay if I added a 30-minute meeting toyour calendar?”You can always reach out more frequently if you have questions orconcerns, but getting on their calendar will help you establish ahealthy check-in cadence and learn more about their

# communication style.

In situations where your manager is failing to give you adequateguidance, being direct (but respectful) is the fastest way to gainclarity. Use your time together to update them on youronboarding progress, and ask how they expect you to focus yourtime. You can say, “What projects or tasks would be most usefulfor me to take on this month? Do you have recommendations onwho I can connect with to get updated in these areas?” Yourproactivity not only shows that you’re engaged with the work, butit also demonstrates your willingness to take initiative andunderstand the team goals on a deeper level.Pro tip: If you need additional resources, support, or feedbackfrom your boss, be sure to explain the “why” behind any ask youmake. Critical feedback is particularly important to your growthand improvement as you adjust to your new role. Aftercompleting a new task or project, you can ask your manager,“What did you think of my work on [project]? I want to make sureI’m meeting your expectations and see if there are any areaswhere I can improve.”Step 2: Ask about essential resources.As a new employee, you’ll need to access to essential resources —the technologies, tools, manuals, and training modules necessaryto do your job. In an ideal situation, your manager, HR, and ITdepartments would provide you with this information duringyour first week. However, if this is not happening, it’s worthreaching out to the following groups:

Human Resources (HR): Explain that you’re a new hire and askabout any training modules you must complete. These mayrange from technical skills development to compliancetrainings, or other company-speciﬁc trainings all new hires arerequired to complete.

Information Technology (IT): IT departments sometimes oﬀertechnology orientations or guides for new hires. If you haven’treceived direct instructions from your boss, contact an IT teammember directly. They can provide you with the tools necessaryfor your role and teach you how to use them eﬀectively. Thisproactive approach ensures you won’t experience technicaldiﬃculties that could hinder your job responsibilities.If you reach a dead end at any point, the next best place to look isthe company’s intranet. This is an internal network (similar to acompany-wide information hub) that typically contains companypolicies, organizational goals, team structures, ongoing projects,and even social events. Many organizational intranets work likesearch engines. You can type in what you’re looking for and bedirected to a wide range of resources. Digesting this informationwill help you feel more grounded in your role.Pro tip: If you decide to reach out to HR or IT on your own, besure to keep your manager updated. You can shoot them a quicknote that says: “I wanted to let you know I plan to reach out to HRand IT this week to get updated on any trainings and technologiesI need access to. Just wanted to keep you updated!” This way, yourmanager won’t feel you’re overstepping them. They may evenappreciate your proactivity.Step 3: Observe the company culture.Company culture is the shared set of

# values, goals, beliefs, and

behaviors that guide people within your organization.Understanding it requires keen observation, participation incompany activities, and sometimes, adjusting your work style toget better aligned with the work style of the company. Doing thiscan help you integrate more smoothly.

Even if your work is remote or hybrid, make an effort to observethe interactions of your colleagues and leaders in meetings. Payattention to how decisions are made, how projects are assigned,and how people communicate with each other. Does your bossemphasize collaboration and consensus, or are things morehierarchical? Do people read the agenda before the meeting andshow up with ideas, or do they prefer to problem solve on thespot? Once you understand the social dynamics on your team, youcan navigate the best ways to contribute to them.Participation in online social activities will also teach you aboutthe culture. Whether it’s a virtual team-building exercises, onlinesocial hour, or affinity group gathering, these activities will helpyou connect with people beyond your immediate team and on amore personal level. Think of them as opportunities to showcaseyour personality and interests. The more authentic connectionsyou make, the more you’ll start to

feel like you belong.Pro tip: While it’s important to align with the company’s ways ofworking, it’s equally important to maintain your personal workethics and values. For instance, if the company culture is fast-paced and deadline-driven, find ways to meet these expectationswhile ensuring the quality of your work isn’t compromised. It’sabout finding that middle ground where you can thrive withoutlosing sight of your professional standards.Step 4: Set up meetings with important stakeholders.We all know that

networking is a crucial component ofprofessional success. Luckily, you’re in a great position to begin.You can use your “newness” as a conversation starter to connectwith important people throughout the organization — peers,colleagues, and decision-makers who can become your allies andadvocates.

Look for people both within your team and in other departmentswho have a wealth of knowledge and experience. For instance, isthere a team member at your level who’s been around longer andwho can provide you with guidance? Is there an executive whosecareer path you admire and who could become a potentialmentor? Is there a colleague in another department whose workoverlaps with your own, and whom you could learn from?The goal is to choose people who have expertise that can help younavigate the culture, adjust to your new role, and eventually,identify opportunities for growth and development. While youwon’t connect on a personal level with everyone, you may end upbuilding a deeper camaraderie with a few.Pro tip: Write down a list of five people (other than your manager)who you want to connect with and invite them to an introductorymeeting. It can be as straightforward as asking them to join youfor a 30-minute virtual coffee chat. Prior to the meeting, do a littleresearch on their backgrounds, and show up with three or fourquestions about their professional journeys, hobbies, or interests.At the end of each discussion, ask your colleagues if there’sanyone else they suggest you meet with to better understand yourrole, the organization, and how everything works.For early career professionals, facing the challenge of minimal orineffective onboarding should be seen less as a setback than aunique opportunity for personal growth and self-development.This situation, while initially daunting, serves as an invaluablelearning experience.The competencies you’ll acquire by taking the steps above —proactivity, effective communication, problem-solving, self-reliance, adaptability, and accountability — are building blocksthat can shape you into a resilient and versatile professional.
