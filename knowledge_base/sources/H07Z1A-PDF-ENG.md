## Recently, the new CEO of a global consumer entertainment company

decided that integrating the company’s distinct brands into one digital

platform was a key strategy for future growth. He asked the dozen

executives leading each brand to create a plan together for how to make

it a reality. The team met several times. The CEO was looking forward to

hearing their recommendations in a meeting he’d set up to get started.

However, he was in for a rude awakening.

The team kicked oﬀ the meeting by saying: “We’re sorry, but we’ve spent

extensive time on this and we’re stuck. We haven’t ﬁgured out how to

work together to make this happen.” The CEO was stunned, and thus

began a months-long process of building the leaders’ ability to lead

# across the business.

Sadly, this is not an isolated example. In a recent CEO research study

we conducted, we interviewed a dozen CEOs of mid- to large-size

companies. There was one key challenge every CEO mentioned: their

frustration at not being able to get their executive teams to work

together. “I’m the only one who thinks about the entire company,” one

CEO lamented, “and despite my best eﬀorts, each of my executives is

only concerned with their own function or team.”

It’s long been recognized that cross-functional collaboration is

essential. Still, stubborn silos that bog down execution, hamper

innovation, and slow decision-making are still a common and persistent

challenge. In our work with company leaders, we’ve found that without

leaders working together at the top, silos and dysfunction are inevitable.

The onus is therefore on senior leaders to knock down these silos —

moving beyond their ability to lead their own teams to also prioritize

leading across the organization.

# Obstacles to Cross-Functional Leadership

Organizational complexity, more work spanning multiple functions,

and the need for faster decision-making have made cross-business

collaboration table stakes for staying competitive. Massive changes

caused by the pandemic, more geographically dispersed teams, less in-

## person interaction, and a continued lack of enterprise-wide incentives

have created even more obstacles to working together across the

# business.

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Lead Across a Siloed Organization

Given our work with senior leaders and their increasing angst at

trying to get things done cross functionally, we set out to better

understand how great leaders navigate these challenges to drive results.

We interviewed dozens of senior leaders (VP level and above) who were

nominated by their organizations as individuals who could get things

done across the business without damaging relationships along the way.

Through our interviews, we found very clear and distinct patterns for

how leaders do this well. Speciﬁcally, we found there are particular

mindsets, skills, and practices top-performing leaders use to lead cross-

enterprise eﬀorts and achieve signiﬁcant outcomes for the organization.

We also found that leaders feel ill-equipped in how to lead across. Their

experience and development is in traditional vertical leadership (i.e.,

managing their own teams), but not in getting things done with peers

who have diﬀerent agendas, priorities, and motivations. The skillsets

are not the same.

## What Sets Successful Cross-Functional Leaders Apart

Leaders who thrive cross functionally possess what we call “lateral

agility,” or the ability to move side to side quickly while maintaining

their balance. They spend as much time leading across the organization

as they do with their own teams. In organizations, this means eﬀectively

partnering with leaders of diﬀerent departments to further enterprise

goals, while maintaining a focus on their own group’s objectives. Here

are three traits these high-performing leaders have in common.

Expanded mindsets. High-performing, cross-functional leaders

embrace expanded mindsets that lean on humility to activate bigger

their lower-performing colleagues. In cross-functional decisions, they

use powerful phrases like: “What do the organization or our customers

# need from our work together?”

- They believe their role is to ﬁnd expertise everywhere. They exhibit

the humility to integrate the expertise of others, acknowledging that

the greatest path to success is to assemble the right team, rather than

trying to do it all themselves. As one leader explained, “My job is

to synthesize the wisdom of all these experts in their various roles

and weave it all together.” And another leader told us, “Sometimes

followership is the greatest act of leadership.”

## Connective skills. A high degree of curiosity and empathy fuel

connective skills that allow these leaders to forge trusted and mutually

## beneﬁcial relationships across the organization:

- They build understanding and trust by proactively seeking to clarify

## the motivations and constraints of colleagues and stakeholders. One

leader we interviewed said, “If you don’t understand what it’s like to be

in your colleague’s shoes, you’re not going anywhere.”

- They ﬁnd ways to win together, seeking and creating solutions that

leverage next-level negotiation skills to make all stakeholders feel

a part of the solution. Several leaders talked of using “paradoxical

questions,” such as: “How can you and I ﬁnd a solution that enables

me to achieve what I’m trying to do, while also enabling your team to

meet its objectives?” This forces expansive thinking and avoids either-

# or discussions.

Innovative practices. In their day-to-day work, the leaders who are

successful at leading across use simple practices that go a long way in

## building credibility with their peers and bridges across departments:

- They “make purple” with their cross-functional colleagues. As one

leader told us, “I bring red, you bring blue, and together we create

something purple — something diﬀerent and better than either of

us would have created alone.” This leverages the idea of bringing a

“sketch” to a conversation: not starting from scratch, but also not

forcing a fully developed plan on others who weren’t involved in

creating it. One health care executive we talked to said: “I used to

push my team to accept my ideas because I wanted to move fast.

But I’ve realized over years of experience that the quickest way to get

alignment is to involve others up front in crafting the answer.”

- They reach across, prioritizing relationship-building with those

stakeholders most important to getting work done. Realizing that

trust is key to eﬀective problem-solving, leaders with lateral agility

understand that this is time well spent.

## How to Become a Better Cross-Functional Leader

Some organizations are now recognizing that intentional eﬀort is

required to promote cross-enterprise collaboration. They’re beginning

to develop lateral agility in their leaders and are re-examining

incentives to ensure they promote inter-departmental collaboration

rather than cross-departmental conﬂict. And they’re looking at

organizational structures to ﬁnd ways to minimize silos.

Here are a few strategies to increase your own lateral agility:

- Take inventory of how well you’re managing cross-functional

relationships. Considering the practices described above, which can

yield the most beneﬁt for you? Identify your top ﬁve to eight

stakeholders, then map them against their strategic importance to

you versus the frequency of interaction you have with them. Are you

putting enough time and intention into building the cross-enterprise

relationships that matter most?

- Assess how much time you’re taking to lead across versus leading your

own team. Knowing that the most successful leaders are now spending

as much time leading across as leading vertically, what implications

does that have for how you spend your time day to day?

- Be a student of your own organization. Take time with peers outside of

your department to understand what their goals are, what challenges

they’re facing, and what motivates them. The more you put yourselves

in their shoes, the more lateral trust you will build, and the more you’ll

understand about your broader company and how it operates.

. . .

We now know that lateral agility is a vital capability for today’s

senior leader. It’s no longer enough to lead a team well — too much

work happens across functions and organizations. The very deﬁnition

of eﬀective leadership has changed in response to that reality. By

becoming more laterally agile, leaders can ﬁnally make the promise of

cross-functional collaboration real, enabling their organizations to bust

silos, speed decision-making, and bring their strategies to life.
