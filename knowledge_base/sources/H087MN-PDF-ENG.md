Organizational change is constant in an era marked by rapid

technological advancements, shifting market dynamics, and the

lingering eﬀects of a global pandemic. A survey by McKinsey &

Company found that 80% of organizations have experienced some

form of transformation in the past ﬁve years, yet only a third of these

initiatives have been successful.

Departmental transitions — whether due to restructuring, leadership

## changes, or strategic shifts — present leaders with one of the most

challenging change circumstances because of the real hit they can take

to morale, productivity, and cohesion.

Here are four strategies to help guide your team through this type of

# transition.

Communicate the “why” clearly and authentically

Clear, transparent communication is the foundation of successfully

navigating departmental transitions. Leaders must articulate the “why”

behind changes, providing context and outlining the anticipated impact

on the team. This must involve more than a one-time, one-way

shout out. As a leader, you should listen to your team’s thoughts

on the transition to address their immediate concerns, conﬁrm each

individual’s understanding, and create opportunities for the message to

# truly resonate with everyone.

## For example, in a recent departmental transition at a

software development company, the CEO leveraged multi-channel

communication — including regular town hall meetings and

personalized messages — to communicate openly with the entire team

about the need to restructure departments in alignment with the

company’s new strategic goals. These meetings served as interactive

sessions for addressing concerns, answering questions, and providing

updates, fostering a sense of unity and purpose among employees.

The CEO’s approach incorporated visual explanations and clear stories

to further clarify the transition’s goals and processes, which helped

alleviate uncertainty and anxiety among team members. By taking this

approach, the CEO was able to maintain employee trust by anchoring

leadership around core values and principles, since these remain stable

even when the environment isn’t. This transparent communication

strategy, underpinned by a commitment to two-way dialogue and

## regular updates, exempliﬁes eﬀective leadership in times of change.

# Acknowledge the emotional impact

Corporate transitions can have a massive psychological impact on

employees, and to address this reality, leaders must focus on empathy

## and support. In the context of the software development company’s

departmental transition, the changes in reporting structures and job

roles stirred apprehension among team members. Supported by the

CEO’s multi-channel communication, department heads organized

one-on-one meetings to openly discuss concerns, oﬀer reassurance,

and assist people in adapting to new processes. The company also

oﬀered support mechanisms to help employees through the transition,

including access to counseling services and professional development

opportunities. This approach not only helped address employees’

immediate emotional distress but also turned these challenges into

growth potential, illustrating the profound impact of emotionally

## intelligent leadership during periods of change.

# Cultivate ownership and involvement

Empowering team members to actively contribute to the transition

process can signiﬁcantly boost employee engagement while instilling

a sense of ownership. To facilitate this process, leaders should

involve employees in decision-making, solicit their input on

implementation strategies, and delegate responsibilities accordingly

during a departmental transition. Leaders can drive innovation and

increase the chance of a successful outcome by leveraging the team’s

collective wisdom, rather than taking a top-down leadership approach.

By prioritizing their team’s psychological safety, leaders can create

an environment where team members feel empowered to take risks,

knowing it’s okay that not every decision will succeed.

## During the restructuring at the software development company, the

CEO formed cross-functional teams of employees to collaborate on the

creation of new organizational structures, rather than simply dictating

what the changes would be. By regularly brainstorming, evaluating a

range of potential solutions, and providing feedback to leadership on

their preferences, these employee teams contributed to the innovation

process, bolstering a culture of collaboration and empowerment. This

collective involvement ensured that employees felt valued, had greater

clarity about their roles, experienced a degree of control over their work,

built stronger relationships through teamwork, and were more likely to

perceive the transition as equitable.

Prepare your team for future changes

Leading through change isn’t just about managing the transition

— it requires empowering and preparing your team for a future

that embraces continuous evolution and collective achievement. By

championing continuous learning and adaptation for your employees,

you can help everyone navigate transitions more smoothly while

positioning the organization for future success. The concept of a

learning organization emphasizes the importance of systems thinking,

shared vision, and team learning in adapting to all types of change.

By investing in the development of their team members, leaders equip

staﬀ with the tools and conﬁdence to continue thriving even when new

organizational changes arise.

Circling back to the software development company example, the

leadership team recognized the need to upskill all employees to

## align team members with new technologies and methodologies.

Leaders organized workshops, seminars, and online courses on agile

development, cloud computing, and data analytics tailored to the

speciﬁc needs of diﬀerent departments. By prioritizing continuous

learning, the company helped to ensure its teams remained competitive

and adaptable in the rapidly evolving tech industry.

Navigating departmental transitions demands that leaders champion

## clear communication, emotional intelligence, ownership, and a culture

of continuous learning. By focusing on these four priorities, leaders can

turn potential disruptions into opportunities for growth and renewal.
