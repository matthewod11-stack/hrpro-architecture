Your 2025 plans are shot to pieces. Thanks to the trade war, weakening

consumer conﬁdence, rising inﬂation expectations, downward pressure

on the U.S. dollar—not to mention the usual uncertainty around

## customers, technology, and competition—your guidance to Wall Street

is about as useful as last year’s Kentucky Derby predictions. Your capital

spending plans…can we pause for a bit? Your hiring plans, marketing

budget, pricing strategy…can we set up time next week?

## HBR / Digital Article / How to Rescue a Failing Strategy

And it’s not just this year’s budget or this year’s plan. For most

companies, the whole foundation of strategy suddenly seems soft:

which markets to go after, who the competition is, how to line up

suppliers and sales and distribution channels, how to create and defend

entry barriers, what AI will do to all the above.

You mustn’t let strategic uncertainly lead to operational and tactical

paralysis. Yes, you need to revisit, review, and revalidate or revise your

strategy, but the world won’t wait for you to ﬁnish thinking. Given the

pace and unpredictability of disruption, there’s a lot to say for progress

over perfection: getting things 80% right fast, then working out the rest.

We’ve seen in our work that there are four no-regrets moves you can

make as you revise your strategy. These actions will create the ﬂexibility

you need to weather major shocks or grab unexpected opportunities,

improve operations, and protect or increase revenues now. All of them

can be done quickly, and they’re strategy-agnostic: They’ll help you

identify, protect, strengthen, and expand your sources of value creation,

whether your strategy is built on being a low-cost provider, a leader in

## technology and innovation, obsessively customer-centric, or something

# else.

- 1. Protect liquidity and increase financial flexibility.

In times of disruption or distress, cash is king. It’s a shield against a cash

crunch and a sword that can be used to seize opportunities.

The risk of a liquidity crisis is real. Interruptions in global trade can

dry up cash, currency ﬂuctuations can increase payables or weaken

receivables, demand can fall, and distressed customers might pay late

or not at all. Looking back to the disruptions Covid caused, a study

by OECD analysts showed that 38% of European companies would

have faced liquidity shortfalls if governments hadn’t helped. The risk is

particularly acute for companies that have high debt-service obligations

(such as many private equity–owned businesses).

## Despite the importance of cash, fewer than one in four companies

(24%) say cash management is one of their top three priorities in

times of disruption, according to data we collected for the AlixPartners

Disruption Index. Many companies have only approximate data about

their cash needs and position, because the numbers are siloed and

aggregation takes time.

Two quick actions can make a big diﬀerence in a company’s cash

position: better forecasting and aggressive improvements in working

# capital management.

Imprecise or inaccurate forecasts cause companies to produce more

than they can sell or hide cash under the corporate mattress. Many

companies’ forecasts aren’t granular enough to track the impact of

## tariﬀs on all their products, components, and materials.

It’s possible to improve forecasting signiﬁcantly in a matter of weeks.

Case in point: We helped one healthcare company improve accuracy

from 80% to nearly 90% within 30 days by integrating basic AI-enabled

## supply chain and inventory management tools, and in the process

discovered large amounts of idle cash.

Better working capital management is the second step toward ﬁnancial

ﬂexibility. Every company pays attention to the money tied up in

receivables, payables, and inventory, but these times call for the

aggressive approach we’ve seen companies take when in turnaround

situations. Payables are quickest: CFOs and treasurers are often

surprised to ﬁnd how frequently their companies pay bills before they’re

due, often because the process for making payments was established

years ago when people still cut checks, payment processes vary by

business unit, or some managers simply don’t know better. Receivables,

too, are often managed in a slapdash way, with invoices sent out days

or weeks late and poor processes for ﬂagging chronically late payers

or pursuing unpaid bills. Permanently reducing inventory takes longer,

but most companies can make quick gains by going back to basics with a

## 13-week cash ﬂow analysis and a sustained cadence of proactive working

# capital reviews.

In each of these cases, AI can accelerate change. For example, it’s

relatively easy to ask AI to compare contractual payment terms with

actual payment times. With a bit more sophistication, AI can create

watchlists of suppliers or customers who are in distress or appear to be

headed there.

- 2. Improve the fitness of your commercial organization.

Facing a downturn, companies often retrench rather than attack. In

fact, they should do both, with high-impact, high-speed programs

to improve customer acquisition and retention. As we’ve written

previously, tactical, quick action can push revenue higher even in a

down market. Within the sales force, there are almost always overlaps

## and gaps in customer coverage, unexploited means of upselling and

cross-selling, and opportunities to improve sales-rep productivity.

Though consumers are stretched, there are still opportunities to raise

prices to cover increased costs, especially for high-end products. And

companies should resist the temptation to cut marketing across the

board and instead undertake a rapid, detailed analysis of marketing

eﬀectiveness so that they can put marketing dollars where they work

# best.

Reducing customer churn and focusing on net retention revenue (NRR)

should also be a priority, especially when new customers are hard

to ﬁnd. For example, a $2 billion Silicon Valley-based technology

service provider we worked with experienced a 10% improvement in

renewal rates ($100 million NRR improvement) in one year by analyzing

the lifetime value of customer segments, developing product bundles

speciﬁcally designed to appeal to each segment, and reconﬁguring

incentives in its sales and service organizations. Using AI, companies

can create models that identify customers that are at risk and create a

“save desk” to intervene.

Retention gains can be big, and they compound. If you pursue

this course of action, you will likely be ahead of your competition:

Our research shows that only 15% of companies deliver white-glove

# customer success support at a low cost.

- 3. Embrace your most profitable customers.

Identify those customers and market segments that are the most

proﬁtable—and don’t take your eye oﬀ them. Proﬁts and proﬁtable

growth potential are always concentrated by market, company,

business, and business segment (i.e., at the intersection of products,

customers, channels, etc.). Financial reporting and analysis are rarely

detailed enough to identify those proﬁtable pockets—but these are the

customers you must ardently work to win, keep, and expand, especially

in tough times. Smart long-term strategy is best built knowing which

channels, customers, and segments are most proﬁtable for you.

A detailed analysis of proﬁtability (including accounting for the cost of

the capital consumed by each product or segment) can take months,

but back-of-the-envelope calculations can be done quickly can give you

much-needed momentum, even if you need to reﬁne your approach a

# few times down the road.

- 4. Strengthen risk management and cybersecurity.

The last thing you need now is a serious risk that materializes out of

nowhere; yet changes in both trade and technology have ratcheted up

threats of all kinds, including cybersecurity breaches or ﬁnancial risks

caused by distress in a key supplier or distributor.

Bad actors exploit times like these. Forty-six percent of executives

## worldwide cite cybersecurity as a major threat, a 20-point increase

from a year ago. They’re right: Any signiﬁcant changes to ﬁnancial

## systems, technology platforms, or those of partners or suppliers can

open new vulnerabilities. New suppliers need vetting. The risk proﬁles

of even reliable partners can turn from green to red as they cope

with their own disruptions. In trade wars, state actors might attack

## even purely domestic players like hospitals and power companies. AI

has accelerated the cybersecurity arms race, with both attackers and

defenders using it.

It’s urgent to audit your cyber defenses, which, in our experience,

needs to be done from inside-out (testing and upgrading current

plans) and outside-in (auditing or stress-testing by an objective expert).

That should include an initiative to begin, dust oﬀ, or level-up third-

party risk management (TPRM). Data from Verizon shows that the

percentage of cyber breaches coming via third parties has doubled

in the last year. Companies therefore need better supplier monitoring

and diversiﬁcation and stronger capabilities in scenario planning,

wargaming, contract analysis, and so on so that they can rank suppliers

on a full spectrum of risk. Many outside advisors (disclosure: including

our company, AlixPartners) can do this quickly, using AI to speed up risk

scoring for Tier One, Tier Two, and even Tier Three suppliers; advanced

programs are even able to predict problems.

These initiatives cannot substitute for strategy. If your strategy has been

sideswiped or totaled, you still need to repair or replace it. But these

four moves will buy you time, create options, and protect you against

# the worst.

Many companies aspire to coordinate a sustained, cross-functional

response to rapidly evolving market conditions, and many fail.

Winning companies in their environment share two traits. First

is their willingness and ability to embrace the change and move

forward, even with imperfect information and even if they have to

change course midstream. Second is their determination that, even

while improvising, they’re guided by four points of a compass: cash,

commercial eﬀectiveness, customers, and risk. Companies that keep

this compass in front of them set themselves apart by translating acute

challenges into the very means of achieving competitive advantage and

learning as they go. After all, in this environment, no deliberate strategy

—memorialized in binders full of carefully crafted PowerPoint slides—is

likely to last. This is all about emergent strategy, which is driven by

on-the-ground realities and responding to unforeseen changes ahead.
