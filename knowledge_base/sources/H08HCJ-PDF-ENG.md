Startups often choose to base their ﬂedgling companies in “tech

clusters,” seeking to beneﬁt from these areas’ developed labor markets

for technical, sales, and managerial staﬀ — typically arising from a

signiﬁcant presence of large ﬁrms. Yet while this proximity to talent

can provide access to the specialists a startup may need to scale, it

also forces these new companies to oﬀer high wages to compete with

the oﬀerings of their large ﬁrm competitors. Spending large amounts

on salaries can leave less capital for other important initiatives, like

experimentation or marketing, which can in turn make it harder for

startups to reach a growth phase.

So what should startups do? Does the beneﬁt of being close to talent

outweigh the ﬁnancial burden of attracting it away from big ﬁrms?

And what part do large ﬁrms play in this? In new research, we

analyzed more than 180 million job ads placed between 2010 and 2020,

including ads from more than 140,000 U.S. startups founded in that

decade. We found that local large ﬁrm hiring patterns have a signiﬁcant

impact on startups’ ability to grow. We examine our ﬁndings and oﬀer

recommendations for startups looking to navigate this complicated

landscape in order to take advantage of resource-rich locations without

being crowded out.

# When Competition Drives Up Salaries

Startups initially consist of a founder team and a set of early employees

that join through informal networks. But once a startup attempts to

grow larger, it enters formal labor markets, including by posting job

advertisements. In order to explore how large ﬁrm hiring aﬀects local

startups, we analyzed the online job ads of more than 140,000 U.S.

startups founded between 2010 and 2020, and compared them to the

more than 180 million ads posted in this timeframe.

We found that when large ﬁrms increase their hiring, startups in the

same location are forced to oﬀer up to 10% more for crucial roles, while

reducing their expected growth by 36%, compared to startups that did

not experience a corresponding increase in exposure to large ﬁrms. This

is true even when controlling for factors such as industry, economic

conditions (like recessions or booms), location, startup characteristics,

and education and experience requirements. We also found that this

“crowding out” eﬀect is particularly pronounced for critical positions

# like management, STEM, and sales.

# The Firms That Pose the Biggest Threats

Intuitively, large ﬁrms with very similar business models to startups

may appear to be the most dangerous, as they rely on the same

specialists and may be more attractive to talented local workers because

of larger salaries or beneﬁt oﬀerings. To investigate the impact of

similarity on startup growth, we used the business descriptions of large

ﬁrms and startups to create similarity scores — a high score meant that

a ﬁrm and startup had more similar businesses, and a low score meant

they were relatively dissimilar.

We found that the higher the similarity, the weaker the crowding eﬀects

for startups — though they were still present. When startups are similar

to surrounding large ﬁrms, their growth (in terms of the number of job

ads they posted relative to other startups) only diminished by 20%,

whereas dissimilar startups saw decreases by up to 60%. This seems to

suggest that similarity can oﬀset some of the negative growth impacts

that startups may experience when they have to oﬀer higher salaries.

This data thus provides evidence that large ﬁrms do not create “kill

zones” in the labor market for startups interested in pursuing similar

aims, even as they still seem to have a negative impact on a startups’

# success.

# How to Compete in Dense Markets

So how can startups incorporate these ﬁndings when making a location

decision? We oﬀer some suggestions.

Critically consider the talent your business will require.

For startups considering moves, it is important to incorporate the

presence of large ﬁrms — including those in other sectors – into a

landscape analysis. For startups considering pivots: When possible,

take advantage of complementarity to the incumbent’s technology. As

our studies found, ﬁrms who have very similar businesses may have a

smaller negative impact on a startup’s ability to scale.

For potential investors, the same applies in reverse. In an analysis of

prospective ventures, ﬁnanciers should try to understand the labor

requirements that scaling will bring, and consider how important

potential labor markets are to a company’s success.

When engaged in competition for talent, broaden your horizon.

Startups based in crowded regions still have several ways to avoid

head-to-head salary competition with incumbents. They can focus

on internal advancement opportunities, emphasizing the chances of

individuals to have impact and to develop a strong employer brand.

Internal development may be most important for the managerial,

STEM, and sales positions that are most aﬀected by crowding, so eﬀorts

should be targeted to those, and special economic incentives should be

deployed there.

Besides internal advancement, startups should explore alternative ways

of talent acquisition, particularly if the formal labor market is clogged,

personal networks are exhausted, and headhunters are too expensive.

Startups should remain nimble and play to their strengths in terms of

allowing remote work to shed the limitation to the local labor market.

These can be networks, internship and apprenticeship opportunities,

## university relationships, and remote workers, both near-shoring and

oﬀ-shoring. Additionally, startups should increase their openness to

## employees from non-traditional careers and backgrounds.

# Understand regional policymaking.

When choosing a location, startups should consider not only the

landscape of ﬁrms that are already present, but also the orientation

of local policymakers. Some regional policies are poised to provide a

## better balance between the presence of large ﬁrms and the needs of

the entrepreneurial community. For example, regional policymakers

frequently seek to attract large ﬁrms with tax and other incentives, and

we show that they face a tradeoﬀ in doing so. Large ﬁrms can increase

agglomeration economies in a region, but crowding might diminish

or even reverse these beneﬁts. Regions that recruit large ﬁrms with a

specialized focus and have policies that improve employee mobility,

## such as non-enforcement of employee non-compete agreements, might

diminish crowding and provide the most fertile environment for long-

run startup success.

# Possible Limitations

While our research provides evidence that local large ﬁrms can have a

stiﬂing impact on startups’ ability to grow, a limitation of this study

is that it is generally hard to study or pinpoint spillover impacts.

For example, we found that when ﬁrms and startups are similar, the

crowding out impact is smaller than when ﬁrms and startups are

dissimilar. We hypothesize that this is because these ﬁrms provide

## spillover beneﬁts in the form of idea generation (entrepreneurial

spawning and spinouts, for example), although we did not measure

# these eﬀects in our study.

Additionally, we measured startup growth by how many jobs they

were able to post compared with other startups at similar gestations,

but there are many other ways of measuring growth that we did not

examine in this study, for example, revenue. That said, our work

provides compelling evidence that large ﬁrms seem to aﬀect the growth

## of startups within the same commuting zones.

Startups looking to grow may very well ﬁnd the talent they need by

locating in talent-rich communities. Our research ﬁnds, however, that

there are signiﬁcant drawbacks to locating near large ﬁrms, as their

hiring patterns can have a stiﬂing impact on startups’ ability to scale.

When startups must compete for talent by paying higher salaries, it can

deplete limited ﬁnancial resources, making growth in other areas more diﬃcult. Incorporating our ﬁndings into any landscape analysis — and

seeking new avenues to ﬁnd employees — may help startups navigate

the talent wars to grow successfully.
