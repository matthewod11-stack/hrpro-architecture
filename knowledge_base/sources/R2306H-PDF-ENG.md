Many corporate CEOs are unhappy with the level of innovation they’re

getting for the billions they pour into R&D. One root cause of the

low return, a large body of research suggests, lies in the managerial

tendency to treat novel ideas as aberrations to be resisted. At each

## stage of the innovation process—from inception to integration to

implementation—executives will either water down “deviant” ideas to

make them ﬁt within existing businesses or crush them altogether.

However, we believe that executives and innovators can combat this

problem if they carefully harness their networks. This is something we

saw in empirical studies on organizational networks we did with Paola

## Criscuolo of Imperial College London, David Krackhardt of Carnegie

## Mellon University, Ammon Salter of the University of Warwick, and

Marco Tortoriello of Bocconi University. Altogether the studies—two of

which were funded by the European Research Council—involved nearly

1,000 R&D executives and innovators. Through them we identiﬁed

## three particularly eﬀective practices: ﬁnding and mobilizing catalysts

in external networks who help launch ideas, engaging with internal

sparring partners to turn those ideas into viable business propositions,

and selectively sequencing the introduction of ideas within your social

circles in the company to stress-test them and gradually gain buy-in.

## While there’s nothing inherently magical about these activities, in our

work with executives and companies we’ve observed that few leaders

fully appreciate or habitually do them. But all leaders can master

the three networking practices once they understand their underlying

# principles.

# Find and Mobilize Innovation Catalysts

The ﬁrst problem with novel ideas is, quite simply, that business

leaders don’t come across them that often. The siloed nature of

organizations means that for many managers, a big chunk of day-to-

day interactions are with the same people in the same context. And

## though C-suite executives at large, diversiﬁed companies will naturally

## mix with managers from around the organization—not to mention with

## numerous formal and informal advisers outside it—many of them still

gravitate toward like-minded people with similar experiences, expertise,

# and backgrounds.

## HBR / Magazine Article / Harness Your Network to Unlock Innovation

Our research shows that leaders at genuinely innovative companies

consciously avoid that trap by deliberately seeking and spending time

with people we call innovation catalysts: individuals who have a knack

for cultivating networks that combine a sense of community and a

diversity of perspectives. Because these people have access to wide-

ranging knowledge that is acutely relevant, they’re able to inspire new

ideas and enhance their development. What sets catalysts apart is that

they are unusually generous with their time, exceptionally skilled at

staying connected to people from many spheres, and always on the hunt

# for out-of-the-ordinary ideas.

One business leader who can attest to the value of innovation catalysts

is Jaideep (not his real name), the head of digital transformation at a large health care trust in the UK. For many years its aﬃliated hospitals

had been coping with increasingly longer patient waiting lists and

overcrowded emergency departments. A solution to the waiting lists in

radiology came from an innovation catalyst named Hannah in a group

of Jaideep’s friends from medical school, who for the past 15 years had

held weekend outings twice annually.

Warming up over a cup of tea after a mountain hike, Jaideep and

Hannah got to talking about the waiting lists. Hannah, who’d been

using artiﬁcial intelligence in her work developing new brain cancer

therapies for a major pharmaceutical ﬁrm, suggested AI as an avenue for

Jaideep to explore. She connected him with people in her network who

had pioneered AI in other health care settings, putting him on a path

that would eventually result in the UK’s ﬁrst cloud-based AI radiology

device. Now deployed nationwide, it’s able to read and interpret results

far more quickly than human radiologists, resulting in faster treatment

times and shorter waiting lists.

The strong bonds among members of the alumni group—who had built

## deep trust over many years of friendship—made it easier for Jaideep

to share his challenges and for Hannah to commit time and energy

to think about them. Equally important as the social bonds were the

divergent career paths of the group’s members, which spanned an

## extraordinarily varied range of medical experiences and expertise. But

even among this well-connected bunch, Hannah stood out for her

diverse array of contacts. She loved the exchange of ideas, often going to

conferences well outside her own domain and making friends in many

# diﬀerent communities.

Catalysts are unusually generous with their time, exceptionally skilled at staying connected to people from many spheres, and always on the hunt for ideas.

Conversations with catalysts are best held away from a larger group—

at a quiet lunch outside a conference venue or perhaps over a shared

drink on a park bench. Informality and privacy make it easier to bounce around ideas that might seem offbeat. It’s also important that both

parties get something out of the exchange. Jaideep can’t just harvest

Hannah’s ideas—he has to reciprocate by sharing ideas himself that she

could pass on to some other connections of hers in a diﬀerent line of

work. Being part of a close-knit network involves give-and-take, which

fosters trust as members build reputations for being helpful to others.

Such reputations, in turn, enable people to get more assistance down

# the road.

Where can leaders ﬁnd innovation catalysts? Peer groups, such as

alumni networks, are good places to start, as Jaideep discovered. In

addition to providing a shared bond, they often include people with

# many kinds of professional experiences.

Forums that bring together people who play similar roles in diﬀerent

types of organizations are another good source. For example,

## technology leaders from some of the largest U.S. science-based

corporations regularly get together in what are commonly known as

industry peer networks. In these groups members share knowledge

about common issues such as emerging technology trends and the

implications for technology strategy. During one of the peer network

gatherings we attended, we saw members engaging in an intense

debate about the conference theme—the merits of open innovation—

and realized that the changes implemented in one ﬁrm could help

catalyze changes in others. For example, the ﬁrm had redesigned its

intellectual property function so that it no longer solely prioritized the

protection of IP rights but also enabled safe collaboration, a model the

other ﬁrms could follow.

However, not everyone in such peer groups will be a catalyst. Leaders

will have to invest time in getting to know members to ﬁnd someone

who checks all three boxes—generosity; deep, diverse ties; and a passion

Innovation catalysts are adept at understanding the problems faced by

others. They can draw a line from the challenge a leader confronts to

the answer, and they can help the leader brainstorm an idea safely

before exploring it further. Not only do their many connections allow

catalysts to tap into a wide range of solutions, but their participation in

in-depth exchanges in community-like settings helps them understand

how those solutions may be applied to novel problems. Because their

ideas tend to be more viable than those from more-isolated individuals,

catalysts help leaders avoid becoming overloaded by a deluge of

suggestions that are unlikely to be workable.

# Engage with Sparring Partners

Integrating a novel idea into a corporation’s existing production and

marketing operations and getting it through legal and ﬁnancial reviews

almost always leads to conﬂicts. What makes an idea unique may also

make it disrupt the smooth operation of the mainstream business. It

may be a new technology play that doesn’t ﬁt with the current model.

Perhaps it’s a service when the company sells only products. Or it might

make a technological platform the company is invested in obsolete.

Leaders who engage with internal sparring partners about a new

idea will boost the chances that it will eventually fuse—rather than

clash—with the company’s core mission. The concerns and questions

such people raise can actually help turn the seed of an idea into a

compelling and compatible business proposition. The best partners

have the credentials and conﬁdence to defend their expertise—but also

curiosity about how another area of expertise might be relevant to their

# own work.

After identifying a sparring partner, a leader should reach out to others

who are knowledgeable about the partner’s domain but aren’t in the

partner’s network. The leader should also encourage the partner to

likewise look for advisers in the leader’s domain who aren’t close to

the leader. That will set the two colleagues up to do what we call dual

networking and gather a fusion of perspectives that will enhance a new

# idea.

Consider the relationship between Xiu and Malika. (As with Jaideep and

Hannah, these names are pseudonyms.) Xiu was an R&D director in a

large pharmaceutical ﬁrm leading a team of scientists who conducted

clinical research on menopausal symptom relief. It’s well-known that

many women don’t consult their doctors about these symptoms because

they believe that they’re an unavoidable part of aging or they have

concerns about the safety of treatments. Xiu was determined to give

women easier access to menopause medication through an over-the-

# counter product.

The concerns and questions that internal sparring partners raise can help turn the seed of an idea into a compelling and compatible business proposition.

Xiu found a sparring partner in Malika, one of the ﬁrm’s regulatory

experts who had in-depth knowledge of clinical trials and FDA approval

procedures. Rather than leaving regulatory issues until the clinical

research phase was completed, Xiu and Malika worked closely together

from the outset in the race to oﬀer the ﬁrst over-the-counter menopause

# medication.

To be able to challenge Malika’s input on regulatory aﬀairs, Xiu

would regularly consult some of her former colleagues who worked on

regulatory issues at other organizations. That helped her have deeper

## discussions with Malika in their biweekly meetings. Likewise, Malika

would spend time ahead of those meetings discussing progress on the

clinical side with advisers in her own network. By independently getting

advice on each other’s domains of expertise, they could spar back and

forth to co-create an imaginative resolution rather than arrive at a

compromise that favored innovation over regulatory alignment or vice

versa. One solution Malika and Xiu came up with, for instance, was a

proposal that regulators interpret compliance requirements in a way

that allowed greater exploration of new technological avenues while

still ensuring that essential safety standards were met. Their years of

hard work paid oﬀ when their company released one of the world’s ﬁrst

# over-the-counter menopause drugs.

By embracing the principle of dual

networking with sparring partners, leaders

## sidestep two common pitfalls. First, they

# avoid “divide-and-conquer” networking:

when two parties each have separate

# conversations with others in their own

domains. Those discussions may help

resolve issues requiring specialized

expertise but are unlikely to be eﬀective

are called for. A CEO that talks exclusively

fail to convince the chief technology oﬃcer that a new idea is

technically feasible. Alternatively, a CTO who draws advice from only

technical advisers may fail to meaningfully contribute to a conversation

with the CEO about why an idea would or wouldn’t make sense from a

# market perspective.

Second, if leaders and their partners rely on the same sets of strategic

and technical advisers, they may both get feedback that an original idea

is too dangerous to be considered. If that happens, they’re likely to make

the idea less disruptive to the status quo. In essence, the novelty will be

squeezed out of it until it’s no longer so threatening to the mainstream.

A telltale sign that this is happening in a company is when innovations

deliver smaller and smaller payoﬀs. In some cases the failures may well

be caused by ﬂaws in the basic concept, but in our experience, more

often than not disappointing innovations start out as ideas with great

promise but get watered down after receiving negative feedback.

## Selectively Sequence Your Idea’s Introduction

Even leaders who eﬀectively mobilize innovation catalysts to cultivate

out-of-the-ordinary ideas and who leverage sparring partners to

transform them into compelling business propositions may still fall

short. Unless you can get buy-in to the value-creating potential of novel

ideas across the organization, the risk of their derailment looms large.

Smart leaders meet this challenge by “sequencing their circles.” This

means stress-testing the idea initially with an inner circle of conﬁdants

who provide candid but constructive feedback on it and then vetting

it with larger circles of pragmatic skeptics whose blessing can give it

# greater legitimacy.

## polyethylene terephthalate (PET) bottle, Ben, the director of research

and development who led them, knew that the idea wouldn’t gain

acceptance easily. PET takes 450 years to decompose, and the

plant-based alternative would be biodegradable—a real advantage for

sustainability. However, the company’s revenue from PET products was

large and growing, and colleagues undoubtedly would raise concerns—

about manufacturing complexities, the challenges of sourcing ethical,

## plant-based materials for plastic production, and other issues—that

could kill the initiative before it ever had the chance for serious

# consideration.

When the team was ﬁrst working on sugar-cane-based polymers—

a project shrouded in secrecy—Ben sounded out his ideas with a

select number of trusted conﬁdants while making every eﬀort to keep

shielding the project from the outright skeptics he knew would discard

the innovation as just plain foolish. The conﬁdants were colleagues

Ben had known for a long time and could count on to be critical

but constructive and to patiently listen to unusual ideas that weren’t

completely baked yet. Conﬁdants play a crucial role by predicting the

“killer questions” that will put an innovation in jeopardy. Through

conversations with his conﬁdants, Ben realized that he had to put more

thought into how plant-based bottles could be integrated into existing

recycling infrastructure. He also needed to ﬁgure out how the new

bottles would withstand the high-humidity climates in many important

markets. Had he rolled out the idea too early, he would not have been

prepared to address those concerns, and it might have withered on the

# vine.

Only once he was conﬁdent that his idea could withstand outsider

criticism did Ben gradually lower his guard. After he had convinced

himself and his conﬁdants that he could clear any potential hurdles, he

sought exposure to a wider internal circle. Speciﬁcally, he reached out

to high-status, well-respected experts, whom we refer to as “pragmatic

skeptics.” Although they’re not easily persuaded, once pragmatic

skeptics are on board, their endorsements produce a ripple eﬀect and

generate broader buy-in that the novel path is a promising way forward.

By sequencing their circles, leaders can eﬀectively calibrate the timing

of input from critics, use it to strengthen their innovations, and

overcome the unavoidable resistance that truly original ideas are bound

to meet. By calling on the right people at the right time, leaders can

reﬁne their innovations and validate them in the eyes of stakeholders

# near and far.

This approach will help leaders avoid pushing through innovations that

have not been fully vetted and could have serious ﬂaws—a common

mistake we’ve seen the entrepreneurs and executives we teach succumb

to. For instance, we’ve seen ﬁntech entrepreneurs launch mobile

applications that are genuinely transformative but come up short on

ease of use and technical stability. Such weaknesses are the very kinds

of issues that constructive conﬁdants are adept at surfacing while the

cost of modifying designs is still relatively low.

Introducing an idea to sequential circles of selected critics also

company learned the hard way. In their quest to develop a laundry

detergent that was more sustainable, they had fundamentally rethought

the underlying chemistry to allow clothing to be washed at lower

temperatures. Because the new product was highly eﬀective, the

manager leading the project didn’t think it was problematic that the

chemistry worked only in a powder-based detergent. But despite the

brilliance of the idea, the project was deemed too deviant and was

rejected, at least initially. Not only was it considered to be out of line

with the recent market shift from products that were powder-based

to those that were liquid-based, but the company’s decision makers

believed that consumers weren’t ready to switch to low-temperature

washing. As we listened to this manager recount her experience, we

noted a marked lack of attention to the need to carefully and gradually

build momentum for the innovation in her network before putting the

From a leader’s perspective, successfully launching innovations is less

about creativity than it is about harnessing networks. Leaders who ﬁnd

and mobilize innovation catalysts by embedding themselves in close-

## knit yet diverse communities outside their own organization stand

a better chance of discovering novel ideas that are feasible. Leaders

who engage internal collaborators as sparring partners—ensuring

that they each gather independent advice in one another’s areas of

expertise—will be more successful at turning the ideas into winning

business propositions. Finally, leaders who skillfully sequence feedback

from critics in their networks from the inside out will achieve what

often seems impossible: getting valuable input while avoiding early

dismissive reactions. If executives follow these three practices, they will

ﬁnd that innovating in large, mature organizations is not only viable but

# highly promising.
