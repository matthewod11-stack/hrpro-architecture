Organizational justice, conflict management and employee relations The mediating role of climate of trust Rojalin Sahoo and Chandan Kumar Sahoo School of Management, National Institute of Technology, Rourkela, India

Abstract Purpose – The purpose of this paper is to examine the impact of organizational justice and conflict management on employee relations (ER) through the mediating role of climate of trust. Design/methodology/approach – This study was conducted with a sample of 331 employees working in a power transmission unit of Odisha. Data were collected by administering a structured questionnaire and analyzed using structural equation modeling (AMOS 20). Findings – The results reveal that climate of trust plays the role of a partial mediator between organizational justice and ER and conflict management and ER. Also, it was found that organizational justice, conflict management and climate of trust are the positive and significant predictors of ER. Research limitations/implications – The study was confined to a single state-owned power transmission unit of an Indian state, which restricts its generalizability. The research would benefit from exploration in alternative units. Practical implications – This scholarly work may encourage managers and decision makers to develop trust building climate by focusing on organizational justice and conflict management to flourish an environment of harmonious ER, furthermore to formulate effective strategies for cultivating facilitative work environment to enhance positive attitude among the employees to challenge future goals. Originality/value – The research is exclusive in determining the influence of organizational justice and conflict management on ER through the mediator of climate of trust in the new perspective of the power sector that provides empirical evidence to the extant literature.

- 1. Introduction The domination of heightened competition has enforced the power sector undertakings to drive the human resource to confront the dynamic and challenging world. In order to survive and thrive, the organization needs to develop strategies to make the employees feel happy and satisfied, as they are the most critical stakeholders and business partners (Kim and Rhee, 2011). Employees share the workspace with their teammates, supervisors and managers under a common ceiling by enduring the channel of communication based on which a relationship is initiated. The exchange of obligations and rights between employees and employers is the prime promoter of employee relations (ER). It is the building block of an organization that directly affects the attitudes and behaviors of the employees (Masterson et al., 2000). An effective ER is, hence, indispensable to the success of both the individuals and the organization as a whole (Gennard, 2002; Madlock and Booth-Butterfield, 2012). Employees, the most vital assets with their attitudes, behaviors and performance, have enormous contribution toward the organizational success (Men, 2012). Researchers and scholars accentuate organizational justice as elementary in understanding the attitude and behaviorof theindividuals(Cropanzanoetal., 2001). Theimportanceof justiceisthusobligatory

to strengthening the quality of relationship between employees and organization (Swalhi et al., 2017). In the work setting, the social entities often experience incompatibility that creates conflict and obstructs the organizational life and productivity. Conflicts should not be avoided, rather be managed constructively to promote healthy workplace relations. These interpretations rejuvenate the notion of trust for promoting cordial organization–employee relations (Zapata et al., 2013). Consequently, climate of trust is introduced as a mediator in the relationship between organizational justice and ER, and between conflict management and ER. ER is an important aspect of every business enterprise, which still remains unexplored in the field of the power sector. Thus, in this framework, a comprehensive model of ER is initiated. ER can be defined as the relationship between employers and employees characterized by fair and equitable treatment, effective management of workplace conflicts, and mutual trust resulting in employee satisfaction, commitment, and job performance.

justice (Cropanzano et al., 2007; Kim et al., 2017), conflict management (Posthuma, 2011; Tjosvold et al., 2014), trust (Jiang et al., 2015; Gaudencio et al., 2017) and ER (Jiang, 2012; Waters et al., 2013; Gill and Meyer, 2013), while limited studies have examined these four factors simultaneously. The present work aims to explore the impact of organizational justice and conflict management on ER through the mediating effect of climate of trust, which is a unique approach of investigation in the field of ER. Furthermore, limited studies have emphasized on interrogating the employer–employee relations established in power sector specific to the Indian context. In order to bridge the gaps, an integrated model is proposed that will supplement to building up atheoreticalaswellasan empiricalbaseinthescopeof ER.Thisscholarlyendeavor is introduced with the theoretical framework and hypotheses development. Next, the methods that outline the sample and the measures with their reliability are explained. The result section cites the outcomes of hypothesis testing.

- 2. Theoretical framework and hypotheses development In this research, the social exchange theory (SET) is adapted to establish a conceptual framework by illustrating the influence of organizational justice, conflict management and climate of trust on ER. The idea of social exchange was advocated by Blau (1964), which is considered prevalent to describe organization–employee relations (Cropanzano et al., 2003). In ER, social exchange is cultivated on the organization’s fair and equal treatment provided to the employees (Aryee et al., 2002). In social exchange, trust is defined as the central feature, and mutual obligation flourishes as the social entities start exchanging the concrete outcomes and the socio-emotional benefits (Blau, 1964). The conceptual

the study is displayed in the form of a hypothesized research model (Figure 1) that is developed on the basis of the SET and will be validated through empirical analysis. The extant literature provides a conceptual background based on which the study hypotheses were formulated.

2.1 Employee relations Tsui and Wang (2002, p. 78) defined ER as “the formal and informal, the economic, social, and psychological connection between an employee and his or her employer.” In the current scenario, promoting a cooperative and supportive work environment and conducive ER is in the paramount interest of both the organization and employees (Hopkins and Yonker, 2015). Organizations’ priority toward enhancing the well-being of employees has been considered relevant for the healthy employer–employee relations (Holtzhausen and Fourie, 2009). Thus, the inclination to build harmonious ER is crucial for employee engagement and organizational performance (Tansel and Gazioglu, 2014). It also stimulates employee motivation, loyalty and performance for achieving the best results for their organization.

2.2 Organizational justice It refers to the perceived fairness of organizational outcomes, procedures and interactions that bind all individuals to work collaboratively for developing a mutually beneficial relationship. Nadiri and Tanova (2010, p. 34) defined organizational justice as “individuals’ perception of fairness of treatment received from an organization and their behavioral reaction to such perceptions.” It is a tri-dimensional concept including distributive justice: the fair allocation of resources and rewards based on the efforts made, procedural justice: the fair process and procedures followed to make allocation decisions, and interactional justice that comprises of interpersonal justice denoting the interpersonal treatment individuals received by following fair procedures (Colquitt et al., 2001). Blader and Tyler (2003) suggested that when individuals are fairly evaluated it It also improves provides a cue about organizational commitment, job performance (Cropanzano et al., 2007; Colquitt et al., 2012; Ohana, 2014; Aryee et al., 2015) and mutual benefits (Loi et al., 2006).

2.3 Conflict management Human beings interact with the organization, difference of opinions, values, goals and situations creating tension and turning into conflict. It is an inevitable phenomenon of human relations and, thus, considered vital to managing it effectively within the workplace. According to Rahim et al. (2000, p. 5), conflict management is defined as “designing effective strategies to minimize the dysfunctions of conflict and maximize the constructive functions of conflict in order to enhance learning and effectiveness in an organization.” Albeit, conflicts have traditionally been treated as disrupting, and well-managed conflict can act as a constructive force by contributing various facilities specifically employee job satisfaction (Posthuma, 2011), supervisor–subordinate relationship, cooperation and involvement (De Dreu and Gelfand, 2008; Deutsch et al., 2014; Tjosvold et al., 2014), individual and organizational benefits (Jones et al., 2000).

2.4 Climate of trust Trust is the central prospect of an enterprise that enhances all relationships. An environment having open communication, mutual respect and honesty among the social actors that fosters interpersonal and intra-organizational relationship delineates the very It can be denoted as the individuals’ perception of essence of climate of trustworthiness where they expect support from other members who are reliable and discuss issues with them (Ferrin et al., 2006). A series of everyday interaction generates reliability, obligations and liberties between the workplace members by creating a climate of trust (Xerri, 2012). Trust is encouraged by concerning the needs, preferences, feelings and viewpoints of the stakeholders (Holtzhausen and Fourie, 2009). In this regard, climate of trust plays the major role for constructing positive human relations as well as the effective

functioning of organizations (Moye and Henkin, 2006). A trusting climate also reinforces cooperation (Wong et al., 2000; Jiang et al., 2015), motivation (Audenaert et al., 2016), job satisfaction, well-being of employees (Gill, 2008; Leat and El-Kot, 2009), commitment and organizational effectiveness (Farndale et al., 2011).

2.5 Organizational justice and ER Justice is a vital component of the organization that sparks employees’ identity and emotional attachment to the employer (Poon, 2012). It encourages the evolution of social exchange relationships that in turn spur employees to develop better organizational behavior. Scholars have stated that organizational justice is beneficial as well as fundamental to both employers and employees (Cropanzano et al., 2002; Swalhi et al., 2017). It was empirically evidenced that organizational justice significantly affects the relationship between organization and employees (Kim et al., 2017). This study was conducted in the South Korean organizations by addressing only two dimensions such as trust and satisfaction. Although this relationship was empirically evidenced, its implication in the scope of power sector was lacking. Thus, the present study attempted to extend the previous one by incorporating the multiple dimensions of fairness in reward system, organizational practices, respectful treatment, work schedule and promotion to investigate the association between organizational justice and ER in the context of the power sector. Researchers have stated that organizational justice binds people together to perform effectively and develops the relationships among the co-workers, employers and employees (Cropanzano et al., 2002; Forret and Sue Love, 2008; Fein et al., 2013). Thus, based on the above discussions, it can be hypothesized that:

H1. Organizational justice will have a significant impact on ER.

2.6 Conflict management and ER The sustenance of organizational efficiency and effectiveness can be accomplished when the workplace conflicts are to be managed constructively (Hempel et al., 2009; Leung, 2008). Basically, individuals experience interpersonal conflicts within the organization. Today, it is a challenging task for the managers to manage the conflicts amicably, rather than avoiding them. Effective management of conflicts will encourage cooperation and mutual trust among the organizational members and also promote their relationship (Chen et al., 2005; Posthuma, 2011). Conflict is a constructive force, as it provides the opportunity to share ideas and valuable suggestions; thus, the channel of communication between employer and employees is enhanced. This will create a conducive environment for the individuals to get to know each other better and improve their relationships quality (Tjosvold et al., 2004; Chen et al., 2005). Although the existing literature offers sufficient theoretical explanation about the relationship between conflict management and ER, it lacks empirical validation. This gap instigates the authors to make a novel attempt by addressing multiple dimensions of conflict management to flourish a healthy ER in the power sector. Hence, the following hypothesis can be proposed as:

H2. Conflict management will have a significant impact on ER.

2.7 Organizational justice and climate of trust Trust is extensively considered as an important phenomenon in the organizational work setting that facilitates supportive and cooperative behavior and mutual understanding among the employees (Cropanzano et al., 2007). When employees received just and fair treatment by the organization, they demonstrate a high level of trust (Zhang and Agarwal, 2009; Vanhala and Ahteela, 2011; Gaudencio et al., 2017). Researchers and scholars have

explored that organizational justice impacts on trust (Cohen-Charash and Spector, 2001; Aryee et al., 2002; Stinglhamber et al., 2006). Later on, Katou (2013) administered a similar study in the private and public sectors of Greece. The literature provides an insufficient justice and climate of trust explanation that the association between organizational in the domain of power sector was not yet examined. Thus, it is an initial step to analyze this relationship from an Indian perspective. Based on the above evidence, it can be formulated that:

H3. Organizational justice will have a significant relationship with climate of trust.

2.8 Conflict management and climate of trust The effective management of conflicts arriving at agreed upon solutions encompasses trust building between the parties involved (Lewicki et al., 2006). If the conflicts are not managed low organizational appropriately, commitment and high turnover rates (Yuan, 2010). In conflict situations, when the employees are being cared and valued by their supervisors and managers, a climate of trusting relationship is developed (Lewicki and Wiethoff, 2000; Chan et al., 2008). Masood and Javed (2016) reported that cooperative management of conflicts increases the level of trust among individuals. These statements are only theoretically interpreted by the eminent researchers. The significance of conflict management in generating a climate of trust is not empirically evidenced earlier. Therefore, in this research analysis, the authors have advocated a new line of investigation by exploring the relationship between conflict management and climate of trust in power sector organizations. The study, therefore, proposed a hypothesis that:

it may result into a lack of trust and cooperation,

H4. Conflict management will have a significant relationship with climate of trust.

2.9 Climate of trust and ER The strength of relationship is encouraged by the trust among the individuals working in an enterprise. In order to build trust, it is vital to creating a positive work environment characterized by honest and supportive relationships. Thus, flourishing a climate of trust is essential in a reciprocal relationship between employers and employees (Marlow and Patton, 2002). Empirical research viewed that trust has appeared as a critical element in maintaining the long-term relationship between organization and employees by acting as social glue (Lau and Rowlinson, 2010). This finding does not suffice the prerequisite of the current study as it was undertaken in a construction industry. By fulfilling the gap identified from the literature in the field of the power sector, we have extended the prior one and proposed a distinct model to empirically validate the relationship between climate of trust and ER. Trust creates obligations and is confined to the relationship between the trustor and the trustee (Redman et al., 2011). Hence, a hypothesis can be formulated as follows:

H5. Climate of trust will have a significant relationship with ER.

2.10 Mediating role of climate of trust In the previous sections, is an important outcome of organizational justice and conflict management as well as an antecedent to ER. Thus, theoretically, these findings suggest that trust functions as a mediator in the relationship between organizational justice and ER, and between conflict management and ER. The previous literature viewed that there are numerous studies on exploring the mediating effects of trust (Aryee et al., 2002; Chan et al., 2008; More and Tzafrir, 2009; Katou, 2013; Gaudencio et al., 2017). However, no studies have examined the role of climate of trust as a

mediator in between the association of organizational justice and ER, and conflict management and ER. This study asserts that even if an employee perceives fair treatment and satisfaction with the management of conflicts, it would not directly transform into ER unless such feeling of being treated fairly and managing conflicts amicably leads to trust. This research tries to bridge the gap by testing the underlying action mechanism between the relationships. Therefore, the following hypotheses are proposed:

H6. Climate of trust will mediate the relationship between organizational justice and ER.

H7. Climate of trust will mediate the relationship between conflict management and ER.

- 3. Methods 3.1 Sample A descriptive research design was used to identify the specific variables that may describe the existing ER scenario. Primary data for this study were collected from Odisha Power Transmission Corporation Ltd (OPTCL), located in Bhubaneswar, the capital of Odisha. This state-owned public sector utility was previously named as Orissa State Electricity Board (OSEB). A large number of employees from OSEB were migrated to other public and private sector, as the ER scenario was highly detrimental. Individuals were bereaved of the facilities they required to maintain a healthy organizational life. Based on these hindrances, OPTCL was incorporated in the year 2004 under the Companies Act, 1956 and indoctrinated to harmonize the relationship between employers and employees by prioritizing the needs of the social entities. Thus, the study is intended to pursue an investigation in this sector to grab an insight into ER. A structured questionnaire was administered among the respondents to accumulate desired information. Out of 445 questionnaires administered, 331 valid responses were received with the response rate of 74.38 percent. Table I describes the demographic profiles of the respondents. The respondents included 231 (69.8 percent) males and 100 (30.2 percent) females. Most of the respondents were aged between 46 and 55 years (37.2 percent) followed by 56–60 years (25.4 percent), 36–45 years

(19.6 percent), 26–35 years (15.4 percent) and 18–25 (2.4 percent). In total, 92.7 percent of the respondents were married and 7.3 percent of the respondents were single. In terms of education, it was categorized as 10th, ITI/+2/Diploma, Graduation and Post-Graduation. it was found that most of the respondents were graduates (50.2 percent) and But, (49.8 percent) were postgraduates. The majority of the respondents had work experience of 21–30 years (29.6 percent), followed by 31 years and above (28.1 percent), 11–20 years (22.1 percent) and 0–10 years (20.2 percent).

3.2 Measures The questionnaire developed was comprised of 18 items and administered among the employees of OPTCL. The items used in this study were adapted from the extant literature and reworded to make it more perceptible for the respondents. Furthermore, some of the items were added based on author’s first-hand experience and the gaps found in the existing literature. The enlisted items are provided in Table AI. All the items used in this study were measured on a seven-point Likert scale (1¼strongly disagree to 7¼strongly agree). The measures used in this research are stated as follows:

(cid:129) OJ: the construct of organizational justice was measured using a five-item scale, out of which two items were adapted from Colquitt et al. (2002), one item from Rupp and Cropanzano (2002), and two items (“fair work schedule” and “fairness in promotion”) were added by the author. Cronbach’s α of all the items is 0.94.

(cid:129) CM:

the conflict management variable was measured on a four-item scale, out of which one item was adapted from De Dreu et al. (2001), two items from the scale of Rahim Organizational Conflict Inventory-II Rahim (1983) and one item (“appreciation for valuable suggestions”) was added by the author. Cronbach’s α value of CM is 0.86.

(cid:129) CT: to measure the dimension climate of trust, a four-item scale was employed, out of which two items were adapted from Robinson and Rousseau (1994), one item from Paine (2003) and one item (“employer’s openness and reliability”) was included by the researcher. This scale has Cronbach’s α value of 0.94.

(cid:129) ER: a five-item scale was used in order to measure employer–employee relations, out of which two items were adapted from Hon and Grunig (1999), two items from Grunig and Huang’s (2000) and one item (“socio-economic and psychological development”) was explored and added by the author. Cronbach’s α score of ER is 0.93.

## Table III. Model fit indices of the measurement model

confirmed that the model could be tested for mediation as the variables: organizational justice, conflict management, climate of trust and ER are positively and significantly correlated with each other.

4.2 Common method variance The study employed the most frequently used Harman single-factor test to solve the problem of common method variance, developed by Podsakoff et al. (2003). Exploratory factor analysis was used in this technique, where all the items were loaded onto a single factor by explaining only 47.53 percent variance and reduced the common method bias. Thus, the outcomes of this procedure enhanced the confidence in deducing the results of the study.

4.3 Measurement model The statistical package AMOS (version 20) was used to perform a confirmatory factor analysis with the four latent constructs (OJ, CM, CT and ER) to determine the fitness of the model. The literature highlights that the maximum likelihood assessment was used to assess the fit indices as outlined in Table III. It was recommended that the values of the indices (χ2/df o 3, GFI and CFI W 0.90 and RMSEA o 0.08) are within the threshold (Hair et al., 2010) and established a satisfactory fit between the hypothetical model and sample data.

4.4 Construct validity The validity of the constructs was tested using convergent and discriminant validity and the values are depicted in Table IV. The convergent validity includes the factor loadings, average variance extracted (AVE) and composite reliability (CR) values for all latent constructs that were in an acceptable region (AVEW0.50; CRW0.70), providing confirmation of convergent validity. The discriminant validity defines the degree of difference between a specific construct with other constructs. The square root of AVE of the constructs is greater than the shared variance between the constructs (Gefen and Straub, 2005), thus indicating each construct is distinct from others and confirming the discriminant validity.

- 5. Hypotheses testing 5.1 Mediation Mediation analysis was executed to find out the mediating effect of climate of trust in establishing the association between organizational justice and ER, and conflict management and ER. The SEM procedure for testing mediation is similar to Baron and Kenny’s (1986) four-step mediation analysis. The mediation effect was tested using the approaches of Baron and Kenny (1986) and Preacher and Hayes (2004). The study adopted the Sobel test to estimate the significance of mediation effects among variables and to create the most reliable results as illustrated in Table V. The mediation effect of climate of trust is depicted in Figure 2 in two distinct models. These two models clearly demonstrate the individual mediating effect of climate of trust in

between the relations of organizational justice and ER, and the association of conflict management and ER. Thus, for the ease of understanding and to provide sufficient explanations about the mediating role of the variable climate of trust, two models are displayed, which can also be presented in one single model. In the mediation analysis, the first step revealed that organizational justice positively and significantly predicted

ER (β ¼ 0.164, p o 0.001). In the second step, organizational justice and climate of trust explained a positive and significant relationship (β ¼ 0.623, p o 0.001). The third step described that climate of trust and ER were positively and significantly related (β ¼ 0.604, p o 0.001). Finally, the results of the fourth step confirmed that climate of trust partially mediated the relationship between organizational justice and ER (β ¼ 0.540, p o 0.001). Hence, H1, H3, H5, and H6 were accepted.

Similarly, another mediation analysis was conducted for conflict management, which showed that conflict management was a positive and significant predictor of ER (β ¼ 0.162, p o 0.001). Furthermore, conflict management and climate of trust had a positive and significant relationship (β ¼ 0.436, p o 0.001). Finally, the results of the last step confirmed that climate of trust partially mediated the relationship between conflict management and ER (β ¼ 0.439, p o 0.670). Therefore, H2, H4 and H7 are accepted.

- 6. Discussion Thestudy aimed to analyze theeffect of organizational justice and conflict management on ER through the mediating role of climate of trust. Based on the study results, seven key findings have been identified and illustrated according to the hypotheses. First, it was confirmed that organizational justice revealed positive and significant relations with ER. This hypothesized link corresponds with the literature that supports finding exhibiting organizational justice predicts ER (Rupp and Cropanzano, 2002; Fein et al., 2013; Kim et al., 2017). Second, conflict management was found as a positive and significant predictor of ER. This finding is in line with the prior studies and stated that manager–employee relations are the consequences of appropriate conflict management strategy (Chen et al., 2005; Posthuma, 2011). Third, the relationship between organizational justice and climate of trust was found to be positive and significant. These findingscorroborate with priorstudies that stated that organizational justice is a significant predictor of climate of trust (Aryee et al., 2002; Katou, 2013).

Fourth, the dimension of conflict management presents a positive and significant relationship with climate of trust. Previously, it was researched that when an organization develops strategies for cooperative management of conflicts it enhances the level of trust between management and employees (Chan et al., 2008; Hempel et al., 2009; Masood and Javed, 2016). Fifth, the results revealed that climate of trust positively and significantly impacted ER. Trust is the most critical constituent for building an effective organization–employee relationship. This finding substantiates with the studies conducted earlier (Gill, 2008; Krot and Lewicka, 2012).

Sixth, the study outcomes showcase that climate of trust partially mediated the relationship between organizational justice and ER. Finally, it was found that the mediation effect of climate of trust was partial toward the relationship between conflict management and ER. Previously, researchers have analyzed the mediating role of trust with other constructs (Chan et al., 2008; Gaudencio et al., 2017; Katou, 2013; Jiang et al., 2015). In this study, climate of trust was initiated to perform the role of a mediator between organizational these findings offer an extensive and unique contribution to the existing literature that lacks empirical investigation.

justice and ER, and conflict management and ER. Therefore,

it was confirmed that the hypothesized relationships (H1, H2, H3, H4 and H5) proposed in this study are found to be positive and significant by revealing consistency with the extant literature. Although previous studies provide empirical evidence and support the findings of the current study, the authors have made a very unique attempt by introducing the items (provided in Table AI): “fair work schedule” and “fairness in promotion” (OJ), “appreciation for valuable suggestions” (CM) and “employer’s openness and reliability” (CT) as the potential dimensions for stimulating healthy ER in power sector utilities.

After a detailed discussion of the research findings,

The results obtained in this exploration recommended that the proposed hypotheses are validated and accepted based on the research objectives and provide theoretical as well as empirical support to the existing body of literature. The business entities must focus on organizational justice, conflict management and building of trust among the individuals for the enhancement of a congenial ER climate. Moreover, the above discussion substantiates the relevance of ER and provides fresh insights for academicians and practitioners.

- 7. Implications The comprehensive results of this research are convincing and contribute for a better grasp over ER. These findings are of great importance to both scholars and practitioners.

7.1 Theoretical implications This scholarly work furnishes a comprehensive model by affirming the importance of the concepts of organizational justice and conflict management and their influence on ER by the mediator of climate of trust. This study is new by initiating climate of trust as the mediating mechanism that can provide intuition for establishing healthy organization–employee relations. The promotion of organizational fairness and adequate management of conflicts enhance mutual trust between employers and employees. Finally, this investigation is administered in a power sector where a very limited study has been conducted by adopting the concept of ER. Therefore, an insightful contribution can be recommended as a great interest for scholars in the field of ER literature.

7.2 Practical implications The overall outcomes of this study highlighted several implications for the managers and decision makers. The research findings suggest that the significance and affirmative consequences of organizational justice, conflict management, climate of trust and ER may encourage organizations to develop proactive strategies to magnify employee satisfaction, commitment and performance toward achieving challenging goals. The research outcomes may help the managers to construct a climate of trust by emphasizing on organizational justice and effective management of conflicts for reshaping cordial employer–employee relationship in the workplace. As a new insight, it may also support the managers to exhibit generosity to employees for their valued contributions. By flourishing congenial ER, organizations could institute a facilitative work environment and embryonic positive attitude among the employees to cooperate and shore up management to take effective decisions. Therefore, managers may manifest their obligations to make employees feel contented to work voluntarily for the success of organizations.

- 8. Limitations and suggestions for future research This scholarly endeavor though highlighted the significant outcomes, encountered some limitations. The major drawback is the size of the sample that was confined only to a single power transmission unit of a particular state of India. Future research could be extended by conducting longitudinal studies considering other public and private power sector located across the country. Thus, a series of comparative analysis could be presented to attain the generalizability of results. This approach could be modeled into a cross-cultural study by considering the international perspectives. Furthermore, climate of trust was employed as a mediatorbetweenorganizationaljusticeandER,andconflictmanagementandER.Asforfuture research, other variables could be suggested to play therole of mediator toenrich the knowledge of ER. The model proposed in this research could be extended to alternative constructs and also to emphasize on different dimensions for a better understanding of their significance and influence on ER within the framework of a power sector and other business units.

- 9. Conclusion The study concluded that the significance of ER is imperative for enduring a smooth and successful organizational life. In order to promote cordial employer–employee relations, it is prioritized to ensure organizational fairness, adequate management of conflicts and building of a climate of trust. When organizational justice, conflict management and climate of trust are coupled with ER, it will have a positive effect on employees’ attitudes and behaviors results in achieving organizational outcomes. Organizations by emphasizing on these constructs can strengthen employee morale, corporate communication, mutual feel understanding and respect within the workplace. As a result, employees will motivated and encouraged to confront the future challenges and organizational growth and sustainability can better be accomplished. The researcher in this work attempted to cultivate the quality relationship between employers and employees by collaborating the employees’ contribution and employer’s investment. As employees are the vital assets of the power sector undertakings, they should be properly cared and valued. In order to satisfy and make employees feel happy, it can be plausible to implement effective and proactive strategies at the organizational domain. Thus, this recent work by integrating the importance of organizational justice, conflict management and climate of trust confirmed the empirical validation and provides new and meaningful insights to enhance the existing knowledge of ER in power sector organizations. organizational Organizational Behavior, Vol. 23 No. 3, pp. 267-285.
