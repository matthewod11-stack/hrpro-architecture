I would like to thank key members of the University Student Union, Inc. at

# California State University, Northridge, Executive Director, Debra L. Hammond, former

Associate Director of Operations, Kristen Pichler and the two former Personnel Directors,

Ana Snowden and Roni Lopez. Each of these members trained and assisted me as a

student supervisor, dealing with a wide rage of issues from hiring employees, training,

building moral, discipline procedures, termination, ethics, and leadership abilities. Their

style of management is based on informing employees of what you expect of them and

what they can expect from management. The union served as a vehicle of opportunity

that enabled me to grow and develop my managerial and leadership capabilities. Each one

of these individuals played a vital role in discussing the complexities of work related issues

and reminding me of my role and responsibilities to the organization and the employees I

cases, a stem warning was given not to repeat the error. Most importantly, neither I, nor

any other employee was ever degraded based on anyone person's error.

Debra and Kristen always stated that hard work, determination, tenacity,

intelligence and good faith does not go unrecognized. Both of them believed that life is a

continuous learning process, where we must strive to acquire new knowledge and always

challenge ourselves. I have applied this philosophy to my life and will continue to

## challenge my work environment and myself.

# ABSTRACT

TO TERMINATE OR NOT:

# A CASE STUDY OF WRONGFUL TERMINATION

# by

# Robert Charles Hubbard

# Master of Public Administration

Many employment issues have gone to court where a former employee is suing the

employer based on their termination.

In some cases the employer has prevailed and in

others, it has been the employee. As a result ofrising lawsuits and complaints to the

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, there is a need to investigate this matter and

detennine the cause of wrongful termination. Termination is the final step in the

emp1oyer/emp1oyee refation..ship, regardless of whether it is voluntary or involuntary.

Conversely, there are key factors prior to any termination act initiated by the employer.

These factors are the employees overall performance record, evaluations, interaction

between an agent of the employer and other employees, gender and age. These factors,

along with others, will help determine whether or not an employee was terminated for the

# incorrect reasons.

Furthermore, it has been determined that property such as handbooks, a job offer

letter and electronic mail messages retrieved from the database are company property and

have been used against the employer in cases involvJUg tecmination. Based of the verbiage

used in ha..ndbooks, courts have assisted in rendering judgments in favor of the employee.

# v

Therefore, what the employer does not know can hurt them, should a case go to trial

based on the contents of the handbook. Because of this growing trend ( employment

related lawsuits), many companies no longer utilize handbooks. Case law has illustrated

excellent examples where courts have ruled that the contents within a handbook are

binding. The companies that continue to use handbooks have found that disclaimers have

been effective in reducing lawsuits.

Evidence clearly shows the at-will employee doctrine is in decline and cases are

constantly being lost, causing a new perspective in addressing employment issues.

Employers are now utilizing arbitration as a means of reaching a solution to complex work

related issues. However, some companies have mandatory arbitration. Courts are in favor

of a mandatory arbitration process, while other courts (appellate) have struck down such

programs. Most employees' employment status is at-will, and they have gone on to fight

the discharge. Yet, there are steps being explored that a.11 employer can take to reduce the

possibility oflawsuits and or loss in court. Many wrongful discharge preventive measures

range from inexpensive to costly, based on an organization's budget. Nevertheless, all

areas, from the advertisement to the employees last day, play a vital role in determining if

an employer error occurred.

# Chapter One

## An Introduction to the Practice of Wrongful Termination in the Workplace

The basis of this project is case law and interpretations that have been given by

judges and lawyers who have first hand knowledge or have written on the subject of

wrongful termination. At the start of this research it is this author's intention to show that

wrongful termination is the direct result of managers who have not been adequately

trained in employment law and or required business procedures. It is this study objective

to determine if this is a true statement to make or not. If this is not the case, after

reviewing all the information presented, it shall be determined why employers are being

taken to court and losing cases for wrongful discharge, and what are the actual problems.

It should be kept in mind that a preponderance of the workforce is at-will employees.

Clarification and identification is needed on a few terms and phrases used, which

can be found hi the legal definitions provided after the chapter six. In addition, the pruase

agent of the employer from here on out shall refer to a single business owner (a sole

proprietorsl-i.ip), partnerslijp, corporation, and or any person(s) v1ithin their business

function, listed as a president, vice president, corporate executive, manager a.11d or

supervisor that has the capacity to directly or indirectly execute a termination of a

subordinate. One must keep in mind, some suits are from those who were in management

and were terminated by their superiors.

## From the author's personal experience at the management level with Host Marriott

Union, Inc., the process of termination has been having knowledge or in some cases, no

## knowledge of correct approach by front line managers.

In order to educate managers

and supervisors in both workplaces, the executive management had those persons trained

in the areas of disciplinary action and the process of termination. For example, in one of

the workplace, store mangers had to learn about the union contract and the process of

arbitration, when applicable. In the following chapters the Case Study of Wrongful

Termination procedures will be analyzed.

In chapter two, the focal point is the employee handbook. An employee handbook

can serve as an instrumental guide in introducing new employees to the corporate culture

and giving an overview of key material that an employee will find useful. For example,

issues dealing with overtime for hourly employees are effective at the start of the year.

Overtime will be calculated by a new method that is any time after the eight hour shall be

overtime_ Prior to this new method, overtime pay did not start until the completion of 40

hours. This new law just passed the California state legislature this summer. Hourly

employees would find this piece of information valuable, as it may make a difference in

their paychecks. Yet another topic to be included is, classification of an employee status,

## in relation to other employees in the company.

Another piece of important information contained in an employee handbook, is

discipline procedures and the evaluation process. The University Student Union has its

discipline procedure outlined in a step-by-step format. At the same time, there is a

staterr..ent that any of these steps can be superseded, based on the severityÂ· of the action.

2

In addition, the Grievance Procedures, can be utilized by an employee has ifhe or she feels

they have been treated unfairly.

In this section, court cases involving employee handbooks are presented, where an

employee brought the employer to court based on the contents of the handbook, for

failure to comply with specified steps. The landmark case of Toussaint vs. Blue Cross

and Blue Shield of Michigan (1980) will address how the employer failed to comply with

their own disciplinary action. In addition, another case involving Hoffinan-La Roche, Inc.,

a pharmaceutical firm, spelled out the reasons an employee could be terminated. In this

situation, the employee termination did not fall under one of the stated causes; therefore,

the termination was considered wrongful. These two cases presented here, demonstrate

the negative impact an employee handbook can have on a business, if there is deviation

from a format. The next logical approach would be to look at what the law says about

# terminlltion.

Chapter three examines the origin of the at-will employment doctrine and its

exceptions. The exact origins of the doctrine cannot be clearly traced, but have had a

strong presence in the American force in the past. Currently, the doctrine is used in 49

states and is on the decline, based on many court challenges, some of which are listed in

chapter two. Essentially, the term ''at-will" means that the employer can terminate you at

any time for cause. Also, the employee can terminate the employment relationship at

anytime without notice. The latter portion of the "at-will" doctrine is not being addressed,

as no research l1as been w,covered on tl'-Js rriatter.

3

Furthermore, some challenges to the "at-will" doctrine have come from violating

various federal acts. The Age Discrimination Employment Act (ADEA) protects

employees, who are 40 years of age or older, from termination based on age. Employers

have been taken to court for terminating an older employer, who has a relatively high

salary and a reasonable benefit package, in exchange for a younger employee. However, if

the older worker is terminated for incompetence, then there is no claim. Another

challenge has come before the court, are claims brought by employees for violation of the

American with Disabilities Act (ADA). With the ADA, the employer will not hire an

employee who falls under this category, so there will not be a need to make reasonable

accommodations to the work environment. Title VII of the Civil Rights Act prohibits

discrimination based on race, religion, national origin or sex. The participation clause

under Title VII, allows for the protection of those who are directly or indirectly involved

# in any investigation proceedings.

There are some exceptions to the at-will employee doctrine. The rejects are in the

area of public policy and may differ in application state by state. There is serving jury

duty, whistle blowing, failure to commit an illegal act on behalf of the employer and filing

a workers' compensation claim. At the same time, some of these exceptions have been

incorrectly understood, such as serving jury duty. An employee went to jury duty and

returned and was then terminated. In this case, the employee sued the company. The

courts ruled that the employer did not violate this public policy, because the employee was

# rl-A- â¢â¢ tenrunateu au.er jUrf serv1ce.

4

Another approach that has been taken is formulation of the Model Employment

Termination Act (META). META has been designed to assist employees, mainly those

who are at-will employees. It is also designed to limit cases that go to court and seek

compensatory and punitive damages. Also, META seeks to utilize arbitration as an option

to reduce wrongful terminate cases. Unfortunately, the research has shown META has

not been enacted in any state legislation. The theory behind META to address issues

relating to at-will employee and wrongful discharge is good, but lacks the necessary

# support in any state.

In chapter five, the attention will shift to employee resources when work related

issues are the center of employee concern. There are three businesses that will analyze

how employment problems are to be addressed. In addition, the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission and the court would be examined as an option to seek relief for

work related issnes. Each bnsiness to he analyzec1 has a methoc1 that is s111ti:1hle for thP.ir

employees to solve problems.

The University Student Union is Grievance Procedures, as stated, are designed to

solve work related issues when an employee feels they were treated unfairly. The

Grievance Procedures are spelled out in the employee handbook, which is given to each

employee at the start of their employment. This procedure has a series of sequential steps

starting from one, and ending with step four. Ifno resolution can be achieved at the first

step, then the employee can proceed until all steps have been exhausted.

Host 1'v1ardott Services Corporation employees who are not at the management

level, are union employees. Employees who belong to the union have union

5

representatives that protect their rights under its contact. The union contract utilizes a

progressive discipline approach and spells out how the employee should be treated. An

employee only has to raise any concerns he or she has with the designated union

representative. At this point the union representative will then work with management to

resolve any work related issues. An option spelled out in the union contract, is the ability

to attend arbitration, which is covered by employee's dues. Arbitration is the final step for

# any union employee at Marriott.

## The Prudential Insurance Company of America associates have developed Roads

to Resolution. Road to Resolution is an internal mechanism that has been designed to

address employment related issues. Roads to Resolution has four steps. If the associate is

not successful at step one, then they may progress to the next step. Step four, which is

the final step, is the last choice before outside assistance. The complexities of each step

will he detaileci in the chapter_

The EEOC and the courts are outside options for employees for any organization

unless they have special arrangements at the start of employment. Even if a special

arrangement exists, it may be possible to have that option to challenge. The EEOC

addresses work related complaints and conducts investigations if necessary. The request

and guidelines set fo1th by the EEOC are not taken lightly. Moreover, the courts carry a

lot of weight and are costly for both the employer and employee. Along with court costs,

there is a time frame for a trial, along with possible appeals from the losing party. The

research wJl show that although both of these options are time consUIT.iing; they may be

# the only choice for an employee.

6

Another area to be analyzed, is preventive measures, found in chapter six.

Preventive measures for wrongful termination, range from a disclaim.er placed in an

employee handbook to a legal audit. Handbooks were discussed in chapter two, as well as

the effectiveness they can have in focusing in on key concepts. Having a human resource

representative review the handbook can reduce instances of litigation. Next, the employee

would read the handbook and sign a statement to acknowledge that they have read the

handbook this is then kept in their personnel file.

For management level employees, the research shows that training on critical

business issues should be addressed along with human resource issues. Business should

design a program that covers problems that are tailored to their needs along with standard

personnel practices, to ensure competent managers. Further research also shows that a

well-trained staff will result in successful termination suits; the key here is consistency

# amongst managers.

The analysis of this chapter is predicated on the fact that an employer can stay out

of court or reduce the number oflegitimate claims to be pursued in court. Preventive

measures also help create an educated work environment for the employer and employee.

Not only should managers be educated, but employees should be informed on conduct that

may lead to termination if the business does not have a employee handbook. Essentially,

these are efforts to reduce problems within a work environment that could manifest into

# termination for any employee.

Concluding thoughts chapter w.Jl merge all five chapters together endi.t1g in a brief

conclusiov~ It is the author's contention to briefly state the cause or causes of wrongful

7

termination. Thereafter, the author will to reinforce some key concepts that have been

stated in several chapters consistently, in an effort to have both parties ( employer and

employee) seek resolution to this complex problem that continues to grow throughout the

# country.

In short, it can be said that the internal mechanisms presented, are designed to

have employees solve problems, work towards a solution, and maintain their employment.

It can also be said that preventive measures are tools an employer has to establish a work

place that is prepared to deal work related problems once they arise.

## What the Literature Says About Wrongful Termination

In an article written by Charles E. Ramirez, titled "Employee Handbooks are Essential

at the Workplace" focuses on the importance and benefits of a handbook. Mr. Ramirez begins

stating that employee handbooks are not read by most employees and new hires in particular.

He also points out that this is the place where the new employee can obtain a sense of the

organizational culture. By determining the organizational culture, the employee is able to

identify what is deemed to be important and gain a sense of the value system. If a new

employee is able to obtain an idea of the culture then he or she will be able to navigate

through different challenges they may be faced with.

Also, Ramirez mentions some basic things that are contained in the handbook. The

basics that can be found in a handbook are, dress code, rules and regulations, attendance and

equal employment policies. Aside from the background about an organization, the basics that

were listed are the main rea.~on for writing a handbook. There were no remark.s regardirlg

# disciplinary action and or possible examples of what constitute appropriate and inapproiate

behavior. He goes on further to suggest that the employee's expectations and any type of

questions and answers would be contained here.

Another area mention in this article is protection from lawsuits for both the employer

and employee. A key issue mentioned are employers who do not adhere to the guidelines

stated with the handbook. In a sense, he is writing that organizations that do not comply with

the stated material can possible find an employee using the verbiage in the handbook against

them as evidence for any legal action. On the other haiid, a handbook may also work against

the employee for not having k.nowledge of the contents. This portion of the article is

9

supported by David Deromedi, an employment law attorney for the law firm of Dickinson,

Wright, Moon, Van Duesen & Freeman. Mr. Ramirez refers to labor relation experts who

argue that employee manuals are binding contracts between employers and their employees.

From this, it can be concluded that those who view handbooks as binding are less likely to

have them in a business where they are employed.

At the end Mr. Ramirez article indicates from various lawyers, since the workplace is

constantly changing, all that is needed are the basics and what the company entitles to the

employees. Meaning if an organization wants a broad base handbook it should be tailored

around that organization's culture. This article is ended by some basic things that should be

included in every manuai a distinction between part time and full time employees,

# compensation polices, employee benefits, arbitration clause, drug testing polices and

applicable laws. Based of the basics, there may not be a need for drug testing policies and

every organization my not have an arhitration c1anse ThP rPH~on rHscipll11e procedure w.ay

not be listed is because they have caused lawsuits in which have been costly to employers

(Ramirez, 1998, p. 3).

Marissa J. Ventura, writes in an article tilted, "When age makes you a cut back

target." The article opens by illustrating examples where employees who are older and paid

more are being let go and or demoted, since the position they were in is no longer needed.

This is all done in an effort to save money for the organization for budgetary reasons.

Furthermore, higl-Jy paid personnel are being terminated for mh1or errors that previously were

10

dealt with a slap on the wrist. The article goes on to suggest that this is nothing more than a

subterfuge for the real issue of age; this position is taken by attorneys.

The arena of focus is the medical profession, in particular nurses and how they were

phased out of certain positions. As stated, the reason is that she or he is within an age range,

which they are paid more and are at senior positions. This type of downsizing and or

termination, will lead to an increase in the age discrimination suits. We are reminded that the

Age Discrimination Employment Act (ADEA) prohibits discrimination of employees above 40

years of age for the sole basis of their age. A key point is that this has been extended to all

## areas of employment, promotions, job assignments and so forth.

Marissa goes into and in-depth discussion of how termination on the basis of age

cannot be used and lists examples where an employer violated the ADEA. An example given

is when an employee over forty is removed from their current position and replaced by a

VOUJlQer emplovee who is less than fortv vears of aoe A ~m;:e oiVf~n ciescrihes H m1rgP. 'Who

- 'Q

.,

.!JQ'"'

,0

was terminated along with sixty other employees, whom were nurses. The nurse Peggy

Woodhouse applied for another position and did not meet the qualifications, alleged by the

employer. An ADEA suit was filed, and within a short time span seventy-six nurses were

hired and ninety seven percent of them were younger than the group of sixty-one nurses that

were terminated. Woodhouse won the case and was awarded $50,700 in back pay and

# $50, 700 in additional compensation.

The article gives advice to employees who feel they may be and are the victim of age

discrirr..it1.ation and what can be done. It is noted that the employee has the Equal Employ111ent

Opportunity CoID..mission (EEOC) as an option. Furthermore, to strengthen a case, it is

11

suggested that employees keep records of meeting and or written and verbal correspondence

leading up to a possible termination. This approach, maintaining records is helpful for an

employee regardless of any avenue he or she chooses to pursue (Ventura, 1998, p. 47).

An article written in Workforce, titled "When is an independent contractor actually

# an employee?"

It is determined the distinction between employee and contractor is

becoming increasingly risky. Therefore, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) produced a list of

twenty factors to assist employers distinguish between the two groups. If instructions are

required and follow a specific format, this is indicative of an employee status. Moreover, the

more training required, is also indicative of employee status. Another factor is integration, if

the work performed is needed and apart of an overall business flow, then this is indicative of

employee status. Next, service rendered personal, if a worker exhibits such behavior, which is

required, they a_re an employee. Hiring, if a worker fhnctio:ns in a supervisor capacity and

gives employees assistant, then this is an employee. Next, is a continued relationship, which is

defined by the employer and work, this constitute an employee status. Right to terminate, a

worker who has the ability to terminate the relationship is an employee. However, one who

must work until the project is complete is an independent contractor, anything prior would be

breach of contract. The right to discharge, a worker who can be discharge at any time is an

employee. An independent contractor can only be discharged for failure to comply with the

terms of the contract. These are some of the distinctions off the list of twenty generated by

# the IRS.

12

The basis for the IRS giving a set of guidelines assist the business in terms of how an

employee is compensated, also for possible legal ramifications. If an worker classifies

themselves as a contractor based what is completed then the workel' is not an at-will employee

who can be terminated at anytime with cause or "for cause." A few things this article does

not clarify are issues of where the worker views their status that is different from the

employee, which could lead for the courts to decide, if necessary ("When is an Independent,"

1997, p. S6(2) ).

An extensive piece written by Adie C. Goldberg for HR Focus, titled "Top 8 issues

affecting HR." The eight issues are as follows first, The contract and Contingent Workforce

## second, Sexual Harassment third, Age Discrimination fourth, Wage and Hour fift~

# Protection on Intellectual Capital sixth, Mandatory Arbitration sevent~ Mental and Emotional

# T1Inesses and Aftirrrmttve Action.

The reader is made aware of recent lawsuits that were won by the plaintiff, the

employee who filled charges against their employer. Texaco was the largest in settling a race

discrimination class action suit for $172 million. Also, Home Depot paid $88 million to settle

a sex discrimination class action suit. Wal-Mart was sued, in which the plaintiff an employee

won for punitive damages, for being sexually harassed. In addition, the Equal Employment

# Opportunity Community in a large-scale case on two counts, discrimination and sexual

harassment sued Mitsubishi Motor Manufacturing Co.. Which support the notion that

employment lawsuits are on the rise across the countrj. Tr.tis statement followed by a very

import'1.nt fact, the U11ited States is the most litigious nation in the industrial world.

13

The remainder of the text covers eight major issues affecting human resources and

discusses related case law. Microsoft is addressed in contract and contingent workforce.

Essentially, theses workers singed a contract with stipulations they were not employees and

entitled to various benefits as those considered employees. However, said workers operated

with a supervisor and as did work that was related to the overall business unit, which make

them employees' not independent contractors, according to the courts. The conclusion

reached by U.S. Court of Appeals 9th Circuit, was helped by provisions set by the Internal

Revenue Service, for the purpose of bringing clarity between employee and a contractor for

# tax reasons.

In recent litigation, it was detennined that courts and the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission, prior to 1980 did not recognize sexual harassment as a form of

gender discrimination under Tittle VII. Conversely, it is noted since the view have changed,

this is now the fflstest area of employment litigation. Goldberg point to high profile cases

example, the confirmation hearing of Clarence Thomas, for U.S. Supreme Court Justice. It is

important to note that time of the alleged harassment, Clarence Thomas was the chairman of

the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, an agency established to eliminate such

# action within the workplace.

Another important area Goldberg wrote on was age discrimination, which has been

fueled by corporate downsizing.

In an effort to reduce possible litigation, companies are

offering elaborate servance packages and waiver stating, the employee will not sue.

Goldberg cautions the public to watch the courts, because they will probably rule in favor of

an employee who sues after opting a waiver not to sue and or accepts a generous servance

14

package. Essentially, each of the five that were written on are critical in a workplace and

current and future court cases will have an impact on employer responsibilities and employee

# rights.

Finally, Goldberg writes on affirmative action, mandatory arbitration mental and

emotional illness are changing based on current lawsuits. An example given is the white

schoolteacher who sued a school board for discrimination according to Tittle VII. The

teacher in question was laid off for an equally qualified black teacher. School board argued it

was within it rights to consider race into the equation as to prevent future discrimination. The

school board lost and, while the court was split eight to four on this issue. It appease that the

school attempted to do what they thought was the right thing however, it was at the expense

of a current employee who was terminated. In short, the school board had to discriminate

against a qualified employee to level the playing field by hiring an equally qualified employee

of a different race (Goldberg, 1997, p. 81(3) ).

An article written by Jonathan Rosenfeld titled "Legal charged tighten workplace

regulation" deals with court cases in Massachusetts. It is noted that employment law cases

are up in the state of Massachusetts. Recently, developments in sexual harassment, now

requires an employer with more than six employees to have a policy on harassment

# in the

workplace. Also, stricter requirements were placed on an employer with 15 employees or

more are required them to adopt a policy by a specific date. Based on these requirements, it

can be detennin.e the state of Massachusetts does not take the issue of sexual J:1arassment

# lightly.

15

Due to a large settlement under emotional distress, the plaintiff which prevailed,

received a large amount of money that the IRS was not able to acquire the appropriate taxes

due therefore, an adjustment to the tax code was required. Mr. Rosenfeld states that

President Bill Clinton passed the Small Business Job Protection Act of 1996, which amended

the IRS code so that taxes could be collected on emotional distress, punitive damages to be

# apart of gross income.

While businesses are now opting for Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) programs,

critics within the state are against such programs. The main reason for the push is to reduce

the amount of litigation. At the same time it is noted that "at-will" employee status is

recognized in the state. It is clearly stated that "at-will" employment has a strong presence in

the state where there is no implied contract. This supported by a careful review of the

employee handbook and or manual to ensure language that is damaging is not used.

# Consequently, there

::ire exception, such as refosing to work on religious holidays. As it

appease the state of Massachusetts is aware how most lawsuits are caused and is taking an

aggressive approach to protect the employer and employee (Rosenfeld, 1996, p. 9).

A well-written article by Julie Brienza titled "Federal EEOC says worker deserve

recourse, not mandatory arbitration" deals with the sole issue of arbitration. Julies points out

the concept of an Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) process is excellent, due to the

enormous amount of employment lawsuits that crowd the court dockets. However, it is not a

their right to pursue Equal Employment Opportunity Commission and or court options. The

16

Equal Employment Opportunity Commission has recently dispatched a warning to

corporations business with mandatory arbitration policies. The Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission position is that such policies are unfair to employees. It is believed

that an employee should have the opportunity to seek the appropriate venue for that particular

# situation.

The co chair of the Alternative Dispute Resolution Task Force, Paul Steven Miller

and Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, Commissioner, assisted in drafting a

statement in opposition to mandatory arbitration. It is ruÂ·gued that all internal resolution

mechanisms in place can substitute for the civil right laws. And that the employee who brings

charges should be able to seek assistance from the Equal Employment Opportunity

# Commission, irrespective of the outcome of any employer Alternative Dispute Resolution

process and or an equivalent. It also mentioned that in theses situations, there exist a zero

sum game to arbitration. The employer saves an enormous amount by not going to trial. On

the other hand, some systems are designed so that an employee filling a case, for arbitration,

pays half and may be responsible for the employer's half, if the employer wins.

Julie, also wrote, as a result of the statement prepared by the Equal Employment

Opportunity Commission, it sends a strong message to employers and benefits the appellate

courts, simultaneously. The empioyer is made aware that the Equal Employment Opportunity

Commission is watching with strict scrutiny. For the courts, it provides additional support to

any ruling they may apply in cases dealing with mandatory arbitration. Finally, there are two

cou...'i cases by the Ninth Circuit, in December issued back-to-back decisions striking down

mandatory arbitration agreements. First was Graham Oil Co. v. ARCO Products and the

17

second was The Prudential Insurance Company of America v. Lai, both in 1994. At

the same time some court are favoring these arbitration clause. Therefore, it is difficult to

determine how a court will rule on these mandatory arbitration issues (Brie~ 1995, p. 16).

In short, the literature presented is designed to address employment issues and the

areas that an employer should be concerned with. The employee handbook can serve as a

valuable aid for new employees, delineating policies and procedures. Also, it is important to

note that discrimination based on age is prohibited, in particular, an employee within the

protective class of age 40 and above. Further, the literature list eight pressing issues facing

human resources that employers should be looking into. Another pressing issue on the rise is

mandatory arbitration; any new employee must participate in, prior to seeking action outside

of their workplace. These articles are separate, yet they are interrelated in every workplace

and may have a negative impact on business if key issues are not appropriately addressed,

according to these authors.

# Chapter Two

# The Use of Employee Handbooks

The purposes oflooking at an employee handbook is to answer the question, can a

handbook serve as an element of wrongful termination? In reply to the question, the

answer is yes. For this chapter, the fundamental issues are pitfalls that exist within an

employee handbook. An Employee handbook can and should serve as an instrumental

tool for employees to acquire information about company policies and procedures.

Despite the fact that handbooks are sometimes written in a way that does not grab the

employees attention and or make the organization appear to be interesting is not the

primary issues being addressed, that will be covered in another chapter. Based on the way

the employee handbook has been written, has caused lawsuits brought on by existing

employees or ones who have a reasonable belief he or she was wrongfully terminated.

The at-will erriployee doctrine, which states that the employer can

terminate the work relationship at anytime, with reason, without reason, without notice

a person acting as an agent of the employer may exercise the employment at-will doctrine

on any employee. According to the company, policies regarding status of employment, an

agent of the employer would not be in violation of the law or company policy. However,

add an additional element to the equation, the employee handbook, which has expressly

supporting documentation that an employee can only be terminated for theft of company

properry ai1d or poor performance. The employee, who may be the subject of termination,

19

has received a rating of three or four [three being average and four above average] in the

last three years of employment with company X. An agent of the employer terminates the

employee, who files charges against company X. The basis of the charge is employer's

termination did not fall into one of the two categories delineated within the handbook.

Employer argues, the employee is an at-will employee therefore; his termination is within

our rights. The fact the employee is an at-will employee, is correct, however, the

termination is a violation of company policy. In this case, the employer would have lost,

based on the language used in the handbooks. However, there are courts that would rule

in favor of the at will employment status versus the handbook. The state of Missouri

clings to the at will employment doctrine. On the other hand Kansas, only consider the

verbiage in the handbook and an additional element to determine if an employment

contract exist. If this case was in the state of Missouri, there is a possibility the plaintiff

would have lost the case based on interpretation itl. the h~11dbook, as not necessarily being

# binding.

Employers usually have the at~will employment verbiage in the application and not

within the handbook. A person looking for a job completes several applications, but only

can accept one offer. Once hired, he or she is given the employee handbook, which

provides background about the company and its goals. Likewise, a new employee can

obtain information on a variety of issues that a company chooses to disseminate and what

is employee finds interesting. A new hire may read that he or she could only be fired for

the following as outliiied hi the handbook or read disciplinary action will occur in the

following format. The disciplinary procedures stated are in reference to a progressive

20

discipline approach. A progressive discipline approach is verbal reprimand, written,

suspension then termination. These are the key elements to progressive discipline; all

components may not be used by every business. A termination based on progressive

disciplinary action does not have to follow this sequence, and not following that order may

constitute wrongful discharged. However, it is the absence that based on the infraction

any portion of this process can be omitted. This well constructed process without any

disclaimer constitutes the basis for reasonable expectation in the mind of the employee in

which termination would occur, and how discipline will be administered. The employee

handbook may be read several times by employees based on upon their particular

situation. And if the employee performance is bad, he or she may read about the action

their supervisor, may take based on their performance. Again, the handbook has formed

the basis of a reasonable expectation between employer and employee that any action

outside of the handbook or not comply1-ng with a sequential order may be viewed as a

violation. A perceived violation by the employee can end up in court and or viewed as a

# misinterpretation of policy.

# Court Cases

It is important to point out that each case is based on the totality of the

circumstances. Courts in some cases to be a binding contract have interpreted the

language used in the employee handbook. "In the landmark case Toussaint vs. Blue Cross

and Blue Shield ofMichigan (1980), the Michigan Supreme Court rule in favor of an

employee when the company failed to follow the disciplinary procedure outlined in its

21

employee handbook prior to firing the individual" (Jenner, 1994, p. 23). The courts

position was it recognized statements created a contract of employment according to the

handbook. So, if the handbook clearly delineated the termination process and any action

that did not comply with what was written was a violation of corporate policy.

In another case, according to Jenner (1994), the New Jersey Supreme Court, in

Woolley vs. Hoffinann-La Roche, Inc. (1985) ruled that the company's policy written

statement on job security created a binding contractual obligation. One reason the court

may have ruled this way is because the employee had reasonable expectation of job

security, and that termination would not occur. It is also possible that said company may

have terminated employees in the past but never had verbiage that existed in their manual

challenged.

Another case involving Hoflinan-La Roche, Inc., which is a pharmaceutical firm

that had in its employee ha.ndbook five reasons an employee could be terw.inated. The five

reasons for termination from the pharmaceutical firm are retirement, resignation, layoff,

## discharge for poor performance, and disciplinary discharge (McGreevy, 1992). The

Alabama Supreme Court which said as apart of its majority opinion, that the language

used in Hoffinan-La Roche was clear enough that an employee reading it could reasonably

believe that he would not be terminated until all the procedures in the hand book had been

followed (McGreevy, 1992). In addition, since Hoffinan-La Rouhe, Inc. had clearly stated

five ways an employee could be terminated, the company could not terminate an

employee, if did not fall into one of the five categories.

22

## In recent developments, employees of ITT Cannon, a Phoenix division ofITT

Corp., filled a lawsuit against the company regarding the contents of the employee

handbook as it related to layoffs and benefits. The handbook stated in the event of

layoffs, employees would be let go on the basis of seniority. When layoff did occur,

employees were not laid off with seniority as criteria. The employee handbook, that was

in existence more than thirty years was up dated with that particular provision not

included. However, the handbook did state, "all provisions are subject to modification or

revocation without notice" (Balzer, 1997, p. 23). This case came before the Arizona

Supreme Court to decide on contents of the employee handbook. "The court ruled May

25 that business owners must uphold company policies in old employee handbooks even if

the policies have been changed and new handbooks issued" (Teichgraeber, 1999, p. 1 ).

Furthermore, "The court determined that handbook policies could be considered contracts

of employment unless a disc!ai.mer states otherwise. The disclaimer also must say that the

company has the right to change policies at any time" Teichgraeber, 1999, p. 1). This

ruling also means that employers must compensate employees for lost benefits

# (Teichgraeber, 1999).

# University Student Union, Inc.

## The University Student Union, Inc., at California State University at Northridge

recently revised its employee handbook, since it was outdated. The union has a practice

of providing each newly hired employee a copy of the employee handbook. The primary

workforce of the union are students who worked part time, not to exceed 20 hours, unless

23

their particular unit had an exemption based on the hours of operation. Just like

employees in the corporate sector, they read the portions that pertain to their particular

situation or interest. For example, overtime, holiday pay, jury duty, benefits and other

issues. At the time the current Executive Director, Debra L. Hammond was hired, she

later formed a committee (comprised of student supervisors and executive staff members)

that would review the current handbook and prepare to write a new one. The current

handbook had a clause that had to be suspended immediately, that is permanent employee.

Before the correction, it stood in place that after an employee passed the

probationary period; they became a permanent employee of the union, entailed to benefits.

A newly hired employee was on probation for six months; before she or he could acquire

benefits or the ability to transfer to another depart of their choice. During this sixth month

process, the employee could be terminated, if the jobs duties were not canÂ·ied out

according to the standards. After the sixth month, the employee became a permanent

employee of the union. Permanent employee implies that an employee could never be

fired. A student employee reading this clause has a reasonable expectation of job security,

as stated in the handbook.

Aware of the legal ramifications, Debra made sure the committee took permanent

employee out of the handbook and made additional adjustments as needed. Also,

numerous other factors of the handbook were reviewed as to quash any possible legitimate

legal action taken against the union. The author determined since the currently

probationar1 period was six montl1s, and our semester was four months, it needed to be

altered. 75% of the student employees went home for the summer and or winter breaks.

24

The author rewrote the probationary period to be duration of three months. Three months

was sufficient for a supervisor to determine if the employee on probation was a suitable

match. Did the employee like his or her job and from the employer perspective, did he or

she cany out the duties assigned in an efficient and ethical manner. Also, within the

handbook was a section regarding layoffs notices, which occurred at the end of each

semester. In the university environment, most student employees went home or found

jobs near home, working full time. The change in probationary period now coincides with

the semester. This also allows for nonsatisfactory employees during a probationary period

to be discharged.

Previously, this study addressed progressive discipline procedures that are

contained with the employee handbook. As an operations assistant, assisting the associate

director of operations was responsible for the student-building manager. They are student

mangers that run the facility dnring the day, nights a.mi weekends in absence of foll tin1e

staff member. These employees had to versed in union policies and procedures. Once a

new manager was hired, he or she had three weeks to be trained, longer if needed by

existing managers. There was one employee during his training process that did not want

to follow the training program in place and on several occasions wanted to go against the

norm. His fellow managers, who were training him, stated he was not complying with

procedures we had in place that had a track record for producing excellence, efficiency

and professionalism. Based on the repeated concerns of his trainers, there was a need to

25

The authors first step was to speak with him and determine from his perspective

what was going on before any action was taken. After listening to the employee, the

author informed him he would have the opportunity to manager his own style after his

training has been completed. The author urged him to follow the direction of his trainers

and to learn the union's policies and procedures, which he did not comprehend.

Unfortunately, this did not work, the author spoke with said employee again a warned

him, should he continue to not comply with his trainers and his training program, a verbal

warning going to be issued. A verbal warning bad to be issued, which was documented as

a verbal warning and placed within his file. The employee was still within his probationary

period and continued not to comply with request in a reasonable amount of time made by

other employees in the union, which his interaction was required. Next, was a written

warning based on the infraction, which ended with the clause this may lead up to

termination. After this failed attempt to rectify the situatio!l..., the employee was issued a

memorandum of counseling; this was within the handbook as a tool for addressing

problems. Again employee continued to show disregard for procedures and policies,

therefore another written reprimand was issued.

The last phase of that process for his constant insubordination was termination.

Employee was still in his probationary period (the six month period, before the handbook

was adjusted). The author entered into a discussion with the Associate Director of

Operation, Kristen Pichler, about employee's performance and it appeared this was not a

suitable n1atch. An option to exterid the probationary period was entertained however,

based on past performance and insubordination, it was in our (union) best interest to

26

terminate the employee. Employee in questions showed no attempt to rectify any

problems addressed, so there was no reasonable expectation that if the department

extenuated the probationary period a behavior change would occur. No extension was

granted and he not was taken off probation to transfer to an employee without

probationary status. The author, consulted with the Personnel Director, Ana Snowden (at

that time) at each and every step to ensure the department had complied with company

guidelines and any applicable law(s). At the time of termination, Kristen Pichler and the

author met with the employee and informed him, he was he being terminated, which was

supported by documentation. Employee began to argue this was wrong and made other

remarks. The author began to counter those remarks and was stopped by Kristen, for fear

what may have been said could have a future impact.

The progressive discipline process was followed as stated in the handbook with

continual consultation with the perso11..nel director. With1r1 the ha.11dbook it clearly states

the union has the option to by pass any of these steps if the infraction is so sever it

becomes essential. Only once was a probationary period extend, when an employee had

made successful attempts in correcting the problems presented. The author had a

reasonable exception that the employee knew the job and the requirements and wanted to

stay. This employee passed the extended probationary period and later transferred to the

business services department, utilizing his business skills acquired within his major.

The union went above and beyond most organization in regards to handbooks or

# manuals. The Union's Personnel Director, Ana Snowden and her successor Roni Lopez

made sure that each student supervisor gave their new employees a copy of the handbook.

27

It was the unions' position that by giving them a handbook, it leads to employee

empowerment and awareness. Also, each semester during orientation employees are

reminded of key issues contained with the handbook and about ethics. On the other hand

there are companies that are not giving out handbooks or making mention of them.

Dissemination of information on annual or biannual basis was good for the union based on

its style of operation. However, going over valuable information in a large meeting may

not be feasible for some businesses. The business in question must determine what is

appropriate and how to disseminate such information, by memo, e-mail or some other

# means.

In short, courts have ruled that employers can be held bound by their handbooks.

The exception to this rule is based on the use of adequate disclaimers that state, this is not

a contract and can be changed at any time by the employer without notice. However, if a

prior handbook exists without a..ny disclaimers, then leg::il issues :rn::iy arise. Failure to

print a disclaimer and notifying employees of any changes may place a company in the

same situation as ITT Cannon, being bound by its contents. The ITT case is the latest

development regarding an employee handbook, which was written several years ago

without a disclaimer. Furthermore, if certain procedures are spelled out a particular way,

it is imperative that they are followed accordingly. At the same time, a handbook can be

extremely instrumental in disseminating critical company policy, if well written and

reviewed by a human resource representative.

# Chapter Three

# The law and Termination

Employers are utilizing the employment at-will doctrine to terminate employees at

any, time for reasons and no reason. Based off this doctrine, it is permissible for an

employer to terminate without any fear oflegal action from the employee. If the employee

files a lawsuit, based on wrongful termination, the employer can feel assured that the

employee will not prevail. The fundamental argument from the employer would be the at

will employment status of said employee. In conjunction with, it is their business and they

may terminate employees as long as no laws have been violated. On the other hand, the

employee perspective is different, and he/she may view the termination of their

employment as unfair. Just because an employer's action is unfair in the eyes of the

employee does constitute wrongful discharge, perhaps bad policy or judgment. When the

employment at-will doctrine has come before courts, both sides have won, employer and

employee. If the employer has the prerogative to terminate at-will, then the question is,

why are such cases being lost?

# At-Will Employment

"This doctrine embraces a rule declaring that employment for an indefinite term

may be terminated at any time for any reason by either the employer or the employee

without any legal liability" (Aalberts, Gaston & Seidman, 1993). The origin and or source

of this doctrine remains obscure even to those who deal with at will employees and those

29

who write on the subject. By 1877 the at-will employment doctrine was generally

accepted in American courts. "'It is generally assumed that the at-will rule was the result

of an evolution in the master-servant relationship forced by industrialization in the

nineteenth century'' (Aalberts et al., 1993). In addition, employment oflarge number of

employees by ever-growing powerful employers insisted on new employment standards

that needed to accommodate new economic conditions (Aalberts et al., 1993).

# The Doctrine's Exceptions

At-will employment rule faces rejection by courts in 40 to 45 states. The at-will

employment doctrine is used in 49 states with the exception of Montana. Court rulings on

this issue have altered the effect on at-will employment, by direct holdings or with strong

dicta stated in the reported cases. Such modifications of the doctrine are embedded in

three theories. The three theories are, breach of employment contract, followed by bad-

faith discharge and public policy tort. In respect to breach of employment contract, the

courts have ruled that the employer has "entered an expressed or implied contract with an

employee that provided that the employee may be terminated only for cause or in

accordance with established policies and procedures" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The second

theory is bad-faith discharge. This "cause of action is also referred to as the "implied

covenant of good faith and fair dealing," whereby the employer breaches a contract in bad

faith after the employee has developed a relationship of trust, reliance, and dependency

with the employer" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The last theory is public-policy tort, which is

siwilar to bad-faith discharge. ~Â·An employer who discharges an employee for a reason

30

that violates public policy may have committed this tort" (Aalberts et al., 1993). No

contract is necessary for this cause of action (Aalberts et al., 1993). The four main public

policy protections are serving jury duty, refusal to committee and illegal act on the behalf

of the employer, whistle blowing on an individual or the company itself and :filling

# worker's compensation claims.

In respect to breach of contract, there are cases where the courts have looked at

the employers' statements, also including spoken assurances. It is important to recognize

that cases, which involve spoken promises, come down to hearsay and do not stand up

well in court. Conversely, written statements within a job offer letters, handbook and

personnel polices are more successful than cases focusing on verbal statements made in a

meeting. A hypothetical situation, if a job offer letter states that an executive will be hired

at $85,000 per year and in actually the starting salary is $78,000, a problem exist. The

executive in auestions has a reasonable exnectation that he or she wi11 start with a salarv of

.I.

Â·-

.I.

------------.,

$85,000 and may not have taken the job if $78,000 was initially offered.

Another hypothetical situation, where written procedures

# in a handbook that

specifically delineates a sequential format can work against the employer if not followed.

A hotel manger may be concerned that if progressive discipline becomes policy, past

employees who were not given the option to rectify inappropriate behavior may sue them.

Therefore, fear of what may occur from past employees may have an impact on current

employees. If no policy is set, the manager must determine, on what grounds an employee

circumstance, an agent of the employer will become inconsistent in their actions. The

31

--

inconsistency in terminating employees will in itself lead to legal action from current

employees or those recently terminated for lack of written disciplinary procedures in place.

In the matter of bad-faith discharge, this is vague and this is a tort and can lead to

punitive damages. Here, the courts must find an implied contract even when one does not

exist, this being the first element. Second element, the courts must determine if the

breach is in bad-faith and if the employee reasonable had an expectation of continual

employment as well as sense of trust to the employer. This is a two-prong test; one

element cannot exist without the other fur the test to be satisfied. Again, a contract exists

between two parties and good faith is apart of said contract, which is implicitly

understood. "This is an accepted theory that has been codified in the Uniform

Commercial Code, Article 1-203" (Aalberts et al., 1993). Given this, a breach of contract

has occurred when a discharge was in bad faith and such discharge violated the implied

# covenant of good faith and fair dealing.

Here are two cases involving bad-faith discharge. A breach of contract occurred

when a salesman was terminated after 25 years of service. The employee had a position

that was straight commission and closed a large sale for his company, then was later

terminated. It was determined by the courts that he was terminated because his employer

did not want to pay the large bonus. Second case, the courts found a forklift operator was

terminated after ten years of service, for not contributing to the employer's pension fund.

In the latter case the court looked at the special relationship that existed between and

and ''vulnerability and dependency" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The court holding focused on

32

the relationship of trust between both parties in that contract. In both of these cases, the

court permitted the case to stand on bad-faith tort and punitive damages.

Next, public policy tort is an exception to the at-will doctrine. As previously

stated a contract is not needed to prove culpability. First, determining what constitutes

public policy in the view of the court. Another factor to consider is that each state may

enforce different and or similar public policies. In practice, we can tum to existing case

law where the courts relied on statues, constitutions and precedents to determine public

policy (Aalberts et al., 1993). In addition a judge may use his or her convictions in

deciding the case. A case where the petitioner

took the employer to court for being

discharged on the grounds of reporting the misconduct of a supervisor to higher

management. The plaintiff argued under the whistler blower protection, that his

termination constituted wrongful discharge. Conversely, the courts responded this was

not a public policy violation and the conduct was reported internally and not reported to

the proper public agency. Here, the behavior of the supervisor was in question and the

plaintiff, while an employee was not being asked to break any law on the behalf of the

employer. If the plaintiff was being asked to break the law, the petitioner followed the

correct steps by reporting the behavior in question to an agent of the employer.

Moreover, to seek public policy protection the employee should have reported the facts of

# the case to the proper public agency.

These are examples in the area of public policy, which demonstrate public interest

summoned for jury duty and serves, a..nd then is fired. Another case, an employee is

33

terminated for refusing to have sexual intercourse with their supervisor. Next, an

employee who is terminated for filling a worker's compensation claim can have a valid

claim for wrongful discharge. Lastly, an employee who refuses to lie to customers

regarding the possibility of reasons for being walked to another hotel is a public policy

issue. Under the at-will employment doctrine an employee can be terminated in each

example listed above. Consequently, such terminations are not permissible under the

## public policy exception to the at-will doctrine (Aalberts et al., 1993).

Case laws are filled with application on how each of the three theories has been applied.

Courts ruling have impacted what managers' can and cannot do in the hiring, firing and

disciplining employees. Furthermore, future company documentation may be affected

based on particular rulings, in any of the three theories stated. The breach of contract

theory dealing with implied protection, requires a contract however, it may be expressed

or implied. A definition of implied contract theory is "inferred by law as a matter of

reason and justice from the parties acts or conduct, the circumstances surrounding the

transactions making it reasonable or even necessary assumption .... that a contract existed

between them by tacit understanding" (Aalberts et al., 1993). The clause tacit

understanding is a gray area for both the employer and employee. Cases exist when the

employee has been employed for a reasonable period of time and given the opportunity to

be promoted, which leads to the development of an expectation for continued

employment. Consequently, the employment for the employee in question comes to a

rather abru.pt end. Given the th~e frame, trJs calls h~to question the terir.Jnation of said

employee, who continually developed with the company without error.

34

# Technology

Lawyers are now using electronic mail ( e-mail), as evidence in wrongful

termination cases. E~mail is an area where agents of the employer are providing expressly

supporting documentation of the direct violations of how that can be used against them in

a court of Jaw. The problem with e-mail is that all uses communicate informally, as if

they were on the phone. The content of phone conversations in some instances tend to be

of candor and no connection with business etiquette, based on the situation. Companies

often inform employees their e-mail is check randomly and should not be used for personal

use. In regards to lawsuits, it is not the employee's e-mail that comes before the court; it

is an agent of the employer. Just because the user pushes the delete button does not take

the message away to a point it can never be retrieved. "Most computer systems,

"deleting: a file merely means that it is moved to another part of the network" (Henry,

1995, P- R)- Since it has moved to another part of the network, allows any lnform::ition

proving culpability, accessible for duplication. Yet there is a way around this, and that is

purchasing software that will let them write over files instead of deleting them.

The Prudential Insurance Company of America e-mail system is known as lotus

notes. This lotus notes database serves as the company's intranet site. In the e-mail

portion of this database, employees at the Woodland Hills home office are notified on a

regular basis to review the e-mail policy. In addition, sometimes a copy of the policy is

sent as an attachment along with the reminder notice. By doing this employees are

reir.Jnded that the company does have ru'1 e-mail policy and on a regularly basis any

messages may be monitored. Lastly, the policy states, our e-mail system is not for

35

personal use only businesses. By doing this, should an employee use the eÂ·mail for

scheduling gatherings after work or stating their opinion about key management

employees, he or she could be terminated for violation of e-mail policy.

Prudential associates are at-will employees; this is also communicated in our

Human Resource database, This notices in regards to employment status is stated in

# various e-mail messages and throughout the Human Resource database. This database

## allows for upward and down wards communication between employees throughout the

company. There is a question and answer portion to Human Resource database, which

the author utilized. The author wrote to Colette Roan a Human Resources representative

( early stages of my research) about the at-will employee status of employee ''In regards to

employment at-will of employees (the company may terminate the employment

relationship at any time with or without cause, without prior notice) appears to clear cut.

However, am I correct to understand there are minimum requirements to be met by the

employer when exercising this doctrine, due to the fact that this doctrine has been

challenged in court by employees (petitioner) against an employer? In situations where the

petitioner prevailed, has the doctrine been watered down? As I present this, I am keeping

in mind that each case is based on the totality of the circumstances and may not warrant a

case for wrongful termination. At the moment I do not have recent court rulings, I would

need to consult LEXIS-NEXIS and other resources. Lastly, I currently understand that if

an employer is taken to court, the new standard of just cause must be proven since evil

intent vvas such a difficult burden to prove" (Robert Hubbard, 1999). On Februai.J 3,

1999 the question was directed to Robin Katz in our Legal Department, which was never

36

answered. The exact question was reprinted and sent to Robin again on February 22,

- 1999. Till this day there has not been a response from any person from legal on this

matter. It appears that this is not a subject those in management do not like to discuss due

to possible ramifications their response may have in the long run. On the other hand,

employees not in management have no problems stating their views on the subject or

experience's friends may have shared with them on the issue.

# Age Discrimination Employment Act

## Originally the Age Discrimination Employment Act (ADEA) had a protective class

from age 40 to 69. Therefore, persons who fell into this category could not be terminated

on the sole basis of their age. Nevertheless, the amendment in 1986 to the ADEA,

removed the ceiling and now protects all older workers against discrimination in various

personnel actions as firing, promotions, layoff.~ a..nd directly affects the rights of em..ployees

as pension or benefit plan participants (Dube, 1988, p. 1 ). Discharging an employee for

their age, or attempted to pursue a different avenue, constitutes wrongful termination, if

the primary motive was age.

## Moody v. Pepsi-Cola Metropolitan Bottling Company, Inc. 915 F. 2d201 (6th Cir.

- 1990) ("Pretense for age discrimination," 1991). An employee 51 years of age was a

warehouse manager at Pepsi bottling facility in Michigan, was fired on October 1, 1982.

A 29-year-old employee replaced the former employee. The former employee sued on

the grounds of ADEA and other state law violations. Said employee constantly had above

average performance evaluations for duration of five years. A new supervisor began to

37

criticize the quality of work being produced by the older employee. This supervisor in

question stated the employee was let go because a reduction in workforce as specified by

upper management. The order given was to terminate six management level employees

since sales had been dropping. U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Michigan

ruled in favor of the plaintiff, in which Pepsi appealed the ruling. The case came before

the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit, in which the appellate court upheld the

district court ruling favoring the plaintiff. The appellate court stated a pretext of reduction

in work force was used to terminate said employee on the basis of his age. After an

investigation, it was determined there was no reduction in work force by Pepsi-Cola.

Plaintiff was awarded $132,818

## for damages and $150,000 for emotional distress.

In another case, involving Bull HN Information Systems Inc., and an

antidiscrimination agency, the computer company settled in the matter of layoff

procedures for infonnation tech_nology. The attorney general for the state of

Massachusetts settled charges that the company had discriminated against older workers

during layoff in the early 90s. There was no monetary compensation given to any worker

or admission of wrongdoing, the company agreed to comply with the following three

# issues.

1.1.

''Notify former employees of new job vacancies'' (Cole-Gomolski, 1999,

p. 14).

1.2.

''Require senior management to review all layoffs of workers over the age

# of 40" (Cole~Gomolski, 1999).

38

1.3.

"Change its internal complaint procedures for age discrimination"

# (Cole-Gomolski, 1999).

Lawyers familiar with this case state, the company did not protect itself from age

discrimination suits. To protect the organization, an employer would need to consider the

average age of the current workforce and then determine the average age after a layoff.

In addition, to compare the average age of those workers laid off. If disparate treatment

exists after the comparison, then adjustments should be made accordingly.

There are loopholes to the ADEA; if an employer is cleaver enough to utilize such

measure, then evil intent does exit. It is not against the law to terminate employees for the

sake of business necessity in an attempt to reduce cost. If an employer wants

# to

terminate an employee who is highly paid to assist in keeping cost down, then as an at-will

employee, they can be discharged. It is important to note that most high earners within

companies are in there 40s; this is when an employee begins reaching their peak earnings.

Termination of high earner could be stated as the justifiable reason, while the intent is to

eliminate older workers. For this approach to be effective, employees who are younger

must be included in discharge, giving the appearance of fairness. Nevertheless, if the

stated sole basis of discharge is monetary strain, and it could be proven, then it is

permissible. If this method of termination is used, it does not mean it is immune :from

lawsuit, but the burden of proof lies with the plaintiff. Many businesses have figured out

this particular loophole and have probably tried this approach with success and failure.

V.'rJle the employer during slov1 economic gro\vth or for the sake of greed v,ants to

maintain or maximize profits, employees are the :first to be discharged, to cut cost. By

39

diminishing the workforce does not maximize profits, to the extent that new revenue is

generated. Reducing overhead by means of employee's salaries and benefits means that

money can be labeled as profit and or money to boost profits. The average ADEA claim

involves employees who have contributed to the growth of an organization and should not

be discharged for any pretext. At the same time, court cases show that employers are

actively participating in wrongful discharge on the basis of age.

In the area of computers, an employee of Airborne Freight Corp. was awarded

$3.3 million against his employer in 1996. An e~mail message had been mtercepted

between executives which uncovered, the company was potential liable for terminating an

employee on the sole bases of his age. The employee was 46 years of age at the time of

his dismissal. Interception of such a message, exhibits expressly supporting

documentation (irrefutable evidence) those agents of the employer were participating in

discriminator practices. Furthermore, agents of the employer are able to conceptualize

new way of terminating employees, the reason given, is merely a pretext to a form of

discrimination (Mullins, 1999, p. 26). "Jury trials are allowed and the courts can award

back pay, order reinstatement to the job or front pay (which means money the employee

would have earned if he or she were reinstated) order hiring, promotions or job transfer;

assess attorney fees; and award double damages for a willful violation (and most are held

willful)" (Frierson, 1999, p. 15).

# Title VII of the Civil Rights Act

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act was passed in 1964, which prohibits

# discrimination in employment on the basis ofrace, religion, national origin or sex.

Moreover, there is a protection against retaliation against employees who complain about

discrimination practices. This added protection is extended to "employees who have

opposed any practice made an unlawful employment practices under Title VII (the

opposition clause) and to employees who have made a charge, testified, assisted, or

participated in any manner in an investigation, proceeding, or hearing under Title VII (the

participation clause)" (Kreiswirth, 1998, p. 2339). The fundamental reason for having

such clause is to allow those directly or indirectly involved to come forth without any fear

of retaliation. Coverage extends to an employer that has fifteen or more employees,

regardless if they are part-time or full-time, during 20 or more weeks in the current or past

year must adhered to this law.

## Two types of cased brought before the courts, disparate treatment and disparate

impact. Disparate treatment is when an agent of employer knowingly is treating person( s)

employed differently based on one or more of the prohibited factors. For instance refusing

to hire women for construction jobs, is knowingly treating women different from men,

therefore this is sex discrimination (Frierson, 1994). McDonnell Douglas Corp v. Green

was a landmark case which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that the plaintiff in a disparate

treatment case must prove four elements one, plaintiff belonged to a protective class two,

was qualified for the job involved t1'.Jee, ,vas treated L.~ &~ adverse way ( de:firied as not

hired, promoted, or discharged) and four, was treated differently from members of another

41

class (Frierson, 1994). If these elements can be proven, then the defendant-business must

be able to present a legitimate, nondiscriminatory, business reason for its conduct.

Conversely, the plaintiff can still prevail if he or she can demonstrate the reason given by

the defendant was merely a pretext for discrimination and not the real reason behind the

employers' actions. Disparate impact, is simply accidental discrimination, consequently it

is still illegal. For instance, an employer hiring unskilled workers, which require

employees to have a record free from criminal arrest, will violate this law based on two

elements. The first element is this rule has a different affect on one covered group as

compared to another. Once you factor in statistical data and geographic locations of the

company and where they hire, this will dramatically affect the equation and the result.

Second element, a business rule did not rest on a valid job requirement otherwise know as

a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ). In such cases the courts can award to the

plaintiff back pay, order hiring, promotions or other equitable remedies and assess the

## defendant-employer for all attorney's fee plus cost (Frierson, 1994).

# In discriminatory

cases the courts have the liberty to award compensatory damages, mental anguis~ and

punitive damages can range from $50,000 to $300,000, which is based on the size of the

# company.

Likewise, when it comes to computers and e-mail systems, companies have been

found guilty of discrimination. Citibank, New York City, was sued in federal district court

on February, 14, 1997 for racial discrimination after e-mail messages were intercepted in

,vt.J.ch Citibank n1anagers n1ade racist con]m.ents demearJng to Africa,.~~ A.t~ericariS

(Mullins, 1997). E-mail messages thought to be deleted were retrieved from the hard

42

drive and used in court against Citibank. As previously stated, the term delete does not

# mean, not recoverable.

# Model Employment Termination Act

## The Model Employment Termination Act (META) is designed to protect nearly

two thirds of the American work force from at will discharge. It seeks to reduce

employees' wrongful termination settlements by eliminating compensatory and punitive

damages. Also by providing limited protection to employees that they may not otherwise

be able to afford and or beyond their scope. META suggests using arbitration as a

## settlement mechanism, for wrongful termination cases.

A criterion has been set on employers and employees in using the META. An

employer with a minimum of five or more employees for duration of20 weeks, would be

required the META requirements. "An employer may not terminate the employment of an

employee without good cause" (Aalberts et al., 1993). Moreover, there are two

exceptions, an employee who accepts a written agreement to a servance pay in lieu of the

acts protected and employees hired for a specified time. During times oflayoffs due to

economic conditions, all elements of an employee work related performance must be taken

# into consideration.

This act recognizes a practice called constructive discharge "and

situations whereby employers can make continued employment intolerable to the

employee" (Aalberts et al., 1993). Theses actions can mean termination however, just like

other forms of termination, it can become a violation when good cause is not present. The

action taken when a charge arises starts an arbitration process that must be swift and final

43

decisions to be rendered in a specified time frame, as recommended by National

Conference of Commissioners. The concept of arbitration shall be discussed in chapter

five. Consequently, META has not been enacted in any states legislation (Wallihan, 1996,

p. 39). META can be interpreted as a concept with good intention, but no state

recognizes the goals and objectives it was designed to achieve.

In summary, case law and statutes exist that can be beneficial to the employer and

the employee. As stated, there are four public policy protections that an employee cannot

be terminated for: jury duty, whistle blowing, failure to commit an illegal act for the

employer and filing worker compensation claim. In the area of technology, e-mail is

company property and can be used against an employee who is sending messages to

threatening, or sexually harassing another employee. At the same time, it can be a

disadvantage to agents of the employer who communicate to one another how an

employee was terminated, if the reason is a violation of the law.

Also, there are other protections in the law for employees, such as ADEA and

Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, to name a few. This study shows, employees who are 40

years of age or older, cannot be terminated from their job on the sole base of their age. In

addition, Title VII of the Civil Rights Act affords employees protection on several issues.

An employer cannot use reduction in the workforce as pretext for age discrimination; this

would be disparate treatment. The laws and public policy are designed to afford rights to

## both employer and employee in the area of employment practices.

44

# Chapter Four

# Employee Resources

For employees who are experiencing problems on the job that may lead to

termination, have resources within their company, which can be utilized. An employee

can also take action outside of the company, which may render a decision within their

# favor. The University Student Union, Inc., Host Marriott Services Corporation and The

Prudential Insurance Company of America, all have different internal syste:rns in place that

which handle work related issues before the employee seeks external assistance. These

internal systems are set up for the sole purpose of resolving conflicts and rebuilding

working relations that have been a strain for the parties involved.

# University Student Union, Inc.

The University Student Union, Inc. (USU) has a grievance procedure iir place,

which is delineated within the employee handbook. The Grievance Procedures are

designed to seek a conclusion regarding the issue(s). It is the policy of the UPiversity

Student Union, to settle any complaints at the lowest level possible. The following

procedures delineated below, are guidelines for an employee Grievance.

1.1. These procedures are only applicable towards hourly employees who have

been employed for more than 30 consecutive days, before the action in

## question (''USU Student Assistant Handbook" 1997).

45

1.2. Any hourly employee can utilize this process if he or she feels they have

been adversely affected by a violation, misinterpretation of personnel

guidelines, administrative work rules and written work rules (''USU Student

# Assistant Handbook" 1997).

1.3. An employee may utilize the Grievance Procedures if he or she believes they

have been subject to discrimination as delineated in the law

1.4. Nevertheless, there are limits, and they are as follows.

1.4.a. disagreement with written USU policies ("USU Student Assistant

# Handbook" 1997).

1.4.b. verdict rendered by a previous grievance ("USU Student Assistant

# Handbook" 1997).

1.4.c. a business decision rendered by the board of directors ("USU

# Student Assistant Handbook" 1997).

1.4.d. any final decision given by the Executive Director or USU

Personnel Committee according to any of these policies

1.4.e. any action which has a separate appeals process in place.

The Grievance Procedure, which has four components, with four sub steps are in

# sequential order below.

2.1. Employee with an issue must first attempt to resolve the issue with

## their immediate supervisor (''USU Student Assistant Handbook"

1997).

46

2.2. If their is no resolution to the employee's satisfaction with their

supervisor, then he or she must submit a grievance in written form

## to the appropriate area director (''USU Student Assistant

# Handbook" 1997).

2.3. Should the previous step fail, then the employee complaint can be

taken to the next level supervisor or Executive Director (''USU

# Student Assistant Handbook" 1997).

2.4. Final step if required, review by the USU's Personnel Grievance

## Committee ("USU Student Assistant Handbook" 1997).

If an employee is terminated during temporary appointments, training periods and

memorandum of counseling, may not be grieved under this procedure.

These Grievance Procedures are clearly spelled out within the employee handbook.

As a student employee in management, the author was aware of what existed within the

employee handbook. A fellow supervisor had a conflict and attempted to resolve the issue

by addressing the person, and was not satisfied with the results. Afterwards, the authors

fellow supervisor (same person) attempted another avenue, and was still not content.

After the author became aware of the problem, the student manager was informed that

there was another way to deal with the problem. Quite simply, the manager was

introduced to the organizations Grievance Procedures and explained how the process

works. The student manager did not know about the procedure, and decided not to

explore that as an option. Nevertheless, tl'iis process is outlined for all employees to

# utilize.

47

# Host Marriott Services Corporation

Host Marriott Services Corporation has a union contract for employees. There are

management employees and non-management employees. The general manager, Human

Resource representative, their assistant, terminal managers and individual store managers,

all consisted of non-union employees. However, the employees were hourly employees

and as apart of the union, paying union dues. They consisted of 70% or more of the

workforce, while management filled the remaining percentage. Once an employee was

hired, he or she was required to join the union and had money taken out of their paycheck

for dues as specified, pursuant to the contract. The union representative worked on behalf

of the hourly employees, addressing any concerns they felt management was not dealing

with fairly. Essentially, their primary role being was an advocate for employee rights and

ensuring fundamental fairness, pursuant to the contract. As a result of the U11ion contract,

wrongful discharge complaints were next to none, or they did not last long.

While at Marriott, it was the author's responsibility as store manager to become

thoroughly familiar with the interworkings of the union contract. The contract delineated

how overtime and layoff would work. Seniority of an employee played a factor in how an

employee was handled. In regards to layoffs, employees with seniority were laid off last

and given the option to work within a new area first, once an opening became available.

In addition, an employee could not be subject to demotion in pay. This meant that, if an

employee bei.,g paid $10.85 fu1 hour i.i1 their cw-rent position, took a lesser position in

which the employee hired for that position was paid $8.95 per hour, the transferring

48

employee would retain their pay of$10.85 an hour. Furthermore, an employee being paid

$10.85 an hour could accept a greater position where the starting pay is $12.58 an hour,

would be required to start at $12.58 an hour. In short, no employee can receive a pay less

than his or her current rate of pay. Days off were also regulated, an employee could work

seven or more days straight without time off. If this occurred, there were guidelines in

place on how many days he or she was entitled, pursuant the union contract.

In regard to discipline, Host Marriott Services Corporation followed a

progressive discipline process. The guidelines are clearly stated within the contract and

listing the actions that are permissible by management to impose. An employee who

refused to follow a direct order could be written up for insubordination on the spot,

without question, as long as the requested order is not a violation of the contract.

Exceptions include blatant safety issues in regards to customers, (i.e., water on the floor).

The author asked an employee to mop up water on the floor. The employee in question,

refused, on the grounds that it was not his responsibility. In this situation, the customer's

need for safety prevailed. It is a right that Marriott can ask any employee to remedy the

situation. The employee refused to mop the floor and another employee rectified the

problem. The first employee was written up for insubordination, pursuant to the contract.

Yet, the second employee became upset because his coworker had passed the buck to him;

therefore his reaction was negative. The first employee in question did apologize, and

another situation was resolved.

However, there are generally about five managers per terminal, supervising an

average of 40 or more employees. Each manager had a different style, which was

49

acceptable to the extent that all manager act in concert when administering disciplinary

action. If an employee arrives 40 minutes late everyday and is written up by two of the

managers and no notation by the other three, then there is a problem. A union

representative would argue in this particular situation that said employee was not treated

the same by all managers. If all five managers wrote this employee up for the tardiness

and not another employee, a problem existed. A union representative is allowed to argue

that employee X who is also late has never been written up therefore, the employee in

question cannot be punished. Unfortunately, this is what takes place and how employees

are exempt from suspension and written reprimand carry no weight. Fortunately, this

problem of inconsistency was rectified. All newly hired managers had to participate in

training classes in all areas of the business. One of the topics that were covered was the

union contract and maintaining consistency throughout the business unit. As a result of

the effort, management consistency had improved within the company.

Assuming that consistency had applied, the union representative would file a

complaint on the violation in question, along with the action taken. The union

representative goal was to have the employee reinstated back to work or have the action

taken, removed from the personnel file. The first step was for the employee to meet with

the union representative and explain their side of the story and receive a copy of the file.

At this point it becomes imperative for the employee to have full disclosure. The union

representative would meet with a Marriott manager in an effort to resolve the situation.

If this did not work, then the next step would be mediation then arbitration. Should

mediation not work, and then arbitration is the final step. The arbitration process cost

50

both sides money however; the union was limited in resources. The author was told that

this process could be drawn out if necessary, this meant Marriott had deep pockets, to the

extent the union would cease this process, based on their budget. Due to the cost factor,

as managers, we were informed that the company would back us and money was not a

# problem.

If it had been determined that an employee had been incorrectly discharged he or

she could be reinstated pursuant to the union contract. And in some cases, some

terminations were an error based insufficient evidence. From the unions perspective

management sometimes makes bad business decisions and take action against an employee

that will cause irreparable harm, to the extent a :financial hardship will take place. This

thought process creates a need for an outsider (union) to become familiar with business

procedures and to ensure that each and every employee has an equal chance in rectifying

inappropriate behavior as deemed by the company_ At the same ti__me, there those

employee who were terminated, which the union did not go out of their way, by having

them reinstated, based off their job performance and work ethic. These employees were

not at will employees, but a mechanism existed for them to seek resolution for business

# problems.

During the authors time with Marriott, they were in the process of renovation all

of their business units within the airport. The renovation involved closing an existing

business unit( s) and establishing a temporary shop until the new business had been built

from the grmu1d up. A demolition teaiTi would come and tear down the current facility

and a new crew would then start building a new unit. Since the temporary facility only

51

required about a quarter of the employees, this was a time for those who had constant

problems to be terminated in accordance with the union contract stipulations. The only

notice give was a layoff notice, which in some case may have been pushed back based on

the contractor. Employees were transferred based on seniority as delineated within the

contract. No managers were laid off, only went for additional training or assisted with

another business unit. At this time there was nothing the union representative could do for

the workers. Quality workers were retained, along with those with seniority however,

they had to meet the needs and expectation of each new business unit.

The only apparent downfall to the terms and agreement of the contract lied with

management and the ability to comply with the terms and conditions. If one manager who

complies with the contract for all employees writes up an employee and another manager

is relaxed about such contractual obligations and disciplinary action with the employees,

this can cause problems. Inconsistency is the major flaw that is currently being addressed

by ongoing training, which stresses documentation.

## The Prudential Insurance Company of America

## The Prudential Insurance Company of America associates regardless of their

position are all at will employees. This year, the company has recently amalgamated a few

departments and added other features to a package that is now known as the new

prudential employment dispute resolution program, Roads to Resolution. In town hall

# meetings across the countrJ, 1vfichelle Darling, Executive Vice President of Human

Resources, introduced the program and Sharon Taylor, spoke on management leading

52

people, Oliver Quinne, Vice President of Roads to Resolution and Dr. Harold Davis, Vice

President of Corporate Ethics. In essence, it builds on existing internal resolution

mechanisms which include local management, Human Resources and the Ethics

RESOLVE Office which is offering external mediation and voluntary arbitration for

certain types of work related issues. The new Roads to Resolution based on three

# principles

1.1. "Conflict is best resolved through open, honest communication;" (Roads to

# Resolution, 1999).

1.2. "The early resolution of issues is the best way to maintain a positive,

## productive work environment; and" (Roads to Resolution, 1999).

1.3. "Even when we cannot resolve conflict internally, we are committed to

resolving issues quickly and fairly through the use of an independent outside

# party" (Roads to Resolution, 1999).

There are a total of four steps to the Roads to Resolution program, which consist of

internal and external factors. All actions taken should occur by follow the sequential

order; therefore, one step cannot be by passed for another.

# Step one:

# Internal Issues

# Step two: Utilizing the RESOLVE Office

# Step three: External Mediation

# Step four: External Arbitration

53

Step one allows an associate to utilize traditional internal mechanisms within the

business unit to address employment-related issues. Local management, Human

# Resources, Employee Relations, Equal Opportunity Office and the Ethics Office comprise

the traditional avenues to pursue employment related issues at Prudential. It is important

to point out that Employee Relations, Equal Opportunity Operations Office and the Ethics

Office are at the corporate level, which associates have access if the issue can not be

resolved with local Human Resources and or local management.

It is suggested that the

associate first deal directly with the parties involved, which might bring about an

understanding and agreement to the issue. It is recognizes that for some individuals it may

be uncomfortable in addressing the person directly involved. Should this be the situation,

and then the employee needs to speak with their immediate supervisor to act as a

mediator. On the other hand, if the problem is with the supervisor, then a Human

Resource representative should act as a mediator. Next, ifthere is no satisfactory

resolution, the next step is corporate options stated above. It is believed that through a

proactive approach in confronting the problem will bring clarity to the issue and at hand a

satisfactory resolution. However, if the options in step one do not reach mutual

conclusion, the step can be utilized.

The Resolve Office is step two of the program. The staff within this office are

here to assist the parties involved to determine if all the options within step one have been

fully exhausted. When speaking with a staff member they will begin by asking pro bing

questions to ascertain what steps were utilized and the outcome of each. Based off the

evaluation and or discussion, if can be determine that all the available options provided in

54

step one did not reach a satisfactory conclusion, then they will be allowed to proceed to

the next steps three and four if deemed necessary.

External Mediation is the third step of Roads to Resolution. If the work related

claim/issue was not satisfied in earlier steps, then this step utilizes an external factor.

Mediation is the key component in this phase, which the company seeks an independent

neutral third party called a mediator. Both parties need to agree upon an organization in

which a mediator will be selected. Acceptable organizations are the American Arbitration

## Association, JAMS/Endispute, and Resolution Systems and in addition to any other

dispute resolution organizations, the parties involved may agree upon. The mediator does

not act as a judge in this process; their role is defined as seeking both parties mutual

cooperation to find a solution to the problem. Another key role is problem identification,

which is fundamental. If the problem cannot be identified then no resolution can be

determined at any stage for any organi7.ation. Once thi,;: has been identified, then the

mediator will explore possible bases for agreement and consensus (Roads to Resolution,

1999).

The Mediator will meet with both parties together or separately in which each

party will have the opportunity to present their perspective regarding the issue. The

mediator will present a proposed solution based on the information provided by both

parties. Consequently, the proposed solution is not required to be accepted by either

party. Should both parties agree to a solution presented by the mediator, then is shall be

placed in writing which is final and binding.

55

Finally, the fourth step is External Arbitration. This next step is a binding

arbitration process. Here any employment related claim and or legally protected rights

might be heard in this step. This step also involves and outside neutral third party.

process the arbitrator will hear the claim presented by both sides and render a decision that

is binding unlike mediation, where the solution presented can be rejected. During this

process, the formality is far greater than any other steps before this. In arbitration,

witnesses can testify on your behalf or for the company and evidence can be presented and

argument made, this rule applies to both sides. Here, any evidence, witness and or

arguments must comply with the rules of arbitration. More importantly, the arbitrator has

the flexibility to grant awards that are permissible within a court oflaw, such as back pay,

## reinstatement and attorney's fees (Roads to Resolution, 1999).

Arbitration times and dates are agreed upon and format followed is outlined. Only

relevant information may be exchanged by the parties involved, and sh_all be submitted to

the arbitrator. At the arbitration, only facts on addressing the issue can be presented along

with expressly supporting documentation. This process is conducted privately and after

the hearing, the arbitrator will submit a final written decision within thirty days, which is

binding, by the company and the associate involved.

During steps three and four the associate may have an attorney present. The

compar."1.y will not pay for an attorney representing an associate. If the associate hires an

attorney then the company will do the same if they are in stage four or five. However, by

participati...'lg in a...'1.y step four or five, the company shall i.i1cur the cost of the entire process

for each party involved (associate, company, mediator administrative fees and or arbitrator

56

# In this

administrative fees). The time limits for initiating step three or four are same for filing a

complaint in a civil action and complying with applicable law(s). If an associate tenninates

their employment from Prudential, they still may participate in Roads to Resolution.

Consequently, if an associate decides not to utilize step(s) three and or four and decides to

seek legal action or skip a step, Prudential will do the following. "Prudential's intents is to

as ask the arbitrator, agency, or court to suspend the proceedings until mediation has

been utilized" (Roads to Resolution, 1999).

This particular program has just been introduced to the company this spring;

therefore, no information exists on any outcome presented by the presenters at the town

hall meeting, in which the author had attended. This approach focuses on understand a

problem that may have been miss understood and utilizing all the mechanism at the

disposal of the company to resolve such issues. It was pointed out that the biggest

concern by associates is fear ofretaliation ifhe or she spoke against a person in

management and or a policy. Chairman and Chief Executive Officer, Arthur F. Ryan, is

committed to have and open door policy at all levels of management, so that no associate

feels a fear of retaliation. This has been expressed on several occasions in e-mail to all

associates and our broadcast television update transmitted internally to communicate the

goals and direction of the company each quarter. An employee is not band from taking

legal action after all the options have been exhausted.

There are five areas, which are not covered under the Roads to Resolution

progra.111, and they are as follows.

57

## 1.1. "claim for worker's compensation or unemployment insurance" (Roads to

# Resolution, 1999).

1.2. "claims for health insurance benefits or benefits related to retirement or

other benefit claims covered by the Employee Retirement Income Security

## Act" Roads Act" (Roads to Resolution, 1999).

1.3. "claims by the company or the employee for a restraining order to other

relief for unfair competition, used of trade secrets or confidential

information, or relating to the terms of a non-compete agreement" (Roads to

# Resolution, 1999).

1.4. "any claims arising from an employee's individual employment agreement

that are covered under a dispute resolution clause in that agreement; and"

# (Roads to Resolution, 1999).

1.5. "any clairns expressly excluded by law'' (Roads to Resolutior1, 1999).

What Roads to Resolution does is limits legal action against the company, which

could end up as a costly lawsuit for both sides. At the same time, should the company

have lost, the possibility exits that Prudential would have paid fees ranging from the low to

mid hundred thousand dollar mark, in addition to their attorney fees and research. It was

stated in the literature review a court case involved The Prudential Insurance Company of

America, where the company lost. Prior to the lawsuit, Prudential had mandatory

arbitration process; meanii,g court action could not be taken. If court action were taken,

it would be against company policy. An employee challenged this and the 9th Circuit

58

Court of Appeals ruled in 1994, that The Prudential Insurance Company of American

could not subject their employees to a mandatory arbitration process, which is denying

employees the ability to seek other available avenues. Courts do favor alternative dispute

resolution programs but not mandatory programs. In fairness, there are companies that

have such (mandatory arbitration) programs in place.

# Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

## The Equal Employment Opportunity Commission (EEOC) is another avenue that

employees have to settle discrimination and other work related issues, including wrongful

## discharge. "Congress has authorized the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission

(EEOC) to enforce compliance with the act's provisions against discrimination in

employment, and to work with state and local fair employment practices agencies in their

enforcement of related antidiscrimination laws" (Dod!!e. 1997. n. 431 ). The nmnbers of

;, r

- / -

- ---

,

7

complaints have risen over the past years however; this should not deter any person from

pursuing a claim.

An employee who feels they were the victims of discrimination may go to the

EEOC and based off filing a claim in good faith, he or she initiates an investigation

process. Sometimes employees have a reasonabie expectation that the employer will

retaliate against them. The phrases engaging in protective activity is utilized by the EEOC

for person( s) who meet a certain criteria. Protective activity is, "filing a charge,

pa.."'iicipating in an. investigation, protesting discr1IT.iination or requesting a reasonable

accommodation - may not be retaliated against as long as their conduct is reasonable and

59

based on good faith belief that the challenged practices are unlawful" (Zachary, 1998, p.

21). Not only are the individuals directly involved protected, yet this protection extends

to persons that are not a member of class protected by law (Zachary, 1998). For instance,

a white male that complains about the retaliation against an African American male is also

protected. The extension goes further to include those who may associate with the person

who is protected, and this could mean a spouse or a family member.

In an effort to affect future policy and court decisions, EEOC has produced an

"internal guidance stating that so-called contingent workers provided by outside staffing

agencies or technical contract firms are to be generally considered employees - not

independent contractors - of the client company'' (Reynold, 1998, p. 10). In essence, the

temps who are paid by a temp agency but working on the property of another company

are subject to the same employment protection as the employee for the company. What

this means is that an employee may sue the temp agency or the compa.lly they are assigned

or both parties, if they feel they were discriminated against. The discrimination could be

age, sex, disability, equal pay, a non bona fide occupational qualification, religion or

national origin. Staffing agencies are a rising source of employees from employers, which

is why the EEOC wants to ensure that employers have a clear guidance laws apply to this

# workforce (contingent workers).

To help clarify a workers status, EEOC has set place factors it shall use to

determine if someone is covered and they are delineated below. If the criteria are met then

the employee can. file a retaliation charge against the staffing firm or Client Company.

1.1. The work being done does not require a high level of skill or experience;

60

1.2. The work is performed on the staffing firm or client's premises;

1.3. There is a continuing relationship between the worker and the staffing firm

# or client;

1.4. The staffing firm of client sets the hours of work and duration of the job;

1.5. The worker is paid by the hour, week or month rather than for the agreed

cost of performing a particular job;

1.6. The worker has no role in hiring and paying assistants;

- 1. 7. The work performed is part of the regular business of the staffing firm or

# Client Company;

1.8. The worker is not engaged in his/her own distinct business or occupation;

1.9. The staffing firm or client company can discharge the worker (Reynold,

1998).

EEOC recognizes three elements to a retaliation claims, "protected activity;

# opposition to discrimination or participation in the statutory complaint process, adverse

# action and causal connection between the protected activity and the adverse action

("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998). Here the EEOC recognizes there are employees

filing a claim as the charging party (CP) and the agent of the employer as the respondent

(R). The EEOC is seeking evidence to determine if the charging party communicated

directly or indirectly to the respondent or another covered party that the actions in

questions was a violation of age discrimination employment act, equal pay act or

American with Disability. A follow up question deals with the reasonableness of the

61

opposition and if was not reasonable, then the charging party is not protected ("EEOC

Compliance Manual" 1998). Along the lines of reason, the question becomes did the

charging party have good faith to believe the opposed practice violated discrimination

laws? If this is the case, the charging party is protected against retaliation. If the charging

party filed a complaint as a result and participated in any investigation of statutes enforced

by the EEOC, again the charging party is protected.

In the matter of adverse action the focus shifts to the respond and any action taken

as a result of charges by the charging party. Here, the question becomes did responded

give an unfavorable reference to a potential employer and did the employee end their

employment? The EEOC is seeking evidence from the respondent that his or her action

was motivated as a direct result of the charging party actions. Now with e-mail widely

used, it is possible that the intent of the respondent adverse action may have been

transmitted to another person whom they feel comfortable with disc11ssing snch matters.

The third element is based on the direct and indirect action taken by the charging

# party in a casual connection.

It is also critically to analyze how the respondent reacts to

other employees that are performing the same work. Direct evidence would be the

respondent's expressing a biases against the charging party based on the activity in

question. Furthermore, the respondent can also use circumstantial evidence to determine

adverse action. The premise of this deals with the motive behind any action that may

appear to be adverse by the respondent against the charging party.

Ifthere is evidence of

a difference of treatment and it ca., be proven, then adverse action against the charging

party was present. If these above mentioned elements are present and the charging party

62

fears irreparable harm, the EEOC can seek temporary relief, pending the final investigation

# ("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998).

The basis for filing a charge, he or she alleges retaliation under Title VII, age

## discrimination employment act, and equal pay act, Americans with Disability. The

charging party can also argue that they were treated differently for filling a charge. For

example a person who is with any physical disability can allege retaliation based on their

activity with a person who has a disability ( association with a member of a protected

group). It is also permitted for the charging party to file a relation claim against the

# supervisor, as well as the employer.

It is important to give a few examples and state how the EEOC views an activity

as being protected or not. This can serve, as a guide for those employees who wish to

pursue this method or dealing with work related issues that could not be resolved

internally. Some employee may utilize EEOC as opposed to speaking with an internal

Equal Employment Office EEO; fear of loyalties and some companies may not have an

EEO. Also, an employee can access the EEOC compliance manual on the internet

http://www.eeoc.gov/. Lets deal with opposition, adverse action and casual connection.

All examples one through six, listed below are from the perspective of the EEOC and how

they would rule on such matters.

1.1. The female employee states to her supervisor, raise my pay or I will

file a lawsuit under the Equal Pay Act or comparative state law; an example

## 1.2. "A request for a reasonable accommodation of a disability constitutes

protected activity under Section 503 of ADA. Although a person making

## such a request might not literally "oppose" discrimination or "participate" in

the administrative or judicial complaint process, s/he is protected against

retaliation for making the request" ("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998).

1.3. Charging party who is female is interested in a position with the

accounting department which requires a CPA license, which she does not

have, yet her competition who is male, has a license. Charging party informs

her supervisor that she was discriminated against because of her gender.

Charging party new it was essential to have a CPA to perform the job. In

this situation charging party did not engage in protected opposition and

there was no good faith and no reason to believe she was rejected because of

her gender ("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998). I would like to add the

CPA can be classified as a bona fide occupation qualification, and based on

this perspective, charging party does have a case.

1.4. "Charging party filed a charge alleging that he was racially harassed by

his supervisor and co-worker. After learning about the charge, CP's

manager asked two employees to keep CP under surveillance and report back

about his activities. The surveillance constitutes an ''adverse action" that is

likely to deter protected activity, and is unlawful if it was conducted because

64

1.5. A female who files a charge claiming she was denied a position as a result of

her gender. At lunchtime a few weeks later, her supervisor invites some

employees to lunch with the exception of her. Charging party believes that

she was excluded based on her filing an EEOC charge. If the supervisor in

question decides not invited charging party based of the charge filed this

does meet the criteria for retaliation because there is no reasonable action

likely to deter protected activity.

1.6.

Charging party files a charge against respondent A, alleging that her

supervisor sexually harassed her and discharged her. The respondent was

sued by charging party and a settlement was reached. Afterwards, in

applying for a new position with respondent B, she received an offer that

based on reference check. Respondent B called Respondent A. The former

supervi_sor states that the ch::irging p::irty was a troublerrmlcer that -filed a sexual

harassment lawsuit. Based off this reference B did not hire the

employee in question. However, foul play was suspected based on her

former supervisors reference. She then files a retaliation charge against A

and B. During the EEOC investigation evidence is found by means of

memos and phone conversation between A and B. The notes obtained

clearly prove that A told B about protected activity and that a negative

reference was given based on protected activity. B gave a conditional job

offer pending a reference check and later pulled the offer after learning about

65

protected activity is strong circumstantial evidence ofB's retaliation

# ("EEOC Compliance Manual" 1998).

Each organization may have a different internal mechanism in place to address

employment related issues. The mechanisms are designed to assist the employee to rectify

inappropriate behavior deemed by the company or work through the complexities of an

issue to assure fundamental fairness. Some companies may have a dispute resolution

program in place; whether voluntary or mandatory. Again, some employees may not feel

comfortable using internal avenues, which the author highly suggests for any person.

Also, some employers, according to the size of a company, may not have any outlets for

the employee. Communication between the parties involved is vital, in an effort to prevent

escalated work issues that may result in termination. The communication climate may

prevent such dialogue to take place, or if the employee has been discharged, then other

avenues do exist. A person has the option to file a complaint with the EEOC, take legal

action, utilize the internal mechanisms in place, or do nothing.

In summation, an employee can utilize the internal mechanism within their

organization to resolve employment issues. Employees of the Student Union can utilize

the Grievance Procedures. At Host Marriott, the employees can seek the assistance of

their union representative, since they are bound by a union contract. A union

representative can look at the facts and determine the merits of management's actions.

Employees at The Prndential Insuran.ce Compar,y of America can utilize Roads to

Resolution. These three organizations have designed an internal mechanism that seeks to

66

be fair and allow the employee to work through the problem and eventually reach a

# resolution.

External mechanisms, such as the EEOC and the courts exist for all employees. The

EEOC is designed to assist employees with issue regarding termination and other

employment matters. An employee also has the option to bring a work related suit in a

court oflaw. However, some companies have mandatory binding arbitration, which may

prohibit EEOC or court action as the first step. These are internal and external mechanism

# (arbitration, court, union representative, Grievance Procedures, Roads to Resolution, and

others not listed), which an employee can access, to solve employment issues.

The courts are the final arbiters of societal conflict

67

# Chapter Five

# Preventative Measures

After reviewing court cases and examining various actions taken by employers and

employees in regards to termination, the next logical step is offering ways to avoid

wrongful termination suits. As stated, no employer can stop an employee from filing a

lawsuit conversely, what should be done is to diminish the legitimacy of a lawsuit.

Agents of the employer must recognize, they are not above wrongful termination suits,

now or in the future. Even if the company has a mandatory arbitration agreement program

in force, such a program can be challenged. In The Prudential Insurance Company of

American v Lai, the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down the mandatory arbitration

agreement in December of 1994. Given the business climate and the rise in employment

lawsuits and complaints, a business should review their policies and procedures and

establish guidelines their busi.11ess can utilize. Next, after an internal review of policies a.rid

procedure or establishing new guidelines, all managers must undergo an extensive training

program. If a person who has the authority to request a discharge or carry out the order,

they must know the organizations guidelines, procedures and laws. This applies to

# nonprofit organizations, public agencies and for profit business and any organization that

has the capacity to terminate a person.

68

# Training

Training all persons within management in regards to the law should be a

requirement. It is taken for granted; since an employee may have had past managerial

experience he or she knows all aspect of management. There are managers that have

never terminated an employee and those who have on numerous occasions. At the

## University Student Union (USU), the Executive Director, Debra L. Hammond had a

training session with all persons (students and full time staff) who supervised employees.

As a student supervisor, the author was in attendance for the training session. The

Personnel Director, Anna and Debra conducted the training session; they went over the

# progressive disciplinary procedures, evaluation, and hiring and termination process. These

four categories listed above if done incorrectly can end up in court. We covered how to

correctly document an employee with discipline problems and were asked questions at

random. A_s apart of t!iis session, we were given packets of LnÂ£orn1ation that v .. v1e could

take back to our business unit. Naturally, some of the questions asked received incorrect

answers. This entire session was created to have employees in management act in concert

when addressing these critical personnel issues. Debra also stated her expectations to

everyone, of what she does and does not want to see in documentation regarding

## termination action, discipline and an employee evaluation.

## At the USU, Kristen Picher, the Associate Director of Operations assisted the

author with our departments hiring procedures. After Kristen became confident of the

author's abilit-yto ask appropriate questions, which were not a violation of any iaws,

Kristen allowed the author to conduct the entire hiring, recruiting and training process.

69

Kristen's involvement was approving the final candidates that the author recommended in

writing and meeting with each person selected. Understanding the importance of an

excellent training program that is rooted in the law, followed by company policies, the

author assisted those who aspired to take a supervisor position. In this training program,

the author did not focus on management styles, for they were already managers in their

current positions (not directly over any particular set of employees) but on the laws and

company policies. Simply, the author stated what is necessary for an evaluation, hiring,

termination, discipline and budget preparations. All three employees were promoted to a

supervisor position and have done extremely well.

When the author started at Host Marriott Services Corporation, new employees

(managers) were hired in groups of seven. Each class of managers went through two

weeks of in class training before being transferred into the field. After the in class training,

the group was then individually assigned to a business ll!lit for one month to become

familiar with the business operations. After the month was completed, the group then

became individually assigned to a permanent location. As apart of each groups overall

training program, the manager had tailored training covering union contracts, discipline,

inventory, cost control and other areas deemed essential by the company. This part of the

training started after the managers were assigned to a business unit and completion of all

training programs was mandatory. After the first round, the group progressed to the next

round, which added new areas and went into more depth for topics covered at the first

# level.

70

Marriott has a well thought out proactive business plan for all new managers. This

approach realized that some managers have more management experience than others

however; the company will not assume that just because a person occupied a managerial

title in the past, they know the law. Also, some businesses have their own way of

conducting ordinary business issues and each newly hired employee needed to know the

approach of that business. Further, as a result of this on going intensive training, the

group improved on leadership abilities and was held accountable for their actions. In

addition, the number of complaints, violation or misunderstanding of the union contract,

decreased. This is a model approach to training managers, which can potentially lead to a

decrease in lawsuits filed by at-will employees. The mere fact that the training is on going

and recapitulated over time keeps all managers aware of company policies and the laws

that pertain to the business. Unfortunately, all businesses do not train their managers,

such nractices are nreventive measmes .

In regards to The Prudential Insurance Company of America, the author can only

speak on the division in which the author works. The Policyonwer Relation Department

was recently created for a temporary project ( class action lawsuit) with an undefined

completion date (which can not be determined by the company and or the courts). What

author does know, employees are promoted to a supervisor capacity, called team leaders

based on their past production, being the primary factory. Within this department,

everything is about production for front line employees, team leaders, associate managers

a.,d managers. Production is beii1g defined the ability to produce X amount of specified

work on average per hour, per day, per week. Those who are promoted to team leaders

71

are given no training and in some cases have no experience in management. Any advice

given to a team leader appears to be based off what needs to be accomplished, resulting

from a particular situation. The corporate objective is having business issues handled by

this department completed as fast as possible therefore, structured management training is

not provided. Such practices as these can cause harm to the organization in the long run.

Employees in this department range from undergraduate students,

junior college students,

graduate students, law school students, those taking a career break, persons in retirement

and those that have not attended college or involved in any career. Despite the fact that

this workforce is here because of schooling or career break does not mean, they will not

take action if they feel they were wrongful discharged. The company should run training

programs for all team leaders and recapitulate issues for associate manager who have also

had some or no management experience.

Below are steps m1y business can do, as preventive measures to protect thew.selves

and the business, should a case come to court or the Equal Employment Opportunity

# Commission.

1.1. When dealing with hiring and firing get everything in writing. "Many

oral agreements are enforceable" (Bordwin, 1998, p. 51 ). Keep in

mind that juries are comprised mostly of employees as opposed to

employers. These juries can have sympathy for an employee bring suit

against the employer. Therefore, written records are essentiaL from

## the begiiuring to the end of the employment relationship.

72

1.2. When recruiting and hiring beware of language used in your

advertisement. Also be cognizant of any protected class under federal

and state statutes. In regard to gender-segregated ads, avoid them,

unless they are a bona fide occupational qualification (BFOQ).

1.3.

If you are an at-will employer, do not use words such as "permanent"

## or "life time employment" (Bordwin, 1998).

1.4. Avoid timing traps, which is discharging an employee "at a particular

point in time, which then becomes the basis of a lawsuit. For example;

employee is fired shortly after events such as the following: engaging

in a "protective activity" such as union activities; reporting OSHA

## violations, other legal violations or "whistle-blower" disclosure or

complaints" (Borden, 1998). A termination near any of the events would

inform the courts the real reason for a dismissal as opposed to m1y

"good reason" stated (Bordwin, 1998).

1.5.

In respect to evaluations, they should be fair and impartial. In

addition, the evaluation is a valid tool for measuring motivation and

intelligence (Rosen, 1992, p. 11 ).

Before an evaluation is given, it should be reviewed and approved by

another manager who is familiar with the job duties (preferably).

1.6.

For CEO's, ifhe or she is on a contract for three to five years, which

is the term pro~,sion, along side may be aii evergreen provision

(always has three years to run), meaning revisable each year (after the

third) to add an additional year. Added to this type is a performance

clause, meaning, they will carry out the duties and functions to the best

of their ability (Webster, 1993, p. 101). In regards to termination, the

association should be limited in its ability to terminate the contract

before it expires (Webster, 1993). It would not be harmful to add a

phrase dealing with limitations of a CEO' s contract, such as for cause.

Fair warning rule No. 1. it has been said that being honest and direct can be

difficult but may be necessary. By being straight forward and direct

prevents message distortion by placing the employee on alert (Gerencher,

1999, p. 77). This direct approach limits any ambiguity and allows the

employee to rectify the problem, ifhe or she desires to stay.

Preventive measure should be used to reduce any possibility of

termination. This starts with the i.nitial !riri_11g of employee with a

rigorous hiring process. All preventive measure will not stop an

employee who may be a troublemaker, yet it will reduce such

problems. Going further, there should be supportive mechanism in

place to detect problems and assist employees when need. It would

help if a progressive discipline process were in placed and followed by

# all of management.

Employers should incorporate the at-will standard into all employment

policy documentation. Also, disclaimer should be used in handbooks,

manuals or in any document containing similar information.

74

Here, the key verbiage is that no statements are intended to be a binding

# contract.

1.10. Educate employees both new and existing about termination and

disciplinary action. Recapitulation what is and is not acceptable in

## regards to the business and any applicable federal and state laws. As

stated in the section regarding Host Marriott training, their entire staff

that were not union employees, were management and upper

management that continuously went over policies and procedures.

This ensures an educated workforce that can be held accountable,

because training on such matters was ongoing.

1.11.

It is also said to have employees sign form( s) stating they have read

the handbook and understand the contents, plus had an opportunity for

clarification if needed. This is also beneficia 1 in the event of ::i l:iws11it

to have such documentation on file. Consequently, one must ask, will

an employee remember the information a year from now or of three,

based on the duration of employment? If this is used (signing a form),

it must be realistic, and not used against an employee down the road to

discredit the iegitimacy of the charged or their credibility. Should this

acknowledge page be utilized, the employer should have reminders on

the key contacts of this document. It is not reasonable to have an

## employee sign such a docwTient without reviewin.g key elements as

deemed by the organization.

75

1.12. Voluntary arbitration is an option for companies to explore, which

allows for a quick and effective way of resolving issues that could

# potentially manifest into lawsuits.

1.13. Many legal problems arise because employers neither develop a

written policy regarding workplace searches or provide employee with

adequate notice about searches" (Brady, 1995, p. 18). Employers

should post notices in regards to searches if they apply and or other

written notice dealing with employment issues. These written policies

and procedures should be placed in the employee handbook and

reviewed by a Human Resources representative and or an employment

# law attorney.

1.14. A legal audit is when an attorney who specialized in employment law goes

over all of the companies polices ::inci procec!mes,

# ::ictim1S ::incl

documentation to spot legal problems before they arise (Frieson, 1999).

This action taken by companies can be helpful in avoiding lawsuits.

The central theme in most of the stated preventive measures is to have information

## in writing and at locations where employees can easily access the information.

Consistency among management is paramount when dealing with discipline and

termination procedures. A company has an option to seek advice from attorneys and

HU1ufu1 Resources representatives. Some of preventive measures cost money and other

do not, yet one may determine the cost for a legal audit every three years, compared to

76

paying punitive damages, back wages and other fees that may be assessed in a lawsuit.

Most of the companies listed in the lawsuits presented are not your average sole

proprietorship, or partnership conversely, they are mid size to large corporations. This

being a reality, executive staff members should find out about inconsistencies and mandate

that all managers comply with corporate policy, not allowing the termination of employees

for race, age, sex, sexual orientation, disability, religion and stating company downsizing

# as a pretext for termination.

In short, this portion of the study shows that preventive measures range from legal

audits every other year to training the entire management staff. A well-trained

management staff at the start of their employment would ensure they are following the

# correct steps in accordance with company policies and applicable laws. Additional

preventive measures include properly training employees, and notifying them of company

policies and procedure that may be in the form of a handbook, which sho11ld have a

disclaimer. An employee handbook does not have to be document to be feared, it can be

effective, is written correctly. Further, establishing some written policies that are essential

for a business would be beneficial to ensure consistency across the board for businesses

that have nothing in place. Any preventive measure can only benefit the employer and

employee in assisting them to solve problems on the job as they arise, rather than let them

manifest into other complex issues. This study has shown that preventive measures can

only help in reducing employment related suits that could possible end up in court.

77

# Chapter Six

# Concluding Thoughts

At the onset ofresearching this subject, it was the author's contention that

termination was conducted incorrectly due to the lack of knowledge oflaws and

internal company procedures. Consequently, this is partially correct based on the case

study approach rooted in case law, it has become apparent that another significant

factor has come into play. The cases presented have defendants ranging from

managers to executives who have full knowledge of company policies and procedures,

using a pretext (bad performance) for termination, or simply do not terminate

according to company policies. Moreover, the agents of the employer are defending

the termination based on at-will employment status, and are finding another method to

force employees out of their positions. This essentially proves that they aie

knowledgeable and have the ability to terminate any employee correctly. Training

methods are critical, but they are only as effective as the manager( s) who view each

employee objectively, complying with company procedures and the law.

Employees may not have a full understanding of the complexities of

employment laws or the guidelines set forth by their employer, but they do posses a

general understand of fundamental fairness. Further, he or she has the intellectual

capabilities to determine if the termination process has been fair, or if their manager is

out to get them. It is this notion of fairness and lu1owledge of their pai-ticular busii1ess

operations, can lead the employee to a reasonable conclusion, if the termination has

78

been correct or incorrect. However, employment lawsuits and complaints are on the

rise because employees have a reasonable expectation they have not been treated

# fairly.

Various forms arbitration, mandatory and voluntary are also increasing. The

courts have side for and against for such practices. Yet, it is important to note

programs that have a mandatory arbitration process, are being struck down. It is only

in those programs where an employee challenges such a program, that we know if the

courts will continue to side with the employee. It is the positions of courts that

employees should be able to explore all avenues available. The courts are in

agreement on, voluntary arbitration, which allows the employee and employer to seek

a solution that may keep the employer/employee relationship intact. These voluntary

programs seek communication by addressing the issue at hand while limiting blame.

This approach, assists the employer and employee, in dealing with the situation

regardless of any difficulties or complexities involved.

Not all companies are able to have arbitration and or mediation, yet

alternatives do exist. Some companies still have unions and others may utilize a

Grievance Procedure or something similar. It is essential to remember the courts are

the final arbiters of societal conflict. Therefore, any legal action should be the last

alternative for an employee to consider. Reducing wrongful termination is only as

## good as a managers training, along with uniform compliance and professionalism

within an organization. Vlrongful tern1ination can be prevented, employers must

recognize that they can be sued, but can take preventive: measures to ensure that no
