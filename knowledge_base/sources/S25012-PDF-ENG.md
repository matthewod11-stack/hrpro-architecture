In the late 1940s an engineer named Taiichi Ohno began developing

the Toyota Production System, basing it on the Japanese principle

of kaizen, or continuous improvement. At Toyota it led to constant

small enhancements, with key suggestions coming from employees

at all levels in manufacturing. Rather than revolutionizing its

industry through bold, innovative, and risky endeavors, Toyota chose

incremental but relentless improvement. Today it’s the world’s largest

automaker, and the Toyota Production System continues to be a

model of how to manage processes across an enterprise. Some notable

concepts that emerged with it have enjoyed a long afterlife: worker

## empowerment, a focus on perpetual cost reduction, total quality

## management, just-in-time manufacturing, root-cause analysis, data-

## driven processes, and automation with a human touch (jidoka).

As more operations become digitized, kaizen—augmented by

## generative AI and other advanced technologies—is once again

reshaping process management. Now that features like natural-

language interfaces have made gen AI accessible to nontechnical

employees, it’s driving both large and small process changes. With

the help of AI, employees can synthesize data of all kinds, including

unstructured data. They can turn once-inscrutable masses of numerical

## information into insight-driven workﬂow improvements, continuously

increasing performance, reducing waste, and achieving higher levels of

quality. Rather than displacing humans, as gen AI is widely presumed

to do, kaizen 2.0 is moving them to the center of new machine-assisted

processes and achieving a long-held aspiration of much management

theory: putting business transformation in the hands of all employees.

But successfully reimagining business processes isn’t as easy as asking

ChatGPT to audit workﬂows. To get up to speed, leaders need to

learn which processes are ripe for algorithm-powered redesign and

understand how other companies have used gen AI to revamp them.

In this article, drawing on decades of experience providing advice to

clients about technology and innovation, we’ll describe how the best

companies are deploying gen AI. We’ll also introduce you to the future

of kaizen: one in which fully autonomous agents can act independently

to achieve goals, adapt strategies, analyze their environments, and

complete complex tasks. However, as with all technological adoption,

humans will remain the linchpin behind gen AI’s success and its ability

to improve business processes.

## Empowering Employees Throughout the Enterprise

Across industries from automaking to life sciences to consumer

products, and across functions from R&D to manufacturing to supply

chain management, gen AI is boosting employee empowerment in new

ways. At Mercedes-Benz, for instance, this is happening on the shop

## ﬂoor, in the supply chain function, and in software design.

The company’s MO360 Data Platform connects its passenger-car plants

worldwide to the cloud, enhancing transparency and predictability

across its production and supply chain operations and enabling the

deployment of AI and analytics on a global scale. “With the MO360

Data Platform, we democratize technology and data in manufacturing,”

## Jan Brecht, then the chief information oﬃcer of Mercedes-Benz

Group, noted earlier this year. “Data is becoming everyone’s business

at Mercedes-Benz. Our colleagues on the shop ﬂoor have access to

production and management-related real-time data. They can work

with drill-down dashboards and make data-based decisions.”

As more operations become digitized, kaizen—augmented by generative AI and other advanced technologies—is once again reshaping process management.

Using prompts in everyday language, rather than technical database

queries, a production employee can ask about assembly-line

bottlenecks or hard-to-notice opportunities for streamlining processes

and receive data-rich insights from the AI. Such insights amplify, rather

than replace, workers’ ability to generate improvements based on their

## own experience, powers of observation, and creativity.

The platform also helps teams identify bottlenecks in the supply

chain. Meanwhile, the company’s software developers are using

GitHub Copilot, the AI-powered assistant that turns natural-language

prompts into coding suggestions. This frees them up to spend more

time addressing complex process issues and integrating software

# development across the enterprise.

To make data use more democratic, the company is helping

people across the workforce acquire new qualiﬁcations in AI. The

HR department has established Turn2Learn, a program that gives

## frontline employees access to more than 40,000 courses on data and

AI, including extensive training in skills from prompt engineering

to natural-language processing. Thanks to generative AI, skilling

initiatives, and digital ecosystems like the MO360 Data Platform,

process change has gone from a niche technical skill to part of

employees’ everyday work experience at the company.

At the automaker Mahindra & Mahindra production teams can send

queries to gen-AI-driven virtual assistants and receive step-by-step

instructions for repairing industrial robots. That helps them quickly

resolve technical issues and reduce machine downtime. Bhuwan Lodha,

the head of AI at Mahindra Group, says the technology has signiﬁcantly

raised shop ﬂoor morale, delivering on the worker fulﬁllment that

# kaizen promises.

# Redesigning Scientific Processes

In the pharmaceutical industry, gen-AI-powered synthetic data is

helping workers create data-rich processes, reduce waste, speed up

analysis, and strengthen quality control. Take the drug inspection

process. Pharma companies rely on automated visual systems to detect

product defects. Unfortunately, the systems often generate false rejects,

slowing the workﬂow and initiating expensive do-overs. This happens

because the systems need to be trained with enormous amounts of

## images, but for many complex defects only a limited number of images

# exist.

To meet the challenge, Merck uses gen AI approaches (such as

## generative adversarial networks and variational autoencoders) to

develop synthetic defect-image data. According to Nitin Kaul, the

associate director of IT architecture, the gen-AI-enhanced system has

helped Merck “understand root causes of rejects, optimize processes,

and reduce overall false rejects across various product lines by more

than 50%.”

Drug discovery is also being transformed by gen AI. Absci, a drug-

development company, is now able to create and validate therapeutic de

## novo antibodies with a computer and zero-shot generative AI—in which

a machine-learning model recognizes and classiﬁes new concepts

without having any labeled examples. In other words the AI designs

antibodies that will bind to speciﬁc targets without using any training

data on antibodies known to bind those targets. Creating them via AI

instead of through trial and error could reduce the time it takes to get

new biologics into the clinic from as much as six years down to 18

months, while increasing their probability of success. Waste, as kaizen

has taught us, is not only a matter of materials but also a matter of time and eﬀort.

# Augmenting Creative Processes

Several leading consumer-products companies are harnessing cutting-

edge AI and digital technologies to catalyze the human creativity

that drives growth in the sector. At Colgate-Palmolive, employees are

now using gen AI to speed up the process of devising new product

formulations. Nestlé, Campbell’s, and PepsiCo are reportedly using a

gen AI platform that helps employees validate new product ideas and

do market research. Coca-Cola is experimenting with a platform that

combines the language capabilities of GPT-4 with DALL-E’s ability

to produce images based on text queries. The platform allows digital

artists to incorporate distinctive branded elements from the company’s

vast archives, giving them a canvas on which they can create original

artwork that will be used in billboard advertising.

Product and component design has long been a mix of art and science—

combining the experience and sensibilities of a designer with the rigor

of prototyping and testing. Across industries, gen AI is accelerating and

transforming numerous elements of the process: creating 3D models

of new ideas, suggesting modiﬁcations to designs, recommending

the materials to be used, optimizing costs, rapidly creating digital

prototypes, and identifying which ideas are most promising.

To what extent can such tools empower employees to improve creative

processes? Consider the case of a single research engineer at NASA.

Using commercially available AI software, Ryan McClelland reinvented the design process for specialized one-oﬀ parts at NASA’s Goddard

Space Flight Center, in Greenbelt, Maryland. Few organizations make

## more one-of-a-kind components to more-exacting standards than the

space agency. These components can be critical in everything from

astrophysics balloon observatories to atmosphere scanners, planetary

## instruments, space weather monitors, space telescopes, and even the

# Mars Sample Return mission.

In McClelland’s new process a computer-

assisted-design specialist starts with a

# mission’s requirements and draws in the

surfaces where the part will connect to an

# instrument or a spacecraft—as well any

# bolts and ﬁttings for other hardware and

electronics. The designer might also have

to block out a path for a laser beam or an

# Alanah Sarginson

optical sensor. “The algorithms do need a

human eye. Human intuition knows what

looks right,” McClelland notes. “Left to itself the algorithm can

sometimes make structures too thin.” Under the supervision of expert

human engineers, the AI then produces complex structure designs in as

little as an hour or two. In traditional mechanical design, coming up

with a design and analyzing it might take a week, followed by more

iterations until an expert assesses the design for manufacturability. So it

can take months of work to arrive at a solution. The structures designed

with AI may look a little weird, but they are two-thirds lighter and 10

times less subject to stress than components created by the traditional

# design process.

# Animating Physical Operations

Gen AI is also transforming the ways humans interact with complex

## physical systems, from robots to the human body to organizations like

# hospitals.

Stuttgart-based Sereact, a provider of AI-based software that automates

warehouse operations, has pioneered the ﬁrst commercially available

solution that uses the transformer technology underlying ChatGPT to

enable robots to understand natural language. The robots, trained on

billions of simulated images, perform “pick and pack” tasks, which

typically account for 55% of warehouse costs. Called PickGPT, the

technology allows human operators to simply type text commands into

a chat interface; users with no technical expertise can direct and debug

the system. Ralf Gulde, the CEO, calls it “the world’s most accessible way

of interacting with robots.”

What’s next? The convergence of gen AI and digital twins, already

underway, provides a glimpse of a future in which continuous process

improvement becomes even more democratic. Digital twins are used to

model complex systems—such as jet engines, wind turbines, factories,

and human hearts—and simulate their functioning with an accuracy

that allows users to remotely create solutions to any problems that

arise (and often before problems arise). Digital twins can be used to

make production processes more eﬃcient, improve quality, increase

operational performance, and create more-robust and -resilient supply

# chains.

Consider how twins are used in healthcare. Some 90% of the world’s

top drug and healthcare laboratories already employ them in areas like

preclinical drug development. Atlas Meditech has built a platform that

lets surgeons practice on a virtual brain that matches the patient’s

brain in size, shape, and lesion position. Digital twins of hospitals

are used to make day-to-day decisions about staﬃng, operations, and

bed management. A hospital can also use its twin to stress-test the

## organization against future scenarios like an earthquake with mass

casualties. Researchers foresee the day when digital twins will be used

to deliver precision medicine, diagnose diseases, and predict health and

# disease outcomes.

With gen AI now poised to expand the capabilities of digital twins,

including by adding natural-language interfaces, we imagine that

many more healthcare workers will have the tools to adapt processes

and almost instantly respond to new needs, a giant step forward for

# continuous improvement.

# Autonomous Agents

The new AI agents take kaizen to a new level, not only oﬀering advice

but making decisions, taking action, and improving processes on their

own. They range from simple chatbots to self-driving cars to robotic

systems that can run complex workﬂows autonomously.

Consider DoNotPay, a company that aims to help consumers save

money by performing a range of tasks from contesting parking tickets

to canceling time-share memberships. Until recently, DoNotPay simply

identiﬁed opportunities for customers to save money and encouraged

them to act. But then the company integrated GPT-4 and AutoGPT into

its software. The ﬁrst user of these new features was DoNotPay’s CEO.

He gave the agent access to his ﬁnancial accounts and prompted it with

a concise yet complex command: Find me money. The agent discovered

$81 in unnecessary subscriptions and an unusual $37 in-ﬂight Wi-Fi fee. Then it oﬀered to automatically cancel the subscriptions, drafted

a letter to contest the Wi-Fi charges, and checked in with the CEO

for review. As icing on the cake, it even drafted and sent emails that

negotiated a 20% reduction in the CEO’s cable and internet bill.

Gen AI is transforming the ways humans interact with complex physical systems, from robots to the human body to organizations like hospitals.

Traditional software is driven by precise, rule-based instructions and

programmed to produce predictable outcomes. That signiﬁcantly limits

its ability to act autonomously. It lacks the capacity for humanlike

reasoning; decisions are hard-coded and don’t incorporate the nuanced

judgment and ﬂexibility characteristic of human thought. In contrast,

AI agents built on top of pretrained large language models are more

dynamic and adaptable because of their ability to understand language

and prompts. Agents built on multimodal foundation models have even

more capability because they can generalize and understand, operate

across, and combine many types of information simultaneously—text,

# code, audio, image, and video.

Autonomous agents exhibit three other similarities to human workers in

# kaizen-oriented settings:

Goal-oriented behavior. People set the goals, but AI agents act

independently to achieve them, adapting their strategies when

necessary. To do so, an agent can work across other software platforms

at a company and interact with other organizations’ software and

language models to execute tasks.

Logical reasoning and planning. AI agents perceive and analyze

their environments. They can break complex tasks down into their

component parts and use reason to ﬁgure out the best way to achieve

# their goals.

Long-term memory and reﬂection. AI agents draw on past interactions

to better understand intention and context. They learn from their

experience to get better at their jobs.

Across industries, many companies are now deploying AI assistants or

agents with varying degrees of autonomy. Walmart uses them to help

manage inventory. At Marriott International, they optimize booking

processes. At Nestlé, they improve supply chain processes. ADT is

building an agent that will help its millions of customers select,

order, and set up their home security systems. Toyota is developing

robot agents that could act as caregivers for elderly people or operate

## autonomously and smoothly in production processes on the factory

ﬂoor. JPMorgan Chase is developing autonomous agents that will

## perform complex multistep tasks in the near future.

Meanwhile, technology companies, from tech giants to smaller ﬁrms and startups, are oﬀering platforms and tools for creating

autonomous agents and systems. Microsoft’s AutoGen is an open-source

programming framework for building such agents and coordinating

them to perform tasks. It enables agents that can converse with other

agents and can help create both autonomous and human-in-the-loop

workﬂows. Meta’s React is a free, open-source JavaScript library for

building user interfaces, including with autonomous agents. Amazon

Web Services recently introduced Amazon Q, which helps users set

up semiautonomous AI agents that perform various tasks, including

writing and debugging code. Google’s Vertex AI Agent Builder and

Semantic Kernel open-source development kit also help you easily

build AI agents and integrate the latest AI models into your code

base. OpenAI’s Assistants API allows users to create agents within their own applications. The San Francisco–based startup LangChain oﬀers

an open-source framework for building applications based on large

language models. LlamaIndex helps users build context-augmented

gen AI applications, including autonomous agents and workﬂows.

GenWorlds provides a platform for creating environments where AI

agents interact with one another to execute complex tasks. MemGPT

enables agent chatbots that can learn about you and modify their own

# personalities over time.

Tech companies are also including autonomous agents in their product oﬀerings. Salesforce, for instance, sells Agentforce, a completely

autonomous AI agent that can understand the full context of customer

messages and independently resolve a broad range of service issues

without using preprogrammed scenarios the way traditional chatbots

do. (Most chatbots can handle only speciﬁc queries that have been

explicitly programmed into their system.)

# Ecosystems of Autonomous Agents

Completing some tasks requires more than a single agent. In those

cases companies may custom-build a system of agents wherein each

one is expert in a speciﬁc task. Take the mortgage-underwriting process.

When a human underwriter provides the instruction “Review this

loan application based on our company’s lending policies,” one agent

might extract relevant information from the application. Another agent

might act as a librarian of bank policies, making them available to

agents that compare the application against them. Yet another agent

might generate a ﬁnal report, recommending a course of action to the

underwriter considering the loan. A “connector” agent might oversee

and orchestrate the activity of all these agents.

Combining multiple agents and allowing them to communicate and

collaborate with one another is critical to the development of AI systems

that can autonomously manage end-to-end processes. Such solutions

could transform entire functions like supply chain management,

production, and marketing. At ﬁrst glance, this might seem to be

about achieving automation on a huge scale (and more fuel for sci-ﬁ

fantasists fearing world domination by AI). But the real story here is the

## opportunity for continuous improvement in the tradition of kaizen.

Consider an experiment conducted by researchers from Google and

Stanford in 2023. They created 25 digital human avatars, each endowed

with a distinctive personality and a back story, and set them loose in a

simulated online world. As the avatars interacted and went about their

daily “lives,” they created a credible facsimile of human behavior. They

made decisions based on their memory and past experiences, without

real human intervention. The ability to rely on memory and to reﬂect

on experiences and interactions like this is what enables agents to learn

from one another and create ecosystems that continuously improve

# processes.

In another recent experiment, researchers at Stanford demonstrated

that human-agent collaboration is a far more promising approach to

automating complex workﬂows than robotic process automation (RPA),

the most widely used technology. RPA is essentially a bot, hard-coded

to perform a set of actions according to predeﬁned rules. Lacking

generalized reasoning and planning abilities, bots are easily tripped up

## by the variations and exceptions that inevitably crop up in complex

processes. They’re also expensive to set up and hard to maintain in the

face of changing conditions.

The ﬁrst workﬂow the researchers experimented with was revenue

cycle management at a hospital. Most hospitals have departments that

## handle timely payment collection, patient insurance veriﬁcation, prior

authorization, and claims processing. A second experiment involved

invoice processing at a large B2B enterprise, which was similarly

complex, given the many contracts with widely varying conditions that

the company dealt with. Most of the work in the two processes was still

manual, despite attempts to automate it.

To overcome the limitations of RPA, the researchers employed a

multimodal foundation model that learned from humans by watching

video demonstrations and reading documents, greatly reducing set-up

costs. The model, which encompassed a variety of agents executing diﬀerent tasks, identiﬁed every step of each workﬂow with 93%

accuracy. It leveraged its reasoning and visual-comprehension abilities

to formulate plans of action, monitored itself and corrected errors, and

## HBR / Spotlight / The Secret to Successful AI-Driven Process Redesign

successfully identiﬁed the completion of a workﬂow with 90% precision

and 84% recall. Those results suggest that the model could automate

entirely new categories of workﬂows, such as those that contain hard-

to-describe steps, require complex decision-making, or are knowledge-

# intensive.

As it executes a workﬂow, the researchers’ model observes the eﬀects

of its actions and can compile a database of skills that can be

transferred to other workﬂows. Though the goal was to achieve minimal

human intervention, the researchers found that human integration into

processes was critical: Humans were needed to ensure alignment with

overall objectives, optimize models for interactions with people, and

provide training and feedback to the agents.

. . .

As the Stanford research illustrates, though AI agents act on our

## behalf and in concert with one another, that doesn’t mean that

humans are out of the loop. Success with artiﬁcial intelligence will

depend as much on people as it does on technology. While employees

optimize agent models for human interaction, the agents will make

## decisions and operate with a greater degree of autonomy. Agents will

constantly improve as they gain experience, and the humans overseeing

the process will continually reﬁne their design and performance.

When both employees and AI agents are empowered, continuous

improvements will be generated on both sides of the human-machine

# equation.

Even in the face of increasing machine autonomy, processes remain

human-centered. In the coming age of autonomous agents, that will be

one of the keys to kaizen.
