HBR Staff; Gary Yeowell/Getty ImagesLast weekend I hiked 17 miles through the Mahoosuc Mountainregion in Maine. With 30 pounds of gear strapped to my back, Icrossed forests and streams, climbed 4180 feet up the slipperyshoulder of Old Speck, and descended through overgrown woodsto a campground beside the Bear River.It was a

four-day, three-night adventure filled with sunburns,mosquitoes, and wet, uneven ground. At one point, I woke in themiddle of the night to the pitch-black walls of my tent, startled bythe sounds of thunder and showering rain.

There were points when I wanted to give up and be back in thecomfort of my apartment, wrapped in a blanket with a glass ofwine, watching the storm through my living room window. Butthere were also moments of complete silence.

importance of having hobbies. The more I push myself to engagein new things, the more I discover about my identity and just howvast and layered it can be. When I return to my desk on Mondays,I sit down refreshed and resilient. I feel ready to focus on my nexttask, knowing that it’s just one part of my very full life.While getting outside is what works for me, I know it’s not foreveryone. So, this week, I want to encourage you to

# explore a

hobby that excites you — even if that

exploration is small. Googlepottery or fencing classes in your area, try out for your local rollerderby team, or join a Dungeons and Dragons club. Whateversounds interesting to you in this moment, explore it.
