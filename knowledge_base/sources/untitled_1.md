ABSTRACT—Goal-setting theory is summarized regarding the effectiveness of speciﬁc, difﬁcult goals; the relationship of goals to affect; the mediators of goal effects; the relation of goals to self-efﬁcacy; the moderators of goal effects; and the generality of goal effects across people, tasks, coun- tries, time spans, experimental designs, goal sources (i.e., self-set, set jointly with others, or assigned), and dependent variables. Recent studies concerned with goal choice and the factors that inﬂuence it, the function of learning goals, the effect of goal framing, goals and affect (well-being), group goal setting, goals and traits, macro- level goal setting, and conscious versus subconscious goals are described. Suggestions are given for future research.

There are four mechanisms or mediators of the relationship between goals and performance. High goals lead to greater effort and/or persistence than do moderately difﬁcult, easy, or vague goals.Goalsdirectattention,effort,andactiontowardgoal-relevant actionsattheexpenseofnonrelevantactions.Becauseperformance is a function of both ability and motivation, goal effects also dependuponhavingtherequisitetaskknowledgeandskills.Goals may simply motivate one to use one’s existing ability, may auto- matically ‘‘pull’’ stored task-relevant knowledge into awareness, and/or may motivate people to search for new knowledge. The latter is most common when people are confronted by new, com- plex tasks. As we will show, such searches may or may not be successful.

## KEYWORDS—goal setting; self-efﬁcacy; commitment; sub- conscious goals

Goal-setting theory (Locke & Latham, 1990, 2002) was devel- oped inductively within industrial/organizational (I/O) psy- chologyovera25-yearperiod,basedonsome400laboratoryand ﬁeld studies. These studies showed that speciﬁc, high (hard) goals lead to a higher level of task performance than do easy goalsorvague,abstractgoalssuchastheexhortationto‘‘doone’s best.’’ So long as a person is committed to the goal, has the re- quisite ability to attain it, and does not have conﬂicting goals, thereisapositive,linearrelationshipbetweengoaldifﬁcultyand task performance. Because goals refer to future valued out- comes, the setting of goals is ﬁrst and foremost a discrepancy- creating process. It implies discontent with one’s present con- dition and the desire to attain an object or outcome.

Goals are related to affect in that goals set the primary stan- dard for self-satisfaction with performance. High, or hard, goals aremotivatingbecausetheyrequireonetoattainmoreinorderto be satisﬁed than do low,or easy, goals.

Goals, in conjunction with self-efﬁcacy (task-speciﬁc con- ﬁdence; Bandura, 1997), often mediate or partially mediate the effects of other potentially motivating variables, such as per- sonality traits, feedback, participation in decision making, job autonomy, and monetary incentives.

Thekeymoderatorsofgoalsettingarefeedback,whichpeople need in order to track their progress; commitment to the goal, which is enhanced by self-efﬁcacy and viewing the goal as im- portant; task complexity, to the extent that task knowledge is harder to acquire on complex tasks; and situational constraints. With regard to the latter, Brown, Jones, and Leigh (2005) found that role overload (excess work without the necessary resources to accomplish a task) moderates goal effects; goals affected performance only when overload was low.

Goal-setting theory has high internal and external validity. As of 1990, support for goal-setting effects had been found on more than 88 different tasks, involving more than 40,000 male and female participants in Asia, Australia, Europe, and North America (Locke & Latham, 1990). Goal effects have been found inbothlaboratoryandﬁeldsettings,usingbothcorrelationaland experimental designs and numerous dependent variables. Time spans have ranged from 1 minute to 25 years and effects have been obtained at the individual, group, and organizational-unit levels. Goals are effective even when they come from different sources; they can be assigned by others, they can be set jointly through participation, and they can be self-set. In the latter instance, goals are a key element in self-regulation. Goal theory

constant), people who were made to view a situation as a threat (focus on failure) achieved signiﬁcantly lower performance than did those who were made to view the situation as a challenge (focus on success and the usefulness of effort).

We note eight categories of studies that have moved goal theory forward. (There is no logical order in the sections that follow.)

Goal Choice Previous research on goal choice showed that self-efﬁcacy, past performance, and various social inﬂuences affect the level at whichgoalsareset.Enlargingonthisworkandmovingitintothe realm of sports, Donovan and Williams (2003) found that track- and-ﬁeld athletes had two sets of goals, one for the season and one for the next competition. The athletes created discrepancies between past performance and future goals by setting their current season goals higher than their best previous perfor- mance. When large negative goal–performance discrepancies occurred in the current season, goals for the season were low- ered. However, goals for the next competition were typically raised in order to compensate for lower-than-desired seasonal progress.Therewasmoregoalrevisionifathletes attributedpast performance to unstable causes, such as effort, than if they attributed it to stable causes, such as ability.

Learning Goals Sometimes speciﬁc, difﬁcult goals do not lead to better perfor- mance than simply urging people to do their best (Seijts & Latham, 2001). Focusing on reaching a speciﬁc performance outcome on a new, complex task can lead to ‘‘tunnel vision’’— a focus on reaching the goal rather than on acquiring the skills required to reach it. In such cases, the best results are attained if a learning goal is assigned—that is, a goal to acquire the requisite task knowledge. Latham and Brown (in press), for example, found that entering MBA students who set speciﬁc difﬁcult learning goals (e.g., learn to network, master speciﬁc course subject matter) subsequently had higher GPAs and higher satisfaction with their MBA program than did people who simply set a distal (long-term or end) performance goal for GPA at the end of the academic year. We believe that a learning goal facilitates or enhances metacognition—namely, planning, monitoring, and evaluating progress toward goal attainment. Metacognition is particularly necessary in environments in which there is minimal structure or guidance.

Affect A 3-year study of people in managerial and professional jobs in Germany revealed that only those adults who perceived their goals as difﬁcult to attain reported a change in affect. Goal progress and goal importance were strong predictors of feelings of success and well-being. Among the most interesting ﬁndings wasthatlackofgoalattainmentinone’spersonal lifewasrelated to greater general well-being when the person experienced goal progress on the job. Evidently, success in one realm compen- sated for failure in the other (Wiese & Freund, 2005).

Group Goals Goal setting is effective with groups too. However, groups add a layer of complexity because goal conﬂicts may occur among the group’s members. Seijts and Latham (2000) examined the effects of conﬂict versus no conﬂict between an individual’s and a group’s goals. In a laboratory task involving monetary incentives, they found no main effect for goal setting. However, havinghighpersonalgoalsthatwerecompatible withthegroup’s goal enhanced group performance, whereas having personal goals that were incompatible with the group’s goal had a detri- mental effect on how well the group performed.

Another added feature of setting goals in groups is that task- relevant information may be shared among group members. In anunpublishedstudy,Lockeandhiscolleaguesfoundthatdyads that share information perform better on a complex management simulation than do dyads who share less. The sharing effect is enhanced if the people in the dyads have high goals.

DeShon, Kozlowski, Schmidt, Milner, and Wiechmann (2004) were the ﬁrst to compare goal effects on individuals versus on groups. On a radar-tracking simulation, the effect of individual goals on performance was fully mediated by task strategy and individualeffort.Group-levelgoaleffectsweremediatedonlyby team-relatedeffort.Feedbacktoindividualsledtoafocusonthe individual’s performance, whereas feedback to the team led to a focus on the team’s performance.

Framing Assigning hard goals may not be effective when people view thosegoals as threatening. The concept of framing is well known in psychology, and one type of framing is in terms of gain versus loss. Whether a person appraises a high goal as a challenge versusathreatmakesadifference forthat person’sperformance. Drach-Zahavy and Erez (2002) found that, when a task was altered to pose new challenges (but with goal difﬁculty held

Goals and Traits The effects of goal setting as a state on the effects of goal orientation as a trait were studied by Seijts, Latham, Tasa, and Latham (2004). People with a learning goal orientation tend to choose tasks in which they can acquire knowledge and skill. Those with a performance goal orientation tend to avoid tasks where others may judge them unfavorably due to possible errors they might make. Hence they tend to choose easy tasks in which theycanlookgoodintheeyesofothers. Seijtsetal.(2004)found that a speciﬁc high learning goal (state orientation) is effective in increasing a person’s performance regardless of their trait

orientation. Performance is highest on a complex task, however, when people have a learning goal orientation and also set a learning goal. In short, the beneﬁcial effect of a learning goal orientation can be attained by inducing it as a state.

# Passion

# Communicated Vision

LePine (2005) conducted another intriguing goal-setting and goal-orientation study, using a decision-making simulation to study the ability of teams to adapt to changing circumstances. When conditions changed so that team members had to change the way they communicated, the teams that adapted best were those that had high goals as well as a high score on a learning- orientation trait scale. Setting high goals was actually harmful if the teams scored low on the measure of learning orientation.

# Tenacity

# Goals

# Self- Efficacy

# Venture Growth

In an even more complex trait-mediation study conducted in the laboratory, Lee, Sheldon, and Turban (2003) found that an ‘‘amotivated’’ orientation (i.e., low conﬁdence in one’s cap- abilities) is associated with goal-avoidance motivation. This, in turn, is associated with lower goal levels and, thereby, lower performance. In contrast, a control orientation, meaning ex- trinsic motivation, is associated with both avoidance and ap- proach goals. The latter are associated with higher goal levels and higher performance. Autonomy goals, meaning intrinsic motivation, led to mastery goals. Mastery goals, in turn, en- hanced mental focus; so did approach goals, which, in turn, enhanced performance. This study illustrates how motivation can be measured at different levels of abstraction, with the more speciﬁc levels mediating the more general ones.

Macro-Level Goals Goal-setting research has also been extended from the group level to the level of the organization as a whole. A study of companies and their suppliers in China found that the re- lationship between a high level of a shared vision among em- ployees and low levels of dysfunctional opportunism was partially mediated by the setting of cooperative goals. A shared vision strengthened cooperative goal setting by drawing the boundary lines of the group around the two organizations involved—namely, the company and its suppliers—thereby reducing the negative feelings that frequently occur in alliances due to perceptions of in- versus out-groups.

Baum and Locke (2004) used a longitudinal design to study the performance of small-venture entrepreneurs over a 6-year period.Growthgoals,alongwithself-efﬁcacy andorganizational vision, were found to signiﬁcantly predict future growth. These three motivators completely mediated the effects on growth of two personality traits, passion for the work and tenacity (see Fig. 1). The role of goals and self-efﬁcacy as mediators of other motivators was also found in previous studies in which the individual was the level of analysis (Locke & Latham, 2002).

Typically, a goal, once accepted and understood, remains in the periphery of consciousness as a reference point for guiding and giving meaning to subsequent mental and physical actions.

Intriguing ﬁndings in social psychology by Bargh and Char- trand and others (e.g., see Bargh & Williams, 2006) suggest that even goals that are subconsciously primed (and participants report no awareness of the primed motive) affect performance. Consequently, Stajkovic, Locke, and Blair (in press) compared the effects of primed, subconscious, achievement goals with explicitlyassigned,conscious,performancegoalsinalaboratory setting. Both priming and conscious goals had independent effects on task performance, although the conscious goal had a larger effect size. Moreover, the two types of goals had an interaction effect. Primed subjects with hard and ‘‘do your best’’ goals had signiﬁcantly higher performance than did unprimed subjects withthe same goals. Priming, however,did notenhance the effects of easy goals. In a follow-up study, Stajkovic and Locke used a 2 (cid:1) 2 design in a proofreading task in which subconsciously primed speed goals and subconsciously as- signed accuracy goals were crossed with explicitly assigned speedandaccuracygoals.Thisenabledustoseewhathappened when subconscious goals were put in conﬂict with conscious goals. Using speed as the dependent variable, the two types of goalsshowedsigniﬁcantmaineffects,buttheypartlyneutralized one another when they were in conﬂict. However, the effect of conscious speed goals was markedly greater than that of sub- consciously primed speed goals. Subconscious priming had no effect at all on accuracy, but conscious goals had a strong effect.

# DIRECTIONS FOR FUTURE RESEARCH

Goals and Subconscious Priming To regulate behavior during goal-directed action, a consciously held goal does not have to be in focal awareness every second.

Goal setting can be used effectively on any domain in which an individual or group has some control over the outcomes. It has beenappliednotonlytoworktasksbuttosportsandrehabilitation

and can be applied in numerous other settings. The success of goal setting depends upon taking account of the mediators and moderators that determine its efﬁcacy and applicability.

Because goal setting is an open theory, there is no limit to the numberofdiscoveriesthatcanbemadeortotheintegrationsthat might be made between goal theory and other theories. Future research could include studies of the effects of different types of learning goals and ways of combining them with performance goals (e.g., learning goals ﬁrst, then performance goals), differ- enttypesofgoalframing(approachsuccessvs.avoidfailure),the relation between goals and cognition (which, by implication, entails all of cognitive psychology), goal hierarchies, and macro goal studies withorganizations of different sizes. More studies of the relationship between conscious and subconscious goals would also be of interest.
