For Sandy Speicher, CEO of IDEO, the current moment provides a rare

opportunity to question the larger structures of how and where we

collaborate, and to treat work as a learning lab.

HBR editor in chief Adi Ignatius sat down with Speicher, who took over

the global design firm two years ago, in this episode of our video series

“The New World of Work” to talk about:

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

- How design thinking can help us learn the most from our current

# workplace experiments

- How moments of disequilibrium—where you are forced to question

your mental models—can lead to progress

- What the workspaces of the future might look and feel like (hint: it

won’t be one-size-fits-all).

The offices of tomorrow may have more in common with a café or a

classroom or a maker space, Speicher says. It’s all about giving people a

“reason to come in rather than regulation to come in.”

“The New World of Work” explores how top-tier executives see the

future and how their companies are trying to set themselves up for

success. Each week, Ignatius interviews a top leader on LinkedIn Live —

previous interviews included Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella and former

PepsiCo CEO Indra Nooyi. He also shares an inside look at these

conversations —and solicits questions for future discussions — in a

newsletter just for HBR subscribers. If you’re a subscriber, you can sign

# up here.

ADI IGNATIUS: All right, so let’s let jump right in. I want to talk about

design thinking, but maybe you can make sure everyone’s up to speed

and give us the quick elevator pitch on what is design thinking?

SANDY SPEICHER: Sure. That’s actually a really great way to start

because we’re probably going to use the word design and design

thinking a lot in this conversation. A lot of people have a familiarity

with design from the things around them in their lives. You can think of

## an interior designer or a fashion designer, or maybe of graphic designers

or interaction designers. There are all different types of design and

design crafts, but underneath them all, they have something in common

about the way that they orient to the world.

Designers are orienting to create choices that shape our experiences

and that actually shape our future. And designers do that with

intentionality. So when we say design thinking, it’s a lot about the kind

of methods and mindsets, the orientation of a designer. How do we

bring the orientation of a designer to the questions that we’re asking?

And those questions can be huge. We can apply that mode of thinking,

that way of listening, that way of learning about other people and what

other people are experiencing, the needs that they have.

Basically be empathic to the needs of other people in order to then

imagine the kinds of experiences and environments that might exist

around them. And like I say, that can go from a thing in your hand, all

the way to the systems that we’re living in.

ADI IGNATIUS: That’s great introduction. So let’s talk about an

environment that’s relevant for this show, and that is the office. I feel

like we’ve gone through stages in terms of our thinking about what the

physical office should look like in order to help us collaborate, help us

innovate, help us build a culture. Forget hybrid for a second, but just

in terms of the physical office, where are we in terms of how we ideally

# design physical workspaces?

SANDY SPEICHER: I think where we are is in a really great moment

of design. Basically, there’s a lot of experimentation. There’s a lot of

questions. People have remapped their relationship with work and we

don’t quite know yet what that’s heading toward. And so right now

there’s a lot of experimentation. People are trying out different policies

around expectations for when people can be in the office.

I think that there are things that we do know. We do know that people

need each other. We do know that relationships really matter. And we

know that there are many, many ways to build relationships, and that

can happen in physical spaces, that can happen in virtual spaces. Many

leaders are starting to really think about how to optimize the office

space for what’s most necessary. Everything doesn’t have to happen in

# the office.

So basically, there’s a lot of experiments going on around, what do we

optimize around? Do we optimize around meaningful moments, the

times where we feel we really need to be together? Of course that’s

## different for all different types of companies.

I’ll tell you one of the things that we’re starting to think about is, what

can only uniquely be done in the physical spaces that we have? We’re

doing a lot of work around food and beverage. One of our offices has a

prototyping kitchen. We have machine shops. We have production areas

where we’re making things. And those really are a way to optimize the

space. So how can our spaces become even more of a learning lab for the

areas that we’re focusing on, building classrooms, building, like I say,

prototyping kitchens and other types of prototyping and build spaces?

So we’re kind of looking at how to turn those into the center of our

spaces so that there’s reason to come in rather than regulation to come

# in.

ADI IGNATIUS: You’re talking about the office place. I think what

you’re saying implicitly is the office isn’t necessarily conducive to

working more efficiently. This is my view: that we’ve learned how to

do that pretty effectively from home, many of us, white collar workers

anyway, knowledge workers. So then the office is where we get together.

Maybe the office is where we do culture, almost different from work. Is

that what you’re thinking? That the office, it’s maybe not even a place

for work as much as it is for interaction?

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

SANDY SPEICHER: Yeah, I guess what we see now is really about a

question of intentionality and every business is different, which means

that I think what we’re going to see is a lot more people designing what

their agreements are for how they want to work together.

For sure what we’ve all realized is that there is work that we can do from

all different types of environments. We can also build relationships in

different platforms, whether that’s physical or virtual. I almost made

up a word there combining them, but this year one of the things that

we’re really looking at is not just what’s the future of work where there’s

just one whole new way, but what are the many ways of working in

the future? At IDEO we call this FWOW, the Future Ways of Working,

because there are many, many different ways that we’ll be working. And

so, the office space becomes one of the things that we can design for

how we come together.

ADI IGNATIUS: I think you put your finger on what a lot of companies

are doing and that is really experimenting. We don’t really know what

we’re going to do in the future. I think most companies are saying,

“Well, we’re going to try something and then see how it goes.” From

your perspective, in terms of thinking about process, how do companies

design the best hybrid work model to learn from this experimentation

that’s going on?

SANDY SPEICHER: It’s such a good question because we risk right now

in the pressure of urgency, coming to new answers quite quickly or

thinking that we know what the best solution will be. When meanwhile,

times are really changing and people’s needs are changing. So there

is a lot of conversation out there about leaders and empathy and

how the role of the leader is really to listen and listen deeply right

now. Understand the needs of customers and also colleagues and use

that information to understand how to design the systems around us,

whether that’s the space or whether that’s our policies or whether that’s

our agreements for how we collaborate.

And of course, what you just said there around the word

experimentation, a good experiment is designed to teach us something.

And so how are we setting up those experiments knowing what we’re

looking to learn so that we can incorporate that and iterate on that over

time? This actually really requires a whole new dynamic relationship

across a workplace, and it’s quite exciting.

I think that as we see in the dynamics of the world today, everyone’s

really asking for an evolved relationship with work. That kind of

frame that you sort of have to be here 9:00 to 5:00, people are really

questioning that relationship, understanding that they can still be really

effective at their work, but have a lot more flexibility and agency in their

days. So really, I think the major principle that should underlie all of the

experiments that we’re doing right now is how does this allow people to

have increased agency, and how do we create a system to incorporate

the flexibility that people need as a result of that agency?

ADI IGNATIUS: Yeah, I think agency is the number one issue. But it’s

tricky because if you ask your workforce, they may ask for 100% agency,

and by that they may mean, “I want to work from home 100% of the

time.” What do you do with that data? Who should take charge?

SANDY SPEICHER: I do think that people have many different needs

and many different experiences, and some people found a comfort and

effectiveness working from home and some people are really missing

being back in person together and some people are in between, really

wanting flexibility. So as leaders, a lot of our job is to incorporate all of

that information and understand how to design a shared system.

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

And maybe just to talk about that notion of a shared system, I

think these last couple of years have really taught us a lot about our

## relationship with each other, our relationship with the world around

us. We’ve been asked to change our ways of living in service of the

## collective, in service of our individual health and the collective health.

And that really has caused quite an awakening where we recognize

that we exist in an ecosystem and these relationships haven’t been that

# healthy.

And so now is a great opportunity for people to reflect on what

kind of life they want to be living, and how do they want to spend

their days? One of the things that we then have to do is get to new

agreements about what it means to live together, to work together. How

do we rebalance, for instance, our relationship with work? How do we

rebalance our relationship with the planet? How do we rebalance some

of the inequities in society? And all of this is coming up for people.

And so of course, as we individually start to think about our needs,

any system that we’re a part of, the people who are the stewards of

that system, the leaders of that system, really need to listen to the

aggregate of those individual needs and find solutions that work at the

## intersection of as much of that as possible.

ADI IGNATIUS: That’s inspiring. Before COVID, several years ago you

wrote an article that said the secret to creative success is disequilibrium.

Can you explain what you mean by that?

SANDY SPEICHER: Oh, thanks for that question. You give me a chance

to be a little bit nerdy here. Disequilibrium is one of my favorite terms,

but I might go into teacher mode on it.

ADI IGNATIUS: It’s okay, our audience is highly sophisticated.

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

SANDY SPEICHER: And actually, it’s so relevant for today.

Disequilibrium comes out of an educational theory, a constructivist

learning theory. The basic idea is that all of your knowledge you have

constructed, and what people do is they form mental models about the

world around them. Like we were just talking about, “this is what the

office is for,” “this is what the workplace is about,” or “this is my role

in society.” These mental models we form through the experiences and

information that we’re given. Well, a process of learning actually means

that when we come to information that questions our mental model,

that says, “Gosh, the way I understood the world isn’t quite lining up

anymore,” we go into this phase of disequilibrium. We’re out of balance.

## Our information doesn’t align with the information in the world around

us. And that phase of disequilibrium, we then use it to help us. We don’t

like to be in disequilibrium.

So we seek to get to resolve. We need to relearn. We need to know again,

revise our mental models. And we’re collectively as a society going

through that process right now. A lot of the things that we understood

to be true are evolving. And now this period of disequilibrium can feel

really stressful because the mental models you operate on aren’t really

working anymore. But this is where, if we take that discomfort and

we stand in it and we get curious about it and we recognize that that

discomfort is actually the thing that’s going to help us get to a new level

of understanding, well, we can make really great things happen in that

process. And so disequilibrium is this beautiful stage that shows you

you’re in a mode of learning.

I’d offer to anybody listening to really embrace that stage and recognize

how essential it is for learning and growth, and that it is a creative

act. We actually have that capability in us to really bring creativity

and redesign the way we understand and the way we create the world

# around us.

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

ADI IGNATIUS: So is your guess that COVID and our response to it has

permanently changed how we collaborate and how we interact, or that

we will eventually get back to something we were familiar with?

SANDY SPEICHER: I would say that it’s permanently changed

something for us. I don’t think that necessarily means that what we’re

doing right now is what we’re going to be doing forever, but I think

what has permanently changed is this societal scale consciousness, this

recognition of the larger systems that we live and work within. And

really, I think that now business leaders and employees and everyone

are asking questions about the role that business can play in helping

the world be a better place. How do we rebalance a lot of the social

injustices that we’ve become quite conscious of? How do we create a

new relationship with the planet that’s not extractive, but generative?

These are questions that leaders are starting to ask that employees are

now demanding that leaders ask, and I think that this has been in us for

a long time, the belief that the way we’re working isn’t quite working

and these two years have really helped us see a lot of those dimensions

and realize that we can change things.

And that’s happening at a pretty big scale. I think that we’re all

designing our way toward that now. But I do think that some of our

clients, for instance, are asking super interesting questions. We have

some work we’re doing with multiple companies right now around, for

instance, how do we increase the voice of the frontline worker in the

decisions that are made about technology to support their work? Now,

it’s really common that there’s a tech team that sits in the background

of big companies and makes a lot of decisions for what tools workers

should use. And it’s rare, actually, that frontline workers are seen as not

just a customer in that, but a potential designer of that. But yet, they’re

the ones that know the needs. And so how do we actually build our

organizations to be that collaborative, to not have that much distance

between the decisions that are being made and the people who have the

real direct lived experience?

ADI IGNATIUS: I’m going to go to a couple audience questions now,

because we’re getting a lot of them and some of them are quite

interesting. So this one might be out of your purview, but I’m going to

try it anyways. This is from Vance who’s in Chicago who’s asking about

the metaverse. We’ve been talking about designing systems, physical

systems to improve how we do things and then there’s this parallel,

virtual environment called the metaverse. So the question is how do you

see the metaverse playing a role in the future of work?

SANDY SPEICHER: Hi, Vance, thanks for your question. And while it’s

a very prescient question, I think this is one of the creative pathways we

have for the future. I guess when I think about the metaverse, it feels

like another environment for us to build a world, right? For us to build

how we relate to each other, what rituals we run ourselves by, what

agreements we run ourselves by. And actually, that to me is the same set

of underpinnings that we need in the real world, right? That we need in

our workplaces, that we need in our virtual work environments.

So this idea of world building feels like something for us to all become

really aware of, not just to jump into another technology tool or another

platform or another environment, but to really be thinking of what

world are we building? We can all become very aware of that and very

intentional about that and set what kinds of agreements we want to

govern our relationships, what kind of work we can do here that we

want to do here, how we make sure that we’re deepening relationships,

not just transacting.

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

It feels like great questions will come up as we become more intentional

## about building worlds, whether that’s with a headset on or whether we

drive into the office to create that world.

ADI IGNATIUS: So we’re getting a few questions that are about

community, about culture, and I sense in these questions and in

my own experience that the flexibility, the agency that we want to

give people might clash with building a culture and sustaining a

culture that’s truly meaningful. Here’s one from Jerry from Woburn,

Massachusetts, asking how much culture do we lose in a remote or even

hybrid environment? Mary Jo from Portland, Oregon, is asking how we

increase the sense of community in the office?

There are a lot of questions about how we build back this culture. You

started to talk about it, but I’d love to hear more because we’re all

struggling with this right now and feeling that it’s a trade-off: agency is

good, but you might lose culture or you have to reinvent what culture

# means in this new environment.

SANDY SPEICHER: Yeah. One thing that I don’t feel we’ve really come

to yet is, what is culture in a virtual environment? We have a lot of

tools that manage the way we interact with each other, but we don’t

necessarily design that as culture. So that feels like a great opportunity.

I think these questions about culture are really important for us to hold.

And I think that both for leaders and for everyone at work, we should

be asking the question about how am I contributing to creating this

# culture?

I think about some of the things that we’ve done to hold culture alive

when in-person became immediately unavailable. One of the things we

did when we went into shelter-in-place across many of our IDEO offices

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

is we thought about how do we bring everybody together in the ways

we used to, right? So we used to be able to walk through our space and

see the work that everyone was doing. So we ended up creating this

event we called the Frenzy, which was four-days-long event, basically

24-hours-a-day rolling across multiple time zones, because we’re all

around the world, where people were sharing content, where we had

times where people came together, times where people could sign up for

stuff. So people were sharing, teaching each other things through this

# content.

So we did a lot to really say, how are we still connected? How do we

still maintain our culture even through this distributed format? And of

course, as time has gone on, we’re are all a little exhausted by Zoom.

We’re all a little bit tired of this environment. It’s actually quite hard to

maintain the spirit of that culture.

So there are some things that we did for that. For instance, in our

Tokyo office, they did something really beautiful where they recognized

that even though we can’t be all in the office together, we could be

individually. So they decided to create a group art installation where

individuals made different art pieces, went into the office and installed

them, and then people could sign up to come through the whole gallery

and experience each other in a different type of distributed way.

I give these examples to basically say we have a lot of areas that we can

manifest culture. I think the question really becomes how do we want

to be together? And that’s something we should all be talking about and

# designing.

ADI IGNATIUS: My next question may relate to that. And you’d

mentioned before we’re not just dealing with Covid, but there are also

big societal issues that we’re wrestling with and we’re feeling we need

to solve globally, but in the workplace as well. So in your mind, how

can design, design thinking, process thinking contribute to progress in

# diversity and inclusion?

SANDY SPEICHER: Yeah, it’s really important that we build deeper

methods here. I think that there are a lot of experts in this space,

and I would not call myself an expert in this space, but I would call

myself a deep learner about what it means to really deeply listen to

and understand people’s experiences in order to create an environment

where people feel safe and welcome and celebrated.

And so one of the ways that I do think a design orientation could help

is to start with curiosity, understand what’s going on in your workplace.

And that doesn’t necessarily mean that you have to ask every person

what their experience is individually. It shouldn’t be that individuals

carry the weight of solving these problems. However, through our

systems, what we could do is we can ask questions. We can understand

# more deeply.

For instance, one of the things we’ve done is created a culture survey

that asks a lot of different elements about what people’s experiences

are in our culture. And then we look to the qualitative input, the things

that people are saying for those who are self-reporting as feeling most

left out or most distant from what may be the central culture of the

organization. And really understanding the root cause of some of those

dissonances helps us better design the foundational systems that we’re

# all operating through.

So some of the things that we’ve been doing is really learning about

the methods and mindsets of being inclusive and really looking at what

foundational systems we need to recreate in order to build more clarity,

to build more equal opportunity across our system.

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

These are kind of design approaches to asking that question, and

how do we become a more inclusive environment, how do we bring

equity into that environment? And it requires a lot of listening, a lot of

curiosity, also a lot of learning, a lot of iterating, and also don’t be shy of

bringing in experts who have the experience and view to help guide us

through that process. Because these are difficult conversations to have

and it really helps to have that facilitated, so that you can get to a deeper

root of what people’s experiences are and the ways that we can come

# together.

ADI IGNATIUS: Another question that all companies have is the

million-dollar question: how do you innovate? How do you perpetually

create a sort of perpetual innovation machine in your company? And

this is a question from James in Sydney who asked about the role of

serendipity and randomness in innovation. I know as employers we talk

about it being good to be together physically because there are these

sparks, but does that really happen?

SANDY SPEICHER: I think it does really help. Serendipity really does

help because through some of those interactions, you might learn

something that you hadn’t known before, and it might help you connect

a dot in your mind on a problem that you’re working on.

Of course, that doesn’t mean that being in the office is the only way to

do that. I think the key for that is to be looking for inspiration, to be

asking different types of questions, to be seeking outside of what your

current experiences and knowledge are in order to help expand your

mind with inspiration, which is the thing that helps us get to new ideas.

Recently, someone I work with was talking about this, that in meetings,

what we’re often looking for is to find common ground. What’s the

pieces that we all agree on so that we can move forward?

# HBR / Digital Article / IDEO’s CEO, Sandy Speicher, Asks: What Is an Office Even For N…

But what about seeking uncommon ground, right? That is part of our

work as creative people, looking to find leaps, to imagine things to

happen in new ways. We actually want to dig for what’s not common,

what is uncommon across the group, so that we can find new answers

in there and new ways to intersect those different perspectives and

different lived experiences.

I’m right there with James around serendipity. I wouldn’t then say that

means we should all require being in the office, but I will say, because

I’ve been in the office recently and had informal conversations with

people, it’s sparked some pretty new ideas for me.

ADI IGNATIUS: I’m going to change gears a little bit. This is a question

from Gaurav from Houston: what have been some of your learnings

from workplace design ideas that have failed?

SANDY SPEICHER: Workplace design ideas that have failed? Well…

ADI IGNATIUS: Must have been one, surely.

SANDY SPEICHER: There must be one. A lot of ideas that fail have to

do with time. They’re a good idea at the time and then they become not.

They don’t work as well after you try them for too long. I’m thinking

about, for instance, some changes that we’ve had to make to a space

that we’re renovating, and renovating during the pandemic. We built

all these open environments so that everyone can be bouncing off of

each other, and then of course we had to rethink the space to have a

bit more room so that we’re not all on top of each other given just the

health dynamics. But of course then once we’re in the rooms, we need to

think about the technology that gets embedded in it because of all of the

# interactions.

And then we need to think about sound because we’re all bouncing off

each other in these spaces, and especially when we’re using technology,

our volume might end up being a bit different. And then there’s a

learning that we had from one of our offices where, when we have

people in rooms working, a lot of times, well, our doors were opaque,

and even if there was a glass that people could see into, it meant

that people didn’t feel as comfortable intruding, or it felt like you

were intruding if you wanted to walk in or say hi to somebody. So a

couple things in there, like how technology integrates, how we think

about sound, but actually the solid doors, I think for our environment,

didn’t work as well because it created a barrier to some of that informal

# connection.

ADI IGNATIUS: I’ll put you on the spot again, and this is impossible

of course, but what’s your guess: What will the office of the future

look like? Even 10 years from now, extrapolating what’s happening

now and what we know about where technology is, how technology is

developing, what do you imagine the workplace and how we interact

will be like?

SANDY SPEICHER: I’m going to hold my pluralism here and say it’s workplaces. I do think we’re going to have many, many different

environments that are designed to be fit for purpose and flexible. So that

means that the workplace might look like this, what we’re doing right

now. The workplace might look like offices that we’ve had before, and

the workplace might look like what it looks like for us to move around

with our laptop and be connected with each other when we need to be.

And I think that those spaces will become platforms of real intention.

I think we’ll see that the shared spaces where we really need to come

together will be prominent in the workplace of the future. Café’s,

classrooms, the maker spaces like I mentioned. And so I think that we’re

going to just see a whole lot of variety, and we’re going to talk a lot more

about the rituals that we create in order to bring us together.

ADI IGNATIUS: Before we let you go, I’ve asked a lot of our guests more

about innovation, and I guess my question is, tell us something about

innovation that we don’t already know.

SANDY SPEICHER: I think innovation often gets synthesized pretty

quickly to be this kind of always-playful, happens-really-fast, happens-

in-the-spark-of-the-moment, process. And it’s true that there are times

in an innovation journey that you come together that way, but you

do that in order to really do the rigorous work of understanding the

implications of what you’re imagining, of processing what you’ve really

been hearing, understanding what that turns into. So I guess the thing I

would say that most people aren’t talking about with innovation is that

it’s actually a really rigorous process.

ADI IGNATIUS: That’s great. So Sandy, I want to thank you for being

with us. My producer sent me a note that we’ve probably had more

audience questions for this show than we’ve had at any other. So people

are really very interested in you and very interested in the topic. So

thank you very much for being on The New World of Work.

SANDY SPEICHER: Oh, thank you. Thanks Adi. I really enjoyed

chatting with you.
