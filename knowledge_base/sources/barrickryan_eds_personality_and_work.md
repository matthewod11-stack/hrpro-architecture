# THE ORGANIZATIONAL FRONTIERS SERIES

The Organizational Frontiers Series is sponsored by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology (SIOP). Launched in 1983 to make scientiﬁc contributions to the ﬁeld, the series has at- tempted to publish books that are on the cutting edge of theory, research, and theory-driven practice in industrial/organizational psychology and related organizational science disciplines.

Our overall objective is to inform and to stimulate research for SIOP members (students, practitioners, and researchers) and peo- ple in related disciplines, including the other subdisciplines of psy- chology, organizational behavior, human resource management, and labor and industrial relations. The volumes in the Organiza- tional Frontiers Series have the following goals:

- 1. Focus on research and theory in organizational science, and the implications for practice

- 2. Inform readers of signiﬁcant advances in theory and research in psychology and related disciplines that are relevant to our research and practice

- 3. Challenge the research and practice community to develop and adapt new ideas and to conduct research on these developments

- 4. Promote the use of scientiﬁc knowledge in the solution of public policy issues and increased organizational effectiveness

The volumes originated in the hope that they would facilitate continuous learning and a continuing research curiosity about organizational phenomena on the part of both scientists and practitioners.

# Foreword

This is the nineteenth book in a series initiated by the Society for Industrial and Organizational Psychology in 1983 (SIOP) and pub- lished by Jossey-Bass. Originally published as the Frontiers Series, the SIOP Executive Committee voted in 2000 to change the name of the series to Organizational Frontiers Series in order to enhance the identity and visibility of the series. The purpose of the publi- cation of series volumes in a general sense was to promote the sci- entiﬁc status of the ﬁeld. Ray Katzell ﬁrst edited the series, and Irwin Goldstein and Sheldon Zedeck followed him.

The editorial board chooses the topics of the volumes and the volume editors. The series editor and the editorial board then work with the volume editor in planning the volume and, occasionally, in suggesting and selecting chapter authors and content. During the writing of the volume, the series editor often works with the ed- itor and the publisher to bring the manuscript to completion.

The success of the series is evident in the high number of sales (now over forty-ﬁve thousand). Volumes have received excellent reviews, and individual chapters as well as volumes have been cited frequently. A recent symposium at the SIOP annual meeting exam- ined the impact of the series on research and theory in industrial/ organizational (I/O) psychology. Although such inﬂuence is difﬁ- cult to track and volumes have varied in intent and perceived cen- trality to the discipline, the conclusion of most participants was that the volumes have exerted a signiﬁcant impact on research and the- ory in the ﬁeld and are regarded as being representative of the best the ﬁeld has to offer.

Another purpose of the series was to bring scientiﬁc research from other disciplines to bear on problems of interest to I/O psy- chologists. This volume, edited by Murray Barrick and Ann Marie Ryan, provides an in-depth examination of the role of personality

in work behavior. Research on the nature of personality and the role of dispositional constructs in explaining a variety of work be- havior exploded in the early 1990s. The renewed interest in this area began with the meta-analytic demonstration by Barrick and Mount (1991) that there are generalizable relationships between some personality constructs and work performance and the grow- ing consensus among many personality researchers (Digman, 1990) that the myriad of personality measures and empirical stud- ies on the structure of personality suggested that ﬁve major per- sonality constructs represent the personality domain well. This book provides a review of some of this research and then goes well beyond a reexamination of these issues to explore the process by which personality exerts its inﬂuence on work outcomes. Also con- sidered is a much wider array of work behavior (including con- textual performance, counterproductive behavior, retaliatory behavior, retention, and learning) than simply performance of one’s assigned work role. This book brings together basic person- ality researchers and those interested in applications of personal- ity in the work context, one of the major goals of the series since its inception.

In Chapter One, Saucier and Goldberg provide a deﬁnition of personality, examine evidence on the structure of personality at- tributes, and raise issues about the adequacy of the Big Five model on several important criteria. Lucas and Diener next explore the evidence for, and the importance of, happiness variables (or satis- faction, to use a more common term in the I/O literature) as func- tional determinants of the choices people make and the behaviors in which they engage. They provide the quite reasonable, but rarely explored, hypothesis that the role of happiness in explain- ing worker behavior and productivity is dependent on the behav- iors that are important and examined. Chapter Three, by Barrick, Mitchell, and Stewart, also reﬂects the theme that situational and motivational variables inﬂuence the relationship between person- ality and work behavior. Chapters Four (by Johnson), Five (by Weiss and Kurek), and Six (by Cullen and Sackett) explore in de- tail aspects of the process model of the personality-performance relationship. In Chapter Seven, Stewart makes a strong case that personality–work behavior relationships can be understood only by examining cross-level (individual, team, organization) effects.

# FOREWORD xiii

Day and Kilduff consider similar issues in Chapter Eight and also point to the role of an individual’s skill in monitoring and manag- ing relationships in groups and organizations. In Chapter Nine, Ford and Oswald examine the evidence for and potential beneﬁts of a consideration of dispositional determinants of learning and training performance, as well as the successful transfer of training to one’s work situation. Chapter Ten by Ryan and Kristof-Brown considers the nature and importance of the ﬁt between individuals and the organization in which they work. The last two chapters, by Hough and by Mount, Barrick, and Ryan, are consistent with the major message of this book: that models of personality-performance relationships must go well beyond the consideration of bivariate re- lationships. The challenge that these more complex models pre- sent for scientist and practitioner alike should provide an exciting and stimulating research venue for many years to come.

Our target audiences include graduate students in I/O psy- chology and organizational behavior, as well as doctoral-level re- searchers and practitioners who want to gain knowledge on the most up-to-date data and theory regarding the important role of per- sonality in determining a variety of work behaviors as well as the reasons that these relationships exist (or do not exist) in various situations. Many of the topics and issues discussed in this book will be novel to many I/O psychologists and human resource practi- tioners. We have certainly read about personality, but there has not been a similar focus on understanding the mechanisms involved in personality-behavior relationships or the complex interplay of individual differences, situations, and outcomes. To the degree that this book fosters investigation of richer and more complex mod- els of these relationships and stimulates interest among other I/O researchers and practitioners and a collaboration with researchers in other disciplines, it will advance our discipline and contribute to the goals of the Organizational Frontiers series.

The chapter authors deserve our gratitude for pursuing the goal of clearly communicating the nature, application, and impli- cations of the theory and research described in this book. Produc- tion of a book such as this involves the hard work and cooperative effort of many individuals. The chapter authors and the editorial board played important roles in this endeavor. Because all royalties from the series volumes are used to help support SIOP ﬁnancially,

# xiv FOREWORD

none of them received any remuneration. They deserve our ap- preciation for engaging in a difﬁcult task for the sole purpose of furthering our understanding of organizational science.

We also express our sincere gratitude to Cedric Crocker, Juli- anna Gustafson, Matt Davis, and the entire staff at Jossey-Bass. Over many years and several volumes, they have provided support dur- ing the planning, development, and production of the series.

# Preface

The idea for this book is based on the notion that we all have per- sonalities, and those personalities affect our behavior at work. Today, this proposition is widely accepted by psychologists, man- agers, and employees. For this reason, there is considerable inter- est in the ﬁeld of industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology on the topic of personality and its inﬂuence at work. In fact, it is dif- ﬁcult to pick up a current research journal in human resources, organizational behavior, I/O psychology, or the general area of management without ﬁnding at least one article dealing with per- sonality at work.

Such interest in noncognitive individual differences is a healthy sign that increased knowledge will be gained by bringing together a variety of theoretical perspectives for understanding personality in work settings. It is our belief that a thorough knowledge of per- sonality as it affects organizational processes and outcomes requires addressing several important questions. First, what is personality, and how is it assessed? Second, how does personality affect various outcomes and behaviors? And third, what is the relationship be- tween personality and behavior in speciﬁc work settings? For ex- ample, what is the role of personality in person-organization ﬁt and person-job ﬁt? What are the effects of personality in work teams? In this book, some of the foremost scholars in the ﬁeld address these questions. Across all chapters, the authors present theoreti- cal perspectives, introduce models or frameworks, integrate and synthesize prior studies, and in myriad other ways make proposals that should stimulate future research and practice. We have been delighted with the contributions by the authors of these chapters. We particularly thank them for their thought-provoking work. We believe that these chapters will serve as inﬂuential research-oriented guides to the next wave of research on personality and work.

# Personality and Work

# CHAPTER 1

## The Structure of Personality Attributes Gerard Saucier Lewis R. Goldberg

In a classic early textbook, Allport (1937) reviewed deﬁnitions of the concept of personality. He called it “one of the most abstract words in our language” (p. 25) and discussed its broad connotations. All- port catalogued ﬁfty distinct meanings—some from literary, theo- logical, philosophical, juristic, and sociological traditions and others stressing external appearance or psychological constructs. The def- inition he proposed—“personality is the dynamic organization within the individual of those psychophysical systems that determine his unique adjustments to his environment” (p. 48)—was a synthe- sis of several psychological meanings of the concept.

Funder (2001) provided a more down-to-earth rendition: “an individual’s characteristic patterns of thought, emotion, and be- havior, together with the psychological mechanisms—hidden or not—behind those patterns” (p. 2). Few could argue that what Fun- der refers to is not personality; it is reasonably close to a consensual

view. It refers simultaneously to characteristics that are (1) ascribed to individuals, (2) stable over time, and (3) psychological in na- ture. Yet it also acknowledges that mechanisms explaining these traits may be difﬁcult to isolate and measure.

Deﬁnitions make one’s assumptions explicit, so how one de- ﬁnes personality is quite consequential: it affects how one selects variables when studying personality phenomena. What if one were to rely on some of the philosophical deﬁnitions of personality re- viewed by Allport (1937), such as “the quality in every man which makes him worthwhile” (Adler, 1929, p. 8), “individuality which has become objective to itself” (Windelband, 1921, p. 281), or “self- hood” (Crutcher, 1931, p. 75)? With such deﬁnitions, one would hardly care to study the individual’s actual behaviors at all.

But Allport’s deﬁnition (1937) also highlights attributes that are seen as residing within the individual. Other ways of deﬁning personality emphasize more external types of attributes, such as the role one assumes or the status one has achieved in society, one’s external appearance (including personal attractiveness), and the reactions of others to the individual as a stimulus—that is, the person’s social stimulus value (see MacKinnon, 1944). In work set- tings, of course, appearances are important. Moreover, Triandis (2001) suggests that in collectivist cultures, external factors are considered more important to personality than are the internal traits emphasized in individualist cultures.

Individual differences in externally deﬁned attributes may be interwoven with individual differences in temperamental traits. Consider terms like magnetic, charming, powerful, and likeable, which seem to be partly internal and partly responses to the individual. Later in the chapter, we explore some structural models for per- sonality that include such attributes.

# Parsimony in Personality Models

Scale labels in personality inventories have a bewildering variety of constructs. And if one turns to single words potentially referring to personality attributes in modern languages, the situation be- comes overwhelming. Allport and Odbert (1936), for example, cat- alogued nearly eighteen thousand words from Webster’s Second International Dictionary referring to characteristics that might be

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 3

used to distinguish one human being from another. In follow-up work, Norman (1967) judged that over thirty-ﬁve hundred of these terms refer to stable personality traits. Clearly, no single compre- hensive model can capture all possible personality attributes. We must economize and reduce, seeking a more parsimonious sum- mary of this vast domain of concepts.

In the ﬁeld of biology, taxonomies have helped in organizing a huge number of species into a single framework indicating how each is related to the others. Correspondingly, in the ﬁeld of per- sonality, there has been a rising wave of interest in the search for a scientiﬁcally compelling taxonomy of the huge number of per- sonality attributes. A taxonomy is a systematic division of phe- nomena into ordered groups or categories; in other words, it is a way of “chunking” things. A scientiﬁc taxonomy helps organize and integrate knowledge and research ﬁndings by providing a standard scientiﬁc nomenclature. Such a nomenclature facilitates commu- nication among investigators and aids in the accumulation of em- pirical ﬁndings. Identifying a widely useful taxonomy of personality attributes is one of the most important goals of basic research in personality.

A central question in taxonomy construction concerns the pro- cedures to be used to divide or group the phenomena under study. A variety of approaches might be employed, but the most useful is a class of statistical methods generically referred to as factor analy- sis. As Goldberg and Digman (1994) noted, factor analysis can be considered a variable-reduction procedure in which many variables are organized by a few factors that summarize the interrelations among the variables. These factors can be thought of as summary constructs, or as higher-level dimensions in a hierarchical model of the variables in the domain.

Anyone seeking to employ factor analysis must ﬁrst make a cru- cial determination: which variables to include in the analysis. If some theory were available—one that was formulated clearly enough to specify the particular variables that should be measured—an in- vestigator might rely on that theory for variable selection, as several investigators have proposed (Cloninger, 1987; Eysenck, 1991). This could lead to an advantageous linking of the taxonomic model with a scientiﬁc theory. Even failures to verify the model in empirical studies could lead to important advances in the development of the

# 4 PERSONALITY AND WORK

theory. However, the theory might omit some signiﬁcant summary constructs that a more empirical approach might reveal.

Alternatively, one could take a strictly practical approach. One could build up a taxonomic model incrementally by developing successively more and more measures, each constructed to predict some important human outcome. This is the approach that Gough (1996) espoused in developing the California Psychological In- ventory (CPI). Although Gough did not initially aspire to create a comprehensive taxonomy, analyses of the interrelations among the CPI scales eventually led him to develop some summary dimen- sions to encompass them. The measures developed by this practical approach typically have empirical strengths, but they are not the- oretically organized and may omit important constructs that no one happened to think of investigating.

Yet another incremental approach to variable selection relies on an investigator’s initial judgments of the most important vari- ables to measure, later adding measures of other variables that em- pirically turn out to be relatively independent of those initially selected. Comrey (1988) used this approach to variable selection in the development of the Comrey Personality Scales, as did Telle- gen (in press) in the development of his Multidimensional Per- sonality Questionnaire (MPQ). If many investigators adopted this approach and they all ended up measuring the same constructs, those variables would have some privileged status in models of per- sonality structure.

Unfortunately, this has not occurred. Despite the long tradi- tion of packaging structural models into multiscale personality in- ventories, until recently there was little agreement among them on the most important variables of personality, and consequently none of them had become widely accepted as a comprehensive taxon- omy of personality attributes. There are several reasons for this. First, research on each inventory has operated independent of that on other inventories, with little comparison or integration (Gold- berg, in press). Second, inventories tend to become ﬁxed in form at an early stage, with rare revisions to reﬂect new developments in theory or measurement; revisions may be scientiﬁcally desirable but problematic from a commercial standpoint (Goldberg, 1999). And perhaps most important, the rationale for variable selection in these inventories, although reasonable in one way or another, has not been particularly powerful.

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 5

# The Basis for the Lexical Approach

Is there a more compelling rationale for personality variable se- lection? As has long been recognized (Allport, 1937; Cattell, 1943; Goldberg, 1981; Norman, 1963), some of the most basic personal- ity attributes might be discovered from studying conceptions im- plicit in the use of the natural language. If a distinction is highly represented in the lexicon, it can be presumed to have practical importance. Personality concepts salient in the lexicon should not be left out of a taxonomy of personality attributes (Tellegen, 1993). That is, folk concepts of personality provide basic but not exhaus- tive (necessary but not sufﬁcient) components for a science of per- sonality attributes (Goldberg & Saucier, 1995).

This leads us to a key premise of the lexical approach to taxon- omy construction: the degree of representation of an attribute in language has some correspondence with the general importance of the attribute in real- world transactions. Imagine an attribute for which there is, within one language, a dense cluster of loosely synonymous terms; such an attribute would certainly have a claim to importance, at least with respect to the language community within which it is so richly rep- resented (Zipf, 1949). An attribute that is represented by multiple terms in a language will likely appear as a factor in multivariate analyses. Moreover, if the factor includes terms that are used with high frequency, the importance of the factor is underscored. Fac- tors derived from studies of natural language personality descrip- tors in different languages provide a superb starting point for a taxonomy of personality attributes, particularly if widely diverse lan- guages are studied. These factors are but a starting point because the lexicon could omit or underemphasize some scientiﬁcally im- portant variables, and the meaning of single natural language terms can be vague, ambiguous, or context dependent (John, Angleitner, & Ostendorf, 1988). We can assume, however, that attributes richly represented in the lexicon are there for a reason.

Cross-cultural generalizability is a valuable criterion for adju- dicating among competitor taxonomic structures. Psychology is the study of mind and behavior of humans in general, not just of hu- mans in a narrow range of sociocultural settings. Structural mod- els derived within one limited population, or a limited sample from that population, are prone to reﬂect the unique patternings found within that population or sample. Culture-speciﬁc patternings may

# 6 PERSONALITY AND WORK

be interesting in their own way, but models that transfer well across populations, and thus across languages and sociocultural settings, are more congruent with the scientiﬁc ideals of replicability and generalizability.

If we take cross-cultural generalizability as a criterion for a good taxonomic structure, we can apply this criterion in a lenient or a stringent way. The lenient way is to export a set of variables (most often, those represented in a single personality inventory) for use in other populations and then examine whether these pre- selected variables (after translation, if necessary) generate the same factor structure in each new language or culture. If the scales in a personality inventory generate similar factors across populations, one might argue that the structure is widely gener- alizable, as McCrae and Costa (1997) have done with respect to their revised NEO Personality Inventory (Costa & McCrae, 1992). However, this is not a very demanding test. It is not sufﬁcient to show that when personality measures in a new language are made to conform to the procrustean speciﬁcations of one model, that model can be recovered. There may be a large number of possi- ble models that are equally exportable and maintain their factor structures across many populations.

A more challenging test of generalizability is to identify the most salient and important personality concepts within each lin- guistic and cultural context, derive an indigenous factor structure from those variables, and then examine the extent to which this new structure corresponds to any previously proposed models. A model that could meet this test in any language would have great psychological import; it could be considered far more ubiquitous and universal than a structure that simply met the less demanding imposed test (that is, showed a high degree of translatability).

The lexical approach involves such an indigenous research strategy. Analyses are carried out separately within each language, using a representative set of native language descriptors, rather than importing selections of variables from other languages (for example, English). The hope is that the ﬁndings from these lexi- cal studies will converge on a replicable pattern such that most lan- guages will reﬂect its imprint. An analogous, and possibly universal, pattern has been identiﬁed in studies of color words across lexi- cons (Kay & McDaniel, 1978), corresponding to the genetics and neurobiology of color perception.

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 7

## What We Learn from Natural Language Personality Descriptions

The majority of lexical studies of personality descriptors have sought to test the most widely inﬂuential personality model of the past two decades: the Big Five factor structure (Goldberg, 1990, 1993b; John, 1990). The Big Five factors are customarily labeled Extraversion, Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Sta- bility (or its opposite, Neuroticism), and Intellect (or, in one in- ventory representation, Openness to Experience). There were signs of the Big Five structure in some studies from an earlier era (as detailed by Digman, 1990; Goldberg, 1993b; John, 1990), but its identiﬁcation in studies of natural language descriptors in En- glish (Goldberg, 1990) was decisive.

If we value cross-cultural generalizability, however, applicability to one language is not enough. As detailed in more lengthy reviews (Saucier & Goldberg, 2001; Saucier, Hampson, & Goldberg, 2000), lexical studies have yielded structures resembling the Big Five most consistently in languages originating in northern Europe, includ- ing German (Ostendorf, 1990) and Polish (Szarota, 1996), as well as English. Although a study in Turkish (Goldberg & Somer, 2000) also found a structure with much resemblance to the Big Five, stud- ies of other non–Northern European languages (Church, Katigbak, & Reyes, 1998; Church, Reyes, Katigbak, & Grimm, 1997; Di Blas & Forzi, 1998; Szirmák & De Raad, 1994) have led to results that are less clearly supportive. And because a majority of studies have re- lied exclusively on self-report, the degree of generality of the Big Five in peer ratings is less certain than for self-ratings.

To this point, lexical studies have revealed a great deal about the relative robustness of the Big Five, as well as information about other less well-known candidate models, including some with fewer and some with more factors. We examine the most consistent ﬁndings from lexical studies to date by describing models with successively more factors.

## What If We Allowed Ourselves Only One Factor?

Several lexical studies have reported evidence about factor solu- tions containing only one factor (Boies, Lee, Ashton, Pascal, & Nicol, 2001; Di Blas & Forzi, 1999; Goldberg & Somer, 2000;

# 8 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Saucier, 1997). The ﬁndings from these studies have been quite consistent. The single factor contrasts a heterogeneous mix of de- sirable attributes at one pole with a mix of undesirable attributes at the other pole. This unrotated factor can be labeled Evaluation; it involves the contrast between socially desirable and socially un- desirable personal qualities. We expect this one-factor structure to be the most replicable one across languages and cultures based on two principles: (1) the more terms that are associated with a fac- tor, the more replicable should that factor be, and (2) because the ﬁrst unrotated factor will have the most terms associated with it, it should be the most ubiquitous factor.

Findings of a single large evaluative factor are no doubt related to a classic ﬁnding in psychology. In judgments about the mean- ings of diverse objects in a wide array of cultural settings, a global evaluation factor (good versus bad) was typically found to be the single largest factor (Osgood, May, & Miron, 1975). Osgood hy- pothesized that the ubiquity of this evaluative factor was related to basic evolutionary principles: our forebears would not have sur- vived if they had not become adapted at a very basic level to any signals of good versus bad objects or events—those leading to plea- sure versus pain (for example, Can I eat it or will it eat me?).

# Are Two Factors Better Than One?

Two-factor solutions from several lexical studies also suggest a con- sistent pattern: one factor includes attributes associated with posi- tively valued dynamic qualities and individual ascendancy, whereas the other factor includes attributes associated with socialization, social propriety, solidarity, and community cohesion (Boies et al., 2001; Caprara, Barbanelli, & Zimbardo, 1997; Di Blas & Forzi, 1999; Digman, 1997; Goldberg & Somer, 2000; Hˇrebíˇcková, Os- tendorf, Osecká, & ˇCermák, 1999; Paulhus & John, 1998; Saucier, 1997; Shweder, 1972; White, 1980). Such a factor structure resem- bles that embodied in the theoretical model of Bakan (1966), who labeled the two factors Agency and Communion. In addition, these two factors may be aligned with some of the other sets of dual per- sonological constructs reviewed by Digman (1997) and by Paulhus and John (1998), including Hogan’s (1983) distinction between “getting ahead” (Dynamism) and “getting along” (Social Propriety).

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 9

This constellation of two factors is also related to the three most ubiquitous dimensions of affective meaning, which include Potency (or Strength) and Activity in addition to Evaluation (Osgood et al., 1975). Whether this correspondence is due entirely to the imposi- tion of universal tendencies in human cognition or to the natural structure of phenomena “out in the world” remains an open ques- tion. In judgments about human targets, Potency and Activity tend to merge into a single dimension that Osgood and his associates called Dynamism. Unpublished analyses with English-language ad- jectives indicate that the Big Two lexical factors are strongly related to the dimensions of affective meaning as indexed in pancultural bipolar scales applied in self-descriptions. The ﬁrst unrotated lexical factor is strongly related to Evaluation (but independent of Potency and Activity), whereas the second unrotated lexical factor is related to Potency and Activity (but independent of Evaluation).

As is true of the Big One factor structure, no lexical study has presented evidence to contradict the view that this two-factor struc- ture is ubiquitous across languages and cultures. If both the one- and two-factor structures eventually turn out to be universal, the latter has some advantage because two factors provide more in- formation than one.

# What Would Be a Big Three?

Findings from most lexical studies to date suggest the general rule that if three factors are extracted and rotated, these factors tend to be broad versions of Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Consci- entiousness, the ﬁrst three factors from the Big Five (Saucier & Goldberg, 2001). All lexical studies that have identiﬁed the Big Five in ﬁve-factor solutions and also report the character of the three- factor solution report this Big Three. Moreover, some studies that did not straightforwardly replicate the Big Five did replicate this lexical Big Three (Di Blas & Forzi, 1998, 1999; De Raad & Szirmák, 1994; Hahn, Lee, & Ashton, 1999), so it appears more robust than the Big Five. And the Big Three (like the one- and two-factor so- lutions already described) seem relatively unaffected by how wide versus narrow a variable selection one employs (Saucier, 1997).

However, at least two lexical studies have not replicated this Big Three in three-factor solutions, these being the studies in French

# 10 PERSONALITY AND WORK

(Boies et al., 2001) and Filipino/Tagalog (A. T. Church, personal communication, Aug. 9, 1999). Thus, although it has been widely replicated, this Big Three may not be universal. Nonetheless, this three-factor lexical model does seem to be more general than a widely touted alternative: the Extraversion-Neuroticism-Psychoticism model of Eysenck (1991). The Eysenck model predicts the emer- gence of Neuroticism among the three largest factors and the collapse of Agreeableness and Conscientiousness into one “Psy- choticism” factor (Goldberg & Rosolack, 1994).

# Regularities at the Five-Factor Level

As we have noted, lexical studies in languages originating in north- ern Europe (including English) have been supportive of the Big Five, and so has a study in Turkish. But studies in Italian (De Raad, Di Blas, & Perugini, 1997) and Hungarian (Szirmák & De Raad, 1994) found no counterpart to the Intellect factor in ﬁve-factor solutions. In- stead, there were two Agreeableness-related factors, one contrast- ing peacefulness with aggression and irritability and the other contrasting humaneness with greed and egotism (compare Deary, 1996). Extraction of additional factors was necessary to ﬁnd a fac- tor related to Intellect.

Several lexical studies have included a relatively broad selection of variables, each with terms that could be classiﬁed as referring to emotions and moods or as being unusually highly evaluative, and two of these studies included terms referring to physical appear- ance. Because none of these studies found the Big Five in a ﬁve- factor solution, it is clear that the appearance of the Big Five as the ﬁrst ﬁve factors is contingent on some strictures in variable selection.

# Lexical Seven-Factor Models

Although not ﬁnding the Big Five in ﬁve-factor solutions, studies with inclusive variable-selection criteria in English and Turkish did ﬁnd Big Five–like factors in a seven-factor solution (Goldberg & Somer, 2000; Saucier, 1997; Tellegen & Waller, 1987). The two ad- ditional factors were Negative Valence (a factor emphasizing at- tributes with extremely low desirability and endorsement rates), found in all three studies, and either Positive Valence (a factor em- phasizing vague positive attributes like Impressive and Outstand-

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 11

ing and found in Tellegen & Waller, 1987) or Attractiveness (found in the other two studies).

Intriguingly, studies in two other languages with broad variable- selection criteria have led to an alternative seven-factor structure. The convergences between these studies occurred in spite of their many differences in methodology. Lexical studies in Filipino (Church et al., 1997, 1998) and Hebrew (Almagor, Tellegen, & Waller, 1995)—languages from widely separated language families and cultures—yielded a highly convergent seven-factor structure, although the similarity was obscured by discrepant labels. The En- glish translations of marker adjectives for the Filipino and Hebrew factors have been shown to correspond in a one-to-one way (Sau- cier, 2002).

One of these new factors resembles the Negative Valence factor just described. Two of them resemble Big Five factors—Consci- entiousness and Intellect. The other three Big Five factors— Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability—correlate substantially but in a complex way with the remaining four factors, which map an affective-interpersonal domain (compare Saucier, 1992). These four can be labeled Gregariousness (or Liveliness), Self-Assurance (or Mettle or Fortitude), Even Temper (Tolerant ver- sus Temperamental), and Concern for Others (versus Egotism). Big Five Extraversion is related to Gregariousness and Self-Assurance, Emotional Stability to Self-Assurance and Even Temper, and Agree- ableness to Even Temper and Concern for Others.

Similar factors have been obtained from lexical data in English (Saucier, 2002), and factors found in studies in Italian (Di Blas & Forzi, 1998) resemble the Multi-Language Seven. However, further replication tests are needed because few studies have used such in- clusive variable-selection criteria. In any case, one would expect a model with more factors to have higher predictive validity, and there are some indications that this Multi-Language Seven model will outperform the Big Five in this regard (Saucier, 2002).

# Implications and Limitations

In lexical studies, variable selection is taken out of the hands of the expert and entrusted to a more disinterested source (that is, a dic- tionary). Using this method, some consistencies in the structure of personality attributes become clear. We can discern a hierarchical

# 12 PERSONALITY AND WORK

structure, with very broad factors related to the affective meaning dimensions of Osgood et al. (1975) at the top of the hierarchy. At a slightly lower level of breadth are the Big Five or partially related alternatives that have been recovered in some languages. Although some investigators have claimed that factors like the Big Five are human universals (McCrae & Costa, 1997), this conclusion is cer- tainly premature. Even at this early juncture, we can ﬁnd studies of languages in which the Big Five do not seem to be the best model for representing the indigenous lexical structure. Clearly, tests of the Big Five against competitor structures are needed.

Moreover, there are some important limitations to the body of lexical studies carried out to date. More studies are needed in non- Western settings where the majority of the world’s human popula- tion resides and with non-European languages. Lexical studies have focused almost entirely on those attributes represented in ad- jectives, although some attributes may be represented mainly as type nouns (Hick, Nerd, Slavedriver, Tease) or as attribute nouns (Integrity, Mettle); certainly more studies that include attributes represented in nonadjectival forms are needed. In addition, most lexical studies to date have relied exclusively on self-descriptions, a methodology whose use should be supplemented with descrip- tions by knowledgeable informants.

Another possible limitation of current lexical studies is that they have focused on the attributes of individuals, and few have exam- ined the attributes of groups or organizations (Slaughter, Zickar, Highhouse, & Mohr, 2001). Given the long history of studies of or- ganizational climate (Astin & Holland, 1961; Ellsworth & Maroney, 1972; Moos, 1972; Wolf, 1966), it would be extremely instructive to examine the structure of interorganizational differences using a comprehensive set of lexical stimuli. Is there something akin to the Big Five or other lexical structures when we study descriptions of groups rather than persons? Future research may provide an answer. One might wonder why the factor structures found in lexical studies are so important, given that the currently dominant for- mats for personality assessment are inventories containing phrase- or sentence-length items. One huge advantage of lexical studies is that the personality-descriptive lexicon constitutes a far more bounded and ﬁnite population than the set of all possible ques- tionnaire items, and therefore one can reasonably argue that a lex-

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 13

ical variable selection (for example, the ﬁve hundred English ad- jectives of highest frequency of use; Saucier, 1997) is representa- tive of that population. This makes it easier to arrive at defensible scientiﬁc generalizations about personality attributes.

As it happens, the structure of personality attributes as encoded in the scales included in current personality inventories may not differ markedly from that encoded in single person-descriptive terms. The higher-level factors from the Sixteen Personality Factor Inventory (16PF; Conn & Rieke, 1994) and the Revised NEO Per- sonality Inventory (NEO-PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992) are variants of the Big Five. Six of the seven factors represented by the scales included in the Hogan Personality Inventory (HPI; Hogan & Hogan, 1995)—Sociability, Ambition, Adjustment, Likeability, Pru- dence, Intellectance, and School Success—have been shown to cor- respond fairly well to six of the Multi-Language Seven factors, with Negative Valence (and School Success) excluded (Saucier, 2002). Of course, future inventory scales need not be limited to the con- tent found in lexical factors; lexical factors indicate necessary but not sufﬁcient components for an adequate representation of per- sonality attributes (Goldberg & Saucier, 1995). Lexical studies pro- vide a superb initial grid for personality assessment, but they are not the entire enterprise.

## Structural Models That Provide More Speciﬁc Constructs

Thus far, we have discussed only structures containing broad, or- thogonal factors. We turn now to the more speciﬁc constructs that are agglomerated into these factors.

## Some Advantages of Lower-Level Constructs

Hierarchical structural models, such as the consensual one that could emerge from lexical studies, are advantageously ﬂexible. One can attain either great parsimony at the few-factor level or greater informativeness at levels with more factors. One can gen- erate even more informativeness by subdividing the broader fac- tors into more speciﬁc subcomponents (sometimes called facets).

# 14 PERSONALITY AND WORK

However, it is possible that going to the facet level may require giv- ing up some degree of cross-cultural replicability.

Broad factors have a number of limitations. They are com- posed of many variables, and this creates a degree of ambiguity. As Block (1995) and John (1990) have noted, investigators differ in the psychological meaning that they give to each of the Big Five factors (see Johnson & Ostendorf, 1993, for one plausible account of the reasons for this problem). For example, Extraversion can be thought of as a composite of Sociability, Assertiveness, and Positive Emotionality (as well as other related constructs), but some see So- ciability as more central (Costa & McCrae, 1992), others see As- sertiveness as more central (Goldberg, 1993b; Peabody, 1987), and still others see Positive Emotionality as more central (Watson & Clark, 1997). Although the factors are usually labeled with a single term, plumbing the psychological meaning of a broad factor like one of the Big Five is a cognitive task of considerable complexity. This is because a broad factor is not so much one thing as a col- lection of many things that have something in common. It is easy to ignore the diverse character of the variables contained within a broad factor. A better way to understand each factor might be to characterize its crucial subcomponents, which, although empiri- cally interrelated, are conceptually distinct.

Indeed, identiﬁcation of speciﬁc subcomponents can help to clarify the conceptualization of the broader factors (Briggs, 1989). Because broad factors blend together subcomponents that might be distinguished from one another, some of the ﬁner features of personality description are lost when making only a few broad dis- tinctions. Such ﬁner features appear to reﬂect genetic sources of variation beyond those bearing on the broad-level factors (Jang, McCrae, Angleitner, Riemann, & Livesley, 1998). And a represen- tation of personality structure that makes the ﬁner features explicit potentially offers higher precision and accuracy (or “ﬁdelity”) in per- sonality description. When categories are narrower, the exemplars for each are more similar, enhancing diagnostic value for speciﬁc instances (John, Hampson, & Goldberg, 1991). Broad-bandwidth constructs, on the other hand, sacriﬁce ﬁdelity to gain efﬁciency. A structural representation combining both broader and nar- rower constructs may be an optimal compromise. The broader- bandwidth level offers higher efﬁciency (parsimony), whereas the

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 15

narrower level offers higher ﬁdelity (predictive accuracy). More- over, to the extent that subcomponents are measured reliably, those measures afford valuable information about middle scorers on the broad dimensions, because middle scorers may score high on some subcomponents of a broad factor but low on others.

Perhaps the major beneﬁt of measuring subcomponents per- tains to predictive validity. As diverse commentators (Goldberg, 1993a; Mershon & Gorsuch, 1988; Paunonen & Ashton, 2001) have pointed out, the amalgamation of measures into broad factors leads to a loss of speciﬁc variance, thus lowering the overall validity of the composite (for important potential exceptions, see Ones & Viswes- varan, 1996). Consequently, an investigator who seeks optimal pre- dictions should use as many speciﬁc sources of variance as statistical power, and thus sample size, will permit (Goldberg, 1993a).

The quest for high predictive accuracy leads to the develop- ment of measures at levels far more speciﬁc than the broad factors compared in lexical studies; such subcomponents are likely to pre- dict more powerfully than the single broad factor into which they are agglomerated. Even when more speciﬁc variables provide lit- tle predictive gain over the common factors, it can be useful to know which aspect of the common factor is responsible for the bulk of the correlation, thus providing more conceptual clarity.

How many hierarchical levels are needed? Eysenck (1991) de- scribed four for personality constructs. The lowest level includes iso- lated behaviors (talking with a stranger), and the second level includes recurring behaviors or habits (tending to talk to strangers). The third level involves clusters of interrelated habitual behaviors (sociability, liking to be with people), which one might think of as middle-level traits. The fourth level is composed of amalgamations of middle-level traits that form broad factors (such as Extraversion). Lexical studies suggest that this fourth level might itself be divided into two levels, including an even more highly abstract level such as is represented in composite factors like Evaluation, Social Propri- ety, and Dynamism. That is, one can blend the apparent primary personality factors to create a few higher-level combinations, as do some languages that combine the colors white, yellow, and red into a single word (translatable perhaps as “light/warm”) and the col- ors black, blue, and green into another word (“dark/cool”); Kay and McDaniel (1978) call these composite colors.

# 16 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Lexical studies comparing the lower-level subcomponents of broad factors are still in their infancy. Given the high similarity in the Big Five representations in the highly related English and Ger- man languages, Saucier and Ostendorf (1999) tested whether such similarity extends to the lower-level subcomponents as well. They found that although not all of the subcomponents from each lan- guage replicate perfectly, most of them did. Speciﬁcally, the repli- cated hierarchical subcomponents of the Big Five included four facets each for Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Conscientiousness and three each for Emotional Stability and Intellect.

# Organizing the Subcomponents

There are two distinct ways of organizing the more speciﬁc sub- components of the broad factors, called the horizontal and verti- cal approaches (Goldberg, 1993b), and any complete taxonomy of personality attributes must include both kinds of organizational features. The vertical aspect refers to the hierarchical relations among the variables (for example, Reliability is a more abstract and general concept than Punctuality), whereas the horizontal aspect refers to the degree of similarity among variables at the same hi- erarchical level (Wit involves aspects of both Intelligence and Humor).

The deﬁning feature of horizontal models is that the relations among the variables are speciﬁed by the variables’ locations in mul- tidimensional space. When that space is limited to only two di- mensions and the locations of the variables are projected to some uniform distance from the origin, the resulting structures are re- ferred to as “circumplex” representations. The most famous ex- ample of such models is the Interpersonal Circle (Kiesler, 1983; Wiggins, 1979, 1980), which is based on variants of the Extraver- sion and Agreeableness factors in the Big Five model. Other ex- amples of circumplex models include those that incorporate the ﬁrst three of the Big Five factors (Di Blas & Forzi, 1999; Peabody & Goldberg, 1989; Stern, 1970); the affective-interpersonal factors based on Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability (Saucier, 1992); and two replicated nonevaluative factors (Saucier, Ostendorf, & Peabody, 2001).

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 17

A more comprehensive circumplex representation was pro- posed by Hofstee, De Raad, and Goldberg (1992). Dubbed the AB5C model, for Abridged Big Five-Dimensional Circumplex, this representation contains the ten bivariate planes formed from all pairs of the Big Five factors. In the AB5C model, each trait is as- signed to the plane formed by the two factors with which it is most highly associated (for example, its two highest factor loadings). Variables that are located in close proximity in each plane are clus- tered together so as to form ninety clusters of interrelated traits. Because of the circular ordering of these clusters, they form forty- ﬁve bipolar dimensions. An inventory developed to measure these forty-ﬁve AB5C facets has been provided by Goldberg (1999).

At a less formal level, the scales in some personality inventories are ordered horizontally by the similarity among their scales; for example, the scales from the CPI are grouped on the proﬁle sheet in such a way that adjacent scales are more highly associated with each other than are those located further away. Indeed, the loca- tions of the scales on the proﬁle sheets for most personality in- ventories are based on some degree of such horizontal ordering. More recently, some inventory developers have used an ex- plicitly hierarchical scheme for ordering their middle-level con- structs. A few of these have been borrowed from lexical research on the Big Five factor structure. The most salient example of in- corporating ﬁndings from lexical studies into inventory construc- tion has been provided by Costa and McCrae (1992), who added the lexical Agreeableness and Conscientiousness factors to their original three-factor NEO inventory. The latest revision of their in- ventory has six subcomponents (called facets) associated with each of the ﬁve highest-level constructs (called domains), for a total of thirty scales.

Other multiscale personality inventories provide a wide range of organizational schemes for their middle-level personality con- structs. For example, the sixteen scales of the 16PF are associated with ﬁve broad factors, and the eleven scales from the Multidi- mensional Personality Questionnaire (Tellegen, in press) are clas- siﬁed as facets of four factors. At the other extreme, the thirty-one scales from the Temperament and Character Inventory (TCI; Cloninger, Przybeck, Svrakic, & Wetzel, 1994) are organized as

# 18 PERSONALITY AND WORK

components of seven broad factors, as are the forty-four homoge- neous item composites from the HPI. The CPI (Gough, 1996) has an open-ended number of middle-level constructs, since new ones can always be generated from the inventory’s large item pool.

These middle-level facet systems appear to converge only par- tially; rarely are the same labels used for similar constructs. Because personality inventories are so widely employed, the high degree of divergence at the scale level, at least in terms of labels for the con- structs, creates a scientiﬁc problem. Indeed, there is a virtual Tower of Babel with respect to the labels for middle-level constructs; every inventory developer seems to speak a different tongue. Although in numerous studies McCrae and Costa have studied the relations between the scales from various inventories and their own NEO- PI-R, they have concentrated on delineating joint broad factors, not on reconciling the competing sets of constructs found at the more speciﬁc level.

The degree of convergence between the lower-level models em- bodied in various personality inventories is not yet well understood, nor are the relations of these inventory-based models to those de- rived from lexical studies. More research is needed to develop an overarching structure linking the facet systems in various invento- ries and then linking these systems to lexical ﬁndings concerning the general structure of personality attributes. In addition, we should learn more about the degree to which these inventories might reference some useful personality characteristics that are not well captured in personality-descriptive lexicons.

For the industrial/organizational psychologist, the most im- portant question concerns the comparative validity of each of the inventory and lexical models in predicting important human out- comes, especially those involved in the world of work. The manuals for many personality inventories include tables of correlations be- tween its scale scores and various criterion indexes, but virtually all of the ﬁndings from different inventories are incommensurate. Test authors are not encouraged to conduct comparative validity studies, pitting their instrument against one or more others as pre- dictors of the same set of criterion indexes. As a result, neither the science of personality assessment nor its applied practitioners have information about the comparative performance of the different

instruments available in the marketplace. There is no Consumers Union for testing our tests.

One basic problem is that scientiﬁc goals may have become subjugated to commercial interests. To solve this problem, Gold- berg (1999, in press) has recently developed a public domain venue for conducting comparative research, the International Per- sonality Item Pool (IPIP). The IPIP is an international effort to de- velop and continually reﬁne a set of broad-bandwidth personality inventories, all of whose items are freely available and whose scales can be used for scientiﬁc and commercial purposes. Although no one investigator alone has access to many diverse criterion settings, the international scientiﬁc community has such access, and the IPIP provides a venue for pooling their ﬁndings.

Because the IPIP is an open system for the accumulation of new personality measures, all we can provide here is a snapshot of its current status. Included at the IPIP Web site (http://ipip.ori.org/) are 280 personality scales, each developed from subsets of the 1,956 items now available in the pool. All of the IPIP items are in a common format, one that should elicit relatively faithful transla- tions across diverse languages. The scales are intended to measure the constructs included in various lexical models, plus constructs similar to those included in each of six commercial personality in- ventories (NEO-PI-R, 16PF, CPI, HPI, MPQ, TCI) already men- tioned in this chapter, in two other inventories—the revised Jackson Personality Inventory (Jackson, 1994) and the new Six Fac- tor Personality Questionnaire (Jackson, Paunonen, & Tremblay, 2000)—and in eighteen other popular personality scales. (For fur- ther information about this ever expanding resource, see Gold- berg, 1999, in press, and the IPIP Web site.)

There are many competing structural models of personality at- tributes at the middle hierarchical level. Indeed, it appears that the more speciﬁc is the level of constructs examined in these models, the more structural chaos is found, and the higher is the potential for confusion among researchers who are not committed to a sin- gle inventory. In some respects, this situation reﬂects a longstand- ing pattern in personality psychology: each expert has his or her own distinct personality theory, and each theory is accorded its own chapter in personality textbooks, with little empirical competition

# 20 PERSONALITY AND WORK

among the approaches. To employ a sports metaphor, we have bred a large number of racehorses, each having claims to superi- ority, but we have rarely bothered to pit them against one another in an actual race. It is time to conclude these preliminaries and get on with some meaningful competition. Comparative studies of structural models must now begin.

# How Good Are Existing Structural Models?

Which is the best structural model of personality? In attempting to answer this question, we face severe limitations because relatively few studies have generated comparative evidence on the utility of multiple structural models. However, because most readers are fa- miliar with the Big Five model, we can illustrate the potential ap- plication of relevant criteria with a brief discussion of how well the Big Five appears to satisfy them.

Many psychologists are interested in a structural model with a strong biological basis. It is relevant that all of the Big Five factors are moderately heritable. However, none is completely heritable, and none is strongly environmental with respect to shared family antecedents; we might ﬁnd a competitor model (or variant of the Big Five) with more causal clarity at some point in the future. There is no clear evidence that the Big Five correspond to main lines of genetic or biological inﬂuence, but the same must be said for all other structural models at this time.

Reliability and validity are frequently referenced criteria for comparing models. The Big Five factors generally show impressive stability across time and agreement across observers, but we do not know if some competitor model might be better on these counts. Because they are factors based on lexical representation, the Big Five have substantial bandwidth and certainly represent socially im- portant dimensions, although it is not clear that the Big Five cap- tures all socially important dimensions. The Big Five does show impressive predictive validity, but models containing a wider range of individual differences would doubtless outperform the Big Five in this respect.

Generalizability across differing types of data and across cul- tural settings is a potentially important criterion. The Big Five has some generality across self- and peer-rating data (Goldberg, 1990,

## THE STRUCTURE OF PERSONALITY ATTRIBUTES 21

1992), but it is not yet clear whether it is superior to potential com- petitor models in this regard. With respect to generalizability across cultures and languages, the Big Five appears adequate using the lenient criteria that we discussed earlier, but there may well be other models that meet stringent criteria even better. With respect to applicant samples in personnel selection, some have found the Big Five difﬁcult to recover (Schmit & Ryan, 1993), and others have proposed models with more than ﬁve factors (Hough, 1994). A more comprehensive model—one that covers the domain of important variables more thoroughly—will generally be preferred to a less comprehensive model. The Big Five may be adequately comprehensive if we use fairly narrow and conventional ways of deﬁning what is a relevant personality variable and set a stringent threshold (a very low multiple correlation with the Big Five) for a variable to be judged “beyond the Big Five.” But there are clearly dimensions of individual differences beyond the Big Five, particu- larly if we widen the taxonomy to include abilities, social attitudes, or appearance-related characteristics (Saucier & Goldberg, 1998). And given the indeterminate boundaries around the concept of personality, especially the ambiguity about whether externally de- ﬁned attributes should be included, it makes sense to widen the taxonomy in this manner.

Many psychologists stress that a good structural model has a strong theoretical basis. The Big Five is often described as “merely” a descriptive taxonomy because it was empirically derived; there are other structural models that come packaged with more a pri- ori theory, although the Big Five seems to be slowly accumulating theoretical perspectives post hoc (Wiggins, 1996).

In summary, the strongest performance of the Big Five seems to be on criteria like social importance, breadth, stability, cross- observer agreement, and generality across self- and peer-rating data. But the Big Five seems vulnerable to being bettered by an- other model on other criteria: causal clarity, correspondence to main lines of biological inﬂuence, predictive validity, generaliz- ability across cultures and languages (by stringent criteria), asso- ciation with theory, and comprehensiveness. However, we sorely lack comparative analyses involving multiple models with respect to all of these criteria. On the path to an optimal structural model for personality attributes, there is still much to learn.

# Conclusion

We have seen important progress in discerning the structure of personality attributes. At the very broadest level (although too broad for some purposes), this structure appears to have much in common with Osgood’s classic dimensions of affective meaning (1962), which were found in studies of the ways that diverse objects (not just persons) are judged and perceived. At a slightly less broad but more informative level are the well-known Big Five factors. The extent to which the Big Five is optimal at its level in the hierarchy is not fully determined. And at more speciﬁc levels, we ﬁnd even less consensus about an optimal model for the classiﬁcation and organization of personality attributes. Much remains unresolved, and therefore it is important to reﬂect on the range of criteria by which structural models can be compared—in other words, what makes a structural model good. Although the Big Five model seems to perform strongly on some criteria, on others it seems more vulnerable to being superseded eventually by alternative models. Future models may well be more comprehensive, more widely generalizable across languages and cultures, and associated with measures that are more highly predictive of a wide array of useful criteria.

The Happy Worker Hypotheses About the Role of Positive Affect in Worker Productivity Richard E. Lucas Ed Diener

The link between happiness and worker productivity has been called the Holy Grail of industrial psychology (Landy, 1989). Es- tablishing that such a link exists would demonstrate the possibility of non-zero-sum interactions (R. Wright, 2000) between labor and management: an organization could increase productivity simply by increasing the happiness and satisfaction of its employees, and both organizations and employees would beneﬁt. But the empiri- cal evidence for the association between happiness and productivity has been as elusive as the relation itself is desirable. A series of qual- itative and quantitative reviews (Brayﬁeld & Crockett, 1955; Iaffal- dano & Muchinsky, 1985; Vroom, 1964) showed that the association between happiness and productivity is trivial. These reviews have led some researchers to relegate the “notion of the happy-productive worker to the folklore of management—as an unsubstantiated claim of practitioners and the popular press” (Wright & Staw, 1999, p. 1). In recent years, however, there has been a resurgence of in- terest in the happy worker; researchers have conducted more care- ful analyses of existing studies, developed new paradigms for testing the relation, and modiﬁed the original job satisfaction– productivity hypothesis. For example, Judge, Thoresen, Bono, and

Patton (2001) suggested that the meta-analysis of Iaffaldano and Muchinsky (1985), which found an average correlation of .17 be- tween satisfaction and performance, underestimated the true cor- relation. In their updated meta-analysis, Judge et al. found a higher correlation of .30. Other researchers have suggested that positive affect and positive emotions (Baron, 1990; Cote, 1999; George & Brief, 1992; Staw & Barsade, 1993; Wright & Staw, 1999) are more likely than job satisfaction to make workers more productive. In this chapter, we examine the assumptions underlying the happiness-productivity relation and propose hypotheses about the ways in which affect can lead to more or less productive workers depending on the tasks.

# Deﬁnition of Happiness

Before we can determine whether happy workers are productive workers, we must clarify what we mean when we say that a worker is happy. Although the term happiness is easily understood by psy- chologists and laypeople alike, it is vague and can encompass a number of distinct constructs that result from different processes, have different correlates, and often have different effects. For this reason, we recommend that researchers who are interested in sub- jective feelings of well-being and happiness focus on one or more of four separable components of happiness at work (Diener, Suh, Lucas, & Smith, 1999). In this chapter, we use the terms happiness or well-being in general terms but refer to more speciﬁc constructs when discussing speciﬁc research ﬁndings and hypotheses.

The ﬁrst two of these components, positive and negative affect, reﬂect a person’s affective well-being. Positive affect refers to emo- tions and moods such as happiness, joy, excitement, and energy; negative affect refers to emotions and moods such as sadness, anx- iety, fear, and anger. Although semantically these two clusters of emotion terms appear to reﬂect opposite poles of the same di- mension, research has shown that positive and negative affect are at least separable (Diener & Emmons, 1984; Lucas, Diener, & Suh, 1996) and perhaps orthogonal (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988; but see Russell, 1980, for an opposing viewpoint). Furthermore, pos- itive and negative affect have distinct patterns of correlations with personality traits (Costa & McCrae, 1980) and speciﬁc behaviors

# 32 PERSONALITY AND WORK

(Clark & Watson, 1988). Therefore, it is necessary to measure and study positive and negative affect separately.

It is also important to note that the nature of affective con- structs changes depending on the time frame in which they are measured. Researchers often distinguish between emotions, which are short-lived reactions to distinct events (Frijda, 1999), and moods, which are longer-lasting feelings that are not necessarily tied to a speciﬁc stimulus (Morris, 1999). In addition, research has shown stable individual differences in the tendency to experience positive and negative emotions and moods, and these affective dispositions are often captured when affect is measured over very long periods of time (Tellegen, 1985). We use the terms emotions, moods, and affective dispositions to refer to short-term reactions, long- lasting noncontingent feelings, and stable dispositions, respectively. We also recommend that organizational researchers explicitly state which component of affective experience they are trying to cap- ture because the different components may have different impli- cations for organizational outcomes (Ledford, 1999; Wright & Staw, 1999).

The third and fourth components of subjective well-being that are relevant to the happy-worker hypothesis reﬂect cognitive judg- ments of satisfaction with one’s life and one’s job. Cognitive judgments of life satisfaction reﬂect conscious evaluations of the conditions of one’s life and are separable from (though related to) the amount of positive and negative affect that one experiences on a day-to-day basis (Lucas et al., 1996). Similarly, judgments of job satisfaction reﬂect conscious attitudes toward one’s job (Judge et al., 2001). Although job satisfaction measures are inﬂuenced by the conditions that exist in one’s job, they are also inﬂuenced by one’s affective disposition and overall life satisfaction (Judge, Locke, & Durham, 1997). Therefore, researchers must be careful not to interpret job satisfaction measures as a proxy measure for the actual conditions of one’s job. However, the moderate corre- lation between life satisfaction and job satisfaction does not pre- clude job satisfaction measures from providing unique information about an employee’s attitudes toward his or her job, attitudes that may have distinct implications for productivity beyond the effects of life satisfaction or affective well-being.

# THE HAPPY WORKER 33

It is also likely that there are additional traits and dispositions related to affective and cognitive well-being and with implications for productivity. For example, Judge and his colleagues (Judge, Erez, & Bono, 1998; Judge et al., 1997) argued that a set of self- concept personality variables (which they call core self-evaluations) is important for worker productivity. Speciﬁcally, they noted that self-esteem, generalized self-efﬁcacy, locus of control, and neu- roticism are important predictors of performance. Many of these variables are conceptually related to happiness and exhibit mod- erate to strong correlations with well-being measures (Lucas et al., 1996). Although there is conceptual overlap, these traits may af- fect performance and productivity through different mechanisms than do affect and satisfaction. For this reason, we restrict the focus of this chapter to affect and well-being and only occasionally dis- cuss ﬁndings from this related literature.

# Deﬁnition of Productivity

Subjective well-being research paints a complex picture of the happy worker. A single employee could simultaneously experience high levels of positive affect, average levels of negative affect, and low levels of job or life satisfaction, and each of these components of well-being could have distinct implications for productivity. Un- fortunately, the complexities of research on the happy-productive worker do not end there. It is also clear that the outcome or crite- rion variable of interest, worker productivity, is multifaceted and complex. Productivity has been operationally deﬁned in a variety of ways, ranging from objective measures including worker output, efﬁciency, turnover, and absenteeism, to more subjective measures, including supervisor ratings. Many of these different measures of productivity and performance do not correlate very highly (Meyer & Gupta, 1995). In addition, some researchers have suggested that happiness and satisfaction are more likely to affect organizational citizenship behaviors than direct measures of productivity and that these citizenship behaviors may have important positive implica- tions for the organization (George & Brief, 1992).

As we shall see, different components of happiness and well- being are likely to inﬂuence these different forms of productivity

# 34 PERSONALITY AND WORK

in very different ways. In addition, certain forms of happiness may be related to certain types of halo effects, in which happy people are liked more and rated as being more productive even when there are no objective differences in productivity. Therefore, it will be necessary, when formulating and testing hypotheses, to state ex- plicitly which form of productivity should be related to each com- ponent of well-being. Ideally, a variety of objective and subjective measures of productivity would be used to provide the most con- vincing tests of the happy worker hypothesis.

## Mechanisms Underlying the Happy-Productive Worker Hypothesis

As Judge et al. (2001) pointed out in their review of the job satis- faction and productivity literature, early formulations of the happy- productive worker hypothesis were based on theories developed in the social psychological attitudes literature. These early formula- tions posited that job satisfaction is an attitude, attitudes lead to be- havior, and therefore employees who have a positive attitude toward their job will engage in positive behaviors, which should result in higher productivity. In this version of the happy-productive worker hypothesis, happiness and satisfaction should result in higher pro- ductivity regardless of the nature of the tasks being performed.

Subsequent research has complicated this simple formulation. First, researchers discovered that job satisfaction measures tap more than just attitudes toward one’s job. These measures also re- ﬂect temporary mood states and stable individual differences in af- fective predisposition and overall life satisfaction. In addition, researchers’ understanding of moods and underlying affective dis- positions has become increasingly sophisticated. Rather than see- ing affect and satisfaction simply as reactions to the objective events and conditions that a person experiences, researchers who are ex- amining subjective well-being have begun to realize that emotions and satisfaction can be functional and adaptive (Buss, 1991; Fredrickson, 1998). Furthermore, it seems likely that different forms of well-being have different functions, and thus different ef- fects on life outcomes. With this increased complexity comes a need for more speciﬁc hypotheses about the effects of happiness

# THE HAPPY WORKER 35

on productivity. This speciﬁcity has only begun to be incorporated into organizational research.

## Speciﬁc Effects of Happiness and Well-Being

We often think of satisfaction and emotions as the end result of a valenced event: when something pleasant happens, we feel satis- faction, happiness, and joy, and when something unpleasant hap- pens, we experience dissatisfaction, anger, depression, or fear. In the work context, this means that employees will feel happy when work conditions are good and unhappy when work conditions are bad. Yet careful analysis of the nature of emotion suggests that emotions can play a much more complicated role in the way we ap- proach the world and the speciﬁc actions we take in reaction to events. Frijda (1999), for example, views emotions as more than just a feeling of pleasure or pain combined with an appraisal of an object or event as good or bad. He argued that emotions have three additional components: action readiness, or the readiness for changes in behavior toward the environment, autonomic arousal, and cognitive activity changes. Although each of these components is elicited in reaction to some stimulus, they also prepare us to deal with the stimulus in a speciﬁc way. Fear and anger, for example, have distinct patterns of action readiness, autonomic arousal, and cognitive activity changes; we will act very differently toward an un- pleasant stimulus depending on whether we feel fear or anger.

Interestingly, although many different negative emotions can be distinguished based on the unique pattern of these components, it appears that positive emotions are relatively undifferentiated and often do not have explicit action tendencies (Fredrickson, 1998). However, in her “Broaden and Build Model,” Fredrickson held that most positive emotions can be described as promoting a tendency to increase and diversify one’s resources in a general way. So al- though happiness may not lead to a speciﬁc action tendency in the same way that fear leads to a desire to ﬂee, positive affect may lead to behaviors that serve to broaden and build one’s social, material, and cognitive resources. Because the tendency to develop these re- sources has important implications for work behavior and because positive emotions comes closest to what we mean by happiness, we

# 36 PERSONALITY AND WORK

focus most of our discussion on the effects of positive affect on worker productivity.

In the next sections, we review the evidence for speciﬁc effects

# of happiness and well-being.

## Social Relationships, Cooperation, and Helping Behavior

Perhaps the most robust ﬁnding in the study of subjective well-being is that affect and satisfaction are moderately to strongly correlated with a variety of social variables. For example, researchers have re- peatedly shown that the personality trait of extraversion (which re- ﬂects the degree to which people enjoy and feel comfortable in social situations) is strongly correlated with subjective well-being. Lucas and Fujita (2000) showed that the meta-analytically derived average correlation between extraversion and positive affect is .37, that this correlation often rises to .80 when multiple measures of extraversion and pleasant affect are used to model the relation, and that the relation is not due to methodological artifacts such as response sets or item overlap in extraversion and pleasant affect scales. Lucas, Diener, Grob, Suh, and Shao (2000) showed that the relation is robust and consistent across a variety of cultures. Other researchers have shown that it is not just feelings of sociability that are related to well-being. Social activity itself is correlated with pos- itive affect, both between persons and within persons over time (Clark & Watson, 1988; Lucas, 2000; Okun, Stock, Haring, & Wit- ter, 1984).

One interpretation of these ﬁndings is that social activity and personality traits that promote social activity cause happiness and well-being. However, an equally plausible alternative—and one with an increasing amount of empirical support—is that positive affect actually causes people to engage in and enjoy social contact. For example, Isen (1970) and Cunningham (1988a) found that peo- ple who experienced a positive mood induction were more likely than those who did not to engage in social contact (including ini- tiating conversation and disclosing personal information). Diener, Lyubomirsky, and King (2001) suggested at least three reasons that positive affect would foster positive interpersonal relationships. First, positive affect appears to make people like other people

# THE HAPPY WORKER 37

more (see, for example, Gouaux, 1971; Lyubomirsky & Tucker, 1998; Mayer, Mamberg, & Volanth, 1988), resulting in happy indi- viduals’ seeking out social contact and being more sensitive and at- tentive to those with whom they interact (Cunningham, 1988a; Isen, 1970). Second, people like happy people better than they like unhappy people (Diener & Fujita, 1995; Harker & Keltner, 2001; King & Napa, 1998), making it more likely that happy people will experience positive social relationships. Finally, the signs of hap- piness, laughter and smiling, indicate that one is friendly and open, and this signal invites others to become engaged.

In addition to this general tendency for happy people to be more socially engaged than unhappy people, a number of more speciﬁc effects of happiness lead to positive social interactions, and these effects have particularly important implications for happi- ness at work. For example, happy people appear to be more help- ful and altruistic than unhappy people. This effect has been found in studies of dispositional affect as well as experimentally induced affect, and it has been found using a variety of techniques for ma- nipulating mood and a variety of measures of helpfulness and al- truism (see Diener et al., 2001, for a review). Carlson, Charlin, and Miller (1988) conducted a meta-analysis of studies examining the relation between positive mood and helping behavior and found evidence supporting four potential mechanisms underlying the re- lation. First, they suggested that a person who feels happy also feels efﬁcacious and resource laden, and therefore is likely to share those resources with others. Second, they found evidence that helping behavior helps to prolong positive moods. Third, there was evidence that helping behavior is a by-product of other effects of pleasant moods, such as increased liking for others. And ﬁnally, they suggested that pleasant moods may cause people to feel a greater sense of interdependence and cooperation with others.

The suggestion of Carlson et al. (1988) that helping behaviors result from increased feelings of cooperation indicates that coop- eration itself may be an additional beneﬁt of pleasant affect. Carnevale and Isen (1986), for example, showed that people are more cooperative after experiencing a pleasant mood induction. Hertel, Neuhof, Theuer, and Kerr (2000) questioned the general- izability of this ﬁnding, however, and suggested that Carnevale and Isen’s interpretation of participants’ behavior as cooperative was

# 38 PERSONALITY AND WORK

incorrect. Hertel et al. argued that happy people are more likely to use heuristics to guide behavior (a possibility we discuss in more detail later in the chapter), and apparent cooperation may result from the use of a heuristic in which people simply respond in kind to interaction partners. According to Hertel et al., happy people are more likely to do what their partner is doing, and when their partner is acting cooperatively, the happy person will too. When the partner is acting uncooperatively, the happy person is likely to follow suit. Clearly, more research is needed to determine the ef- fect of happiness on cooperative behavior. Happy people usually do tend to like other people and help other people more than do unhappy people. Thus, it would make sense that happy people are more cooperative as well. However, this may depend on the task they are performing and the speciﬁc behaviors of their interaction partners.

Implications for Work and Productivity Happy workers experience greater social rewards than unhappy work- ers do. They are more likely than unhappy workers to like and be liked by their coworkers, and this greater liking may result in greater helping behavior from the happy worker and toward the happy worker. Thus, worker productivity could beneﬁt from greater hap- piness in at least two types of jobs: (1) those in which pleasant so- cial contact is a direct measure of job performance (for example, in customer service ﬁelds) and (2) those in which high levels of help and cooperation are required for successful performance.

There is some indirect support for each of these hypotheses. For example, Barrick and Mount (1991) found that extraversion (a trait that is moderately to strongly correlated with positive af- fect) is positively correlated with job performance in jobs that re- quire social interaction, and Mount, Barrick, and Stewart (1998) found that extraversion was correlated with performance in jobs that required cooperation. In addition, organizational citizenship behaviors, which often have a social component, may be inﬂu- enced by levels of positive affect (George & Brief, 1992; Organ, 1988), and these behaviors may have important implications for overall organizational effectiveness. In jobs with few social re- quirements, happiness may play less of a role.

# THE HAPPY WORKER 39

The greater sociability of happy people may have drawbacks as well. In occupations that do not require social contact, the desire for social rewards may be a distraction. Too much “water-cooler talk” or other unnecessary social contact may result in lower pro- ductivity. In fact, Furnham and Miller (1997) found that although extraverted sales employees were more likely than introverted em- ployees to be rated as high performers, young extraverts (who are likely to be dispositionally happy) were also absent most frequently. Furnham and Miller opined that this may be due to boredom and the fact that extraverts wanted to take days off to do activities that they found more exciting. At the team level, Barry and Stewart (1997) found that the percentage of extraverts within a team af- fected that team’s performance. Although having some extraverts on a team was beneﬁcial for performance (they argued that a mix of half extraverts and half introverts was ideal), too many extraverts was detrimental (perhaps because too many extraverts resulted in team members jockeying for control).

We must caution that the greater interpersonal attractiveness of happy people may lead to the perception that they are more productive when productivity is measured using supervisor ratings, a perception that may have real implications for the happy indi- vidual. For example, Burger and Caldwell (2000) found that job applicants high in positive affect were more likely to obtain follow- up interviews when seeking a job than were applicants who were low in positive affect. However, this perception may also be incor- rect. Therefore, researchers who are interested in actual produc- tivity must make sure to operationalize productivity in such a way that it cannot be inﬂuenced by likeability.

# Energy and Activity

Research on the structure of positive affect suggests that feeling good is strongly associated with feeling energetic and active. In fact, Watson et al. (1988) argued that feelings of energy and activ- ity deﬁne the positive affect dimension (Tellegen, 1985). In addi- tion, correlational research shows that people who are high in positive affect tend to participate in more active behaviors. For ex- ample, after asking people to track their behaviors and emotions

# 40 PERSONALITY AND WORK

over time, Watson, Clark, McIntyre, and Hamaker (1992) found that people who were high in positive affectivity were more likely than those who were low in positive affectivity to engage in a variety of activities, including going to parties and museums and taking weekend trips. In addition, Csikszentmihalyi and Wong (1991) found that when students completed surveys multiple times dur- ing the day, the reports of positive affect were correlated with higher feelings of activity and greater participation in a variety of activities. There is even some experimental evidence that induced pleasant moods can lead to greater preference for active behaviors. Cunningham (1988b) found that students who had experienced a pleasant mood induction were more likely than those who did not experience the induction to express a preference for engag- ing in social and nonsocial active behaviors.

Implications for Work and Productivity Although both correlational and experimental evidence demon- strates the link between happiness and activity, the precise mech- anism underlying this relation has yet to be speciﬁed. Do happy people feel more energy than unhappy people in all types of ac- tivities, or do happy people seek out activities that are active and require energy? The answer to this question has important impli- cations for the effect of worker happiness on productivity. If hap- piness makes people feel more active in general, there would be beneﬁts in a wide variety of jobs. If happiness makes people seek out active occupations, then the beneﬁts of happiness may be lim- ited to these active jobs, and the happy worker may even be less productive in more sedate or less exciting occupations. Further- more, the happy worker’s desire for activity may lead to greater ab- senteeism because the worker is likely to seek more exciting activities (Furnham & Miller, 1997).

## Self-Conﬁdence, Motivation, and Approach Toward Goals

Recently, we argued that the facets of the extraversion personality trait are linked by their common association with positive affect (Lucas et al., 2000) and that investigators could begin to formu- late hypotheses about the functions of positive affect by carefully

# THE HAPPY WORKER 41

examining these facets. The research we have already reviewed il- lustrates the usefulness of this approach: two cardinal features of extraversion, sociability and activity, have been shown to be related to and possibly outcomes of high positive affect. A third important characteristic of extraversion is the tendency to be self-conﬁdent and to have strong approach motivation (Depue & Collins, 1999). Diener and Fujita (1995), for example, noted that students with el- evated dispositional positive affect were rated as being more self- conﬁdent and assertive by friends and family members than were people low in dispositional positive affect. Lucas et al. (1996) repli- cated this ﬁnding, showing that when self-esteem and subjective well-being variables were measured using a variety of methods of assessment (self-report, informant report, multiple forms), self- esteem was consistently correlated with life satisfaction, positive af- fect, and negative affect. Diener and Diener (1995) demonstrated that this correlation is signiﬁcantly greater than zero in a variety of nations (though it was weaker and occasionally zero in collectivist cultures).

In addition, longitudinal and experimental studies show that this correlation is due, at least in part, to the effects of well-being on self-esteem. Headey and Veenhoven (1989), using a panel de- sign, showed that there are mutual causal inﬂuences of life satis- faction on feelings of superiority and of feelings of superiority on life satisfaction. Sarason, Potter, and Sarason (1986) found that peo- ple who were asked to recall positive events from the past week (a positive mood induction) were more likely than those who did not recall these events to describe themselves in positive terms. Simi- larly, Wright and Mischel (1982) determined that induced positive mood caused respondents to report more favorable self-evaluations and more success on a laboratory task (in both retrospective as- sessments of success and expectancies for future success).

These positive self-perceptions are likely to lead to the setting of higher goals, increased approach motivation and approach be- havior, and increased task persistence (see Carver & Scheier, 1990, for a more general discussion of the interrelations among affect, goals, and approach behaviors). Emmons (1986), for example, found that people high in positive affect were more likely than peo- ple low in positive affect to report having important goals in their lives, and experimental evidence (Baron, 1990; Hom & Arbuckle,

# 42 PERSONALITY AND WORK

- 1988) shows that positive mood can have a causal effect on the goals that one sets. Positive affect also inﬂuences feelings of efﬁ- cacy in speciﬁc tasks. Baron (1990) and Saavedra and Earley (1991) demonstrated that experimentally induced positive mood increases task-relevant feelings of self-efﬁcacy. Thus, positive affect seems to have a wide-ranging effect on conﬁdence, efﬁcacy, and self-esteem.

Implications for Work and Productivity The idea that happiness can lead to greater feelings of conﬁdence along with increased motivation and persistence has been recog- nized as an important reason that happiness and productivity may be linked (George & Brief, 1992; Wright & Staw, 1999). If workers have greater self-conﬁdence, set higher goals, and pursue those goals more persistently, it seems almost inevitable that they will be more productive, a hypothesis that was supported in the meta- analysis by Sadri and Robertson (1993) on the association between self-efﬁcacy and performance. Yet these effects may depend on the extent to which the worker perceives his or her job as challenging. Self-conﬁdence should affect performance only where competence is in question or in jobs where high levels of competence are re- quired, and productivity in low-skill jobs may not beneﬁt from workers’ higher feelings of conﬁdence.

Similarly, if employees do not perceive higher productivity as an important goal, no amount of happiness will make them ap- proach this goal. Thus, some researchers have suggested that hap- piness may affect performance only when there is a clear link between performance and external rewards such as pay (see Judge et al., 2001, for a review; see Stewart, 1996, for a similar argument about the moderators of the extraversion-performance relation- ship). Providing rewards for performance presumably allows em- ployees to see high performance as an important goal, and perhaps only in these circumstances will happiness affect productivity.

Another possibility is that the increased self-conﬁdence asso- ciated with happiness may have negative consequences for pro- ductivity. In extreme forms, self-conﬁdence may lead to arrogance, dominance, competition, and insubordination. Ironically, these potential negative effects of happiness are exactly opposite those examined in the section on social relationships, cooperation, and

# THE HAPPY WORKER 43

helping behavior. Is it possible that happiness can lead to feelings of sociability, helpfulness, and cooperation and to arrogance and insubordination? We do not believe (and have found no evidence) that happiness in any form is likely to lead to these more hostile forms of self-conﬁdence. In fact, in experience sampling studies, we found that when people are feeling happy, they are likely to feel both more assertive and more affectionate (Lucas, 2000).

Organizational research may provide a useful test of these ef- fects. Certain sales jobs, for example, require individuals to be so- ciable and friendly at the same time that they are trying to take advantage of the person to whom they are selling. Does positive af- fect make them appear more friendly at the same time that they are being more cunning (the appearance of helpfulness and co- operation), or does positive affect actually make sales associates more likely to give the buyer a better deal (actual helpfulness and cooperation)? Organizational settings can provide researchers with a unique opportunity to test these separable, and perhaps con- ﬂicting, effects of positive affect.

# Health and Coping

In addition to the direct effects of happiness on work behavior, well-being may have additional indirect beneﬁts for worker pro- ductivity and organizational efﬁciency. For example, researchers have shown that happy individuals have better health and coping outcomes than do unhappy individuals. Most of the research in this area has focused on the effects of negative affect and stress on health and immune functioning, and these studies often ﬁnd that individuals with higher levels of stress and negative affect have poorer health outcomes (Salovey, Rothman, Detweiler, & Steward, 2000; Sapolsky, 1999). However, it is also possible that positive emo- tional and cognitive well-being may have similar effects or may at least moderate the effects of negative moods and stress. Correla- tional studies of mood and immune functioning over time (Stone, Cox, Valdimarsdottir, Jandorf, & Neale, 1987; Stone et al., 1994) and experimental studies of induced mood and immune func- tioning (Dillon, Minchoff, & Baker, 1986; Futterman, Kemeny, Shapiro, & Fahey, 1994) provide evidence that positive moods and immune functioning are linked.

# 44 PERSONALITY AND WORK

The effect of positive emotions on health and immune func- tioning may be direct or be mediated by processes described in previous sections. For example, Sapolsky (1999) described the de- structive effects that chronic stress has on the body and the im- mune system. He also noted that certain ways of responding to stress (including seeking social support, believing that one has control over the stressor, and having an optimistic view of one’s situation) can moderate the harmful effects of stress. Notably, many of these moderators are strongly associated with happiness and well-being. Thus, although positive affect may not play a di- rect role in immune functioning, it may moderate the effects of negative affect on health outcomes (for a similar argument, see Danner, Snowdon, & Friesen, 2001). In addition, it appears that coping processes that are often linked with happiness may help individuals overcome the negative effects of stress. Scheier, Carver, and Bridges (2001) noted that subjective well-being and related variables (including dispositional optimism) are related to suc- cessful coping strategies like active engagement. Thus, happy in- dividuals may be predisposed to cope more adaptively, allowing them to overcome the negative physical and mental health effects of stress.

Implications for Work and Productivity Differences in health and coping can have signiﬁcant and long- lasting effects on outcome variables. For one thing, positive affect may help employees to deal with stressors, and the ability to deal with stress may affect performance (see Spector, Dwyer, & Jex, 1988, for a discussion of the associations between stress and productivity). In addition, positive affect may have important indirect implica- tions for employee productivity. Both Danner et al. (2001) and Ostir, Markides, Black, and Goodwin (2000) found evidence that positive emotionality predicted longevity (though Friedman, 1999, found opposite results, perhaps because happier participants were more likely to die from risky behaviors). It would be reasonable to assume, then, that happier workers would be less likely to miss work due to illness and may be less susceptible to the negative ef- fects of stress. Cutting down on the number of illnesses would not only reduce absence, it could potentially decrease health care costs. Yet researchers must be careful to assess the impact of happiness and well-being very carefully. As the longevity literature shows, hap-

# THE HAPPY WORKER 45

piness may have different effects on distinct reasons for absen- teeism (see Kohler & Mathieu, 1993, for a discussion of the rea- sons for absenteeism). Happy workers may be less likely to miss work due to illness, but they may be more likely to miss work due to injuries from accidents or simply because they wanted to do something more exciting that day than go to work (Furnham & Miller, 1997). We should note, however, that Dalton and Mesch (1991) found that job satisfaction was related only to absence due to illness and not to absence due to other causes. Again, however, positive affect may function differently from job satisfaction, and thus we recommend that researchers go beyond simply examining outcome variables like absenteeism and try to incorporate addi- tional measures that can explain exactly why happy workers are ab- sent more or less frequently.

# Creativity

Depending on the nature of the job in which a worker is engaged, creativity may be a powerful predictor of employee productivity. Individuals who can think of novel solutions to a problem or in- novative strategies for accomplishing a task can greatly increase the productivity and efﬁciency of the organization where they work. Considerable evidence from laboratory studies shows that induced positive affect can lead to increased creativity. Isen and her col- leagues have shown that inducing a pleasant mood leads to higher scores on the Remote Associates Test (which tests the associations one makes among three seemingly unrelated words; Estrada, Isen, & Young, 1994) and to more unusual responses in a word associa- tion task (Isen, Johnson, Mertz, & Robinson, 1985). Other re- searchers have shown that induced positive affect leads to the use of more creative strategies when estimating correlations (Sinclair & Mark, 1995), the listing of more unusual categories in a sorting task (Hirt, Melton, McDonald, & Harackiewicz, 1996; Murray, Sujan, Hirt, & Sujan, 1990), and the listing of more unusual ex- emplars of a category (Greene & Noice, 1988). Positive affective dispositions seem to have similar effects in laboratory tests of cre- ativity: Cacha (1976) found that happy, relaxed, and bold children tended to score high in creativity.

When we move outside the laboratory, the evidence is slightly more complicated. A number of researchers have noted that creative

# 46 PERSONALITY AND WORK

artists often have bipolar disorder (Andreasen, 1987; Goodwin & Jamison, 1990; Richards, Kinney, Lunde, Benet, & Merzel, 1988) and that creative episodes often occur when the person is in a hypomanic (mildly manic) as opposed to depressive state (Richards, 1994; Richards & Kinney, 1990). This ﬁnding supports the notion that high positive affect is associated with creativity. But Feist (1998) noted that the personality traits that predicted creativity among artists were different from those that predicted creativity among sci- entists, and so creativity may be multidimensional and inﬂuenced by multiple factors. More research must be conducted before we can determine whether all types of creativity are related to and inﬂu- enced by positive affect and feelings of well-being.

Implications for Work and Productivity Fredrickson (1998) holds that happiness signals that one is safe and secure. This feeling may then prompt individuals to be play- ful and to try new things, a tendency that may result in novel solu- tions to problems and creative new ideas. However, creativity and playfulness may be adaptive only when workers have the freedom to play and when novel solutions are likely to increase perfor- mance. Certain tasks must be accomplished by following a precise set of guidelines, and the desire to try new things in these tasks may in fact result in decreased efﬁciency and perhaps even more mis- takes. Thus, before researchers can determine whether the increased creativity that happy people exhibit will increase productivity, they must determine whether creative, playful approaches to a job will be helpful or detrimental to the overall functioning of their orga- nization (for a similar interactional approach to understanding the associations between creativity and the traits of openness and con- scientiousness, see George & Zhou, 2001).

# Judgment and Decision Making

The literature on judgment and decision making presents a com- plicated picture of the cognitive processes that happy and unhappy individuals are likely to use. On the one hand, numerous studies show that happy individuals are less likely than neutral or sad in- dividuals to evaluate the quality of arguments (Bless, Bohner, Schwarz, & Strack, 1990; Mackie & Worth, 1989) and are more likely

# THE HAPPY WORKER 47

to rely on stereotypes and preexisting judgments (Edwards & Weary, 1993; Meloy, 2000). These studies suggest that happy people are less careful and less analytical than unhappy people, which leads to more frequent errors and greater reliance on stereotypes and biases. On the other hand, in certain conditions (particularly when more per- sonally relevant or more ecologically valid tasks are used), happy people have been shown to be more efﬁcient in their cognitive pro- cessing. Baron (1990), for example, found that people who had ex- perienced a positive mood induction were more likely than those who did not to use an efﬁcient strategy in a clerical coding task, and Isen and Means (1983) showed that in a decision-making task, participants in a positive mood condition were more likely to ignore information that they had previously seen, resulting in a more efﬁ- cient strategy. In addition, Bodenhausen, Kramer, and Süsser (1994) found that participants in a positive mood condition could over- come their stereotypes if they were told that they would be held ac- countable for their decisions.

Resolving the discrepancies in the literature has required emo- tion researchers to consider the function and effects of positive moods more carefully. Many emotion theorists now believe that positive moods are not tied to particular types of processing. In- stead, moods may provide information about the conditions in the world around us, and it is that information that inﬂuences the choice of cognitive processing (Martin, Ward, Achee, & Wyer, 1993). Speciﬁcally, positive moods signify that things are going well, and therefore decisions can be made more quickly, less carefully, and with less concern about potential risks (Bless et al., 1996). As a result, people in positive moods will be likely to use heuristics to perform tasks. This results in more errors when attention to detail is required, but more efﬁcient strategies when tasks are less difﬁ- cult or more information needs to be synthesized.

Implications for Work and Productivity The research on judgment and decision making illustrates that there are situations where a positive mood can lead to riskier de- cisions and less careful processing of available information. For jobs that require vigilance, caution, and careful consideration of all information, happy individuals may be less productive than less happy workers. Although happy individuals can sometimes over- come these deﬁcits, it is unclear exactly when this occurs.

# 48 PERSONALITY AND WORK

The increased vigilance of the unhappy worker does, however, have a trade-off: these workers may not be as efﬁcient or as able to deal with complicated tasks as the happy individual. Happy work- ers may adopt more efﬁcient processing strategies and more ef- fective heuristics that allow them to accomplish complicated tasks very quickly, even if they are more likely to make errors. Thus, happy people may be able to engage in multitasking and other complicated tasks more effectively.

## Job Characteristics That May Interact with Happiness

Based on current research on the functions of moods and emo- tions, we argue that any associations between happiness and pro- ductivity will not arise simply from an attitude-behavior link. In addition, although there are many general effects of well-being that may lead to slightly higher productivity, we do not expect many of these effects to be large. Instead, we believe that the most impor- tant effects of happiness and well-being on worker productivity are complex and varied, and most will interact with the nature of the tasks being performed. In this section, we speculate on the nature of job characteristics that could possibly interact with happiness to result in a more productive worker.

# Social Contact

The most robust ﬁnding in the literature on the effects of happi- ness and well-being is that happy people enjoy, feel more conﬁdent in, and even attract social contact. This should make happy work- ers perform better in jobs that require social contact. Customer service jobs, sales jobs, and other occupations in which employees deal directly with customers and the general public will beneﬁt from the happy worker’s greater likeability and greater social com- petence. In addition, occupations that rely on teamwork and co- operation may beneﬁt from employees with higher levels of positive affect. But because positive affect will likely increase em- ployees’ desire for social contact, greater positive affect may be detrimental in jobs where too much social contact is distracting and unproductive.

# THE HAPPY WORKER 49

Interestingly, it may often be the case that for the same task, in- creased sociability may be both beneﬁcial and detrimental at the same time. Happy sales employees probably beneﬁt from increased likeability and greater sensitivity to the needs of their customers, but their greater feelings of helpfulness and sociability may also prevent them from making self-serving deals that are in the best interest of the organization. Similarly, happy technical support staff working for computer software or hardware companies may pro- vide a more pleasant experience for customers seeking help, but these same workers may spend more time chatting, resulting in a less efﬁcient process. In this case, two measures of employee pro- ductivity, customer satisfaction and amount of time spent per call, may conﬂict. It is unclear which measure will be affected more by differences in happiness, and therefore it is essential that re- searchers pay careful attention to the speciﬁc measures of pro- ductivity that are used, along with the speciﬁc mechanisms that lead to higher or lower productivity for the happy worker.

# Negative Feedback and Failure

Happy workers are more likely to feel self-conﬁdent and persist in their efforts, even in the face of failure. Jobs vary in the extent to which individuals are likely to experience failure or receive negative feedback. For jobs where such feedback is frequent, happy workers may be more resilient and persistent than unhappy workers. For ex- ample, trial lawyers regularly face situations that have a clear winner and a clear loser. Lawyers who can persist in spite of the potential for failure and the actual experience of failure will be more likely to succeed in the future. Whenever jobs have the potential for frequent experience of failure or negative feedback, happy workers may have an advantage over unhappy ones. Where there is little of this feed- back, happiness and self-conﬁdence may have little beneﬁt.

# Structure

It is also likely that in highly structured and routinized jobs, affect is less likely to have effects on productivity. These jobs provide less op- portunity for self-conﬁdence, goal setting, and creativity to inﬂuence productivity because the procedures for accomplishing the job are strictly deﬁned. Furthermore, in occupations where such structure

# 50 PERSONALITY AND WORK

and routine are required, increased positive affect may lead to greater playfulness, which can decrease productivity. Thus, we hy- pothesize that for more unstructured jobs such as chief executive ofﬁcers and managers, affect can have an important impact on pro- ductivity. For highly prescripted jobs, affect should have less inﬂu- ence on performance. In support of this idea, Barrick and Mount (1993) found that extraversion was more strongly correlated with performance in jobs with greater autonomy.

# Novelty and Complexity

For jobs that require novel responses, the happy worker may be able to synthesize information quickly and develop creative new strategies that can have a positive impact on productivity and per- formance. For complex and mentally challenging jobs, happy workers may be more likely to ignore irrelevant material and to use effective heuristics to simplify tasks. This should result in more ef- ﬁcient strategies and higher productivity. Less happy workers may be slower and more careful, resulting in an inability to make deci- sions and the use of overly cautious strategies.

# Consequences of Errors

In some jobs, the cost of an occasional error is quite small; perhaps there are no important outcomes that result from the task or self- correcting mechanisms catch errors. In other jobs, however, errors are very costly, and constant vigilance is necessary. We hypothesize that happy people, who tend to be less vigilant than less happy peo- ple, may be at somewhat of a disadvantage when the costs of errors are quite high. Heart surgeons who must constantly monitor their actions and the conditions around them and mechanics checking jet engines for hairline cracks may be more careful in their activi- ties when they have lower levels of positive affect. Thus, the con- sequences of errors and the potential for errors may interact with happiness in predicting worker productivity.

# Conclusion

Positive affect, negative affect, life satisfaction, and job satisfaction are not simply attitudes about one’s life and one’s job. These com- ponents of happiness and well-being play a functional role in the

# THE HAPPY WORKER 51

choices that people make and the behaviors in which they engage. The research reviewed in this chapter shows that happy individu- als are often more sociable, active, self-conﬁdent, healthier, more creative, and more likely to use quick and efﬁcient strategies for processing information than are less happy individuals. Thus, happy individuals appear to have many advantages when interact- ing with the world. However, the speciﬁc impact that these differ- ences will have on worker productivity likely depends on the nature of the worker’s task. Happy workers may be more sociable, but whether this beneﬁts productivity depends on the precise nature of their task. In addition, happy workers may be creative and efﬁcient when performing complicated tasks, but this creativity and efﬁ- ciency may come at the expense of caution and vigilance, which may result in costly errors. Thus, researchers interested in happy worker hypotheses must carefully examine the nature of the tasks in which workers will be engaged before making predictions about whether the hypothesis should hold.

Future research must determine whether selecting employees based on levels of happiness can increase productivity. Positive af- fect, negative affect, and life satisfaction are stable over time, and thus employers may want to match workers with tasks that are suit- able for their dispositional level of happiness. However, much more research needs to be conducted on the speciﬁc interactions that occur before such selection procedures can be used conﬁ- dently. Furthermore, even with the considerable stability in well- being levels, it is possible that programs to increase happiness may also be effective (Fordyce, 1977, 1983). If this is the case, research will be needed to determine whether selecting happy people or in- creasing overall levels of happiness provides the biggest boost to productivity.

In addition to suggesting some avenues for future research, we hope that we have been able to emphasize the importance of ex- amining speciﬁc components of well-being, multiple objective and subjective indicators of productivity, and explicit mechanisms that can link the two. Evidence shows that different indicators of pro- ductivity may be uncorrelated (Meyer & Gupta, 1995) and may be differentially related to different forms of well-being. Furthermore, when researchers specify precise mechanisms linking speciﬁc com- ponents of happiness and speciﬁc forms of productivity, they can test each link in the chain from one construct to the other. This

# 52 PERSONALITY AND WORK

provides stronger evidence for the theories and prevents misinter- pretation of the evidence. As studies of absenteeism and health have shown, happy workers may be more likely than unhappy workers to miss work due to illness but more likely than unhappy workers to miss work due to injuries or the desire to do something more fun. Therefore, studies that examine absenteeism without study- ing the reasons for it may not provide useful evidence about the processes underlying the happiness-absenteeism relation. Research- ers who specify the precise mechanisms underlying the happy worker hypothesis in a speciﬁc context will be able to provide a stronger test of their theory.

The importance of the happy worker hypothesis may be in- creasing as the nature of work changes. Howard (1995) noted that as we have moved into a postindustrial information age, the focus of work has shifted from making products to managing and pro- viding information. This shifting focus has resulted in increased numbers of service jobs, greater reliance on teamwork and the sharing of information, and higher involvement by workers. Many industries change quickly, and successful organizations adapt and provide novel products, services, and processes. These changes are transforming the nature of work in ways that have the potential to increase the inﬂuence of happiness and well-being on worker pro- ductivity. Therefore, the resurgence of interest in the happy worker hypothesis may be well timed to deal with the changing nature of work in the postindustrial information age.

# CHAPTER 3

Situational and Motivational Inﬂuences on Trait-Behavior Relationships Murray R. Barrick Terence R. Mitchell Greg L. Stewart

Social cognitive theory suggests that a full understanding of human nature requires the study of three components: the person, the sit- uation, and behavior (Bandura, 1986). A great deal of research in industrial/organizational psychology over the past hundred years has focused on the ﬁrst component: the person. Considerable work has been invested in identifying which traits characterize an indi- vidual’s personality and thereby make him or her different from other people. Today, a consensus has emerged that the second-order structure of personality consists of ﬁve (plus or minus two) major personality dimensions, known as the Big Five. In the past decade, a number of meta-analyses (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, & McCloy, 1990; Hurtz & Donovan, 2000; Salgado, 1997) have shown that two of the ﬁve personality dimensions, Con- scientiousness and Emotional Stability, predict performance out- comes in many, if not all, jobs, while the other three personality traits (Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience) are re- lated to performance in some jobs or for speciﬁc criteria.

## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 61

Less attention has been devoted to developing theory and re- search related to the inﬂuence of situations (Hattrup & Jackson, 1996; Murtha, Kanfer, & Ackerman, 1996; Peters & O’Connor, 1980; Stewart & Barrick, in press). Although there has been more discussion on these issues in the personality literature, there is a lack of theory related to the work context (Hattrup & Jackson, 1996). This is surprising given evidence that relationships between personality and performance are stronger when one accounts for the context a priori (Tett, Jackson, Rothstein, & Reddon, 1994). In short, meta-analytic true-score correlations between personality measures and performance tend to be signiﬁcantly larger if re- searchers use their understanding of the job and organizational context (conﬁrmatory versus exploratory analyses) to develop hy- potheses about which personality traits are expected to be related to performance. Researchers thus seem capable of specifying which traits will be related to performance by accounting for situational demands (the job context). However, this approach provides no in- formation about the process whereby the situation inﬂuences the re- lationship or about which aspects of the situation are crucial for moderating relationships with personality.

To advance research related to the situation, we need theory about how different settings inﬂuence relationships between per- sonality and behavior. Although some work in the ﬁeld of leadership has been done matching contexts and leader attributes (Fiedler, 1967), less work has been done in the ﬁeld of motivation (Mitchell, 1997), which is particularly relevant for research on personality. We thus need to develop methods for conceptualizing the basic kinds of situations or, alternatively, identifying what variables are useful for comparing one situation with another. As a step toward this theoretical development, we focus on the distinction between competitive and cooperative situations. Although we agree that more dimensions will ultimately deﬁne work settings, these two have been shown to capture key differences in the social dynamics of work environments (Stewart & Barrick, in press).

The third component of the study of human nature involves be- havior. Job analysts and others have devoted considerable effort to describing behavior at work (Harvey, 1991). In fact, Campbell (1991) argues that behavior is the only appropriate representation of per- formance in work contexts. However, there has not been enough

# 62 PERSONALITY AND WORK

theoretical and empirical work linking individual differences (cog- nitive abilities, personality traits, and interests) with job behavior con- structs (delegating and coordinating, exchanging information, operating machines), particularly through well-grounded theories of motivation. According to social cognitive theory, an understanding of relationships between individual differences and job behavior re- quires an understanding of the cognitive processes that link them.

As Davis and Luthans (1980, p. 285) have pointed out, a main focus of social cognitive theory is “to investigate the mediating ef- fects that covert cognitive processes have on an otherwise observ- able sequence of events.” Cognition thus becomes the mediator that explains how situational factors and individual differences get translated into behavioral responses (Ajzen & Fishbein, 1980; Manz & Stewart, 1997). A major purpose of this chapter is to advance re- search focusing on work behavior by explicitly describing the cog- nitive processes that link personality traits to that behavior. These cognitive processes reﬂect cognitive-motivational work intentions, which reﬂect basic goals that people pursue at work. These inten- tions provide a goal-focused explanation of why certain personal- ity traits are associated with high levels of work performance.

Figure 3.1 presents a social cognitive model that we will de- velop to describe how traits, situations, and cognitive-motivational work intentions relate to each other and thereby inﬂuence behav- ior. As shown, personality traits link to work intentions, which in turn inﬂuence performance. These relationships are moderated by situational demands associated with competitive and coopera- tive settings. To develop the model, we discuss the cognitive moti- vational work intentions through which personality affects behavior, speciﬁcally deﬁne and explore the mediating mechanisms of mo- tivation on the personality-performance relationship, and then dis- cuss the inﬂuence of situational demands and opportunities on these relationships.

## How Do Distal Personality Traits Relate to Job Performance?

In the past decade, our understanding regarding the nature of re- lationships between personality traits and performance has been considerably enhanced by the study of speciﬁc personality con-

structs, typically based on the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of person- ality, and meta-analytic research. These studies reveal that two of the ﬁve personality traits, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stabil- ity, are universal predictors of overall job performance across nearly all jobs (Barrick, Mount, & Judge, 2001). In contrast, the other three traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness to Experi- ence) are contingent predictors of performance (Barrick et al., 2001). These traits relate to success in only a few jobs or with a few criteria. For example, Extraversion has been found to be related to performance in jobs with a large competitive social component

# 64 PERSONALITY AND WORK

(sales, managers). Agreeableness is a valid predictor of perfor- mance in jobs with cooperative demands or opportunities (use of work teams). Finally, Openness to Experience has not been found to relate to many outcomes of interest at work.

One explanation for the disappointing conclusions about Openness is that this trait is the least well understand personality construct in the FFM literature (Digman, 1990). Consequently, the weak relationships found to date may be attributable to an in- adequately deﬁned construct. Some researchers have even begun questioning the utility of this trait. However, recent evidence sug- gests that Openness to Experience may be related to creativ- ity (George & Zhou, 2001). Such research may eventually help illustrate the validity of this construct. However, given the current ambiguity associated with Openness, it is not contained in our model.

Moving beyond our current understanding of the relationship between speciﬁc personality traits and overall performance re- quires an exploration of the mechanisms through which these per- sonality traits inﬂuence performance. Today, most researchers assume that distal personality traits affect performance primarily through proximal motivational mediators (Barrick, Mount, & Strauss, 1993; Barrick, Stewart, & Piotrowski, 2002; Kanfer, 1991). Recent reviews of the motivation literature (Ambrose & Kulik, 1999; Mitchell & Daniels, 2002) point out that the construct cur- rently dominating the motivational literature is goals (Austin & Vancouver, 1996). Goals, combined with efﬁcacy and expectancy beliefs, have been integrated into an overarching self-regulatory, social cognitive approach to motivation that focuses on what the individual can do, wants to do, and will do in terms of future be- havior and how such beliefs and aspirations affect current action. The cognitive processes attributed to goal setting that are mo- tivationally relevant are arousal, focusing attention, and establish- ing intentions. Establishing intentions includes the allocation of effort, persistence, and some sort of task strategy. Personality vari- ables could probably inﬂuence most, if not all, of these factors. For example, goal discrepancies (distance to goal achievement) pre- sumably cause arousal and direct attention. Thus, people who are focused on accomplishing task-oriented goals but are not accom- plishing their interpersonal goals would be aroused and focused

## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 65

on this issue. They would allocate their attention on interpersonal activities that might close this gap and think about a plan (effort and persistence) to accomplish that end. It is these allocation and effort and persistence decisions that we describe as self-regulatory. Regulatory goals can be organized hierarchically as well (Cro- panzano, James, & Citera, 1992), ranging from abstract goal orien- tations or response styles (for example, motivational orientations toward achievement and afﬁliation) to midlevel goals, such as per- sonal strivings and personal projects, to more concrete goals or spe- ciﬁc performance goals complete with precise action plans. We believe that to predict relatively general performance measures, one should adopt relatively general midlevel goals. These goals are likely to reﬂect personal strivings (Emmons, 1989), which are formulated as speciﬁc means of attaining certain desired end states (to be one of the highest performers in the department, for example) at work. However, personal strivings are not so precise as to contain fully de- tailed plans and actions. They also are not so broad as to be un- necessarily vague and imprecise regarding future-directed plans. Rather, personal strivings represent broad, general intentions or motives that direct future courses of action at work. Although much research has gone into the higher-level motivational orientations (VandeWalle, 1999; Dweck, 1986) and speciﬁc task goals (Locke & Latham, 1990), less work in industrial/organizational psychology has gone into the midrange goals.

Sheldon, Elliot, Kim, and Kasser (2001) examined ten funda- mental motives that people strive to fulﬁll through satisfying events or experiences. Across three different studies, they found that mo- tives labeled as self-esteem, relatedness, autonomy, and competence were strongly related to an individual’s most satisfying experiences. This suggests that people are motivated to achieve a sense of self- respect (self-esteem), meaningful contact with others (relatedness), enhanced perceived control (autonomy), and challenging work that demonstrates their own capabilities (competence). We believe that people incorporate these fundamental motives into their goals or personal strivings.

Two of these fundamental motives, striving for self-esteem and competence, should be related to goals or personal strivings associ- ated with task achievement. Task-oriented employees have a strong desire to accomplish task-related goals as a means of expressing their

# 66 PERSONALITY AND WORK

competence and to build self-esteem (Stewart & Barrick, in press). We categorize the goals or personal strivings associated with task orientation as representing Accomplishment Striving.

Accomplishment Striving reﬂects an individual’s intention to accomplish work tasks and is expected to be characterized by high task motivation. Behaviorally, Accomplishment Striving is likely to be expressed in a way that laypeople would call “work motivation”; these employees are likely to exert considerable task effort and maintain that effort over an extended period of time. We believe that Accomplishment Striving is cognitively represented and as- sessable as intentions. It differs from typical perceptions of moti- vation, however, as it relates to a generalized, individual difference measure representing intentions to exert effort and work hard. We believe it is likely caused by many determinants, including the per- son’s personality traits and environmental features such as in- structing the person to try harder, offering incentives to perform well, or making the task meaningful or difﬁcult.

The results of Sheldon et al. (2001) also underscore that social interactions at work, or relatedness, is a fundamental motive. Re- searchers have identiﬁed two broad motivational intentions related to social interactions (Hogan & Shelton, 1998; Wiggins & Trapnell, 1996). The ﬁrst dimension captures goals directed toward obtain- ing acceptance and intimacy in personal relationships. We label this personal striving Communion Striving. At work, Communion Striving would be expressed by actions associated with “getting along with others.” The second dimension, called Status Striving, reﬂects goals directed toward obtaining power and dominance within a status hierarchy. At work, employees often achieve this by “getting ahead of others.” We think of these two constructs as sep- arate measures that comprehensively depict the social dynamics of the work setting. In some sense, this distinction is one between the vertical organizational structure (interacting with superiors and subordinates) and the horizontal structure (dealing with peers). One of the major goals of this chapter is to introduce the funda- mental difference that emerges from these two personal strivings toward relatedness. In addition, this distinction is likely to have im- portant effects at the organizational level, as well as the individual level, a topic to which we will return.

## The Effect of Personal Strivings on Personality-Performance Relationships

The three motivational constructs of Accomplishment Striving, Communion Striving, and Status Striving allow us to relate indi- vidual differences in personality to performance on a variety of jobs. In this section, we relate the four relevant personality traits to the motivational constructs.

Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are personality traits that are likely to be universal predictors of performance across a variety of jobs. To apply our motivational mediator model to the case of these two traits, we assume that both affect performance through work motivation, particularly motivation related to Ac- complishment Striving. Conscientious people set goals, are more committed to those goals, and exert more effort (Barrick et al., 1993; Gellatly, 1996). Thus, they are more “motivated” at work and strive to achieve. In contrast, neurotic employees (low in Emotional Stability) have signiﬁcantly reduced motivation at work. Emotion- ally unstable people do not see themselves as worthy, are less con- ﬁdent, are frequently distracted by worrying and become obsessed with details, and are more dissatisﬁed with themselves, their jobs, and lives. Thus, they are less motivated to accomplish tasks at work, and if they are “motivated” at all, it is to avoid failure at work. Based on this reasoning, we believe these two personality traits will relate to performance through on-task effort or Accomplishment Striv- ing at work.

The effects for Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability on performance through Accomplishment Striving should exist across jobs. First, these personality traits have been found to be universal predictors of performance. Therefore, they would be expected to be valid predictors in all or nearly all jobs, which reduces (but does not eliminate) concerns about the effect of situational demands on these relationships. Second, Accomplishment Striving is a funda- mental cognitive-motivational variable that affects behavior in all jobs; it is hard to conceive of a job where an employee’s motivation to accomplish tasks will not affect performance. This may explain why Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are universal predic- tors of performance. That is, if they are related to accomplishment

# 68 PERSONALITY AND WORK

striving, which in turn has universal applicability to work in all jobs, the expectation is that these two traits would be valid predictors in all, or nearly all, jobs.

Turning to the two interpersonal personality traits, Extraver- sion and Agreeableness are expected to affect job performance through our other two cognitive-motivational work intentions: Sta- tus Striving and Communion Striving. Lucas, Diener, Grob, Suh, and Shao (2000) demonstrate that the core features of Extraver- sion are energy, ascendance, and ambition. The primary essence of Extraversion is thus a sensitivity to obtaining rewards rather than sociability. In fact, they argue that sociability appears to be an im- portant feature of Extraversion because it provides more oppor- tunities to achieve status and rewards. Consequently, Extraversion will be related to Status Striving rather than Communion Striving. In contrast, the fundamental features of Agreeableness appear to be primarily related to afﬁliation and friendliness (Digman, 1990). Consequently, Agreeableness will be linked to personal strivings that contribute to Communion Striving and not to those related to Status Striving.

Conﬁrmation for these relationships between personality and motivational strivings is found in a recent study by Barrick et al. (2002). In a study of 164 sales representatives, Barrick et al. demon- strated that Conscientiousness (r = .39) and Emotional Stability (r = .15) were signiﬁcantly related to Accomplishment Striving. Ex- traversion was correlated with Status Striving (r = .48) and Agree- ableness with Communion Striving (r = .15). Barrick et al. also examined the links among Accomplishment Striving, Communion Striving, and Status Striving. In accordance with the model pre- sented in Figure 3.1, Accomplishment Striving and Status Striving were related to performance. Similarly, as expected, Communion Striving in this competitive sales setting, was not related to perfor- mance. Furthermore, as suggested in Figure 3.1, Status Striving me- diated the relationship between Accomplishment Striving and performance. As we explain below, we expect similar mediation through Communion Striving in cooperative settings. People thus appear to be ultimately motivated to accomplish tasks in order to achieve either communion or status, depending on their traits and the situational context.

## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 69

## How Do Situational Demands Affect the Personality-Performance Link?

An undergraduate student noted, “I am extraverted with my friends but introverted when in a large lecture classroom.” This statement, embodied by interactionists, indicates that a personal- ity trait will be a signiﬁcant predictor of behavior only in situations that are relevant to its expression and not so constrained as to dis- allow individual differences (Endler & Magnusson, 1976). To argue that situations do not matter implies that people will show power- ful cross-situational consistency of responses. Yet to respond in ex- actly the same way across time and diverse situations would be maladaptive and is likely to result in many dysfunctional behaviors. Consequently, most researchers today recognize that to predict be- havior with personality requires one to account for the situation (Kenrick & Funder, 1988). We believe personality will have its greatest effect on behavior when the situation is relevant to the trait’s expression and is weak enough to allow the person to choose how to behave in that situation (Stewart & Barrick, in press).

Although work psychologists have examined how aspects of the immediate work situation affect variance in performance (the job analytic literature), no taxonomy has been developed that incor- porates both situational and trait effects (Murtha et al., 1996) on motivational mediators. This unfortunate circumstance has long been recognized (Peters & O’Connor, 1980). Although there are many dimensions across which the work environment can be mean- ingfully categorized, here we focus on one broad aspect of situa- tions: the social setting.

# Cooperation and Competitive Demands

Research illustrates that although several dimensions of work de- sign have been identiﬁed, an important component of many, if not all, theories of work design relates to how individuals contribute to the organization through social inputs. For example, a funda- mental design feature of structural contingency theory recognizes the importance of interdependence among people in the organi- zation, particularly the vertical (the authority system) and lateral

# 70 PERSONALITY AND WORK

relationships (the informal peer system). Similarly, at the organi- zational level, several dimensions of work design have been iden- tiﬁed, but empirical research shows that many of them can be summarized by two parameters: (1) coordination or structuring of activities and (2) concentration of authority or interdependence among workers and managers (Pugh & Hickson, 1997). Thus, both individual- and organizational-level literatures on work design un- derscore the importance of determining how tasks are coordinated and controlled. These theories also assess the extent to which em- ployees depend on each other for information, materials, and rec- iprocal inputs.

Ultimately, how the organization addresses the fundamental is- sues of coordination and control at work will have a substantive im- pact on the social dynamics of that work setting. One dimension along which the social aspects of work settings differ is how the ﬁrm structures the cooperative and competitive demands and op- portunities in the organization. For example, an organization may design the job of marketing specialist so that employees work in a team that requires extensive interdependence to develop market- ing campaigns. In another ﬁrm, the marketing specialist job may be designed to work independently of others. Furthermore, this organization may encourage multiple marketing specialists to vie for limited incentives or resources by making them available only to employees who have their marketing campaigns adopted by a customer. Thus, these two work settings will fundamentally differ in their cooperative and competitive social demands.

The importance of cooperative and competitive demands is supported by research that reveals that social aspects of work are psychologically meaningful to employees. How we see ourselves is substantially inﬂuenced by how we are deﬁned in relation to oth- ers in the larger organization or society (Markus & Kitayama, 1991). Furthermore, Hogan (1996) argues that socioanalytic the- ory, which is based on an evolutionary perspective, identiﬁes two critical social dimensions that people pursue. These dimensions address how individuals strive toward getting along with others (cooperation) and getting ahead of others (competition). People are thus predisposed to distinguish work settings according to the cooperative and competitive demands and opportunities of the sit- uation. We propose that these distinctions will systematically affect

## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 71

# the strength of the relationship between relevant personality traits and work performance.

Research from an ecological perspective of personality simi- larly suggests cooperation and competition as fundamental fea- tures of environments. Central to this perspective is the concept of affordances, which Gibson (1979) deﬁnes as the fundamental util- ities or action possibilities that the physical or social environment offers. Baron and Boudreau (1987) extend this concept and argue that in social settings, the opportunity to engage in certain behav- iors is dependent on the actions of others. In particular, coopera- tive and competitive behaviors require reciprocal, coordinated behavior from others. Speciﬁcally, Baron and Boudreau suggest that “helpfulness requires a helper and a recipient, competition requires a rival, and dominance requires a subordinate” (p. 1223). Traits are thus expressed when other people in the organizational environment afford (allow and encourage) their expression. In particular, environments tend to differ on the extent to which they afford demonstrations of competitive and cooperative behavior (Baron & Boudreau, 1987).

In accordance with the ecological notion of affordances, our focus on cooperative and competitive demands is driven in part by an observation that behavior in social settings corresponds to key individual differences. The two personality traits that appear to have the strongest inﬂuence on social behavior are Extraversion and Agreeableness (Graziano, Hair, & Finch, 1997; Lucas et al., 2000). The typical extravert craves excitement, is adventurous, and tends to be assertive and dominant, as well as sociable. Thus, the social behavior of highly extraverted individuals is characterized by demonstrations of dominance and competitiveness (Lucas et al., 2000). In contrast, agreeable people are helpful, trusting, and friendly; they are cooperative and work well with others. Highly agreeable employees prefer social situations that are characterized by cooperation, close relationships, and interpersonal harmony and acceptance.

The effects of cooperative and competitive situational differ- ences on Extraversion and Agreeableness have been empirically demonstrated. In a meta-analysis, Mount, Barrick, and Stewart (1998) reported that Agreeableness was the most important per- sonality predictor of performance in jobs involving interactions

# 72 PERSONALITY AND WORK

with others ((cid:1) = .27, n = 1,491), particularly when those jobs involve interacting in teams ((cid:1) = .35, n = 678). Results from Hough’s meta- analysis (1992) support this; she found that Agreeableness corre- lated with measures of teamwork (r = .17). Agreeableness thus appears to be an important predictor of behavior in cooperative settings.

Barrick and Mount (1991) found Extraversion to be a valid predictor of performance in management and sales jobs, which have a high social component related to inﬂuencing or leading others (sales: (cid:1) = .15, n = 2,316; management: (cid:1) = .18, n = 11,335). Stewart (1996) also illustrated that Extraversion is quite sensitive to the situational inﬂuence of rewards. In this study, Extraversion was related to higher performance only on performance dimen- sions that were explicitly rewarded (new sales or customer rela- tions). Empirical ﬁndings thus suggest that Extraversion is related to performance in situations where one can acquire and maintain status (that is, in competitive situations).

# Autonomy

In addition to cooperative and competitive demands, the level of autonomy in the situation is likely to have a fundamental impact on the relationship between personality traits and performance. The nature of this effect is quite different from that attributed to the inﬂuence of cooperative or competitive social demands at work, however. In this case, autonomy relates to the extent to which the external environment constrains a person’s freedom to behave in idiosyncratic ways (Barrick & Mount, 1993; Liu & Weiss, 2000). In strong situations, the organization exerts considerable pressure or demands to induce conformity. These controlling forces press the individual to behave in a speciﬁc way or exhibit a very narrow range of behaviors. In contrast, weak situations pre- sent few demands or presses to conform. In such settings, the in- dividual determines which behaviors, if any, to undertake. The magnitude of the relationship between personality traits and be- havior is thus greater in weak situations, or settings where people can perform their jobs in idiosyncratic ways.

A few studies demonstrate that personality is more useful in predicting behavior when autonomy is high than when it is low.

## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 73

Data from 146 managers (Barrick & Mount, 1993) indicated that the predictive validity of two relevant personality predictors, Con- scientiousness and Extraversion, was greater for managers in jobs high in autonomy compared with those in jobs low in autonomy. Lee, Ashford, and Bobko (1990) also found that the degree of au- tonomy a person has in his or her job moderated the relationships between Type A behavior and job performance, job satisfaction, and somatic complaints for employees from a variety of organiza- tions. Based on these ﬁndings, we believe the degree of autonomy in the situation moderates the effects of all relevant personality pre- dictors on performance.

# The Role of Situational Factors

These situational effects are represented in the model (see Figure 3.1). First, the two interpersonal personality traits, Extraversion and Agreeableness, are expected to relate to behavior only when the relevant situational demands and opportunities are highly salient in the work setting. Speciﬁcally, Extraversion should relate to job performance only in settings that can be characterized as competitive work environments. In contrast, Agreeableness should predict performance behavior only when the work requires work- ers to cooperate. In a similar vein, Status Striving relates to per- formance only in competitive environments and Communion Striving only in cooperative settings.

The model also suggests that relevant personality traits have higher correlations with performance when the degree of auton- omy in the job is high (a weak situation). Consequently, in jobs with high autonomy, the predictive validity of Extraversion should be higher if the job is competitive and the validity of Agreeable- ness should be higher for cooperative jobs. Furthermore, two per- sonality traits, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability, are expected to be valid predictors of performance in nearly all jobs. In settings where the situational pressures are weak (high auton- omy), we expect the relationship between these traits and perfor- mance also to be higher than where autonomy is low. Thus, the level of autonomy in the job will moderate the relationship be- tween Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability with performance in all or nearly all jobs, and either Extraversion or Agreeableness

# 74 PERSONALITY AND WORK

on performance depending on the degree of cooperative or com- petitive demands at work.

The Barrick et al. (2002) study is also suggestive about the im- portance of accounting for the cooperative and competitive de- mands salient in the situation. In this study, the job (telemarketing) was characterized as one high in competitive demands (with high sales pressure and contact with the customer limited to one brief telephone interaction), but low in cooperative demands (the sales representative works alone and is not dependent on others for per- formance). Given these situational factors, Barrick et al. expected Status Striving, but not Communion Striving, to be a relevant me- diator of the personality-performance relationship. As expected, they found that Status Striving was related to performance (r = .36) and Communion Striving was not (r = −.10). More important, as predicted by the model in Figure 3.1, the major portion of the re- lationship between Extraversion and job performance was indirect through Status Striving (approximately 76 percent of the effect is mediated by Status Striving). Although Agreeableness was related to Communion Striving, neither Agreeableness nor Communion Striving was related to success in this sales job.

These results have important implications for the model. In essence, they show that relevant personality traits were related to job success through motivational mediators. Although this study was not able to contrast multiple situations (it did not include data from multiple jobs that differed in cooperative or competitive so- cial demands), it did support the linkage expected for jobs with high competitive demands.

We realize that the model is silent regarding the effect that co- operative demands may have on competitive demands, and vice versa. In fact, Figure 3.1 implies that these situational demands are relatively independent. This is not our intent. Given our limited knowledge about the nature of these relationships, particularly at work, we believe that future research should strive to clarify the re- lationship among these competing demands (the need for team- work, yet the need to be individually recognized and rewarded). For the time being, we anticipate that researchers will examine the relations among these variables in jobs that are clearly high in co- operative demands or competitive demands.

# Future Research Directions

The model that we present here focuses on the processes through which traits inﬂuence performance. A major contention of the me- diational portion of the model is that traits are expressed through broad goals, or personal strivings. Although this perspective is gen- erally supported by theory and empirical research, there are some additional ways that goals and goal properties might mediate the personality-situation relationship with behavior. For example, Mitchell and Wood (1994) point out that some goals focus on process while others focus on outcomes. People high on Agree- ableness may be more motivated by process goals, and people high on Conscientiousness may prefer outcome goals. In addition, re- search could test to see the consistency of goals preferred across different hierarchical levels. Individuals high on communion striv- ing, for example, should also embrace values reﬂecting the im- portance of interpersonal harmony at the highest level and working in teams at a lower task-speciﬁc level. Similar type consis- tency would be expected for Status Striving and Accomplishment Striving. Examinations of such consistencies and goal preferences are clearly warranted and provide a potentially fruitful path for ad- ditional research.

Another major dimension of goal-setting research focuses on whether goals should be set by the self, assigned, or set participa- tively with one’s boss. At least initially, we believe that personality factors might be related to preferences for these different strate- gies. For example, highly conscientious people might prosper with self-set goals, people high on Agreeableness might prefer the in- terpersonal process involved with participation, and emotionally stable people might prefer the concreteness and speciﬁcity of as- signed goals. Thus, the goal construct and the goal-setting process also hold promise for further research on the mediating role be- tween personality and behavior.

Sheldon and Elliot’s self-concordance model (1999) provides some interesting thoughts for guiding future research. This model suggests that people are more likely to persist at and derive well- being from goals congruent with enduring interests and values. This perspective suggests that extraverted individuals are likely to

# 76 PERSONALITY AND WORK

work hardest in environments that afford competition, whereas agreeable individuals will work hardest in cooperative environ- ments. However, Sheldon and Elliot also suggest that the attainment of self-concordant goals is key to individual well-being. Our model looks only at performance. Yet the self-concordance model sug- gests that agreeable individuals will derive satisfaction from work- ing in cooperative environments, and extraverts will be happiest in competitive environments. Future models and research can likely beneﬁt from directly examining the effects of personality not only on performance but also on employee satisfaction. More im- portant, the model should be extended to other work behaviors, including withdrawal and counterproductive behavior.

The self-concordance model also suggests that competence, autonomy, and relatedness are primary mechanisms that ensure people will persist in goal-directed behavior. Our model is similar in its assertion that greater autonomy allows agreeable and ex- traverted people to pursue goals consistent with their trait prefer- ences. The model is consistent with notions of relatedness in that it suggests that agreeable people prefer relating to others cooper- atively, whereas extraverts prefer relating competitively. The model does not, however, speciﬁcally include a focus on competence. We believe that competence is likely to have important relationships with Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Accomplishment Striving. For example, the relationship between Conscientiousness and Accomplishment Striving may be stronger if the person has high competence on the task, particularly if there is considerable autonomy in the job. We encourage future researchers to explore the nature of these relationships.

The model we present here highlights ways that situational characteristics affect the relationship between personality traits and job success. Our model emphasizes interpersonal contextual di- mensions (competitive and cooperative demands) as critical situ- ational variables that affect these relationships. Researchers should explore the role of other situational variables. For example, the emotional demands or emotional labor of the work context may be an important situational factor to consider. At an extreme, emo- tionally taxing work can result in burnout, which has been consis- tently linked with organizational consequences such as increased turnover, stronger intentions to leave, negative work attitudes, and

## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 77

reduced levels of performance (Brotheridge & Grandey, in press; Wright & Cropanzano, 1998). Personality traits like Emotional Sta- bility and Extraversion are likely to be important predictors of burnout. Consequently, there may be value in assessing the emo- tional demands associated with various jobs on the personality— performance relationship. A taxonomy of emotional demands could focus on “emotional taxes” due to task demands (as with sur- geons who face life-and-death decisions), interpersonal demands (such as sales representatives who have frequent interactions with challenging customers), and emotional control required by the job (for example, ambulance technicians who encounter emotionally demanding circumstances). With the development of a theoreti- cally relevant taxonomy of emotional demands, we believe re- searchers could explore the effect these emotional factors have on the nature and magnitude of the relationship between speciﬁc per- sonality traits and performance or affective outcomes.

Research on cognitive ability has illustrated that complexity of the job, as determined by job knowledge requirements, is an im- portant determinant of the relationship between ability and perfor- mance (Hunter, 1986; Schmidt, Hunter, Outerbridge, & Trattner, 1986). Consequently, models of job performance must also include job complexity as an important situational variable. Is job complex- ity likely to be an important moderator for personality? We do not know. However, if it is, it may be because complexity is associated with greater discretion or autonomy, in addition to a need for more job-speciﬁc knowledge. Furthermore, if the job is too simple or too complex for the person’s skills, it may have implications for motiva- tion (not intrinsically motivating if too simple a job) or anxiety (if too difﬁcult, it may increase the emotional labor of the job). Given this, research that extends our understanding of the role of job com- plexity on personality-performance relationships is important.

While these alternative perspectives suggest areas where our model will likely be reﬁned, we believe that both our general model of the effects of person and situation variables on behavior and our speciﬁc model of how four personality traits relate to motivation and subsequently to performance can guide research. In the gen- eral model, we have proposed that at least two situational con- structs (cooperative demands and competitive demands) are required to explain the relationship between the two interpersonal

# 78 PERSONALITY AND WORK

traits (Extraversion and Agreeableness) on performance. The in- ﬂuence of situational demands and opportunities relevant to these outcomes remains a relatively unexplored source of variance of po- tential importance to both researchers and practitioners alike. These frequently overlooked contextual factors are hypothesized to af- fect the level of observed performance, the relationship between personality and performance, and the personality-motivational- performance linkages. The limited empirical evidence available clearly justiﬁes the need to explore the direct and interactive ef- fects of situational demands as important determinants of these outcomes.

# Conclusion

The model shown in Figure 3.1 is our interpretation of how spe- ciﬁc distal personality traits, as well as situational factors, are re- lated to important work behaviors on a day-to-day basis. This model emphasizes personal goals (strivings and projects) as the key prox- imal motivational variables through which our long-term disposi- tional tendencies are operationalized. Alternative theoretically relevant measures of motivation include expectancies and com- petency beliefs, affective variables, and subjective values and va- lences. We believe that focusing on cognitive-motivational goals captures much of the critical variance for the work motivation con- struct space relevant to these performance outcomes. Certainly, there is considerable support for the notion that cognitive pro- cesses (goals) are critical to understanding the relationship be- tween person factors and job behaviors. Nevertheless, future research must address whether these goal-oriented variables ade- quately represent motivational effects.

Our model suggests that Accomplishment Striving is the en- gine through which the relevant social goals (either Status Striving or Communion Striving, depending on the situation) affect per- formance. The available data support this conjecture, but we still need direct comparisons of the effects of Accomplishment Striv- ings on either Status Striving and Communion Striving and, in turn, their effects on performance in a variety of work settings. This model also suggests that the explanation for the universal effects for Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are due to their ef- fects on Accomplishment Striving.

## INFLUENCES ON TRAIT-BEHAVIOR RELATIONSHIPS 79

We have sought to show how person and situation factors are linked through motivational variables to predict a reasonably broad range of behavioral performance measures in various work con- texts. Industrial/organizational psychologists have historically fo- cused on the relationship between personality and performance. This chapter illustrates that we also need to account for situational determinants of behavior, as well as the mechanisms through which personality affects behavior. Pursuing this research will en- able researchers to make progress on explaining both perfor- mance and affective work outcomes.

# CHAPTER 4

Toward a Better Understanding of the Relationship Between Personality and Individual Job Performance Jeff W. Johnson

Researchers and practitioners in industrial and organizational (I/O) psychology have long been intrigued by the potential for measures of personality to describe, explain, and predict the be- havior of individuals at work. Including personality variables in a se- lection system often has the effect of increasing its validity for predicting job performance, while simultaneously reducing adverse impact against protected groups (Hough, 2001). Although the use- fulness of personality predictors is widely accepted today, academic I/O psychologists paid very little attention to personality measures from the mid-1960s to the mid-1980s (Schneider & Hough, 1995). This dearth of research is often attributed to an inﬂuential review of personality test validities by Guion and Gottier (1965), which con- cluded that research to that point had been so poorly done that personality measures should not be used to make employment de- cisions without clearer evidence of their validity. Other inﬂuences were the Civil Rights Act of 1964, which permitted the use of pro- fessionally developed ability tests but was not so explicit about per- sonality inventories, and the emergence of Mischel’s (1968) idea

83

# 84 PERSONALITY AND WORK

that behavior is determined more by situations than by traits (Guion, 1998).

In the late 1980s, the trait approach to personality was back in vogue, and the trait-versus-situation debate had produced a better understanding of how to predict behavior from traits. In early per- sonality research, correlations were computed between all person- ality variables and all criteria. Most of these correlations were near zero, creating the impression that personality was generally unre- lated to performance. We now better understand that the trait being investigated must be relevant to the criterion and that pre- dictors and criteria should be conceptualized as constructs (Hough & Schneider, 1996). Personality research now involves the speciﬁ- cation of a personality taxonomy, a job performance taxonomy, and hypothesized relationships between them. A meta-analysis by Tett, Jackson, and Rothstein (1991) found generally higher validi- ties in studies that had a clearly stated hypothesis than in purely exploratory studies.

Meta-analyses of the criterion-related validity of personality vari- ables have illustrated the beneﬁt of using personality taxonomies as an organizing framework, revealing personality-performance re- lationships that had not been clear before (for example, Barrick & Mount, 1991; Hough, 1992; Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, & McCloy, 1990). Barrick, Mount, and Judge (2001) conducted a second-order meta-analysis of all meta-analyses of the relationship between personality and performance conducted during the 1990s. Results were organized according to the Big Five dimensions of per- sonality. Conscientiousness consistently predicted job performance across all criterion types and occupational groups and had the high- est validity of all dimensions. Emotional Stability was the only other dimension to have nonzero true score correlations with overall work performance. Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness to Ex- perience predicted some criterion types in some occupations. These results showed that the Big Five dimensions of personality are valid predictors of performance for at least some jobs and some criteria, although the magnitudes of the validities were relatively low.

Research has moved beyond the search for signiﬁcant correla- tions between Big Five dimensions and general measures of job performance and is focused on understanding in greater depth

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 85

the nature of personality and job performance, and how they are linked. This chapter focuses on two areas of research relevant to gaining this understanding. The ﬁrst area is the development of a nomological net linking speciﬁc personality predictors to speciﬁc job performance criteria (Barrick et al., 2001; Hough & Furnham, 2002; Schneider, Hough, & Dunnette, 1996). Research has shown that lower-level facets of the same Big Five factor often have very different correlations with job performance criteria, revealing meaningful relationships that are masked if broader measures are used (Hough, 1992). Thus, linking speciﬁc predictor and criterion measures can result in increased correlations and better under- standing of the relationship between personality and performance. The linking of these lower-level predictors and criteria requires tax- onomies of speciﬁc personality and job performance constructs (Barrick et al., 2001). To that end, this chapter reviews the research on taxonomies of personality and individual job performance, and it proposes a taxonomy of job performance dimensions to be used in this type of linking research for forming hypotheses and cumu- lating results.

The second area of research is the development of models of the process by which personality inﬂuences job performance (Bar- rick et al., 2001; Schneider & Hough, 1995). This type of research has been in the form of searching for moderators of the rela- tionship between personality and performance and searching for mediators of this relationship. The literature on moderators is ex- tensive and is not reviewed in this chapter (interested readers should see Schneider & Hough, 1995; Chapter Three, this vol- ume). This chapter focuses on reviewing the mediators linking per- sonality and performance and integrating this research into a proposed model of the process by which personality inﬂuences job performance.

# Personality Taxonomies

Two approaches to developing personality taxonomies are brieﬂy reviewed here. The ﬁrst approach is based on intercorrelations of personality dimensions; the second approach is based on correla- tions between personality dimensions and external criteria.

# 86 PERSONALITY AND WORK

# The Big Five and Its Facets

The Big Five (also known as the Five-Factor Model) has been ubiq- uitous in personality research, being robust and generalizable across rating sources, cultures, languages, and factor extraction and rotation methods (Hough & Furnham, 2002). The ﬁve factors are generally labeled Extraversion, Conscientiousness, Agreeable- ness, Emotional Stability, and Openness to Experience (Digman, 1990). Although the Big Five has advanced theory and practice as a useful framework for organizing and summarizing personality- performance relationships, it has been criticized for being insufﬁ- ciently comprehensive and too heterogeneous (Block, 1995; Hough & Schneider, 1996; Paunonen & Jackson, 2000; Schneider & Hough, 1995). The number of lower-order facets of the Big Five is very open to debate, but Saucier and Ostendorf (1999) provided a good starting point by identifying eighteen subcomponents of the Big Five that were replicable across two languages:

# Extraversion

## Sociability Unrestraint Assertiveness Activity-adventurousness

# Agreeableness

## Warmth-affection Gentleness Generosity Modesty-humility

# Conscientiousness

## Orderliness Decisiveness-consistency Reliability, industriousness

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 87

# Emotional Stability

# Irritability Security Emotionality

# Openness to Experience

## Intellect Imagination-creativity Perceptiveness

# Approaches for Maximizing Prediction

Rather than developing a personality taxonomy based on factor analysis of intercorrelations between scores on personality variables, Hough espouses a nomological–web clustering approach, in which taxons are based on similarities in patterns of relationships with vari- ables outside the personality domain, such as job performance cri- teria (Hough & Ones, 2001; Hough & Furnham, 2002). Hough and Ones (2001) used this approach to propose a working taxonomy of personality variables, based on an extensive review of the literature. They called for other researchers to reﬁne this taxonomy through theory and empirical evidence, creating more useful taxons that will lead to a better understanding of the relationships between per- sonality and performance.

A related approach is the use of compound traits, which are combinations of basic personality traits that do not necessarily co- vary that are put together to maximize the prediction of a speciﬁc criterion construct (Hough & Schneider, 1996). Some examples of compound personality traits that have been found to be valid for predicting their intended criterion construct are integrity (Ones, Viswesvaran, & Schmidt, 1993), customer service orienta- tion (Frei & McDaniel, 1998), employee reliability (Hogan & Hogan, 1989), and managerial potential (Gough, 1984). Hough and Ones (2001) suggested a number of other possible compound traits. The development of their working taxonomy will allow for the creation of compound traits to predict behavior for very spe- ciﬁc or unique situations (Hough & Ones, 2001).

# 88 PERSONALITY AND WORK

# Models of Job Performance

Although there is little agreement on the appropriate personality taxonomy to use in researching personality-performance relation- ships, there have been concerted efforts on the part of recent re- searchers to organize personality variables into a taxonomy that makes sense. The same cannot be said for the criterion side. Most meta-analyses of personality-performance relationships have been limited to a hodgepodge of whatever criteria are available, and these criteria do not come close to representing the entire domain of individual job performance. This is a by-product of the decades of neglect suffered by the job performance construct. To realize Hough’s (2001) vision of a matrix that links speciﬁc predictors to speciﬁc criteria, however, a taxonomy of job performance variables is just as important as a taxonomy on the predictor side. This sec- tion reviews recent models of job performance and integrates them into a proposed taxonomy to be used for personality research.

# Performance Deﬁned

This chapter focuses on individual job performance, which Camp- bell (1990; Campbell, McCloy, Oppler, & Sager, 1993) deﬁned as behavior that is relevant to the goals of the organization and can be measured in terms of the level of the individual’s contribution to those goals. Performance can be distinguished from effective- ness, which is some aggregate of the outcomes of performance that can be inﬂuenced to some extent by factors other than the indi- vidual’s performance. Thus, this chapter includes only models of performance that are based on individual behaviors, not measures of effectiveness (such as dollar volume of sales). This chapter also does not include counterproductive or withdrawal behaviors, which are addressed in Chapter Six.

Campbell et al.’s (1993) model of performance consists of eight components, some or all of which should be adequate to de- scribe all jobs in the U.S. economy:

- Job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency • Non-job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency • Written and oral communication proﬁciency

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 89

- Demonstrate effort • Maintain personal discipline • Facilitate peer and team performance • Supervision/leadership • Management/administration

This model is a useful starting point to which more speciﬁc di- mensions can be added based on recent research on citizenship performance, adaptive performance, and managerial performance.

Borman and Motowidlo (1993) proposed a model of performance with two components at the highest-level: task performance and contextual performance. Task performance consists of activities that (1) directly transform raw materials into the goods and ser- vices produced by the organization or (2) service and maintain the technical core by replenishing supplies, distributing products, and providing planning, coordination, supervising, and staff functions that allow for efﬁcient functioning of the organization (Motowidlo, Borman, & Schmit, 1997). Contextual performance consists of ac- tivities that support the broader environment in which the tech- nical core must function, including behaviors such as volunteering for tasks not formally part of the job, demonstrating effort, help- ing and cooperating with others, following organizational rules and procedures, and supporting organizational objectives (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993).

Contextual performance is similar in deﬁnition to Organ’s (1988) organizational citizenship behavior (OCB), as well as other concepts such as prosocial organizational behavior (Brief & Moto- widlo, 1986), extra-role behavior (Van Dyne, Cummings, & Parks, 1995), and organizational spontaneity (George & Jones, 1997). The primary difference between the deﬁnitions of OCB and contextual performance is that OCB was deﬁned as extra-role, discretionary, and not formally recognized or rewarded by the organization. Organ (1997) recognized the lack of clarity this brought to the construct and reﬁned the deﬁnition to make it more or less syn- onymous with contextual performance. Contextual performance, OCB, and related concepts are now often referred to as the same

# 90 PERSONALITY AND WORK

thing under the general label of citizenship performance (Borman & Penner, 2001; Coleman & Borman, 2000).

Conﬁrmatory factor analyses have provided evidence for the dis- tinction between task and citizenship performance (Conway, 1996; Johnson, 2001). Furthermore, research has shown that both task performance and citizenship performance are taken into consid- eration when supervisors evaluate others’ performance (Conway, 1999; Johnson, 2001; Motowidlo & Van Scotter, 1994; Van Scotter & Motowidlo, 1996). Some research also shows that task perfor- mance is better predicted by ability and experience, and citizenship performance is better predicted by personality variables (Borman, Penner, Allen, & Motowidlo, 2001; Hurtz & Donovan, 2000).

The dimensionality of citizenship performance is muddled, with different authors offering different numbers of dimensions with dif- ferent labels (Borman & Motowidlo, 1993; LePine, Erez, & John- son, 2002; Organ, 1988; Podsakoff, MacKenzie, Paine, & Bachrach, 2000). In an attempt to clarify the latent structure of citizenship performance, Coleman and Borman (2000) identiﬁed twenty- seven citizenship performance behaviors based on all proposed models and discussions presented in the literature. The behaviors were sorted by forty-four I/O psychologists, and the similarity data were analyzed using factor analysis, multidimensional scaling, and cluster analysis. The authors rationally combined the results of the separate analyses into a single integrated model representing three categories of behavior. Borman, Buck et al. (2001) reﬁned this taxonomy on the basis of a sort of approximately twenty- three hundred examples of citizenship performance taken from twenty-two studies, giving the categories the following labels and explanations:

Personal support: Behaviors beneﬁting individuals in the organiza- tion; includes helping, motivating, cooperating with, and show- ing consideration of others

Organizational support: Behaviors beneﬁting the organization; in- cludes representing the organization favorably, showing loyalty, and complying with organizational rules and procedures Conscientious initiative: Behaviors beneﬁting the job or task; includes persisting with extra effort to complete tasks, taking initiative, and engaging in self-development activities (Borman, Penner et al., 2001).

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 91

Motowidlo et al. (1997) suggested that behavior exemplifying conscientious initiative facilitates both the technical core and the broader work environment and should be considered an element of both task and citizenship performance. Johnson (2001) found that a factor model with conscientious initiative loading on both the task factor and the citizenship factor ﬁt signiﬁcantly better than models in which it loaded on just one or the other.

# Adaptive Performance

Because of the increasingly dynamic nature of work environments, adaptive performance has recently received increased attention (Campbell, 1999; Hesketh & Neal, 1999; London & Mone, 1999; Pulakos, Arad, Donovan, & Plamondon, 2000). Adaptive perfor- mance is the proﬁciency with which a person alters his or her be- havior to meet the demands of the environment, an event, or a new situation (Pulakos et al., 2000). Hesketh and Neal (1999) suggested that adaptive performance is a component of the performance do- main that is separate from task and citizenship performance.

Pulakos et al. (2000) developed and found support for a tax- onomy of adaptive performance consisting of eight dimensions. Johnson (2001) classiﬁed six of these dimensions as either task or citizenship performance. The other two dimensions are most sim- ilar to London and Mone’s (1999) and Hesketh and Neal’s (1999) conception of adaptive performance (self-managing learning ex- periences in anticipation of changing conditions, ﬂexibility to cope with change). The dimension of learning work tasks, technologies, and procedures in response to changing conditions contains as- pects of both task and citizenship performance. Learning new tasks, technologies, or procedures certainly inﬂuences task performance, and the aspect of seeking out learning opportunities in anticipa- tion of changing conditions overlaps with the self-development component of conscientious initiative. The dimension of dealing with uncertain and unpredictable work situations is the only com- ponent of Pulakos et al.’s taxonomy that may well be distinct from task and citizenship performance. Elements of this dimension in- clude taking action when necessary without having all the facts at hand; adjusting plans, actions, or priorities to deal with chang- ing situations; and imposing structure to provide focus in dynamic situations.

# 92 PERSONALITY AND WORK

# Managerial Performance

A host of managerial performance taxonomies are available to ex- pand on Campbell et al.’s (1993) supervision-leadership and management-administration components, two of which are ex- ceedingly comprehensive. Borman and Brush (1993) found 187 di- mensions of managerial performance from twenty-six published and unpublished studies. These dimensions were sorted into categories by twenty-ﬁve I/O psychologists, and factor analysis of a similarity matrix derived from these sortings yielded an eighteen-dimension structure. These dimensions are easily assigned to the task or citi- zenship performance categories or to one of Campbell et al.’s eight components (1993). Tett, Guterman, Bleier, and Murphy (2000) used a sorting method to develop a more speciﬁc managerial per- formance taxonomy of ﬁfty-three competencies. They include a cross-reference of how their taxonomy ﬁts with twelve other tax- onomies, including that of Borman and Brush (1993).

# An Integrated Model of Job Performance

The taxonomies reviewed in the previous section can be integrated into a single taxonomy that can be used to link speciﬁc personal- ity constructs to speciﬁc performance constructs. The taxonomy is hierarchical but is not a latent variable model such as would be tested using factor analysis. Consistent with other conceptualiza- tions of performance (for example, Motowidlo et al., 1997), this taxonomy is an aggregate model. The performance components at the higher levels are aggregate multidimensional constructs, or mathematical functions of the lower-order dimensions. This means that the dimensions assigned to the same higher-order dimension are not necessarily highly correlated with each other. For example, non-job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency refers to performance on tasks that may be performed in many jobs within an organization (for example, planning and organizing, making decisions, and using computers; Johnson, 2001). These tasks may have little in common with each other, but the aggregate of performance on all of these tasks represents a meaningful construct.

Table 4.1 contains the taxonomy, which has three components at the highest level: task performance, citizenship performance,

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 93

and adaptive performance. At the next level, task performance is deﬁned by ﬁve components from Campbell et al. (1993) and the aspects of conscientious initiative that are relevant to task perfor- mance. Supervision/leadership was renamed supervision because “leadership” is a less speciﬁc construct that is often an aggregate of task, citizenship, and adaptive performance (Leslie & Van Vel- sor, 1996). At the most speciﬁc level, each Level 2 dimension is de- ﬁned by labels or descriptions from Pulakos et al. (2000), Borman and Brush (1993), and Campbell et al. (1993). Some dimensions are classiﬁed under more than one higher-order dimension. For example, physical adaptability could be job speciﬁc (as for a Na- tional Football League player) or non-job-speciﬁc (many jobs in the army). Job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency and non-job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency are very broad because of the multitude of task cate- gories included under these umbrellas. Campbell et al. deﬁne job- speciﬁc task proﬁciency as the behaviors that distinguish the substantive content of one job from another (for example, de- signing architecture, driving a bus, directing air trafﬁc). Non-job- speciﬁc tasks are those that are required across many jobs within an organization (for example, teach classes, use computers).

Citizenship performance includes Borman, Buck et al.’s (2001) three components, which are deﬁned by additional descriptors from Borman, Buck et al., and dimensions from Campbell et al. (1993), Pulakos et al. (2000), and Borman and Brush (1993). Note that supervision is included as both a Level 2 dimension under task performance and a Level 3 dimension under personal support. This is because supervision is explicitly included in the deﬁnition of task performance as an element that services and maintains the techni- cal core (Motowidlo et al., 1997), but some elements of supervision are clearly part of the deﬁnition of personal support (coaching, de- veloping, and motivating others; Borman, Buck et al., 2001). “Demonstrate effort” is also included under both task and citizen- ship performance. “Handling work stress” is included under all higher-order dimensions of citizenship performance because it con- tains aspects from all three. Adaptive performance includes only the single Level 2 dimension of “Dealing with uncertain and un- predictable work situations,” which is deﬁned at Level 3 by Hesketh and Neal’s (1999) “Demonstrating ﬂexibility to cope with change” and further descriptors from Pulakos et al. (2000).

# 96 PERSONALITY AND WORK

One could go to an even more speciﬁc level than Level 3 by in- cluding Tett et al.’s (2000) managerial competencies, many of which are relevant to all jobs. Level 3 is the most appropriate level for linking speciﬁc predictor constructs to speciﬁc performance constructs. Level 2 may be used for cumulating results across stud- ies for meta-analyses, at least until sufﬁcient data have been gath- ered to conduct meta-analyses at Level 3.

Task performance has generally not been predicted well by per- sonality variables. In the U.S. Army’s Project A, technical proﬁci- ency (job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency) and general soldiering proﬁciency (non-job-speciﬁc task proﬁciency) had very low correlations with all personality variables measured (Hough et al., 1990). Hough’s (1992) meta-analysis found only intellectance to be related to tech- nical proﬁciency. In a meta-analysis by Hurtz and Donovan (2000), the highest mean corrected correlations with criteria classiﬁed as task performance were .16 and .14 for Conscientiousness and Emo- tional Stability, respectively.

Hurtz and Donovan (2000) found personality to be a better predictor of citizenship performance. For job dedication (a com- bination of conscientious initiative and organizational support), mean corrected correlations were .20 for Conscientiousness and .14 for Emotional Stability. For interpersonal facilitation (personal support), mean corrected correlations were .18 for Conscien- tiousness, .17 for Emotional Stability, and .20 for Agreeableness. Organ and Ryan’s (1995) meta-analysis showed Conscientiousness to correlate .30 with generalized compliance (part of organiza- tional support) and .22 with altruism (part of personal support). Borman, Penner et al. (2001) updated this meta-analysis and found Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, positive affectivity, negative af- fectivity, and locus of control to have relatively high uncorrected mean correlations with a general citizenship performance com- posite (range of .13 to .24).

Several studies have investigated the relationship between per- sonality variables and adaptability. In a study of over ﬁfteen hun- dred managers, Conway (2000) found corrected correlations of .20 or greater between an adaptability performance dimension and the California Psychological Inventory (CPI) scales of responsibil- ity, tolerance, achievement via independence, and intellectual ef- ﬁciency. Mumford, Baughman, Threlfall, Uhlman, and Costanza

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 97

(1993) found that students low in evaluation apprehension, high in self-discipline, and high in creative achievement tended to per- form better on an ill-deﬁned task, which is an element of adaptive performance. LePine, Colquitt, and Erez (2000) found that Open- ness to Experience was positively related and dependability was negatively related to decision quality after the rules were unex- pectedly changed on a decision-making task.

## Theories of Individual Differences in Job Performance

According to Campbell (1990; Campbell et al., 1993), performance is a function of three determinants: declarative knowledge, proce- dural knowledge and skill, and motivation. Declarative knowledge represents factual knowledge about speciﬁc things, or knowing what to do. Procedural knowledge and skill is the degree to which one is able to perform a task. This is achieved when knowing what to do is combined with knowing how to do it. Campbell et al. deﬁne mo- tivation as the combined effect of the choice to expend effort in a particular direction, the choice of the level of effort to expend, and the choice to persist at that level of effort. Performance on a job di- mension is determined directly by some combination of these three determinants. The direct performance determinants are distin- guished from indirect performance determinants, which can in- ﬂuence performance only by the direct determinants. Examples of indirect determinants provided by the organization include re- ward systems, training, and management practices. Personality is an example of an indirect determinant that the individual brings to the organization, along with abilities, interests, education, and experience.

This model has clear implications for the relationship between personality and performance on a particular performance di- mension. Personality can inﬂuence performance only through its inﬂuence on declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and skill, or motivation. This means that one way a personality variable may be related to performance on a dimension is if people higher on that variable tend to acquire more of the declarative or proce- dural knowledge necessary for performance on that dimension (McCloy, Campbell, & Cudeck, 1994). Many personality variables

# 98 PERSONALITY AND WORK

are likely most predictive of motivation. This is supported by Mc- Cloy et al. (1994), who found higher personality-performance cor- relations when performance was measured by ratings, which reﬂect all three performance determinants, than when performance was measured by job knowledge tests or work samples, which do not reﬂect motivation.

Research supports the notion of motivation as a mediator of the personality-performance relationship. Barrick, Mount, and Strauss (1993) found that the link between Conscientiousness and two measures of sales representative job performance (supervisor ratings and sales volume) was mediated by the motivational vari- ables of goal setting and goal commitment. Gellatly (1996) found that performance expectancy and goal choice mediated the link between Conscientiousness and performance on an arithmetic task. Barrick, Stewart, and Piotrowski (2002) noted that the moti- vational variables of accomplishment striving and status striving mediated the relationship between Conscientiousness and job per- formance of sales representatives, and status striving mediated the relationship between Extraversion and job performance.

Campbell et al.’s (1993) model of performance determinants provides a general explanation of how individual differences in personality translate to individual differences in job performance on a particular dimension. Motowidlo et al. (1997) expanded this model to explain why personality should be a better predictor of contextual performance dimensions than of task performance di- mensions. They split declarative knowledge and procedural knowl- edge and skill into task knowledge and skill and contextual knowledge and skill. Task knowledge is knowledge of facts, princi- ples, and procedures relevant to the core technical functions of the organization, and task skill is skill in performing necessary ac- tions to complete tasks. Contextual knowledge is knowledge of facts, principles, and procedures relevant to maintaining the or- ganizational environment in which the technical core must func- tion (such as knowing how to cooperate with others and how to present a favorable image of the organization), and contextual skill is skill in performing actions known to be effective in situations calling for contextual performance. Task knowledge and skill are determined primarily by cognitive ability, which is supported by ample research (Borman, White, & Dorsey, 1995; Hunter, 1983;

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 99

Lance & Bennett, 2000). Motowidlo et al. suggest that personality should be the primary determinant of contextual knowledge and skill, because people possessing personality characteristics consis- tent with a particular element of contextual knowledge or skill should be more likely to notice the relative effectiveness of certain patterns of behavior in relevant situations, and thus more likely to master that knowledge or skill.

The Motowidlo et al. (1997) model is further distinguished from the Campbell et al. (1993) model by replacing motivation with task and contextual work habits. Work habits are patterns of behavior that people learn over time that can facilitate or interfere with job performance. They include characteristic motivational re- sponses such as choices for the amount, intensity, and duration of effort to expend; tendencies to approach or avoid certain situa- tions; procrastination; or persistence in the face of adversity. They also include characteristic responses that are not necessarily moti- vational in nature. Motowidlo et al. give an example of a sales rep- resentative who has been trained in the best way to deal with an angry customer and has shown the ability to do so, but occasion- ally reverts to pretraining habits of reacting with hostility. Task work habits are characteristic responses to situations that interfere with or facilitate the completion of tasks. Contextual work habits are characteristic responses that interfere with or facilitate performance in contextual work situations. Motowidlo et al. suggested that task habits are predicted by both cognitive ability and certain person- ality variables (such as Conscientiousness), and contextual habits are predicted primarily by certain other personality variables (such as Agreeableness and Extraversion). Because personality variables are expected to inﬂuence more determinants on the contextual side of the model and ability variables are expected to inﬂuence more determinants on the task side of the model, personality should be more related to contextual performance and ability should be more related to task performance.

Some studies have attempted to test the mediating aspects of the Motowidlo et al. (1997) model. Schmit, Motowidlo, Degroot, Cross, and Kiker (1996) investigated the mediating role of con- textual knowledge in the personality–contextual performance re- lationship in a sample of sales associates. In this study, the personality measures assessed Extraversion, Agreeableness, and

# 100 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Conscientiousness. The contextual knowledge measure was a situa- tional interview designed to assess the participants’ knowledge of ap- propriate customer service behaviors, and the job performance measure was supervisor ratings of the participants’ customer service– related job performance. Schmit et al. found that contextual knowledge mediated the personality-contextual job performance relationship in the case of Extraversion. These results are some- what difﬁcult to interpret because customer service is probably a combination of task and contextual performance.

Schneider and Johnson (2001) used a situational judgment test as a measure of contextual knowledge for the dimensions of per- sonal support and conscientious initiative. Predictors were agree- ableness, achievement, dependability, and cognitive ability. Criteria were supervisor ratings of personal support, conscientious initiative, and customer service performance. The contextual knowledge me- diation hypothesis was tested separately for each construct, and sup- port was mixed. Conscientious initiative knowledge did not mediate the relationship between achievement and conscientious initiative performance. When testing the relationship between agreeableness and personal support performance, a model in which personal support knowledge mediated the relationship ﬁt equally as well as a model in which there was no mediation. For customer service, the mediation effect was found for achievement but not for de- pendability or agreeableness.

Schneider and Johnson (2003) tested a more complete version of the Motowidlo et al. (1997) model in a sample of employees in customer contact positions in a large company. The criteria were supervisor ratings of customer service task performance, conscien- tious initiative, and personal support. Task and contextual knowl- edge were measured with a situational judgment test. The indirect determinants were cognitive ability, agreeableness, and achieve- ment. The Motowidlo et al. model was not supported; there were no mediation effects of task or contextual knowledge. Support was found for an alternative model that involved two changes from the original model. First, a direct path was added from achievement to task knowledge, because people higher on achievement should tend to acquire more task-relevant knowledge. The second change was to make conscientious initiative a mediating variable between achievement and the dimensions of personal support and task per-

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 101

formance. A measure of conscientious initiative may be more a measure of motivation than one of performance. Because demon- strating effort necessarily precedes any type of performance and is related to both task and contextual performance, conscientious initiative was expected to inﬂuence both personal support and task performance directly. In this model, task knowledge mediated the relationship between ability and task performance and the rela- tionship between achievement and task performance. Personal support knowledge did not mediate the relationship between agreeableness and personal support, and conscientious initiative knowledge did not mediate the relationship between achievement and conscientious initiative. Conscientious initiative did mediate the relationships between achievement and the dimensions of per- sonal support and task performance.

# Expanding the Motivation Construct

The models of Campbell et al. (1993) and Motowidlo et al. (1997) differ in how they conceptualize motivation. Campbell et al. use a cognitive choice model of motivation, in which the choice to per- form leads directly to behavior. There is no explicit provision for motivational processes that may be used to overcome difﬁculties in the accomplishment of the intention to perform. Campbell et al. do say that the investigator’s favorite model of motivation can be inserted into that component of their theory, so the theory does allow for a conceptualization of motivation that is more complex than the three choices they specify. Because motivation is such an important mediating variable between personality and job perfor- mance, it is necessary to describe that aspect of the model more completely to provide a true understanding of the nature of this relationship.

Motowidlo et al. (1997) replaced the motivation component with work habits, which they deﬁned as stylistic ways that people han- dle different kinds of situations that occur on the job, learned as their basic tendencies (personality traits) interact with their envi- ronments over time. Habits are an important component to include in a model of performance determinants because they may interfere with performance despite motivation to perform in a certain way. Rather than replacing the motivation component, however, work

# 102 PERSONALITY AND WORK

habits should be included in addition to motivation. Although Motowidlo et al. included choices for how much effort to exert and for how long as examples of characteristic motivational responses under work habits, this appears to exclude motivational choices that go against one’s habitual tendencies. For example, a person’s characteristic tendency may be to exert as little effort as possible, but he or she may choose to go against that tendency in response to a new bonus structure that rewards productivity.

Habits inﬂuence behavior despite intentions to behave other- wise because they require very little attention. To implement an in- tention that goes against habitual tendencies and other intentions competing for one’s attention, one must engage self-regulatory or volitional mechanisms. Self-regulation refers to the higher-level cognitive processes that guide the allocation of attention, time, and effort across activities directed toward attaining a goal (Kanfer, 1990) and protect an intention from being replaced by a compet- ing action tendency before the intended action is completed (Kuhl, 1985). This is a critical component of motivation that is missing from the models of Campbell et al. (1993) and Motowidlo et al. (1997).

Some theories integrate cognitive choice and self-regulatory aspects of motivation (Heckhausen & Kuhl, 1985). The importance of this integrative perspective for the purposes of this chapter is that different dispositional variables are proposed to inﬂuence mo- tivation at different stages, providing a framework for more sys- tematic investigation of how personality affects motivation and job performance (Kanfer, 1990). Mitchell and Daniels (2002) distin- guished between proactive and on-line cognitive processes. Proac- tive cognitive processes occur before a task is begun and reﬂect cognitions about expectations for achieving a goal or the value of outcomes resulting from achieving a goal. During this phase, peo- ple determine what course of action to take, resulting in the for- mation of an intention. Mitchell and Daniels include expectancy, self-efﬁcacy, and goal setting in the proactive category of motiva- tion theories. On-line cognitive processes occur while the person is working on a task and are characterized by self-regulatory pro- cesses that are necessary to maintain goal-directed action. This phase refers to the process of implementing an intention to achieve a goal. Control theory, action theory, and self-regulation are on-line theories of motivation (Mitchell & Daniels, 2002).

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 103

A third component of motivation that can be inﬂuenced by personality is psychological motives. Motive-based theories focus on the inﬂuence on behavior of one or more psychological mo- tives (for example, altruism, personal development, competence), recognizing that people may have very different purposes for ex- hibiting the same behavior (Borman & Penner, 2001). The types of motives that are likely to be inﬂuenced by personality are val- ues, interests, preferences (Dawis, 1991), and attitudes (Penner, Midili, & Kegelmeyer, 1997). Motives are expected to inﬂuence proactive cognitive processes directly (Kanfer, 1992). The follow- ing sections review how personality has been shown to be related to each component of motivation.

# Motives

One type of motive that has been extensively studied is job atti- tudes. Job attitudes tend to be more strongly related to OCB than are personality variables (Podsakoff et al., 2000), leading Organ and Ryan (1995) to conclude that the relationship between per- sonality and OCB is probably mediated by attitudes such as job sat- isfaction, organizational commitment, and fairness perceptions. Many studies have shown relationships between personality vari- ables and job attitudes (for example, Judge & Bono, 2001; Judge, Higgins, Thoresen, & Barrick, 1999).

Rioux and Penner (2001) developed a scale to measure mo- tives for engaging in OCB and identiﬁed three motives through factor analysis: prosocial values, organizational concern, and im- pression management. They administered this scale and other measures to a sample of city government employees and obtained self-, peer, and supervisor ratings on ﬁve aspects of OCB. For peer ratings, the prosocial values motive was signiﬁcantly related to the altruism and civic virtue dimensions of OCB, and the organiza- tional concern motive was signiﬁcantly related to civic virtue. These two motives also accounted for signiﬁcant unique variance in these dimensions beyond that accounted for by measures of personality, perceived organizational justice, and positive mood. Two person- ality variables from the Prosocial Personality Battery (Penner, Fritzsche, Craiger, & Freifeld, 1995) were included in this study. Other-oriented empathy correlated .46 with prosocial values and .27 with organizational concern. Helpfulness correlated .31 with

# 104 PERSONALITY AND WORK

prosocial values. Other correlations were very small. These results indicate that certain motives for engaging in citizenship perfor- mance contribute uniquely to the prediction of citizenship per- formance and can be predicted by personality variables.

Barrick et al. (2002) developed a measure of three psychologi- cal motives: accomplishment striving, status striving, and commu- nion striving (that is, getting along with others). Although they referred to these variables as intentions or goals, the variables bet- ter ﬁt the deﬁnition of motives because of their lack of speciﬁcity (these motives would lead an individual to choose a speciﬁc goal). The authors found that Conscientiousness and Extraversion were related to both accomplishment striving and status striving, Emo- tional Stability was related to status striving, and Agreeableness was related to communion striving. These motives mediated the rela- tionship between the personality variables and a measure of sales representative job performance.

Chan and Drasgow (2001) developed a measure of motivation to lead, which ﬁts in the motive component of motivation because it is deﬁned as an individual difference construct that inﬂuences decisions to participate in leadership activities and intensity of ef- fort. Each Big Five personality variable was found to be a signiﬁcant predictor of at least one of the three factors of motivation to lead.

# Proactive Cognitive Processes

Judge and Ilies (2002) conducted a meta-analysis of the relation- ship between the Big Five and the proactive motivation constructs of expectancy motivation, self-efﬁcacy, and goal setting. Studies measuring expectancy generally asked respondents to indicate the extent to which exerting effort in a particular direction would re- sult in a speciﬁc outcome. Neuroticism and Conscientiousness were most highly correlated with expectancy motivation. Neuroti- cism and Extraversion were most strongly related to self-efﬁcacy, with Conscientiousness and Openness to Experience also display- ing nonzero correlations.

The goal-setting variables measured in studies included in Judge and Ilies (2002) generally measured goal content (choices of goal level or goal difﬁculty). All the Big Five traits had nonzero rela- tionships with goal content, with Neuroticism, Agreeableness, and

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 105

Conscientiousness showing the strongest relationships. Less research has examined personality correlates of goal commitment. Hollen- beck and Klein (1987) suggested need for achievement, Type A per- sonality, self-esteem, and locus of control as indirect determinants of goal commitment. Partial support for this model was provided by Hollenbeck, Williams, and Klein (1989), who found that com- mitment to difﬁcult goals was stronger when individuals were high in need for achievement and had an internal locus of control. In other studies, need for achievement (Kernan & Lord, 1988) and Conscientiousness (Barrick et al., 1993) were positively related to goal commitment.

# On-Line Cognitive Processes

Kuhl’s (1985) action control theory focuses on the translation of an intention to an action through self-regulatory processes. According to action control theory, self-regulatory skill is partially determined by an individual’s action or state orientation. More action-oriented individuals are better able to devote their attention to the current goal. More state-oriented individuals tend to ruminate on alterna- tive goals or emotional states, reducing the cognitive resources avail- able for striving for the current goal. Diefendorff, Hall, Lord, and Strean (2000) evaluated the construct validity of a revised version of a measure of action-state orientation, the Action Control Scale (Kuhl, 1994). This scale measures three dimensions of action-state orientation: preoccupation (the degree to which individuals de- tach from thoughts about interfering goals), hesitation (the difﬁ- culty in initiating goal-directed action), and volatility (the degree to which individuals become distracted when working on a task). These dimensions were regressed on measures of the Big Five. Emotional Stability contributed signiﬁcantly to the prediction of all three dimensions, and dependability (Conscientiousness) and Extraversion contributed signiﬁcantly to the prediction of the hes- itation dimension. The action control subscales contributed sig- niﬁcant variance beyond the Big Five to the prediction of supervisor ratings of task performance and several OCB dimensions in a sam- ple of employed students.

Kanfer and Heggestad (1997) proposed a taxonomy of motiva- tional traits and skills. Motivational skills were deﬁned as individual

# 106 PERSONALITY AND WORK

differences in self-regulatory patterns of activity during the goal- striving stage. They focused on two self-regulatory strategies pro- posed by Kuhl (1985): emotion control and motivation control. Emotion control facilitates task performance by protecting atten- tion and effort from distracting emotional states (for example, de- pression). Motivation control increases the strength of a current intention by selectively processing information that supports it. They focused on the trait constructs of achievement and anxiety based on the strength of research evidence supporting them. Achievement is characterized by the two distinct aspects of mastery (the desire to master a task for personal excellence) and compet- itive excellence (the desire to rival and surpass others). Anxiety is characterized by the constructs of general anxiety (neuroticism or emotional stability), fear of failure (tendency to avoid goals or sit- uations that might lead to failure), and test anxiety (anxiety re- stricted to testing situations). Individual differences in traits are proposed to inﬂuence motivational skill development through the differential opportunities with which they are likely to be associ- ated. For example, high-achievement individuals are more likely to put themselves in challenging situations, giving them more op- portunity to develop motivational skills.

# Proposed Model of the Relationship Between Personality and Individual Performance

A proposed model of pathways by which individual differences in a personality variable inﬂuence individual performance on a given performance component is presented in Figure 4.1. This model is compatible with those of Campbell et al. (1993) and Motowidlo et al. (1997) and adds elements to both. Consistent with Campbell et al., performance on any particular job performance component is a function of declarative knowledge, procedural knowledge and skill, and motivation. One difference is the expanded conceptual- ization of motivation. Another is the addition of a fourth determi- nant, work habits, in recognition of the possibility that job-relevant behavior can occur automatically despite motivation to behave oth- erwise. Work habits also inﬂuence performance indirectly by in- ﬂuencing the need for and choice of self-regulatory strategies. For simplicity, the only indirect determinants included are personality variables and ability variables. This model could be expanded to

include other classes of individual (for example, experience, inter- ests) or organizational (for example, training, rewards) indirect per- formance determinants. The relative strength of each path from one construct to another depends on the predictor variables in- cluded and the performance component that is the criterion, even for performance components within the same broad performance category (task, citizenship, or adaptive). For example, if achieve- ment were used to predict the demonstrating effort dimension of citizenship performance, the strongest path would likely go through motivation because motivation is highly relevant to demonstrating effort and achievement is highly relevant to each component of motivation. If sociability were used to predict the maintaining good working relationships dimension of citizenship performance, however, the stronger paths would likely go through declarative knowledge and procedural knowledge and skill. This is because social knowledge and skill are highly relevant to maintain- ing good working relationships, they are likely to be predicted by sociability, and sociability is not as strong a predictor of motivation. Figures 4.2 and 4.3 contain illustrative examples of how this model explains the prediction of speciﬁc performance compo- nents from speciﬁc predictor variables. Both ﬁgures include cog- nitive ability, achievement, and sociability as potential predictor variables. In Figure 4.2, the performance component is technical proﬁciency. Cognitive ability is the dominant predictor because of its inﬂuence on technical job knowledge, technical skill, and task habits. Cognitive ability may also inﬂuence motivation, primarily because it should be related to self-efﬁcacy and choice of goal dif- ﬁculty (Phillips & Gully, 1997). Achievement should also predict unique variance in technical proﬁciency, primarily through its in- ﬂuence on motivation, but also because high-achievement indi- viduals tend to acquire more job knowledge necessary for good performance and to develop habits that are effective for achieving high performance. Sociability should contribute little if anything to the prediction of technical proﬁciency.

In Figure 4.3, the performance component is maintaining good working relationships. In this case, cognitive ability would predict performance only to the extent that cognitive ability contributes to the determination that one kind of social response is more effec- tive than another (Motowidlo et al., 1997). Achievement would also predict performance through its inﬂuence on motivation, but this

inﬂuence should be less than what would be expected for techni- cal proﬁciency. The dominant predictor in this case would be so- ciability, which should directly inﬂuence social knowledge, social skill, social habits, and some aspects of motivation (for example, prosocial motives, self-efﬁcacy, goal commitment).

It is important to keep in mind the numerous potential mod- erators that can inﬂuence the extent to which personality predicts performance. Examples of moderator variables are situational strength (Beaty, Cleveland, & Murphy, 2001), occupation (Barrick et al., 2001), time on job (Helmreich, Sawin, & Carsrud, 1986), and autonomy (Gellatly & Irving, 2001). Some studies have found an interaction between personality and ability in predicting per- formance (Wright, Kacmar, McMahan, & Deleeuw, 1995), although most recent studies have shown no interaction (Mount, Barrick, & Strauss, 1999; Sackett, Gruys, & Ellingson, 1998). Multiple per- sonality traits may also interact to inﬂuence performance. For ex- ample, Witt, Burke, Barrick, and Mount (2002) found a signiﬁcant interaction between Conscientiousness and Agreeableness in ﬁve samples of employees in occupations characterized by cooperative interactions with others.

The purpose of this model is to identify the constructs through which personality variables work to inﬂuence performance on spe- ciﬁc performance dimensions. It can be used to choose appropriate personality predictors for a given criterion construct. The strength of the relationship between the predictor and the criterion de- pends on (1) the number of direct determinants of the criterion to which the predictor is related, (2) the strength of the relationship between the predictor and each direct determinant, (3) the strength of the relationship between each direct determinant and the criterion, and (4) the presence of relevant moderators. Ability variables should be most predictive for task performance dimen- sions because of their strong relationships with task knowledge, task skill, and task habits and the strong relationships between these direct determinants and task performance. Personality vari- ables should also contribute, but to a lesser degree because of their strong relationships with motivation but weaker relationships with task knowledge, task skill, and task habits. Personality variables should be most predictive when predicting citizenship perfor- mance because of their strong relationships with motivation and citizenship knowledge, skill, and habits. Ability variables should be

# 112 PERSONALITY AND WORK

predictive to a lesser extent because of their weaker associations with these constructs. Personality variables are probably most pre- dictive of adaptive performance because of the importance of self- regulatory skills when quickly adjusting to a new situation. Ability variables should also be strongly related because of the importance of skills such as problem solving.

An immediate need for research with this model is the medi- ating effect of citizenship knowledge and skill. So far, support for this effect has been mixed at best. In addition, we have very little idea at this time how the aspect of performance being studied in- ﬂuences the predictors of motivation. For example, certain per- sonality variables are likely to be highly related to motives, expectancies, self-efﬁcacy, goal content, and goal commitment when the criterion is a dimension of citizenship performance, but they have no relationship to these constructs when the criterion is a dimension of task performance.

# Conclusion

This chapter has reviewed and advanced research in two areas rel- evant to understanding the link between personality and individ- ual job performance. The ﬁrst area is identifying relationships between speciﬁc personality predictors and speciﬁc job perfor- mance criteria. According to Hough (2001; Hough & Ones, 2001), an important goal for personality researchers is the development of a nomological net of personality-performance relationships for use in building predictor equations for speciﬁc situations. The tax- onomy of performance dimensions proposed in this chapter is a step in this direction. This taxonomy includes task performance, citizenship performance, and adaptive performance at the high- est level, with a second and third level of more speciﬁc dimensions. To advance our state of knowledge most efﬁciently, primary stud- ies must be conducted relating speciﬁc personality variables to these performance dimensions, and meta-analyses must summa- rize this research at more speciﬁc levels than the Big Five and over- all task and citizenship performance. This performance taxonomy should also be reﬁned by identifying other important performance dimensions that are not adequately represented in the taxonomy. The second area of research is investigating the mediating vari- ables through which personality inﬂuences job performance. The

# PERSONALITY AND JOB PERFORMANCE 113

Campbell et al. (1993) and Motowidlo et al. (1997) models were combined, revised, and expanded to more completely explain the process by which individual differences in personality traits lead to individual differences in speciﬁc dimensions of performance. This model can be used to guide research linking speciﬁc personality variables to speciﬁc performance dimensions by helping to iden- tify theoretically relevant predictors for different criteria. In this model, the construct of motivation was expanded to highlight how different personality variables inﬂuence different components. Self-regulation is the primary component that previous models were missing. This construct is very important because it is strongly related to personality; helps explain how people with similar knowl- edge, ability, goals, and desire to perform differ in their level of performance; and helps explain how people overcome their habits to perform in accordance with their goals. Further research relat- ing speciﬁc personality variables to speciﬁc motivation components will be valuable in expanding this model and furthering our un- derstanding of the personality-performance link.

# CHAPTER 5

Dispositional Inﬂuences on Affective Experiences at Work Howard M. Weiss Katherine E. Kurek

Personality constructs enter into the explanatory systems of every variable of interest to industrial/organizational psychology (I/O). Affect is clearly no exception, and in this chapter, we provide some general thoughts on how personality-affect connections can be un- derstood and studied. We have not attempted to review the I/O lit- erature on the relations of personality constructs with affect constructs. Readers interested in that review might look to Staw (in press). Nor have we tried to make precise predictions about spe- ciﬁc personality constructs, beyond relevant clarifying illustrations. Instead, we focus on some broad issues concerning how that rela- tionship can be productively conceptualized. We believe the time is right to think seriously about the study of personality and affec- tive reactions and think that analysis will be advanced by a more process-oriented discussion of affect. In effect, we are playing to our strengths as affect researchers and hope that the more knowl- edgeable personality researchers who comprise the readers of this volume will bring that knowledge to bear on the conceptual and process issues we address.

If we are to have a useful discussion of the relationship between personality and affect, we have to make clear that affect and person- ality are very different kinds of constructs and that the differences

121

# 122 PERSONALITY AND WORK

are so fundamental that simple examinations of relationships be- tween the two, as is often seen in the literature, can be misleading and misdirected.

Affect is a state, and the fundamental characteristic of state con- structs is change. If we can envision a continuous stream of experi- ence, we can also envision particular moments in that stream when change occurs, when people move from one state to another. Such states can vary in length. Pain from touching a hot surface can last moments. Anger or guilt can last for hours. Marriage is a state that for some can last for decades, for others weeks. Nonetheless, and regardless of the time frame, states are time-bound constructs.

By this characterization, affect is a state. Researchers make the distinction between two forms of affect: moods and discrete emo- tions. Moods are generally considered to be more diffuse affective states, lacking a deﬁning object, and disconnected from particular objects or circumstances. Discrete emotions are affective states that are connected to objects or circumstances. They are about some- thing. The difference can be seen in the language of moods and discrete emotions. “I’m feeling angry with my boss” and “I’m feel- ing guilty about missing my son’s soccer game” are statements in the language of emotion. “I’m feeling down” and “I’m feeling kind of perky” are statements in the language of mood.

Both moods and emotions are state variables, characterized by beginnings and endings. Affective states, when compared to other kinds of state variables, are generally of relatively short duration. For example, moods might last for a few minutes, as is often the case in the laboratory, to a few hours. The experience of anger or guilt might follow the same sort of time frame.

Figures 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3 illustrate the momentary variability of affect. In each of the cases illustrated in these ﬁgures, data were col- lected by using ecological momentary assessment (Stone, Shiffman, & DeVries, 1999) to capture momentary affective states among work- ers. Participants were signaled at random points through the day and asked to indicate their current mood states (pleasant versus un- pleasant and aroused versus unaroused). These immediate mood states were collected over two- or three-week periods.

These charts are useful but rather limited in their description of true affective experience as it plays out over time. By dropping

in at random points during the day, we are unable to capture the holistic, episodic nature of any particular affective experience. We miss its beginning and its end, and thereby miss the meaning and coherence of the experience itself. In addition, by assessing only the positive or negative nature of the affective state, we miss the discrete emotional experience. Moods may be well captured by di- mensional reductions, but discrete emotions are not. In these kinds of data, we fail to discriminate among these different kinds of experiences.

Nonetheless, these data can help us make a few points about af- fective states. Simple observation of these data illustrates the mo- mentary and transient nature of affective states. They also show that individual affective experiences examined over time have distinc- tive patterns and that various parameters can be used to describe these patterns. For example, observers can see that individuals ap- pear to vary in their average levels of positive and negative affect. They also vary in the variability of affect itself, the intensity of peaks

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 125

and valleys, and the time span for movement from one state to an- other. Not observable but still present are distinct cycles to affective states, cycles whose frequencies or periods vary from one person to another. Affective experiences are state constructs that vary in di- rection, intensity, subjective experience, and length of time.

What kind of construct is personality? Let us ﬁrst say that for this discussion, we will be talking of personality in trait or disposi- tion terms. We recognize that there are personality researchers who ﬁnd this framework limiting (see Pervin, 1994, and accompa- nying commentaries as examples), but it is clear that in the I/O lit- erature generally and in the work affect literature in particular, the trait concept overwhelmingly predominates. So what kind of con- struct is a personality trait? Of most importance for us is that it is an attribute of a person that has no built-in time frame, no “on and off” element. We will not get into the issue of whether it can change or whether it is largely inherited, only that it is distinguished from state variables. State variables, by deﬁnition, come and go. Trait variables, by deﬁnition, do not.

Immediately, we see a disconnect. By asking the general ques- tion of the relationship between affect and personality, we are in- quiring how a state like construct, characterized by its variability, can be explained by a trait construct deﬁned by its stability. This is no small problem. Yet we also believe that solutions are available. However, before we discuss what we think are appropriate so- lutions, it will be useful to provide an overview of the nature of I/O research on dispositions and affect. This will tell us how researchers have dealt with the disconnect and also what they have not done but could do.

## Organizational Research on Affect and Personality

Our examination of the existing research in the I/O literature seeks not to review speciﬁc ﬁndings but rather to identify certain key themes in the way the research has been conducted.

To identify the body of I/O research on personality and affect, we conducted a literature search where we entered key search words such as emotions, affect, mood, and speciﬁc emotion words (for

# 126 PERSONALITY AND WORK

example, anger) into the PsycINFO database. An enormous list was generated, but only terms related to work or organizations are in- cluded in our overview.

We believe that the literature can be characterized by four major

observations that are relevant to the objectives of this chapter:

- 1. In the literature on personality and affect in work settings, af- fective experiences are frequently studied not as affect itself but as related constructs, such as job satisfaction and psycho- logical strain.

- 2. Studies of personality and affective reactions in organizational settings have primarily involved the examination of aggregate affective constructs as dependent variables.

- 3. The general format for studying affect-related experiences in- volves cross-sectional questionnaire studies that are unable to capture the affect process as it unfolds over time.

- 4. Affective experiences and personality variables create a murky pool in which there is no clear distinction between a stable characteristic and an experience in progress.

Our ﬁrst point is that many organizational studies on person- ality and affect have examined such things as job satisfaction (Bluen, Barling, & Burns, 1990; Fisher, 2000; Hart, 1999; Judge, Locke, & Durham, 1997; Porac, Ferris, & Fedor, 1983), psycholog- ical strain (Chen & Spector, 1991; Jex & Bliese, 1999; Saks & Ash- forth, 2000), and burnout (Wright & Cropanzano, 1998; Zellars & Perrewe, 2001); fewer have looked at emotions or moods at work. Although these regularly studied phenomena are potentially in- ﬂuenced by affective experiences and are related conceptually, they are not the same as actual affective experiences (Weiss, 2002a). Job satisfaction is a good example.

Job satisfaction is an attitude, not an affective state. As an atti- tude, it is best conceptualized as an evaluation of one’s job, inﬂu- enced in part by affective events that have occurred at work (Weiss, 2002b; Weiss & Cropanzano, 1996) and, as a source of error, the mood one is in at the time of making the evaluation (Brief, Butcher, & Roberson, 1995). In addition, most measures of job satisfac- tion have a large cognitive component (Brief & Roberson, 1989). The studies reviewed often used highly cognitive measures, such as

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 127

the Minnesota Satisfaction Questionnaire (Hart, 1999; Smith & Tziner, 1998; Watson & Slack, 1993) and the Job Descriptive Index (Glynn, 1998; Judge & Hulin, 1993; Levin & Stokes, 1989). In ad- dition, job satisfaction, unlike affective experiences, is a fairly sta- ble construct. Although results generally show moderate relations between affective personality constructs and job satisfaction, these results, weak or strong, tell us very little about personality and true affective reactions.

Psychological strain as an outcome of exposure to job stressors has many operationalizations, including job satisfaction, frustra- tion, anxiety, depression, burnout, and physical health problems. Some of these may be considered emotional reactions, but, inter- estingly, even so are generally measured over a period of time (say, in the past month). For example, Chen and Spector (1991) asked participants “how they generally felt at work during the past 30 days,” but they called this a “state” measure of anger. The same type of measure has been used with anxiety (Jex & Gudanowski, 1992; Jex & Spector, 1996; Spector, Chen, & O’Connell, 2000).

Our second conclusion relates to the ﬁrst point. Overwhelm- ingly, when more clearly affective constructs have been studied, ag- gregate measures have been used as the dependent variable. Sometimes measures of relatively stable constructs like satisfaction are used; sometimes people are asked to aggregate their momentary experiences subjectively over a particular time period (for example, “How have you typically felt over the last month?”); sometimes re- searchers aggregate momentary data mechanically. The Job Affect Scale (Brief, Burke, George, Robinson, & Webster, 1988) used in several studies (George, 1990; Saavedra & Kwun, 2000) asks for the respondent’s mood for the past week rather than at the moment the person is responding to the items. Stokes and Levin (1990) re- lated their new negative affectivity scale to experienced positive and negative affect over a one-week period. Other studies have used one-day measures, assessing the respondents’ judgments of their average moods over the course of a day (Bohle & Tilley, 1993). Although these studies have found relationships between personality constructs and individual differences in average affect, this paradigm is not able to explain the within-person changes in affect, which we have noted is a large portion of the total variance in emotional states.

# 128 PERSONALITY AND WORK

There are some notable exceptions in the literature that ask for emotional states at a speciﬁc point in time as they are occurring (Weiss, Nicholas, & Daus, 1999; Wofford, Goodwin, & Daly, 1999). However, even here, the momentary data are often aggregated be- fore analysis. Wofford et al. (1999) asked for recollections of emo- tions felt in speciﬁc situations, such as “on last being with their supervisor” or “on last returning home from work.” The responses for ﬁve different situations were then averaged to obtain an affect score to be assessed in relation to various personality variables.

Our third observation is that the use of one-time surveys has been the overwhelming format of choice for those studying per- sonality and affective experiences. Studies are often conducted in a cross-sectional, one-time assessment of all variables of interest (George, 1990; Saavedra & Kwun, 2000). Some studies have used longitudinal designs (Portello & Long, 2001; Spector & O’Connell, 1994) but are still assessing the affective constructs at one, or maybe two, points in time. For example, Spector and O’Connell (1994) gathered information on personality at time 1 and then twelve to ﬁfteen months later assessed the level of job strain that participants experienced. It should be noted that the majority of the studies that fall under this category were aimed at studying things that we have concluded are not affect but related constructs such as job satisfaction and psychological strain.

Other techniques (such as diary or experiential sampling meth- ods) have been used more rarely, but in a higher percentage, in studies speciﬁcally interested in affective experiences as the de- pendent variable (Bohle & Tilley, 1993; Portello & Long, 2001; Shiu, 1998). These formats are better able to capture the affective process. However, the same problem of aggregation persists with some of these methods. Despite the attempt to measure a mo- mentary phenomenon, when looking at personality, many diary studies average the momentary data (see Weiss et al., 1999, as an example) or ask for the respondent’s feelings or mood for that day (Buunk & Verhoeven, 1991). This masks any qualitative changes that have occurred throughout the day. Some studies, however, have used an experiential sampling technique to assess the pattern of emotions by asking the participants about their current emo- tional states at several points in time, resulting in a proﬁle of the participant’s emotional states over the time of the study and look- ing at personality correlates with the patterns. Research employ-

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 129

ing this format (Weiss et al., 1999) has required innovative meth- ods of comparing the stable personality construct to varying emo- tional responses. One such technique uses the statistical estimates of the distribution parameters, such as the standard deviation of reported emotions (Kurek, Le, & Weiss, 2001), as dependent vari- ables. Other studies have used multilevel modeling techniques to assess the variability within and between people in cross-level analy- ses using these types of data (see Portello & Long, 2001, as an ex- ample). Studies employing these more intense data collection formats have been few in number and still fail to capture the full emotion episode.

Our fourth conclusion about this literature is that there is no clear distinction between affective experience and personality. The averaging of moods and emotions across time dispositionalizes af- fect, creating, in effect, alternative measures of personality. Per- sonality is generally deﬁned as a consistent pattern of behaviors across time. When someone engages in many speciﬁc instances of behavior or attitude across time, this is described as personality, whereas any particular behavior at one point in time would not be labeled in this manner. Someone who is negative over many points in time will be labeled a pessimist, but being pessimistic once does not constitute a pessimist. The point here is that the longer the time frame is in which we are assessing any particular behavior, the more dispositionalized it becomes, and therefore the closer it comes to a measure of personality than of a situationally speciﬁc construct such as affect.

In our review of the literature, it occurred to us that there is a hazy line between the dispositional measures, such as positive and negative affectivity, and the time-bound affect measures. We typi- cally measure one’s personality or disposition as the individual’s typical response. For example, the Positive Affectivity and Negative Affectivity Scales (Watson, Clark, & Tellegen, 1988) ask for the ex- tent to which the respondents “typically” experience a list of twenty emotions. However, when we are trying to predict a time-bound behavior such as affect using an aggregate measure, we are essen- tially measuring the same construct as those that capture “typical” experiences.

In sum, as a result of examining the literature as a whole, it be- comes clear how I/O researchers have dealt with the problem of using a time-free construct like personality to explain a time-bound

# 130 PERSONALITY AND WORK

construct like affect states. Essentially, they have dispositionalized affect itself. They have done this in one of two ways. One way has been to examine constructs that are traitlike in terms of time frame and to call them affect constructs. This is the satisfaction paradigm. The other way has been to aggregate the momentary experiences either by asking people to provide judgments about their typical or general affective states or to create such summaries mechani- cally from momentary data. The latter approach loses the within- person variability, which is essential to understanding affective experiences over time, as we have seen. The former approach also loses such dynamic data and suffers from the biases inherent in these recollective judgments. Neither approach pays much atten- tion to the nature of affect processes.

## Process Approaches for Linking Personality to Dynamic Outcomes

Going back to our original ﬁgures and looking at the patterns of affect over time, we can see that the mean level of affect is not the only parameter that can be used in examining differences in these patterns. For example, the standard deviation of those experiences over time can be predicted from personality variables that capture differences in affective responsivity. Weiss et al. (1999) showed that Larsen and Diener’s affective intensity measure (1987) predicted individual differences in affective variability. Weiss et al. (1999) and others have also looked at individual differences in the extent to which regular cycles exist in individual affect patterns. Such cycles may also have personality correlates.

Although examination of the various parameters besides mean levels is an important undertaking, it still focuses on using per- sonality to explain between-person differences in affective states. Yet the within-person component of affective variability is what jumps out at any person who is studying affective experiences over time. People can feel angry in the morning and happy in the af- ternoon. They can and do move from state to state throughout the course of a day. Personality focused on between-person variance is limited in what it can accomplish. Yet our dilemma with within- person variance is that we are asked to predict and explain variable responses in the individual using stable characteristics of that per-

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 131

son. Such an activity is inherently inconsistent. This is not to say that stable characteristics are not relevant to affect processes. How- ever, if we are to go beyond predicting affective aggregates, using stable characteristics to explain affective experiences as they are experienced, that is, varying over time, we must focus on person- ality constructs that interact with varying environmental events. We must focus on reactivity constructs, not tendencies to display cer- tain levels of affect across situations, and study these reactivity con- structs as they interact with changing events. We will discuss here various constructs that predict differences in the way people re- spond to stimuli. We will also say that a search for these constructs must begin with an examination of the processes that generate emotional states at particular times.

The 1990s saw a resurgence of interest in trait theories of per- sonality, in both I/O and other areas of psychology, stimulated by research done within the Big Five approach. This reinvigoration of trait psychology was followed by a reinvigoration of critiques of dispositional personality generally (Mischel & Shoda, 1995, 1998; Pervin, 1994) and the Big Five in particular (Block, 1995). We do not revisit these issues here. However, we believe the position that Mischel and Shoda described is of great relevance for reconciling the conceptual disconnect we have been referring to.

Mischel and Shoda (1995, 1998) have described what they see as two traditions in personality psychology. One, the behavioral dis- position tradition, has sought to create personality constructs that operationalize consistencies in behaviors over time. These dispo- sitions or traits predispose people to behave in a certain way across time and situations. Mischel and Shoda argue that researchers within this tradition acknowledge that cross-situational consistency is generally low but not zero. They then focus on that part of the total variance that represents the stability component and seek to explain individual differences in this portion of the variance. In so doing, they treat the within-person variance, which can be quite substantial, as error. Clearly, this is the approach that best charac- terizes current I/O research on personality and affect. The alter- native approach, the mediational process approach, treats the within-person variance as real and to be explained, not thrown away. This approach argues that the role of personality is not to be found by dispositionalizing the behavioral (or affective) expression

# 132 PERSONALITY AND WORK

but rather to search for personality contributions in the mediating processes that are appropriate for the variable in question. Analy- ses driven by this tradition respect the within-person variability across situations but seek to ﬁnd coherence in these dynamic out- come patterns—coherence driven by characteristics of individuals’ processing systems, values, goals, and others that interact with the situation.

It should be clear by now that our position is very much con- sistent with the mediational tradition described by Mischel and Shoda (1995, 1998). Examining the dispositional or stable com- ponent of affective states by correlating personality traits with mean levels of affect aggregated over time or with self-reports of typical affect seems to miss the point of studying affect. “Dispositionaliz- ing” affect removes the essential features of the construct, simply for the purpose of generating associations with other known indi- vidual dispositions. Intraindividual variability, the essential char- acteristic of affective states, is treated as error variance, to be removed in the search for dispositional explanation.

Are we therefore arguing against a role for personality in af- fective processes? Clearly we are not. Instead, we are suggesting that the place to ﬁnd personality effects is in the mediating processes of affect generation. Here we are taking the position of Mischel and Shoda (1995, 1998). Instead of looking for stability in the expression of moods and emotions, we are suggesting that we look for the multiple ways in which personality enters into the causal chain of emotion generation and emotion consequences. Because that chain is deﬁned by the way individuals interact with and understand environmental events and conditions, the position easily accommodates the consistent aspects of human personality with the changing nature of emotional states. We believe that the reconciliation between changing affect states and stable charac- teristics of individuals is to be found by examining how those sta- ble characteristics inﬂuence the various elements of the mediational processes by which events inﬂuence affective reactions and affec- tive reactions inﬂuence behaviors, attitudes, and cognitive pro- cesses of relevance to work settings. We discuss possible inﬂuences of personality after a brief discussion of the emotion-generating process.

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 133

# A General Discussion of Affect Processes

Our discussion of affect generation processes is intentionally global and overly general. Researchers on emotions have not settled on one perspective for understanding how emotions are elicited (Weiss, 2002a). Researchers on moods have hardly addressed the issue at all. Our discussion in this and the next section follows the general outline of a cognitive appraisal approach. Researchers pre- ferring another perspective may therefore disagree with the par- ticulars of these discussions. We believe that they will not disagree with the general message, however.

Emotions are elicited by events. Although most emotion theo- ries use these events as the starting point for emotion generation, the events we experience are not entirely externally caused or ran- dom. We make decisions that expose us to certain events. Although there are certainly events that are beyond our control, we create our own environments in which we have a greater tendency to experi- ence certain types of events. Some events are thrust on us. Others are partly our own creation. Still, emotions are reactions to events. Not all events culminate in emotional responses. Cognitive ap- praisal theorists argue that events are appraised or evaluated along a number of dimensions, and these appraisals are the proximal cause of emotional responses (Smith & Kirby, 2001). These ap- praisal theories generally posit two types of appraisals in emotion generation. Primary appraisal is usually seen as an assessment of “concern relevance.” Is this thing that has happened of relevance to my goals (proximal or distal) and values? As a result of the ﬁrst appraisal process, both the valence and intensity of the emotion are determined (Lazarus, 1991). If it is of relevance and beneﬁcial for one’s goals and well-being, the valence of the emotion will be positive. If it hinders attainment of one’s goals, the emotion will be negative. The more important the goal is, the more intense the emotion is. As Weiss and Cropanzano (1996) noted, people will be focusing on different aspects of their goal hierarchies at any par- ticular time. This focus will inﬂuence the judgments made re- garding the relevance and importance of the event to one’s goals. An event that helps an individual achieve an important goal will produce a strong, positive emotion.

# 134 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Whereas primary appraisal determines the valence and inten- sity of the emotion experienced, secondary appraisal determines the particular discrete emotion experienced. Although different theorists propose different appraisal dimensions, all of them agree that the event is evaluated in relation to several attributes (such as causal attribution, coping potential, and stability of the event), and the pattern of attributions results in the elicitation of the particular emotion. (See Smith and Ellsworth, 1985, or Lazarus, 1991, for a more thorough discussion of this process.)

Although we have emphasized the discrete, transient nature of emotional states, Frijda (1993) has discussed the concept of “emo- tion episode,” that is, emotional reactions extended over time. In these emotion episodes, people experience a dynamic ﬂow of emo- tional reactions over an extended time. Sometimes these discrete emotions are different emotions, but all cohere around a single underlying theme (a company layoff, for example). The emotion episode is characterized by a heightened arousal and attention with the same underlying theme as the instigating event. During this time, people are trying to deal with the emotions, and their be- haviors are controlled by the emotion. To understand the affective process fully, we must recognize the characteristics of these emo- tional episodes. For example, it is the peak and end of the emotional experience that appear to be remembered when looking back on an event (Fredrickson, 2000).

Emotion processes do not stop with emotion elicitation. Moods and discrete emotions have behavioral consequences that are of great relevance to organizational functioning. Mood states bias judgments and decisions. They inﬂuence helping behaviors. They change the nature of cognitive processing (Weiss, 2002a). Discrete emotions are accompanied by particular behavioral tendencies and also have processing implications (Tagney, 1999). In addition, emo- tion and mood regulation processes accompany affective states as people try to manage their emotions, sustaining positive experi- ences and coping with negative ones. These regulatory processes generally put demands on cognitive resources. They inﬂuence at- tentional processes that have an impact on task performance and involve particular and individualized strategies.

To simplify the explanation (perhaps overly so), the affect process starts with the appraisal of emotion-relevant events and

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 135

ends with a variety of emotion-caused responses. Intervening are a host of mediational processes. At any point along the way, per- sonality may make a difference.

## Connecting Dispositions to the Emotion Process

The emotion processes just discussed suggest that there are several places in which dispositions may inﬂuence emotional experiences and their consequences (see Figure 5.4). The environment that one creates, the appraisal processes, the emotional episodes, and the behavioral and attitudinal reactions that one has when emo- tions are experienced can all be inﬂuenced in different ways.

Consistent with a general process approach we are advocating, Larsen (2000c; Larsen, Diener, & Lucas, 2002) has proposed a simple stimulus-organism-response (S-O-R) model for under- standing the role of personality dispositions in emotion processes. Larsen argues that dispositions may inﬂuence the S-O link in terms of processes related to stimulus sensitivity. He then suggests that dispositions may inﬂuence the O-R link by connecting with processes related to emotional response regulation. Larsen et al. (2002) present a full discussion of dispositional inﬂuences on both links. Our discussion is very much in keeping with Larsen’s model, with issues of cognitive appraisal added to the process elements.

The observation that affective states are generally reactions to speciﬁc events suggests that the ﬁrst place to look for a connection between personality and affect is in the experience of and reaction to events. In this regard, two links are particularly relevant. First, aspects of personality may inﬂuence events themselves. Second, and perhaps more important, aspects of personality may inﬂuence reactivity to events.

Personality may actually inﬂuence the events we experience, or, more precisely, the behavioral manifestations of personality traits may inﬂuence the nature of these events. For example, peo- ple who present a generally positive demeanor may be more likely to have positive things happen to them. Other people like them and enjoy being around them. Conversely, negative affective ex- pressions may elicit negative events.

In support of this idea, Magnus, Diener, Fujita, and Pavot (1993) examined the relationships between extraversion and neu- roticism, on the one hand, and self-reports of “objective” or veriﬁ- able positive and negative life events, on the other. Veriﬁable events were examined in order to reduce the effect of personality on the interpretation of more subjective occurrences. The data were col- lected in two waves. In the ﬁrst wave, respondents completed the NEO Personality Inventory (NEO-PI; Costa & McCrae, 1985). In the second wave, four years later, respondents reported on the fre- quency of the occurrence of various positive and negative objec- tive life events. Extraversion signiﬁcantly predicted the frequency of positive but not negative events over the next four years. Neu- roticism signiﬁcantly predicted the frequency of negative but not positive events over the next four years. Similarly, van Os, Park, and Jones (2001) showed that childhood assessments of neuroticism could predict the occurrence of stressful life events among a co- hort of adults in their late thirties and early forties.

Research on personality and the occurrence of affect-generating life events has been conﬁned to studying affective personality di- mensions like neuroticism and extraversion. This is the result of trying to discover mediational processes to explain the often found correlations between these affective traits and general assessments of emotional well-being. However, the relationship between per- sonality and affect-generating events need not be limited to those personality dimensions thought to be affective in nature. For ex- ample, conscientiousness is known to (modestly) predict perfor-

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 137

mance (Barrick & Mount, 1991). If performance feedback, both external and internal, can have affective consequences, then con- scientiousness may enter into an affect generation process. Specif- ically, those who are more conscientious do a good job and receive positive feedback, which leads to positive emotional reactions (pride); those who are less conscientious do not do such a good job, resulting in negative feedback and negative emotional reac- tions (dejection).

Reactivity to similar events can vary among individuals, and this variability can be related to personality differences. Weiss et al. (1999) showed that intraindividual variability in self-reports of mood over a three-week period could be predicted by individual differences in Larsen and Diener’s Affect Intensity Measure (AIM; 1987), and Kurek et al. (2001) replicated this ﬁnding in their sam- ple of graduate students. These studies replicate in the workplace numerous other studies conducted by Larsen and his colleagues on various nonwork samples. Larsen and Diener consider the AIM a measure of affective reactivity to events, both positive and nega- tive. In support of this interpretation, Larsen, Diener, and Emmons (1986) showed that AIM differences in a student sample predicted the strength of emotional responses to a constant set of emotional events among these students. Although more recent research has questioned the factorial purity of the AIM (Bryant, Yarnold, & Grim, 1996), Larsen’s research does illustrate stable individual dif- ferences in reactivity to emotional events.

Frequently found relationships between trait extraversion and neuroticism and aggregate mood states can also be explained by differential reactivity to positive and negative events. In a series of studies, Larsen and colleagues (Larsen & Ketelaar, 1989, 1991; Rusting & Larsen, 1999; Zelenski & Larsen, 1999) have shown that extraversion predicts responsivity to positive but not negative mood inductions, and neuroticism predicts responsivity to negative but not positive mood inductions.

An alternate personality structure, one coming from investi- gations into the physiology of affective reactions, also supports the logic of individual differences in reactivity to affective events. Gray (1987) proposed two physiological systems, one reacting to posi- tive stimuli and the other negative stimuli. These behavioral ap- proach and behavioral inhibition systems are thought to integrate motivational, emotional, and personality ﬁndings. Much research

# 138 PERSONALITY AND WORK

has been conducted under this framework. Carver and White (1994) have created a paper-and-pencil measure (the Behavioral Inhibition and Behavioral Activation Scales, BIS/BAS) of individ- ual differences in the reactivity of the two systems. Davidson (1995) and Sutton and Davidson (1997) have good summaries of the na- ture of the systems and a brief history of the research that has been conducted.

Davidson (1995) describes the anatomical location of the two systems. He suggests that individual differences in the cortical ac- tivity in different areas of the brain are related to the emotional re- activity to positive and negative stimuli. The frontal or anterior areas of the right hemisphere are responsible for withdrawal re- sponses, and the anterior areas of the left hemisphere are respon- sible for approach behavior. Sensitivity to positive and negative stimuli is thought to produce affective reactions and, in turn, be- havioral approach and avoidance behaviors (Davidson, 1995).

Exposure to positive and negative stimuli seems to produce the predicted effects on cortical activity in the appropriate areas. David- son (1995) has shown that the relative cortical activity is an indi- vidual difference that predicts the intensity of reactions to positive and negative stimuli. These cortical activity asymmetries are more highly related to paper-and-pencil measures of the BIS and BAS, such as Carver and White’s BIS/BAS (1994), than they are with measures of positive and negative affectivity. The underlying sys- tems are systems of reactivity, not stable affect differences.

Gable, Reis, and Eliott (2000) examined daily experience of positive and negative events and daily reports of positive and neg- ative affect. Consistent with expectations, they found in two stud- ies that individual differences in levels of the BIS (using Carver and White’s BIS/BAS measure) moderated the relationship between daily experience of negative events and daily reports of negative affect. Inconsistent with expectations, however, in neither study was a moderating effect of differences in behavioral activation on the relationship between positive events and positive affect found. Cognitive appraisal theory and research suggests that discrete emotional experiences are the result of a primary appraisal process and a secondary appraisal process. Primary appraisal involves as- sessment of goal relevance and determines the direction and am- plitude of emotional response. Secondary appraisal involves

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 139

assessments of such things as responsibility, coping potential, and modiﬁability and determines the particular discrete emotions ex- perienced. If these appraisals are integral to the emotion-generation process, then individual differences in appraisal tendencies might also be a place to look for a connection between stable character- istics of individuals and emotional reactions.

Interestingly, as Griner and Smith (2000) have pointed out, al- though an essential element of appraisal theory is to show how dif- ferent people can construe the same situation in different ways, clearly implicating the importance of individual differences in val- ues, needs, and appraisal tendencies, almost all research on ap- praisals has asked about the appraisals directly, ignoring the question of the source of the appraisals. Griner and Smith have begun to rectify that situation by showing that individual differ- ences in afﬁliation motive can inﬂuence the judgment of afﬁliative importance in emotion-eliciting circumstances.

All appraisal researchers suggest that goal structures provide the standards on which events are evaluated in primary appraisal processes (Smith & Kirby, 2001). As such, individual differences in these goal structures can inﬂuence affect-generation processes. Dif- ferent types of goals or goal structures can lead people to interpret the same event as personally relevant or not personally relevant. Some people tend to focus on things that they “ought” to do to avoid negative consequences, while others focus on things they “want” to do to improve themselves (Higgins, 1998). The differ- ences between these broad goals have an impact on the resultant emotions that are experienced (Brockner & Higgins, 2001; Hig- gins, 1998). Goal structures may even change the valence of whether the event is helping one attain one’s goal or hindering it. A person with a focus on learning a task (rather than performing better than others) may see a failure as a challenge (that is, something posi- tive) rather than a failure or hindrance to his or her goal. These interpretations lead to very different emotional reactions. Dweck and her colleagues (Dweck & Leggett, 1988; Grant & Dweck, 1999) have come to the conclusion that such goal tendencies are consis- tent across time and can therefore be viewed as precursors to per- sonality traits.

Primary appraisal is thought to be followed by secondary ap- praisal in the generation of discrete emotions. Different theorists

# 140 PERSONALITY AND WORK

have proposed different appraisal dimensions, and so it is difﬁcult to generate particular dispositional components that would be univer- sally accepted as relevant to secondary appraisal. Nonetheless, enough commonalities exist to suggest avenues for exploration. Many appraisal theorists discuss the importance of the assessment of per- sonal accountability. External attribution for events can lead to non-self-focused emotions like anger. Personal attribution can lead to self-focused emotions like guilt. Individual differences in locus of control (that is, the tendencies to judge events as self or exter- nally caused) will therefore inﬂuence the particular emotions gen- erated by particular events and outcomes.

Many theorists also discuss the role of changeablity of the state, particularly with regard to negative states (Smith & Kirby, 2001). Clearly, dispositions such as self-esteem or self-efﬁcacy are likely to be relevant to such judgments and therefore to the differential elic- itation of discrete emotions. In a related fashion, studies have shown that learned helplessness attributional style (Abramson, Seligman, & Teasdale, 1978), a personality trait characterized by a belief in an inability to change one’s situation, is associated with depression (Yee, Edmondson, Santoro, Begg, & Hunter, 1996).

Overall, while much has been done on the appraisal dimen- sions that generate discrete emotions, less research has been done on appraisal templates, that is, stable differences in appraisal ten- dencies. Certainly, individual personality dimensions developed in other contexts can and have been shown to be relevant to emo- tional appraisal. However, more coherent attempts to tie disposi- tions to the full nature of emotional appraisal are infrequently encountered but would be very useful.

Emotion processes do not stop with emotion generation. Emo- tions elicit cognitive, attitudinal, and behavioral responses of rel- evance to work behavior (see Brief & Weiss, 2002, for a current review), and individual differences in personality are likely to touch on these processes as well. In recent years, a great deal of attention has been paid to processes of emotion regulation. Gross (1999) published an important paper on emotion regulation, and Larsen (2000b) had a lead article in Psychological Inquiry on mood regula- tion. In the organizational literature, Pugh (2002) has published a good general discussion of individual and group emotion- regulation processes. To refer back to Larsen’s general model

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 141

(2000a) of individual differences in emotion processes, these are discussions of the output side. All of these discussions of emotion regulation mention the role of personality in regulatory processes, but in most of the chapters, the personality discussion is somewhat isolated and not well integrated with the basic processes.

Nonetheless, certain traits are clearly relevant and worth dis- cussing. Pugh (2002), summarizes the work on emotional expres- sivity (Friedman, Prince, Riggio, & DiMatteo, 1980; Gross & John, 1998) and its relevance to regulatory processes. Emotional ex- pressivity refers to individual differences in the extent to which people overtly express their emotions. Pugh suggests that emo- tional expressivity acts as an “output ﬁlter” between emotional ex- periences and their expression and that this ﬁlter is relatively stable. Its relevance for understanding emotion-generated behav- ioral outcomes in organizations is discussed by Pugh.

Emotions are known to disrupt ongoing activities and interfere with performance tasks, partly through the interference effects of rumination and intrusive thought. Numerous discussions of emo- tions, cognitive interference, and rumination have been published in the past few years (see Sarason, Pierce, & Sarason, 1996, and Martin & Tesser, 1996). All indicate the importance of cognitive in- terference for understanding the performance consequences of emotions. In this area, Sarason and his colleagues have developed a measure of individual differences in the tendency to engage in interfering thoughts during task performance, the Thought Oc- currence Questionnaire (Sarason, Sarason, Keefe, Hayes, & Shearon, 1986). This disposition appears to be a prime candidate for understanding differences in the work performance conse- quences of emotional states. Finally, both Larsen (2000b) and Parkinson and Totterdell (1999) have recently offered classiﬁca- tion schemes for affect-regulation strategies. Larsen has suggested that such schemes readily lend themselves to dispositional analy- ses of regulatory processes.

Affective states inﬂuence judgments and behaviors in ways other than through the by-products of regulatory processes. Both discrete emotions, and particularly mood states, bias memory and judgments and inﬂuence the depth of cognitive processing (Weiss, 2002a). Gohm and Clore (2000) have presented an analysis of the role that personality plays in the link between mood states and

# 142 PERSONALITY AND WORK

these information processing outcomes that is totally consistent with the process logic we have been arguing for. They ﬁrst lay out the stages linking immediate mood states with judgments and pro- cessing outcomes. Working from the “affect as information” ap- proach, they propose the key stages of reaction, attention (to affective states or reactions), and attribution (for affective states or reactions). They then propose a classiﬁcation of individual differ- ence measures relevant to these stages and organize relevant ex- isting trait measures into their classiﬁcatory scheme. The program has the virtue of tying personality directly to process and the added advantage of using personality moderator predictions as a way of testing the validity of process.

# Conclusion

This chapter was intended to offer thoughts on studying the rela- tionship between personality and affect. The overabundance of studies correlating various personality traits with dispositionalized operations of affect attests more to the simplicity of thinking about this relationship than to the utility of conducting such studies. This body of research tells us much less than we need to know about af- fect and personality.

The primary source of difﬁculty is the disconnect between the stable (by deﬁnition) nature of personality traits and the transient, time-bound nature of affective states. Affect states, as states, change over time, and the changing nature of these states makes expla- nation by way of stable dispositions difﬁcult, but not impossible.

The answer to the conceptual disconnect, however, is not found in remaking state variables into trait variables. Correlations may be found between personality and aggregated mood or job satisfaction, but such correlations do little to help us understand the role of dispositions in explaining true affective experiences. Rather, we argue that the role of personality can be found by ﬁrst taking a thorough look at the complex chain of processes that link events to emotional reactions and emotional reactions to behav- ioral, cognitive, and attitudinal outcomes. This examination will ﬁnd that personality constructs of many different types have vari- ous roles to play all along the mediational path.

There are wrong turns to be taken here as well. We believe that one risk is the arbitrary creation of dispositionalized elements of

## DISPOSITIONAL INFLUENCES ON AFFECTIVE EXPERIENCES AT WORK 143

the process. So, for example, Larsen et al. (2002) look at the me- diational processes (good) but then suggest that researchers should examine individual differences in these processes. We agree that there are likely to be individual differences in these media- tional processes, but we also believe that full, productive analysis will link these differences to existing and well-accepted personal- ity constructs (positive affectivity, negative affectivity, self-efﬁcacy, affect intensity, and others), not create new measures of individual differences in mediational constructs (the “tendency to see events as personally relevant”). Tying together existing constructs with mediational processes brings more information to the analysis, in- formation gleaned from the nomological network of the already existing variables. Dispositionalizing process does not do this to the same extent.

The other risk is the generation of a laundry list of disconnected personality ﬁndings, a natural outcome of the complexity of emo- tion processes. We understand this risk but at this point choose to accept it. Emotion processes are complex. Consequent dispositional contributions are also going to be complex. For the time being, this is the price to be paid for careful study of dispositional-process links. Our ﬁnal comment goes beyond issues of affect. Many out- comes of interest to I/O psychologists vary substantially over time. Dispositional explanations of these variables tend to focus on the same sort of aggregations characteristic of the research on affect. As with affect, the within-person variance goes unmodeled and is treated as error. Personality has a role in explaining the dynamic nature of these outcomes, but as we suggest, that role will be de- ﬁned by appropriate connections to mediational processes.

# CHAPTER 6

# Personality and Counterproductive Workplace Behavior Michael J. Cullen Paul R. Sackett

Despite overwhelming evidence that personality traits are useful pre- dictors of counterproductive workplace behaviors (CWBs), little progress has been made in describing the processes underlying the observed empirical linkage between personality and CWBs. In brief, we lack an understanding of why personality traits should be pre- dictive of counterproductive behavior. A sound theoretical under- standing of the basis for our empirical ﬁndings is necessary not only to make sense of these results in the aggregate, but also to guide fu- ture research in proﬁtable directions. In this chapter, we aim to chart a tentative course for researchers interested in exploring more deeply the relationships between personality and CWBs.

# Foundation Understandings

This chapter rests on an understanding of what counterproductive work behavior is and documentation that personality traits are use- ful predictors of CWBs.

# Deﬁning Counterproductive Work Behavior

Counterproductive workplace behavior at the most general level refers to any intentional behavior on the part of an organization

150

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 151

member viewed by the organization as contrary to its legitimate interests (Sackett & DeVore, 2001). We distinguish counterpro- ductive behavior from counterproductivity, viewing the latter as the tangible outcomes of counterproductive behavior. We view counterproductive behavior as a facet of job performance and performance as reﬂecting behaviors rather than outcomes. For example, in a given time period, violation of safety procedures (behaviors) may not result in any injuries (outcomes), thus illus- trating the distinction between counterproductive behavior and counterproductivity.

This deﬁnition of CWB takes the perspective of the organization. Thus, a behavior can be performed by many employees in an orga- nization (for example, a setting where taking sick leave when not ac- tually sick has become widespread), and hence the behavior is not deviant in the norm-violation sense; nevertheless, the organization may view the behavior as contrary to its legitimate interests.

CWBs encompass a broad number of categories of behaviors. Gruys (2000) sorted behaviors in the literature into eleven categories:

- Theft and related behavior • Destruction of property • Misuse of information (reveal conﬁdential information; falsify records)

- Misuse of time and resources (waste time, alter time card, con- duct personal business during work time)

- Unsafe behavior • Poor attendance • Poor-quality work (intentionally slow or sloppy work) • Alcohol use • Drug use • Inappropriate verbal actions (argue with customers; verbally harass coworkers)

- Inappropriate physical actions (physically attack coworkers; physical sexual advances toward coworker)

This list is presented to give a sense of the range of behaviors

## in this domain rather than as an exhaustive compilation.

An important issue is the need for an understanding of the co- variance structure of CWBs. There has been a tendency to treat

# 152 PERSONALITY AND WORK

each form of CWB as discrete, resulting in separate literatures on behavior categories such as theft, drug and alcohol use, absen- teeism, and unsafe behaviors. Sackett and DeVore (2001) reviewed literature on the interrelationships among CWBs. Self-report, other-report, and direct judgments of likelihood of co-occurrence support the notion of positive interrelationships among CWBs. Self-report data indicated positive correlations in the range of .30 between individual counterproductive behaviors but higher cor- relations of about .50 between composites of related behaviors, a ﬁnding replicated with data using supervisor ratings. It also appears reasonable to think in terms of an overall CWB construct, as grand composites across broad ranges of CWBs exhibit internal consis- tency reliabilities in the .80s and .90s. Sackett and DeVore suggest a hierarchical model, with a general CWB factor at the top; a se- ries of group factors, such as the organizational deviance and in- terpersonal deviance factors identiﬁed by Bennett and Robinson (2000), below this general factor; and speciﬁc behavior domains, such as theft, absence, safety, and drug and alcohol use below these group factors. Researchers and practitioners may focus at differ- ent levels of this hierarchy for different applications. In many per- sonnel selection settings, organizations are interested in identifying prospective employees who will not engage in the broad range of CWBs, and thus may focus on the broad CWB construct. In con- trast, an intervention may be sought that will deal effectively with a single speciﬁc problem behavior (for example, widespread vio- lation of safety procedures).

Another important issue is the relationship between CWBs and the domains of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCBs) and contextual performance. One perspective, articulated by Ben- nett and Stamper (2001), views these as positive (OCB) and neg- ative (CWB) discretionary behavior and hypothesizes that they reﬂect opposite ends of an overall continuum of discretionary be- havior. Empirical evidence does suggest that these two domains are related, though methodology appears to have a strong inﬂu- ence on study ﬁndings. Sackett and DeVore (2001) report a cor- relation of about −.60 between supervisor ratings of the two domains, based on the results of a meta-analysis and two large- scale individual studies. In contrast, much smaller correlations are found with self-reports of behavior in the two domains. Laczo

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 153

(2002) reports r = −.17 between the two domains; Miles, Borman, Spector, and Fox (2002) report r = −.11; and Kelloway, Loughlin, Barling, and Nault (2002) report r = −.20. Perhaps most telling in resolving the issue of viewing OCBs and CWBs as one or two di- mensions is emerging evidence of different correlates of the two domains. For example, Miles et al. report that a measure of nega- tive affectivity correlates .35 with CWB and .12 with OCB. Thus, al- though the OCB and CWB domains are not unrelated, we view them as two meaningfully distinct domains.

# Personality as a Predictor of CWBs

As summarized by Sackett and DeVore (2001), the results of count- less individual studies and at least three meta-analyses have estab- lished that personality traits are useful predictors of a wide variety of CWBs. Meta-analytic evidence from the integrity testing litera- ture, the Big Five literature, and the literature on the prediction of military performance all make clear that some personality dimen- sions show consistent relationships to CWBs. The strongest ﬁndings are for the dimension of Conscientiousness. First, integrity tests showed sizable relationships (mean observed r = .27 and .20 for two different types of integrity tests) with CWBs, and research on the constructs underlying integrity tests showed that Conscientiousness was the single largest source of variance in integrity tests, followed by Agreeableness and Emotional Stability (Ones, Viswesvaran, & Schmidt, 1993). Second, Hough (1992) separated the Big Five Con- scientiousness dimension into dependability and achievement sub- facets and reported similar relationships with CWB criteria (mean observed r = .19 and .24 for achievement and dependability). Third, the military’s Project A similarly separated dependability and achievement and reported comparable ﬁndings (mean observed r = .18 and .30 for achievement and dependability; McHenry, Hough, Toquam, Hanson, & Ashworth, 1990). These conclusions were based on well over one hundred studies of several hundred thousand individuals. Thus, among the Big Five personality di- mensions, Conscientiousness is the strongest predictor of a broad class of CWBs. There is also general support for the hypothesis that Emotional Stability and Agreeableness are predictive of broad cat- egories of CWBs.

# 154 PERSONALITY AND WORK

At a more molecular level, various studies have demonstrated the utility of these three Big Five traits and their lower-order facets in predicting a variety of more speciﬁc CWBs. For instance, re- searchers have demonstrated the utility of one or more of these traits as predictors of absenteeism (Judge, Martocchio, & Thoresen, 1997), turnover (Barrick & Mount, 1996), delinquency (Hough, 1992), workplace violence (Ones & Viswesvaran, 2001), substance abuse (Schmidt, Viswesvaran, & Ones, 1997), property damage (Ones & Viswesvaran, 1998), and a broad array of violent and non- violent criminal behaviors (Collins & Schmidt, 1993; Eysenck & Gudjonsson, 1988).

# Why Do Personality Traits Predict CWBs?

A basic premise of this chapter is that there are many ways in which personality traits may inﬂuence the occurrence of CWBs. In order to organize the hypothesized lines of causal inﬂuence, it is useful to draw a distinction between what we will term initiated CWBs and reactive CWBs. Initiated CWBs are, as the label implies, initiated by the individual to satisfy some need or motive. Individuals may initiate a counterproductive behavior (for example, steal from the organization) to satisfy a motive such as pleasure, greed, thrill seek- ing, risk taking, or attention seeking. Reactive CWBs, in contrast, are engaged in by the individual in response to some actual or per- ceived organizational event. In these cases, the behavior is engaged in to satisfy a motive such as retaliation, revenge, release, or escape. Several observations about this distinction are in order. First, any type of CWB could be initiated in some settings and reactive in others. One individual may steal to satisfy a need for risk taking, while another may steal in retaliation for perceived mistreatment by a supervisor. Thus, it is not the case that types of CWBs can be categorized as initiated or reactive. Second, any given CWB may be engaged in to satisfy multiple motives. Two individuals may both be seeking an outlet to react to perceived injustice but differ in risk-taking propensity; the one high in risk-taking propensity may choose theft as the means of retaliation, while the one low in risk- taking propensity may choose to extend work breaks.

This distinction between initiated and reactive CWBs is re- ﬂected in Figure 6.1, which is the organizing device for this chap- ter. As Figure 6.1 indicates, one manner in which personality traits

may inﬂuence the occurrence of CWBs is by initiating those be- haviors. We hypothesize that as an initiator of CWBs, personality traits exert both a direct line of causal inﬂuence and a more indi- rect line of inﬂuence by helping to shape the attitudes held toward the CWBs and a set of perceptual variables including perceived job stress, perceived injustice and dissatisfaction.

A second manner in which personality traits may inﬂuence the occurrence of CWBs is by moderating relationships between orga- nizational events and CWBs. As Figure 6.1 indicates, we hypothesize that speciﬁc personality traits moderate two sets of relationships. The ﬁrst is the relationship between organizational features (job characteristics, work group characteristics, or company policies) and a set of perceptual variables including perceived job stress, per- ceived injustice, or dissatisfaction. The second is the relationship between those perceptual variables and the counterproductive be- haviors themselves.

In this chapter, we point to evidence that personality may be linked to CWBs in all of these ways. We do not mean to suggest that a comprehensive explanatory model of these linkages is possible at this stage. Indeed, any attempt to explain the processes linking personality and CWBs is part of a larger and continuing effort within personality psychology itself to explain how personality and behavior are interconnected. In sum, we offer here a model that posits ﬁve mechanisms by which personality can affect CWBs:

- 1. Personality as a direct determinant of CWBs. We will posit lim- ited instances in which individuals are “hard-wired” by biological and neurochemical mechanisms to engage in counterproduc- tive behavior (impulsive behavior that bypasses cognitive as- sessment of appropriateness).

- 2. Personality as a determinant of attitudes toward counterpro- ductive behaviors, with such attitudes leading to various CWBs. 3. Personality as a determinant of a set of perceptual variables in- cluding workplace satisfaction, moods, stress, and injustice, with these perceptual variables leading to various CWBs.

- 4. Personality as a moderator of perceptions of environmental events (personality leads some to perceive as unjust organiza- tional events seen as just by others), with those perceptions leading to various CWBs.

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 157

- 5. Personality as a moderator of cognitive, affective, and emo- tional reactions to perceived environmental events (personality leads to different behavioral reactions to injustice).

We explore each of these possibilities in the ﬁve sections that follow.

## Personality as a Direct Determinant of Counterproductive Behavior

One reason personality traits may inﬂuence the occurrence of counterproductive behaviors is that they reﬂect internal biological states that predispose us toward certain relatively stable patterns of behavior in general. The idea that personality traits may reﬂect bi- ological states has a long history in the ﬁeld of personality psy- chology. Allport (1937) conjectured that traits reﬂect neuropsychic systems with motivational properties. Murray (1938) viewed needs as “psycho-chemical” forces, and Eysenck (1990) attempted to link his three-factor theory of traits—Extraversion, Neuroticism, and Psychoticism—to individual differences in nervous system func- tioning and formation (Winter & Barenbaum, 1999). More re- cently, McCrae and Costa (1999) have deﬁned traits as deep, unobservable psychological entities that are biological in origin.

Recent empirical evidence is strongly supportive of the thesis that personality traits are reﬂections of events taking place at the molecular level. In particular, by examining the neurotransmitters that govern the transmission of nerve impulses and their linkages to human behavior, researchers are beginning to identify the bio- logical states associated with our personality traits.

To date, the most progress has been made in relation to the traits of Extraversion and Impulsivity, which as a trait essentially re- ﬂects a state of high Extraversion, low Conscientiousness, and low Agreeableness (Digman, 1997; Eysenck, 1997). There is emerging consensus that the neurotransmitter dopamine inﬂuences the ex- pression of either extraverted-type behaviors or impulsive behaviors, or both. Disagreement remains, however, about whether the line of neurobiological inﬂuence lies more properly with Extraversion or Impulsivity speciﬁcally. One group of researchers contends that dopamine production directly inﬂuences extraverted-type behavior

# 158 PERSONALITY AND WORK

only (Depue & Collins, 1999), while another group contends that dopamine production inﬂuences behaviors more closely aligned with aggressive or impulsive-sensation-seeking behaviors (Gray, 1991; Cloninger, Svrakic, & Przybeck, 1993; Zuckerman, Kuhlman, Thornquist, & Kiers, 1991).

The fact that so much of the research linking biology to per- sonality has centered on the trait of Impulsivity makes it especially important, for the purposes of this chapter, to understand the bi- ological theory of personality. Apart from its links to counterpro- ductive behaviors through its relationship to the higher-order factors of Conscientiousness and Agreeableness, Impulsivity is pre- dictive of many counterproductive behaviors in its own right. For instance, Impulsivity has been found to be a moderately good pre- dictor of alcohol, marijuana, cigarette, and psychedelic drug use (Watson & Clark, 1993), juvenile delinquency (Robins, John, Caspi, Mofﬁtt, & Stouthamer-Loeber, 1996), verbal slurs, and co- ercive actions (Baumeister, Heatherton, & Tice, 1994; Hynan & Grush, 1986).

The fact that dopamine or other neurotransmitters inﬂuence the occurrence of a certain set of behaviors does not normally mean that our behavior is determined solely by those neurotransmitters. Whether we succumb to the inﬂuence of any biological state may simply depend on whether we choose to be guided by their inﬂu- ence. For instance, although various biological systems may tell us we are hungry and increase the odds of our eating, in most cases we are able to resist these impulses by making a conscious decision not to eat. In similar fashion, although high dopamine levels may be associated with a tendency to engage in impulsive behaviors at work, such as substance abuse, in most cases we are able to resist these impulses by making a conscious decision not to use these substances.

Although we are usually able to resist the inﬂuence of biolog- ical states through choice behavior, this may not always be the case. For instance, if neurotransmitter levels are extreme enough, they may induce personality disorders or psychopathological states. The neurotransmitter serotonin provides a case in point. Extremely low levels of serotonin are known to produce very aggressive behavior and are often associated with psychopathy, murder, and suicide (Zuckerman, 1995). Such cases call into question whether an in-

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 159

dividual has much choice whether to engage in the behaviors as- sociated with a particular neurotransmitter.

In such cases, a given personality trait, as a reﬂection of an un- derlying biological state, should have a direct effect on behavior because its inﬂuence is for the most part unmediated by any choice behavior on the part of the individual coworkers. Although per- sonality traits can be considered direct determinants of counter- productive behaviors in these extreme cases, we hypothesize that these occasions will be somewhat rare. In most cases, we expect personality traits to exert their inﬂuence on counterproductive be- haviors indirectly, through their effect on either our attitudes to- ward various counterproductive behaviors or general workplace attitudes or moods. Indeed, when individuals possess extreme lev- els of a neurotransmitter that regulates a given personality trait, the population under consideration may no longer be a “normal” population of adults. For instance, many of these individuals may satisfy the clinical criteria for a particular personality disorder. In- dividuals who are very high on neuroticism may satisfy many of the diagnostic criteria for borderline personality disorder, including vulnerability, anxiety, and depression. Similarly, individuals who are very high on the Conscientiousness dimension may satisfy many of the criteria for obsessive personality disorder, such as a preoccupation with order and perfectionism (Widiger, Verheul, & van den Brink, 1999).

Research into the links between biology and personality is in its infancy. The important point for the purpose of this chapter is that in an as yet undetermined number of cases, counterproduc- tive behaviors at work may in fact be manifestations of clinical dis- orders that have their origins in biological systems. The extent to which this is true has not yet been adequately addressed.

## Personality as a Determinant of Attitudes Toward CWBs

Personality traits may exert their inﬂuence on counterproductive behaviors indirectly by inﬂuencing our attitudes toward those be- haviors. For instance, the trait of Agreeableness may produce an unfavorable attitude toward aggressive acts, which may in turn make it unlikely that an individual will engage in violent acts in the

# 160 PERSONALITY AND WORK

workplace. A body of evidence in fact links personality traits to the attitudes we hold toward certain behaviors and our attitudes to- ward those behaviors to whether we choose to engage in them.

# The Theory of Reasoned Action

Attitudes are a summary evaluative judgment of a psychological ob- ject. The judgment is usually couched in dimensions such as good- bad, pleasant-unpleasant or likeable-unlikable (Ajzen, 2001; Eagly & Chaiken, 1993). We focus here on Fishbein and Ajzen’s theory of reasoned action (1975), which is currently the most widely en- dorsed theory of attitude formation (Ajzen, 2001). According to the theory, our attitudes toward a behavior are the product of two things: our beliefs about the consequences of engaging in a given behavior and our evaluation of the desirability of the consequences of that behavior. These two elements are multiplied to obtain an individual’s overall attitude toward a behavior.

According to the theory of reasoned action, behavioral inten- tion is normally the best predictor of how a person will behave, and behavioral intentions are a weighted additive function of a person’s attitude toward the behavior (A) and his or her subjective norms (SN) about what others think he or she should do. The subjective norm element is composed of a normative belief about whether relevant individuals or groups think the individual should or should not perform the behavior and the individual’s motivation to comply with that individual or group.

The theory of reasoned action has been successfully used to predict the behavioral intention to commit a number of behaviors, including having an abortion, smoking marijuana, and choosing among political candidates (Beck & Ajzen, 1991). On rarer occa- sions, the theory has been applied to socially undesirable behav- iors, such as lying, cheating, and shoplifting (Beck & Ajzen, 1991). More recently, in his theory of planned behavior, Ajzen (1991) has argued that behavior is a function of both behavioral intention and perceived behavioral control, which refers to people’s per- ception of the ease or difﬁculty of performing a given behavior. While we acknowledge that there may be instances where per- ceived behavioral control can inﬂuence the occurrence of a CWB (theft or destruction of property), these instances would seem to

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 161

be rare. For the vast majority of CWBs (unsafe behavior, poor attendance, poor-quality work, drug use, alcohol use), we would expect most people to be conﬁdent they can perform these be- haviors. Thus, for the purposes of this chapter, we focus on the at- titudinal and subjective norm components articulated in the original theory of reasoned action.

## Personality and the Theory of Reasoned Action

The fact that behavioral intention to engage in a counterproduc- tive behavior is a function of attitudes toward that behavior and subjective norms concerning that behavior suggests four possible paths through which personality can inﬂuence the occurrence of CWBs. Speciﬁcally, personality can inﬂuence either of the belief components associated with our attitude toward a given counter- productive behavior (that is, beliefs about the consequences of the behavior or beliefs about the desirability of those consequences), or either of the subjective norm components related to that be- havior (beliefs about what relevant others believe one should do and motivation to comply with that norm).

Beliefs About the Consequences of CWBs There would appear to be a wide range of potential perceived con- sequences of engaging in CWBs. We posit that two key conse- quences are detection and sanction. For example, if I steal from the organization, will I be detected, and, subsequently, if detected, will there be sanctions? Other consequences are possible as well, such as effects on self-image and effects on how one is viewed by others.

Of interest, then, is the question on whether personality vari- ables are related to these beliefs. It is interesting to note that item formats explicitly dealing with these perceptions are a part of some integrity tests. For example, a public domain instrument developed by Ryan and Sackett (1987) contains the agree-disagree item, “A person could steal company merchandise for 10 years without being caught.” The established link between Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Emotional Stability and integrity test score sug- gests that personality traits are linked to beliefs about the likeli- hood that certain CWBs are detected. There appears to be little

# 162 PERSONALITY AND WORK

systematic research on the relationship between personality variables and various perceived consequences of CWBs. However, one per- sonality trait that may affect this perception is self-monitoring (Snyder, 1987). High and low self-monitors differ in the importance they accord to making a good impression. Individuals high in self- monitoring care about what other people think of them, and they may adjust their behavior to enhance others’ perception of them. Be- cause they are less concerned with public perceptions of their be- havior, low self-monitors may not perceive any personal consequences for committing a CWB. In contrast, high self-monitors may perceive that there are very important negative social consequences to such behavior and thus be less likely to commit CWBs.

Covey, Saladin, and Killen (1989) demonstrated that high self- monitors will not increase their rate of cheating when given incen- tives, whereas low self-monitors will do so. Beliefs about the potential social embarrassment of getting caught may be enough to dissuade the high self-monitor from engaging in high-risk cheating.

Beliefs About the Desirability of the Consequences of CWBs Let us consider next how personality traits might be related to our beliefs about the desirability of outcomes arising from CWBs. As an example, we consider how a particular personality trait, achieve- ment striving, might inﬂuence our attitude toward the counter- productive behavior of production deviance, that is, not working diligently on the job.

One mechanism through which the trait of achievement striv- ing could affect judgments about the desirability of the conse- quences of not working hard is cognitive dissonance theory (Festinger, 1957). According to dissonance theory, individuals are motivated to maintain a logical consistency surrounding the items of knowledge, information, or beliefs that relate to them or their surroundings. When important beliefs are not consistent with each other, dissonance theory predicts that an individual will experience a state of psychological discomfort and attempt to ease that dis- comfort by making the beliefs consonant with each other.

How do these insights apply to our example? Individuals who are low on achievement striving think of themselves, and are thought of by others, as unambitious, unindustrious, and unen- terprising (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Accordingly, these individuals

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 163

hold the important self-belief that they lack ambition. Assume they also hold the belief that production deviance will have negative consequences for them. These two beliefs are not consonant with each other. The unambitious individual knows that his lack of am- bition is likely to lead to a lack of effort at work—and thus, possi- bly, production deviance—but also believes that this lack of effort will be bad for him. Accordingly, holding these joint beliefs should create a state of psychological discomfort. Dissonance theory pre- dicts that this individual should be motivated to reduce the dis- comfort by changing his behavior or modifying one of these beliefs. One possible dissonance-reducing strategy is to change his behavior at work by exerting more effort. In this case, production deviance will not occur, and dissonance will be eliminated. How- ever, individuals really lacking in ambition may ﬁnd it difﬁcult to exert the necessary effort to avoid engaging in production de- viance. For this reason, this individual may choose to reduce dis- sonance by changing his belief about the desirability of the consequences of production deviance. For example, he may de- cide that the consequences of lack of ambition, and speciﬁcally production deviance, are not so undesirable after all.

If this manner of thinking rings true for the individual low on achievement striving, then the attitude toward production deviance should be enhanced for this individual. Holding the subjective norm component constant, this enhanced attitude toward pro- duction deviance should increase the likelihood that an individual low in achievement striving will engage in production deviance.

Beliefs About the Existence of Norms About CWBs Beliefs about norms may be speciﬁc to the current work situation or more general. According to the theory of reasoned action, a given CWB will be more likely to be performed, all else equal, if a person believes that the behavior is widespread. This in and of it- self is straightforward; the question of interest is individual differ- ences in such beliefs. Departures from a “correct” perception of, say, the proportion of employees who steal may occur as a result of multiple mechanisms, including selective observation and selective recall.

It is worth noting that normative beliefs about CWBs, and about counterproductive behaviors outside the workplace, are a

# 164 PERSONALITY AND WORK

commonly used item format in overt integrity tests. The Ryan and Sackett (1987) integrity instrument contains agree-disagree items such as, “Most of my friends have taken a little money or mer- chandise from their employer,” “Just about everyone has shoplifted something,” and “Most people cheat on their income tax.” A fac- tor analysis of one widely used integrity test, the London House Personnel Selection Inventory, identiﬁes a normative beliefs factor as one of four factors underlying overall test scores (Harris & Sack- ett, 1987). Given that such items contribute substantially to in- tegrity test scores and given the relationship between integrity test scores and Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, and Emotional Sta- bility, it is likely that there is indeed a link between personality and normative beliefs about CWBs.

Motivation to Comply with Perceived Norms About CWBs Personality traits can also affect the subjective norm component of the behavioral intention equation by inﬂuencing our motivation to comply with workplace norms. In our view, the two traits likely to affect motivation to comply with workplace norms are the “du- tifulness” facet of Conscientiousness and the “compliance” facet of Agreeableness. Individuals who are dutiful are characterized by a tendency to adhere strictly to their ethical principles and fulﬁll their moral obligations (Costa & McCrae, 1992). As such, they are likely to be motivated to comply with the normative behavioral standards that have been set in the workplace. In contrast, indi- viduals who are not dutiful do not take these obligations very seri- ously and may thereby be less likely to care whether they are obeying workplace norms. In a similar vein, individuals low on compliance are characterized by a tendency to be aggressive and a preference to compete rather than cooperate (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Such individuals may simply not be motivated, by virtue of their low levels of compliance, to observe the wishes of those in charge of the workplace.

If the traits of dutifulness and compliance do affect motivation to comply with workplace norms, then these traits directly affect the subjective norm component of the behavioral intention equa- tion. Speciﬁcally, these traits weaken the subjective norm compo- nent. Thus, holding attitude toward showing up late constant, low levels of compliance and dutifulness should increase the likelihood an individual will engage in a given counterproductive behavior.

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 165

## Personality as a Determinant of Moods and Work Attitudes

As Figure 6.1 illustrates, we hypothesize that personality traits indi- rectly inﬂuence the occurrence of counterproductive behaviors by shaping attitudes toward CWBs, as discussed in the previous section, and by shaping workplace emotions, work attitudes, and percep- tions of the work environment. Here we refer to attitudes toward work, in contrast with the previous focus on attitudes toward CWBs. In the discussion that follows, we examine the inﬂuence of person- ality traits on workplace moods and job attitudes speciﬁcally as rep- resentative features of the set of work attitudes, perceptions, and emotions in Figure 6.1.

# Personality and Mood

To understand how personality traits can affect the occurrence of CWBs through mood states, it is important to review the manner in which these traits are linked to mood states generally. We dis- cuss this from the standpoint of the Three-Factor Model of per- sonality introduced by Tellegen (1985).

Tellegen (1985) identiﬁes three orthogonal personality dimen- sions: Extraversion/Positive Emotionality (E/PE), Neuroticism/ Negative Emotionality (N/NE), and Disinhibition/Constraint (DvC). For the purposes of this section, the N/NE and E/PE fac- tors are the most relevant factors. N/NE refers to the extent to which an individual perceives the world as threatening, problem- atic, and distressing, and E/PE concerns an individual’s willingness to engage the environment (Clark & Watson, 1999). Abundant ev- idence links these two factors to the Big Five factors. Essentially, E/PE and N/NE dimensions represent the Extraversion and Neu- roticism dimensions from the Big Five (McCrae & Costa, 1985; Watson, Clark, & Harkness, 1994).

An important feature of Tellegen’s conception (1985) of E/PE and N/NE—and one that distinguishes it from the Big Five con- ception of Extraversion and Neuroticism—is that different affective states are at the core of the E/PE and N/NE dimensions. For instance, despite transitory shifts in mood, those high in N/NE gen- erally experience the world as distressing and frequently experi- ence feelings of guilt, sadness, anger, and contempt. In contrast,

# 166 PERSONALITY AND WORK

individuals high on the E/PE dimension generally feel joyful, in- terested, attentive, excited, and enthusiastic.

Research is now considering the extent to which E/PE and N/NE, and the emotions and moods they engender, relate to work- place behaviors. Although few studies have speciﬁcally studied the relationship between PE and CWBs, some have demonstrated that high PE is positively related to positive moods at work and that such positive moods are related to a variety of helping behaviors classi- ﬁed as organizational citizenship behaviors (George, 1991). From a theoretical perspective, positive moods are theorized to be linked to helping behaviors because these moods facilitate perceiving peo- ple in a positive light and induce people to be attracted to others (George & Brief, 1992).

Just as there are good reasons for hypothesizing that individu- als high on E/PE will engage in helping behaviors, there are good reasons for hypothesizing that individuals low on E/PE may en- gage in a variety of CWBs. Individuals who are low in E/PE often experience moods such as sluggishness and drowsiness (Watson & Tellegen, 1985). It seems reasonable to hypothesize that those who are often sluggish and drowsy will lack the energy and enthusiasm required to make the effort to show up for work on time and tackle jobs with the energy required to do them well. They may therefore be likely to engage in CWBs such as absenteeism, production de- viance, and misallocation of time-related resources. In line with this hypothesis, George (1989) found that positive moods at work were signiﬁcantly negatively correlated with absence.

There are also good reasons for hypothesizing that individu- als high on N/NE will engage in an assortment of CWBs. Individ- uals high on this dimension are prone to experience feelings of sadness, anger, and contempt. One might reasonably expect these feelings to be linked to both aggressive and passive counterpro- ductive behaviors. To date, however, very little research has ex- plored the linkages among negative affect, mood at work, and the behavioral consequences of these feelings. Some studies have in- vestigated the relationship between negative affect and withdrawal behaviors, but results are somewhat inconsistent. For instance, Cro- panzano, James, and Konovsky (1993) found that negative affect was associated with turnover intentions, but George (1989) did not. In light of the strong theoretical reasons for believing that negative

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 167

affect should be related to many of the counterproductive behav- iors listed in Figure 6.1, we encourage researchers to explore those linkages more fully.

# Personality and Job Satisfaction

One of the most frequently studied work attitudes is job satisfaction, often deﬁned as an affective reaction to one’s job (Fisher, 2000) or a pleasurable or emotional state resulting from an appraisal of one’s job (Locke, 1969). Theoretically, there are a number of reasons that personality should be predictive of job satisfaction. Perhaps the most straightforward explanation is that our natural resting state of E/PE or N/NE may affect our affective judgments about the world in which we work. For instance, individuals who are higher on the E/PE dimension may be more inclined to make a positive summary evaluation of the work environment. In contrast, individuals high on N/NE may be more inclined to make a negative summary eval- uation of the work environment.

Mood induction experiments provide some support for this proposition, especially with respect to negative affect. For instance, individuals with higher negative affect are more susceptible to a neg- ative mood induction than those low in negative affect (Larsen & Ketelaar, 1991) and more resistant to a positive mood induction (Brief, Butcher, & Roberson, 1995). Thus, individuals high on N/NE may have a predisposition to focus on what is negative in the work environment and ignore what is positive. A recent meta-analysis by Connolly and Viswesvaran (2000) conﬁrms that negative and positive affect are strongly related to job satisfaction. They found that the sample-size weighted corrected mean correlations of job satisfaction with positive and negative affect were, respectively, .49 and −.33. As we will explore more fully, the link between job satis- faction and various CWBs is well established. In particular, job sat- isfaction is negatively related to turnover (Carsten & Spector, 1987) and absenteeism (Hackett, 1989).

In closing this section, we note that Figure 6.1 posits that the at- titudinal and normative components of the theory of reasoned ac- tion both mediate and moderate the linkage between our set of work attitudes, perceptions, and emotions and CWBs. We have al- ready sought to explain the manner in which personality traits affect

# 168 PERSONALITY AND WORK

the attitudinal and normative components of the theory of rea- soned action and will not duplicate that process in respect of the set of work attitudes, perceptual variables, and emotional variables in Figure 6.1. We simply point out that there are a variety of means through which the attitudinal and normative components might mediate the relationship among work attitudes, workplace per- ceptions, emotions, and CWBs. For a simple example of mediation, perceptions of workplace injustice may adversely affect the moti- vation of an individual to comply with the wishes of others, thus decreasing the value of the subjective norm component of the be- havioral intention equation and, consequently, increasing the like- lihood that an individual will engage in a CWB. For an example of moderation, the presence of a workplace security camera would be expected to increase the perceived negative consequences of engaging in a CWB. In this manner, it should foster negative atti- tudes toward CWBs, thus reducing the behavioral intention to en- gage in them. The altered behavioral intention should affect the relationship between perceptions of injustice and the probability that perception will be translated into a CWB.

Personality as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Organizational Features and Satisfaction, Perceived Injustice, and Stress

Our discussion to this point has focused on the role personality traits may play in initiating counterproductive behaviors. We now turn to a set of processes wherein organizational events and fea- tures trigger the occurrence of unwanted behaviors. Because coun- terproductive behaviors occur in this process as a reaction to organizational events, we classify these types of behaviors as reac- tive CWBs.

We hypothesize that organizational events inﬂuence reactive CWBs indirectly by inﬂuencing employees’ perceptions of job stress, job satisfaction, and justice, which in turn inﬂuence the oc- currence of the counterproductive behaviors. For the purposes of this chapter, we interpret the phrase organizational events very broadly to include job characteristics, work group characteristics, and company policies and practices.

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 169

Personality traits are hypothesized to operate as moderators at two points. First, they are hypothesized to moderate the relation- ship between the organizational events and employee perceptions of stress, justice, and dissatisfaction. Second, they are hypothesized to moderate the relationship between these perceptions and the occurrence of the CWBs. This section foucses on the relationship between events and perceptions and then on the relationship be- tween perceptions and CWBs.

## Organizational Events and Perceptual Variables

One of the most widely investigated relationships among the or- ganizational and perceptual variables in Figure 6.1 is the relation- ship between job characteristics and job satisfaction. Originally, Hackman and Oldham’s job characteristics model (1976) hypoth- esized that ﬁve core task dimensions—task identity, task variety, au- tonomy, task signiﬁcance, and feedback—would be linked to a number of psychological states, such as job satisfaction, and sub- sequent organizational events, such as absence and turnover. Re- search has indeed established that the attributes that Hackman and Oldman named are useful predictors of job satisfaction (Agho, Mueller, & Price, 1993; Ambrose & Kulik, 1999). Researchers have also investigated the relationship between job characteristics and perceived job stress. Workload, ﬂuctuations in the amount of work demanded at different times, and the amount of control or dis- cretion an individual has over the work process have all been linked to perceived job stress (Bromet, Dew, Parkinson, & Schul- berg, 1988; Perrewe & Ganster, 1989; Spector, 1986; Tetrick & LaRocco, 1987).

Company policies and procedures have been linked to both job satisfaction and perceptions of injustice. For instance, both organi- zational constraints (O’Connor, Peters, Rudolph, & Pooyan, 1982) and work schedules have been linked to lower job satisfaction (Ral- ston, 1989). Organizational justice studies are concerned with in- vestigating the perceived fairness of procedures and outcomes in organizations. As such, it is usually divided into two categories: pro- cedural justice, which is concerned with the perceived fairness of the procedures used to determine organizational outcomes, and

# 170 PERSONALITY AND WORK

distributive justice, which is concerned with perceptions of the fair- ness of the outcomes themselves. Perceptions of injustice are by deﬁnition caused by workplace policies and procedures. Research examining which types of policies and procedures can give rise to perceptions of injustice has burgeoned in recent years and in- cludes procedures relating to selection and stafﬁng, performance appraisal, compensation, and layoffs (Gilliland & Chan, 2001).

## Personality as a Moderator of the Organizational Event–Perception Relationship

We hypothesize that one signiﬁcant moderator of the relationship between the stated organizational events and perceptual variables is neuroticism, or negative affect. Speciﬁcally, we hypothesize that individuals high on negative affect will be more likely to perceive organizational events as stressful, unjust, or unsatisfying than will individuals who are low on negative affect. Such individuals are predisposed to respond negatively to perceptual stimuli.

Some research does demonstrate that individuals high on neg- ative affect interpret ambiguous stimuli in a threatening manner and may therefore see crises where others do not (Costa & McCrae, 1990; Watson & Clark, 1984). One particularly intriguing line of research in support of this position comes from mood-induction experiments, which have found that individuals higher in negative affect are more susceptible to a negative mood induction than in- dividuals with low negative affect (Levin & Stokes, 1989) and more resistant to a positive mood induction (Brief et al., 1995). Parkes (1990) found that negative affect moderated the relationship be- tween work demands and well-being, such that individuals high on negative affect perceived their work environment as being more stressful than individuals low on negative affect. Similarly, Moyle (1995) found that negative affect moderated the relationship be- tween control over the work environment, time constraints, and symptoms of stress. These relationships are supportive of the hy- pothesis that negative affect moderates the relationship between organizational events and perceptions of stress, injustice, and dis- satisfaction. However, research into these relationships is only in the initial stages, and further research is encouraged.

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 171

The above discussion focuses on neuroticism and negative af- fect as personality dimensions for which we can offer broad hy- potheses. It is also worth noting that in speciﬁc circumstances, one could posit relationships between many other personality dimen- sions and perceptions of satisfaction, stress, and injustice. A com- pany policy restricting socializing among employees at work may inﬂuence these perceptions among extraverts but not introverts. A change in job design adding public speaking to work require- ments may be stressful for introverts but not extraverts. A change in work rules setting higher performance standards may be stress- ful to highly conscientious workers concerned about meeting the standard, but not to less conscientious workers not concerned about meeting the standard. As these examples illustrate, such ef- fects are speciﬁc to the situation in question. One would not posit, for example, Extraversion as a generalizable moderator of the job- characteristics–satisfaction relationship.

Personality as a Moderator of the Relationship Between Satisfaction, Perceived Injustice, and Stress and CWBs

Here, we explore the possibility that there are individual differences in the relationship between dissatisfaction, perceived injustice, and stress and engaging in various CWBs. There are two separate issues here: whether dissatisfaction, injustice, and stress lead to engaging in CWBs, and if so, which CWB is exhibited.

## Satisfaction, Perceived Injustice, Stress, and CWBs

Research has linked satisfaction, perceived injustice, and stress to CWBs. The relationship between job satisfaction and employee turnover has been the focus of much of this research. In particu- lar, many structural models have been created to explain the rela- tionship between job satisfaction and turnover (Bannister & Griffeth, 1986; Dalessio, Silverman, & Schuck, 1986; Hom, Grif- feth, & Sellaro, 1984; Mobley, Horner, & Hollingsworth, 1978). Other meta-analyses have found signiﬁcant relationships between overall job satisfaction and absenteeism (Hackett, 1989).

# 172 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Perceptions of injustice are also related to theft (Greenberg, 1993; Skarlicki & Folger, 1997), retaliatory behaviors (Skarlicki, Folger, & Tesluk, 1999), organizational withdrawal, and other CWBs. In a recent meta-analysis, Colquitt, Conlon, Wesson, Porter, and Ng (2001) reported that the estimated population correlation between procedural justice and withdrawal, after correcting for sampling error and unreliability, was −.36 for procedural justice and −.41 for distributive justice.

Finally, perceptions of workplace stress often result in CWBs. In the face of a perceived environmental stressor, individuals must somehow cope. CWBs such as withdrawal from work or substance abuse may be the chosen ways of coping. Perceived work stress has been linked to withdrawal (Leiter & Robichaud, 1997), turnover intention (Jamal, 1990), and sabotage (Storms & Spector, 1987).

# Personality Traits as Moderators

In the previous section, we asserted that speciﬁc personality traits moderate the relationship between the organizational events and perceptions of satisfaction, injustice, and stress. That discussion ex- amined whether people perceive organizational events as stressful, unjust, or unsatisfying. By asserting that personality traits moderate the relationship between the perceptual variables and counterpro- ductive behaviors, as we do here, we are asserting that personality inﬂuences how we react to stress, job dissatisfaction, and feelings of injustice, assuming we do experience those feelings.

As indicated in Figure 6.1, we are not positing that personality traits operate independent of cognition in moderating the linkage among stress, job dissatisfaction, feelings of injustice, and CWBs. Instead, we hypothesize that the moderating effect of personality traits on these relationships is mediated by the attitudinal and sub- jective norm components of the theory of reasoned action. Hav- ing already explained how personality traits might affect the attitudinal and normative components of the theory of reasoned action, we focus here on a consideration of which personality traits are likely to moderate the relationship between perceptions of workplace dissatisfaction, stress, and injustice and CWBs.

We hypothesize that the chief moderators of the relationship between the perceptual variables and CWBs are Impulsivity, Ex-

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 173

traversion, and Conscientiousness and that individuals higher on Impulsivity, lower on Extraversion, and lower on Conscientious- ness will be more likely to react to those perceptions by engaging in CWBs than individuals at the opposite ends of those dimensions. Many studies have examined the relationship between per- sonality traits and coping with stress. Most of the research in this regard has been conducted in relation to neuroticism, or negative affect, and many studies ﬁnd that negative affect is associated with avoidance-based coping, distancing oneself, hostile reactions, and detachment rather than problem-focused coping and support seek- ing (Bolger, 1990; Costa & McCrae, 1989; Folkman & Lazarus, 1985; Smith, Pope, Rhodewalt, & Poulton, 1989). Other studies ﬁnd that pessimism, a trait often associated with negative affect, is a moderator of the stress-outcome relationship (Carver & Scheier, 1999). Optimists tend to cope by using more problem-focused cop- ing strategies, whereas pessimists tend to cope by disengaging from goals. In general, these studies support the contention that neu- roticism represents a vulnerability factor that predisposes an indi- vidual to react negatively toward stressors (Spielberger, Gorsuch, & Lushene, 1970). They are also consistent with the view of neu- roticism reﬂected in personality inventories themselves, which often explicitly contain items directed to the issue of stress reac- tivity (for example, “I sometimes get too upset by minor setbacks”; Watson & Hubbard, 1996).

In terms of implications for CWBs, this research suggests that individuals high in negative affect may respond to stressful work environments (and potentially to job dissatisfaction and injustice as well) by engaging in retaliatory work behaviors and reducing ef- fort on work-related tasks. Support for these hypotheses comes from a study by Skarlicki et al. (1999), who found that the rela- tionship between perceptions of injustice and retaliatory behaviors by employees had the strongest effect on individuals low in Agree- ableness and high on negative affect, and Strutton and Lumpkin (1992), who found that pessimists react to work stress by increas- ing the number of non-work-related behaviors, such as sleeping, eating, or drinking.

The question of which CWBs the high-negative-affect individ- ual will perpetrate in response to feelings of stress or dissatisfac- tion may depend somewhat on the level of speciﬁcity at which one

# 174 PERSONALITY AND WORK

measures the broader construct of neuroticism. According to Costa and McCrae (1992), neuroticism is characterized by the six facets of anxiety, angry hostility, depression, self-consciousness, impulsiveness, and vulnerability. One can readily imagine that individuals high on the depression facet speciﬁcally may react to perceptions of stress, injustice, and dissatisfaction very differently from individuals who are high on the angry hostility component. In the former case, we would hypothesize that reactions to the perceptual variables might manifest themselves in more withdrawal types of behaviors, such as absenteeism or production deviance, whereas in the latter case, the reactions might include more aggressive behaviors, such as theft or inappropriate verbal or physical actions.

Individuals who are high on Extraversion are often described as friendly, sociable, warm, and outgoing (Costa & McCrae, 1992). What will the reactions of these people be to organizational dis- satisfaction, stress, or perceptions of injustice? Although little re- search bears on this question, it seems reasonable to take our cue from the stress-response literature. In general, research has demon- strated that extraverted individuals use more problem-based cop- ing strategies in reaction to stressful events than introverts do (McCrae & Costa, 1986; Vollrath, Banholzer, Caviezel, Fischli, & Jungo, 1994). Highly extraverted individuals also tend to seek out more social support in reaction to stressful events than introverts do and to be more restrained in their reaction to stress (McCrae & Costa, 1986). As many commentators have noted, these re- sponses are not altogether unexpected. Because individuals high on Extraversion, or positive emotionality, are prone to feeling joy- ful, attentive, and enthusiastic, we would expect them to look for positive ways of dealing with perceptions of stress, dissatisfaction, and injustice. Two of these methods are to seek out support from others and look for realistic solutions to problems. Thus, unless the social support received is in the form of suggestions for retal- iatory behavior against the company, we would not expect ex- traverts to engage in many counterproductive behaviors in response to these perceptions.

Individuals who are conscientious are dutiful, orderly, self- disciplined, competent, and achievement striving and are de- scribed by words such as thorough, organized, industrious, efﬁcient and enterprising (Costa & McCrae, 1992). Little research bears on

## PERSONALITY AND COUNTERPRODUCTIVE WORKPLACE BEHAVIOR 175

the issue of Conscientiousness as a moderator of the relationship between stress, dissatisfaction, and justice and CWBs. However, the stress-response literature once again suggests a reasonable hy- pothesis. In general, this literature suggests that in response to stressful life events, conscientious individuals engage in more ac- tive planning, less maladaptive coping, and more support-seeking behavior than do nonconscientious individuals (Jelinek & Morf, 1995; Vollrath et al., 1994; Vollrath, Torgersen, & Alnaes, 1995; Watson & Hubbard, 1996). These ﬁndings suggest that conscien- tious individuals will seek out more constructive ways to deal with stress, dissatisfaction, and injustice than will nonconscientious in- dividuals, resulting in fewer counterproductive behaviors.

# Conclusion

We have sought to trace the multiple processes through which per- sonality may inﬂuence the occurrence of counterproductive be- haviors. Our central thesis has been that there are many ways in which personality traits may exert their causal inﬂuence in relation to these behaviors. In particular, we have argued that personality traits may exert their causal inﬂuence by initiating, both directly and indirectly, the occurrence of counterproductive behaviors and by moderating the relationship between organizational events and perceptions of job satisfaction, stress, and injustice and these per- ceptions and counterproductive behaviors.

As we mentioned at the outset, this chapter is part of an ongo- ing effort within personality psychology to understand the causal paths between personality and behavior generally. As such, the chapter is necessarily preliminary, provisional, and incomplete. It is our hope that we have sparked the interest of researchers inter- ested in the linkages between personality and counterproductive behaviors and provided direction for future research in this area.

# CHAPTER 7

Toward an Understanding of the Multilevel Role of Personality in Teams Greg L. Stewart

Work organizations have increasingly adopted team structures; a recent survey suggests that as many as half of the Fortune 500 use teams in some part of their operation (Devine, Clayton, Philips, Dunford, & Melner, 1999). Although small group researchers have studied teams for decades, industrial/organizational (I/O) psy- chologists have only recently begun to examine how teams alter human resource practices.

One area of emerging research focuses on the role of person- ality in team contexts. This research originates from two perspec- tives. One examines how team settings create an environment that inﬂuences relationships between individual personality traits and individual performance (Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1998). The other examines how individual traits aggregate to form team-level personality, which in turn affects team and organizational perfor- mance (for example, Barrick, Stewart, Neubert, & Mount, 1998; Barry & Stewart, 1997). Personality can thus be studied in team set- tings at both the individual and team levels of analysis. In this chap- ter, I review research related to both levels, illustrate areas where additional research is needed, and develop a multilevel perspec- tive of personality in teams.

# Individual-Level Relationships in Teams

Research that focuses on relationships between individual traits and individual performance in team settings is an extension of ex- isting personality research. Grounded in an interactionist per- spective (Snyder & Ickes, 1985), these analyses suggest that teams create a setting requiring increased cooperation, thereby altering the impact of certain traits on individual performance (see Chap- ter Three, this volume). Team structure thus creates organization and team-level factors that inﬂuence individual-level personality relationships.

# Research Findings

A meta-analysis by Mount et al. (1998) examined relationships be- tween Five-Factor Model (FFM) traits and overall job performance in a team environment. We found Agreeableness to have the strong- est relationship ((cid:1) = .33), followed by Emotional Stability ((cid:1) = .27), Extraversion ((cid:1) = .22), Conscientiousness ((cid:1) = .21), and Openness to Experience ((cid:1) = .16). We also examined relationships with a more speciﬁc performance criterion of how well the team mem- bers interacted with others. The results were similar: the strongest relationship was for Agreeableness ((cid:1) = .35), followed by Emotional Stability ((cid:1) = .25), Conscientiousness ((cid:1) = .17), Extraversion ((cid:1) = .16), and Openness to Experience ((cid:1) = .07). Neuman and Wright (1999) found Agreeableness and Conscientiousness to pre- dict peer ratings of individual performance beyond job-speciﬁc skills and general cognitive ability. Agreeableness thus appears to be a particularly important predictor of individual performance in team settings, which is somewhat counter to ﬁndings in settings that do not involve extensive teamwork (Barrick, Mount, & Judge, 2001). The impact of Emotional Stability and Extraversion on in- dividual performance also appears to be magniﬁed in some team settings.

Why are some traits linked more strongly to performance in team settings? Barry and Stewart (1997) found social inputs to me- diate the relationship between Extraversion and peer ratings from teammates. Stewart, Fulmer, and Barrick (2002) also explored this question by examining relationships between FFM traits and team

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 185

member roles. Agreeable team members contributed to team suc- cess by ﬁlling social roles. Conscientious team members ﬁlled crit- ical task roles. Agreeable and conscientious team members were also more accurate in their self-perceptions of social and task roles, respectively. Team members high on Emotional Stability were sim- ilarly found to be more accurate in their self-perceptions of both social and task roles. These results suggest that similar to other set- tings, Conscientiousness is linked to individual performance pri- marily through behavior that represents task contributions. Unique to team settings, Agreeableness is linked to performance primar- ily because of the social demands. The relatively stronger rela- tionship for Emotional Stability may also stem from greater awareness of how an individual member contributes to the team. One effect of organizing workers into teams thus appears to be an increased emphasis on social inputs, and thereby on associated traits such as Agreeableness and sometimes Extraversion. Selecting team members with desirable personality traits may thus be helpful for improving individual performance in team settings. However, as we will see, this improvement in individual performance does not always translate into an improvement in team performance.

# Directions for Future Research

Alternative theoretical perspectives provide some interesting ideas for future research. One is the notion that in a team setting, an individual’s environment is predominantly composed of other team members. An interesting question is whether the traits of a team member inﬂuence the behavior of other team members. Ev- idence that this occurs is found in theory developed by LePine and Van Dyne (2001). In their model, team member responses to a low performer depend on attributions. A team member low in Consci- entiousness evokes an internal attribution of high controllability. Teammates see the low-conscientious person as able but unwilling to perform at a higher level and thus respond with behavior aimed at providing either encouragement and motivation or rejection in the form of criticism. In contrast, a highly conscientious team mem- ber who is not performing well evokes either external attributions or peer behavior directed toward training. The conscientiousness of team members thus inﬂuences the behavior of their teammates.

# 186 PERSONALITY AND WORK

LePine and Van Dyne (2001) also suggest that a very agreeable team member may evoke feelings of empathy in teammates, in- creasing the likelihood that they will direct their efforts toward training behavior.

Other traits have not generally been examined in terms of their inﬂuence on teammates. For instance, the inclusion of a highly extraverted team member is likely to alter the entire setting because extraverts compete with others and create a less coopera- tive environment (Barrick, Stewart, & Piotrowski, 2002). It also seems possible that an emotionally unstable individual can change the environment, creating an environment of mistrust and anxi- ety. Such an effect of creating mistrust can be particularly harmful because team trust has been identiﬁed as an important factor for eliminating dysfunctional conﬂict in teams (Simons & Peterson, 2000). Studying the impact of a team member’s traits through the impact on other team members thus appears to be an area where future research is likely to be enlightening. Indeed, an under- standing of the dynamic interplay among team members is likely to provide substantial insight into how personality traits have unique effects in team settings.

Another theoretical perspective that can provide insight con- cerns the effects of situational strength and autonomy. Some settings provide strong situations where behavior is mostly a function of en- vironment rather than traits. Other settings provide very weak situ- ations where the inﬂuence of traits is relatively strong in comparison to the environment (Kenrick & Funder, 1988). The best established moderator in individual settings is perhaps autonomy. Barrick and Mount (1993) found stronger trait-behavior relationships for set- tings with high autonomy. A common feature of teams is increased autonomy, suggesting that trait-behavior relationships should gen- erally be enhanced in team settings. The autonomy created by teams needs closer examination before drawing this conclusion.

Higher autonomy at the team level does not necessarily trans- late to higher autonomy at the individual level. Barker (1993) stud- ied manufacturing teams that were collectively given high levels of team autonomy, which they used to create norms and rules that tightly controlled individual behavior. Autonomy at the team level should therefore not be assumed to equal autonomy at the indi- vidual level. The introduction of empowered teams into an orga-

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 187

nization may thus either increase or decrease individual-level re- lationships between personality and behavior, depending on the extent to which autonomy ﬁlters to the individual level of analysis. Group-level features of teams such as autonomy, cohesion, hierar- chical control, norms, and conﬂict may thus moderate relation- ships between traits and behavior. Future research that looks at how these group-level characteristics moderate individual-level per- sonality relationships should be fruitful.

An alternative perspective also suggests that situational strength may have a unique effect in team settings. Maslach, Santee, and Wade (1987) manipulated the perception of peer opinion in small groups. Participants in their study were assessed to determine how the relationship between their traits and behavior was affected by consistency of peer opinions. In one scenario, a strong situation was created by participants’ being led to believe that their peers were in agreement about a topic. In the other scenario, a weak sit- uation was created by participants’ being led to believe that their peers held a split opinion. The linkage between the participants’ traits and behavior was strongest when the peer opinion was unan- imous. This ﬁnding led Maslach et al. (1987, p. 102) to conclude that “strong situations may make self-presentational concerns very salient, particularly when the situation that is strong is social and interpersonal in nature (such as social norms or the demands made by other people). Under such circumstances, a person’s traits and self-concept may be more directly involved in the attempt to behave in more self-expressive or self-enhancing ways; conse- quently, the link between personality and behavior should be strong, not weak.”

The ﬁndings of Maslach et al. (1987) suggest that teams may create the very type of social setting where a strong situation cre- ated by peers actually results in closer linkage between traits and behavior. A person’s desire to retain and enhance his or her self- concept and individual identity may result in that individual’s be- having consistently with his or her traits because of the strong peer pressure to do otherwise. Given that the effect operates in social and interpersonal settings, it is most likely to occur in teams, thereby creating a strong situation whereby traits have a stronger link to behavior. Future research should thus look at how consis- tency among the traits and behaviors of teammates creates a strong

# 188 PERSONALITY AND WORK

situation and thereby inﬂuences relationships between an indi- vidual’s traits and behavior.

Research at the individual level of analysis thus highlights the potential uniqueness of team settings. Interpersonal traits, partic- ularly Agreeableness, are better predictors of performance than they are in individually oriented settings. Much of this effect likely occurs through the interplay of team member traits, whereby the traits of one’s teammates inﬂuence relationships between one’s traits and behavior. Only limited research has been done in this area, but several theoretical perspectives suggest that future re- search may be a key to unlocking a better understanding of per- sonality in team settings.

From a practice perspective, research suggests that traits can be useful predictors of individual performance. Similar to non- team settings, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are help- ful facilitators of task-oriented performance dimensions. In contrast to many individual performance settings, Agreeableness is a critical predictor of social inputs. These social inputs improve not only team viability but also the likelihood of synergistic actions that ultimately improve individual task performance. Neverthe- less, personality traits should be used cautiously as performance predictors in team settings, because the traits that lead to improved performance for an individual may have a negative inﬂuence on the inputs of others and thereby harm collective performance. Speciﬁc examples of such an effect, along with guidelines for prac- tice, will be described below in relation to a cross-level discussion of personality.

# Team-Level Personality

Applying the concept of personality to teams risks anthropomor- phism, which occurs when things not human are ascribed human characteristics. Although such application can often be danger- ously superﬁcial, Kozlowski and Klein (2000) point out that a process of emergence can occur whereby individual phenomena aggregate to form collective phenomena. The key to effective cross- level application is to clearly describe the nature of the construct at the new level and how the phenomena are linked across levels.

# Can Teams Have Personality?

Personality at the individual level is deﬁned as a person’s social reputation or the structures, dynamics, processes, and propensity inside a person (Hogan, 1991). Extending this deﬁnition to the team level of analysis suggests that teams can have personality to the extent that they have regularities in behavior that are perceived consistently by outside observers and internal dynamics and processes that inﬂuence their actions. Teams have observable reg- ularities in both behavior and internal processes, suggesting that the construct of personality may indeed be useful at the team level of analysis.

A key difference from individual-level research is that the trait should be descriptive of the group as a whole rather than of indi- viduals who comprise the team. At the individual level, the dimen- sions on which people vary are captured in lexical approaches, which assume that “those individual differences that are most sig- niﬁcant in the daily transactions of persons with each other will eventually become encoded into their language” (Goldberg, 1981, p. 142). The question is the extent to which descriptors at the in- dividual level have application to daily transactions at the team level. Kets de Vries and Miller (1986) did some initial work in this area by describing how organizations develop pathological tendencies that are similar to individual-level pathologies such as depression and compulsion. Although this approach is insightful, a lexical focus on the descriptive concepts encoded into language can potentially pro- vide greater insight into the daily activities of teams.

Lexical classiﬁcation of normal personality at the individual level has converged on the FFM. Factor analysis of trait descrip- tions across languages and cultures suggests that trait descriptors can ultimately be grouped into ﬁve broad categories (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Digman, 1990). The FFM classiﬁcations are Agree- ableness (friendliness, generosity, cooperative), Conscientiousness (efﬁcient, organized, thorough), Extraversion (sociable, outgoing, ascendant), Emotional Stability (relaxed, optimistic, unfearful), and Openness to Experience (unconventional, imaginative, ad- venturous). An important question is thus how well team regular- ities can be grouped into the FFM classiﬁcations.

# 190 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Although no empirical research compares lexical descriptions of teams with descriptions of individuals, a number of studies and case descriptions adopt language that is highly similar to FFM dimensions. Bettenhausen and Murnighan (1991) created coop- erative and competitive bargaining teams. These teams differed substantially on Agreeableness, with some being described as ar- gumentative and stubborn and others as trusting and straightfor- ward. Davis-Sacks (1990) studied a credit analysis team of federal employees. Although individuals were described as conscientious, the team did not meet its major deadline and was described with terms like careless and unreliable, which are negative markers of Con- scientiousness. Barker (1993) examined manufacturing teams that could be classiﬁed as low in Emotional Stability. Over time, the teams developed a sense of sadness and fear. Consistent with low Emo- tional Stability, they expressed feelings of vulnerability and self- consciousness. Cohen and Denison’s study of ﬂight teams (1990) contrasted an extraverted team with an introverted one. The ex- traverted team constantly chatted with ﬂight passengers, enjoyed receiving attention, and competed hard to excel at customer ser- vice. The introverted team was less hurried and less enthusiastic. Although the individual team members were somewhat outgoing, the team as a whole adopted a relatively detached approach to social interaction. Saavedra (1990) reported differences that are repre- sentative of Openness to Experience. One beer sales team followed standard operating procedures and did not look for alternative methods of accomplishing tasks. Another team constantly altered procedures and approached tasks in unconventional ways.

Based on common descriptors of teams, the FFM appears to be at least somewhat adaptable for describing important traits at the team level of analysis. Yet the extent to which FFM trait descriptors are capable of capturing the full range of team regularities and trends is unknown. This is an area where additional research is needed. Nevertheless, because the FFM is based on studies that have incorporated as many as eighteen thousand descriptors (All- port & Odbert, 1936; Goldberg, 1981), it seems quite possible that it may have adequate breadth to summarize important team traits. Even if additional research discovers that the FFM is not as useful for describing teams as individuals, existing evidence does support the idea that teams develop both behavioral regularities and in-

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 191

ternal processes. The concept of personality at the team level does appear to be meaningful and may even present an alternative to the ubiquitous input-process-output model that permeates teams research. Indeed, the notion of personality at the team level may provide a mechanism for describing and integrating both internal and external characteristics and interactions.

# How Do Traits Form at the Team Level?

A theoretical perspective for answering the question of where team traits come from can be found in individual-level trait theory. Re- search has found individual traits to be the result of two forces: ge- netics and environment (Plomin & Daniels, 1987). This analogy suggests the need to identify both nature and nurture effects at the team level.

The nurture analogue at the team level is relatively easy: a team’s external inﬂuences should inﬂuence the team similarly to how an individual’s surroundings inﬂuence that person. To date, most of the research related to external inﬂuences on team trait development has focused on the tasks that a team performs. Be- cause genes are the raw material of individuals, a useful analogue to a gene is the individual. This analogue cannot, however, be di- rectly applied to the team level, because teams can change their members but people cannot to date change their genes. Never- theless, thinking of members as genes does provide some poten- tial insight into how team personality forms and cross-level relationships between the concept of personality at individual and team levels.

Because individuals at the team level are analogous to genes at the individual level, theoretical models of the process through which genes combine to inﬂuence an individual’s traits can be helpful for understanding how individual characteristics combine to form a team’s traits. Speciﬁc gene combinations are referred to as genotypes. The expressed trait is referred to as a phenotype. A genotype thus represents the actual genes that a person possesses, and the phenotype is the trait that others observe. Applying ge- netic concepts to the team level suggests that the genotype is de- ﬁned by a summary of the characteristics of the individuals. The phenotype is more difﬁcult to describe and depends on the process

# 192 PERSONALITY AND WORK

through which individual-level characteristics combine to create a team-level trait.

At the individual level, genes combine through three different effects (Rowe, 1994). First, dominance takes place when the pres- ence or absence of a speciﬁc gene combination determines the manifestation of the trait. For teams, this effect suggests that the team-level trait (phenotype) is dependent on the inclusion, or ex- clusion, of at least one member who possesses (or does not pos- sess) the individual characteristic. Second, an additive process occurs when gene combinations representing high trait expres- sions substitute linearly for gene combinations associated with lower trait expressions. Applied to the team level, this additive ef- fect suggests that a team-level trait (phenotype) is determined by the extent to which team members in aggregate possess that trait. Finally, epistasis occurs when the combination of genes related to a particular trait depends on the genes related to a different trait. At the team level, epistasis may be exhibited when the manner in which individual team member traits combine to create a certain team-level trait depends on some other characteristic of the team. For instance, if a team has one member high on openness and one low on openness, the team-level openness trait may depend on the extent to which the two team members are extraverted.

The application of these gene effects is similar to methods al- ready adopted to capture team-level personality. Taking more of a nurture perspective to personality formation, Barrick et al. (1998) used Steiner’s taxonomy of tasks (1972) as a basis for choosing a method to aggregate individual traits into team-level constructs. We suggested that trait formation is an averaging process when teams engage in additive tasks, making the mean of the individual trait scores an appropriate form of aggregation. The desirable per- sonality traits of each member form a collective resource pool. For compensatory tasks, where outcomes are the product of an aver- aging of diverse inputs, team traits are dependent on the distribu- tion of individual traits. The variance of the individual trait measure is thus a useful form of aggregation. Conjunctive tasks re- quire inputs from each member of a group, suggesting that the in- clusion of an individual with a low score on a desirable trait may adversely affect team performance. The lowest individual trait score can thus be used as an indicator of the team-level trait. In

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 193

contrast, high performance on disjunctive tasks requires only a sin- gle team member to excel, suggesting that the highest individual trait score may be representative of the team trait.

The dominance effect from genetics and the maximum and minimum methods from task type both suggest that a team’s traits are often dependent on the individual traits of a single team mem- ber. The additive process of gene combination and the notion of additive tasks are alternative perspectives that lead to the same ap- proach of using the mean of individual trait scores as the team’s trait score. The epistasis effect for gene combination suggests that individual traits may somehow interact to form a team trait, and the notion of compensatory tasks suggests that in some settings, the distribution of individual traits is critical for understanding the team trait.

These forms of aggregation are similar to processes that Koz- lowski and Klein (2000) described. They suggest that a lower-level phenomenon (individual personality) emerges into a higher- level phenomenon (team personality) through composition, a lin- ear combination similar to an additive effect, or compilation, which represents nonlinear interactive combination similar to dominance and epistasis. The three methods can also be viewed from Chan’s typology (1998) as process models of composition in that the team- level parameter is an analogue of parameters at the lower level. The additive process does, however, operate the same as Chan’s additive model, in that it is simply a summation of individual char- acteristics. Combining the genetic perspective with multilevel the- ories thus suggests that individual characteristics aggregate to the team level in several ways.

# Research Findings

Similar to research at the individual level, Agreeableness has been found to be a critical trait at the team level. Barrick et al. (1998) found mean and minimum levels of Agreeableness to correlate with team performance. We also found four operationalizations (mean, min- imum, maximum, variance) to correspond with increased social cohesion and decreased team conﬂict. Neuman and Wright (1999) similarly found the lowest individual score for Agreeableness to correspond with team-level interpersonal skills, as well as team-level

# 194 PERSONALITY AND WORK

measures of accuracy and work completion. As predicted by a dom- inance effect, the inclusion of a single individual either very high or very low on Agreeableness seems to have a large impact on col- lective cooperativeness, and thereby the performance of the team. In accordance with the additive notion of combining individuals and the additive nature of tasks, average levels of Agreeableness also appear to correspond with higher team performance. Teams composed of agreeable members thus seem to have higher per- formance because they cooperate more and work together better. Barrick et al. (1998) also found Extraversion, regardless of the method of operationalization (mean, variance, minimum, maxi- mum), to correspond with higher levels of social cohesion. All methods of operationalization for Extraversion, except variance, also corresponded with reduced team conﬂict. However, only the Extraversion minimum score corresponded with team perfor- mance, with the inclusion of one very introverted person harming performance. Barry and Stewart (1997), using the proportion of individuals high on Extraversion as a variance indicator, found teams consisting of approximately half extraverts to have the high- est performance. Extraversion does appear to translate into dif- ferences in cohesion and conﬂict, which is supportive of the notion that this individual-level trait translates into a team-level trait. More- over, Extraversion appears to aggregate in both a dominant and an additive manner.

Agreeableness and Extraversion thus represent two interper- sonal traits that have important team-level effects. This is not sur- prising given that interpersonal traits can be exhibited only in the presence of other people. Kenrick and Funder (1988) concluded that the presence of even a single individual with very desirable or very undesirable interpersonal traits can inﬂuence relationships within an entire group. In accordance with this observation, in- terpersonal traits appear to combine at least somewhat in a domi- nant fashion, whereby one individual strongly inﬂuences the team trait. The overall trait for the team is thus quite dependent on the interpersonal traits of individual team members, particularly if those individual traits are extreme.

Given that conscientiousness generally relates to performance across tasks and roles, it seems reasonable to predict that team-level conscientiousness will form in an additive fashion. This is sup-

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 195

ported by Barrick et al. (1998), who found the mean level of Con- scientiousness to correlate with team performance. However, the evidence also supports a dominance effect for Conscientiousness. Neuman and Wright (1999) found the inclusion of a single team member low on Conscientiousness to harm measures of team ac- curacy and work completion. Conscientiousness is thus likely to ag- gregate by both additive and dominance effects, with the team’s tasks potentially playing an important role. Tasks that are not highly interdependent and allow team members to compensate for the shortcomings of individuals should result in more of an addi- tive effect.

Emotional Stability at the team level also seems to operate with additive and dominant effects. Barrick et al. (1998) found that the mean and minimum levels of Emotional Stability relate to a vari- ety of team process measures, including cohesion, conﬂict, ﬂexi- bility, communication, and workload sharing. The inclusion of even a single member low on Emotional Stability thus seems to have a harmful impact on the internal dynamics of a team.

# Future Research

The primary method of assessing team personality is thus to mea- sure and aggregate individual-level measures. In essence, each of the current approaches suggests that team-level personality can be assessed through measuring and statistically combining individual- level traits. This approach can be justiﬁed theoretically. However, little effort has been directed toward assessing whether team traits can be reliably assessed with measures targeted speciﬁcally at team- level perceptions. Can available individual-level trait measures be adapted to measure traits at the team level of analysis reliably? If team traits change with tasks, are team-level traits stable enough to label as personality? One method of assessing this is to ask team members and observers to provide measures of regularities and patterns for the collective group. In essence, this is what Chan (1998) refers to as a referent-shift consensus composition model, where individuals provide data but the target of their response is the team as a whole rather than an individual. Future research should compare this cross-level approach to measurement with cur- rently adopted measures that aggregate individual-level traits. Such

# 196 PERSONALITY AND WORK

comparisons will likely shed light on relationships between indi- vidual and team-level traits.

An aspect of the gene combination analogy that has not been explored is epistasis. Do traits interact with each other? One pos- sibility is that individual traits interact to inﬂuence team-level traits. This seems most possible when there are status differences in the team: people with higher status have stronger inﬂuences on groups (Berger, Webster, Ridgeway, & Rosenholtz, 1986). Extraverted peo- ple also tend to be aggressive and seek dominance over others (Stewart & Barrick, in press). The other individual traits of the extravert may thus have a greater inﬂuence on the team trait. For instance, an individual who is high on both Extraversion and Open- ness to Experience may inﬂuence the team toward developing openness. In contrast, an individual-level combination of Openness and low Extraversion may not be inﬂuential. Research related to such interactions, particularly with Extraversion in team settings, is needed and should provide additional insight into the process of team trait formation.

With the exception of perspectives that assess a team’s tasks, lit- tle work has been done to understand the inﬂuence of environ- mental factors on team personality development. Perhaps the best-developed insights into the effect of environment on team per- sonality are in the area of team norms, deﬁned as “informal rules that groups adopt to regulate and regularize group members’ be- havior” (Feldman, 1984, p. 47). This deﬁnition is very similar to the concept of personality. In fact, a lexical approach to team per- sonality in many ways provides a framework for labeling various norms. Feldman (1984) suggests that norms develop in four ways: members carry over behavior from past situations, team members and leaders make explicit statements, critical events occur, and pri- macy effects make early patterns difﬁcult to alter. The ﬁrst two are likely captured by the notion of individual traits. Previous experi- ences inﬂuence individual traits, and statements are manifestations of those traits. However, critical events and primacy suggest that events that occur in the team’s life span can have an impact on the traits that the team develops. Similar to personality at the individ- ual level (Wrightsman, 1994), these norms may develop fairly early and become somewhat resistant to change.

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 197

One interesting external inﬂuence that may create norms, and thereby team-level personality, is the amount of autonomy given to a team as a whole. Consistent with research at the individual level (Barrick & Mount, 1993), it seems possible that individual traits will have more inﬂuence on a team trait when the team as a col- lective group has high autonomy. Teams with low autonomy are not likely to develop consistent traits, but teams with high auton- omy should develop unique norms, and thus traits, that represent combinations of individual traits. For instance, the dominance ef- fect for the interpersonal trait of Agreeableness is likely stronger when team autonomy allows norms consistent with a very dis- agreeable member’s having great latitude in choosing his or her behavior, thereby inﬂuencing others.

Another potentially important external inﬂuence is leadership. Linking back to the work of psychodynamic scholars such as Freud, personality development is shown to be strongly inﬂuenced by au- thority ﬁgures. The relationship that a team experiences with its leader early in its development phases may inﬂuence its team-level traits. For instance, a leader who makes statements that encourage exploration and creativity may develop norms that increase team Openness to Experience (Feldman, 1984). A leader who intermit- tently gives and takes away team autonomy may create norms that result in an emotionally unstable team (Stewart & Manz, 1995). Such inﬂuences may be particularly strong soon after the team is formed, before strong tendencies and patterns of interaction have developed. Stage theories of individual trait development may also inform team-level research. Erikson (1963) proposed that personality de- velopment occurs at stages across the life span. Other researchers (Levinson, 1986) have suggested that a particularly important stage occurs at about midlife, when environmental inﬂuences can have a relatively stronger inﬂuence. This perspective is supported for teams by Gersick’s model of punctuated equilibrium (1989). Her ﬁndings suggest that a team’s characteristics are developed early in its life span, but then undergo radical change near the tempo- ral midpoint of its existence. Team designers and leaders can thus time their interventions to occur near a team’s temporal midpoint in order to maximize the likelihood of altering norms that inﬂu- ence patterns of behavior and interaction.

# 198 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Research related to the team level of analysis is thus rather lim- ited. The research that exists supports the notion that individual traits can combine to inﬂuence a team trait in an additive or a dominant effect. Although researchers have not yet looked at how different individual traits may interact to form a team-level trait, the epistasis effect suggests that future work in this area should be quite informative. A great deal of additional work also needs to be done to assess the impact of environment. As research evolves, we will be better able to develop theory that explains how individual traits combine with team environmental factors to inﬂuence team trait development.

From a practice perspective, research suggests that team-level traits do have an impact on team performance. One method of in- ﬂuencing these traits is careful selection of team members. The in- clusion of a single team member who is very low on Agreeableness, Conscientiousness, or Emotional Stability can potentially harm the performance of the entire team. The desirability of Extraversion for any individual also appears to depend on the levels of Extra- version for other team members. These effects suggest that the im- portance of selecting employees with desirable traits may be even more critical in team settings than in settings that rely primarily on individual performance. This is because of the potential dominance effect of an individual trait on the team trait, whereby the trait of one individual has a large impact on performance at the team level. The utility of personality traits as performance predictors, particu- larly Agreeableness, is thus likely to be severely underestimated by studies that measure individual but not team performance.

# A Multilevel Perspective

Kozlowski and Klein (2000) provide a useful framework for sum- marizing the multilevel effects of personality in teams. They sug- gest that cross-level models, which describe relationships between different constructs at different levels of analysis, tend to take three forms:

- A direct effects model, which occurs when a construct at one level (individual personality) is hypothesized to directly inﬂu- ence a construct at another level (team-level personality)

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 199

- A moderator model, which exists when a construct at one level (team cohesion) is hypothesized to inﬂuence the relationship between two constructs at a different level (individual traits and individual performance)

- A frog pond model, which occurs when the effect of a con- struct at one level (an individual trait) is dependent on the rel- ative standing of that construct in a higher-order construct (team personality as expressed by an overall mean)

Several of the multilevel effects of personality in team settings can be summarized by looking at them in terms of this framework.

# Direct Effects

The inﬂuence of individual-level personality on team-level person- ality represents a cross-level direct effect. This effect is best seen as a mixed determinant model because the individual-level traits are expected to interact with team- and organization-level constructs to inﬂuence team-level personality. Nevertheless, the traits of individ- uals are expected to have a direct effect on the team-level trait.

Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability should operate in teams much as they do at the individual level: more is better. Of in- creased interest across levels are the interpersonal traits. Because individual Agreeableness and Extraversion appear to inﬂuence the team traits in a dominant fashion, one individual can have a sub- stantial inﬂuence on team traits. These traits thus take on increased importance in team settings, primarily because of the direct inﬂu- ence on team-level constructs.

The direct effects model thus highlights the inﬂuence of indi- vidual traits on team traits and thereby on team performance. Most important, this model highlights the importance of caution when determining the process by which individual-level traits aggregate to inﬂuence the individual trait. Because some traits aggregate in a dominant fashion, they will take on increased importance in team settings. For instance, a full understanding of the utility of Agree- ableness as a selection predictor requires cross-level research that examines its impact not only on individual performance but also on team-level performance. Research related to Extraversion also clearly illustrates the need for careful analysis before assuming that an increase in performance at the individual level translates

# 200 PERSONALITY AND WORK

into an increase in performance at the team level. An important cross-level conclusion is thus that organizations need to think of team- level effects when they make individual selection decisions. In many cases, the impact on collective performance is likely to go well beyond what might be determined through measuring only individual performance.

# Moderator Effects

The inﬂuence of the team setting on relationships between indi- vidual traits and individual performance represents a moderator model. The team setting, which can be viewed as either a team or an organization-level construct, creates a setting that magniﬁes the importance of cooperative social relationships. Agreeable people have a natural tendency to cooperate with others, making agree- ableness an important predictor of individual performance in team settings. The higher-level construct of team-based organizational structure thus moderates the relationship between individual-level agreeableness and individual performance.

Another interesting moderator effect appears to occur when team structure moderates the relationship between one individ- ual’s traits and another person’s individual behavior. Based on the work of LePine and Van Dyne (2001), team members adjust their behavior dependent on how they perceive the traits of their team- mates. Because this effect is predicted only in an interdependent team setting, the higher-order construct of team structure again moderates the relationship between two individual-level variables. Various theoretical perspectives also suggest that team-level con- structs such as cohesion and conﬂict may inﬂuence relationships between traits and individual behavior.

Perhaps the key lesson learned from the moderator perspec- tive is that the higher-level construct of teams has the potential to alter individual-level relationships. Most of our research in the ﬁeld of industrial/organizational psychology has focused on perfor- mance in individually oriented settings, suggesting that we need to revisit many of our currently held assumptions. Although the focus of this chapter has been on personality, these assumptions are as- sociated with several core ideas of human resource management such as job analysis, selection, and compensation. How can job analysis inform and guide organizations that assign relatively large

## THE MULTILEVEL ROLE OF PERSONALITY IN TEAMS 201

pieces of work to groups rather than individuals? Is cognitive ability as valuable a performance predictor in settings where a high-ability member interacts and potentially compensates for lower-ability teammates? Does compensation that provides indi- vidual incentives harm contributions toward a collective goal? In each of these cases, it seems possible that the higher-order con- struct of team structure calls into question some of the basic ﬁnd- ings of research conducted in individual performance settings, suggesting the need for additional cross-level research.

# Frog Pond Effects

The least researched models are frog pond models. In these models, the effect of an individual’s traits is dependent on the conﬁguration of the individual traits of others. For instance, the conscientiousness of an individual team member may affect team-level conscien- tiousness only if other team members are relatively very low on con- scientiousness. The one study that looked at traits in this fashion was by Barry and Stewart (1997). We found that the proportion of extraverts to be linked to team performance. This frog pond per- spective assessed how the relationships among an individual-level construct related to team-level outcomes such as cohesion and per- formance.

Additional frog pond models have the potential to provide great insight. They can even be combined with direct effects and moder- ator models. For instance, it seems possible that from a direct-effects perspective, the inﬂuence of any individual trait on the team trait may be inﬂuenced by how different a particular individual is from the other members of the team. From a moderator-effects per- spective, the relationship between an individual’s traits and the be- havior of others may be inﬂuenced by how different that person is from others in the group. Indeed, frog pond models in the realm of personality appear to be an important area of research that has not yet been fully pursued.

# Conclusion

An understanding of personality in teams requires a true multilevel perspective that incorporates various cross-level effects. At one level, the team setting magniﬁes the importance of certain interpersonal

# 202 PERSONALITY AND WORK

traits, particularly Agreeableness. These traits lead to both higher individual-level performance and a direct inﬂuence on team-level characteristics. One way of viewing these characteristics is to think of teams in trait terms. Adapting the individual-level framework of the FFM to the team level of analysis suggests that our under- standing can advance as we see teams in terms of their Agreeable- ness, Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience. These team-level effects can then be as- sessed in terms of their inﬂuence on and interaction with other team-level factors.

Personality does appear to be an important construct in teams, but it can be understood only from a multilevel perspective. This perspective is required because teams represent a group-level phe- nomenon that interacts with the individual-level perspective preva- lent in most personality research. Future research and practice will advance as researchers and practitioners take into account these cross-level relationships and seek understanding across both indi- vidual and group levels of analysis. Indeed, this multilevel per- spective appears to be one of the most critical areas for future research in the ﬁeld of personality.

Self-Monitoring Personality and Work Relationships Individual Differences in Social Networks David V. Day Martin Kilduff

Relationships form the core of any organization. Creating and main- taining effective work relationships allows for task coordination, in- formation ﬂow, and other work processes necessary for accomplishing the goals and objectives of an organization. Management, in partic- ular, is a relationship-based discipline. According to Gabarro (1987), “The importance of interpersonal relationships as an aspect of man- agement is documented in study after study of managerial behavior, regardless of national culture or type of management job” (p. 172). Relationships are also important for individual success. An emerging literature demonstrates the role that social capital plays in individual job performance, leadership, and career success. So- cial capital is created when relations between people are formed that help facilitate instrumental organizational action (Coleman, 1990). Social capital is a key to individual success because it pro- vides access to critical information and other social resources (Seib- ert, Kraimer, & Liden, 2001). There are also individual differences in the quantity and quality of relationships that form the basis of social capital.

# 206 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Our purpose is to examine the theory and research pertaining to individual differences in personality that shape the development and maintenance of the kinds of network structures that allow more (or less) access to vital social resources. We also consider the conﬁguration of these relationships, the inﬂuence of individual personality on network conﬁgurations in organizations, and the structural constraints imposed on certain network conﬁgurations. Historically, relationships tend to be viewed as mainly dyadic in nature (Graen & Scandura, 1987). A broader perspective, how- ever, considers that every relationship constitutes a system. Specif- ically, relationships are open systems that are nested in a larger social environment (Reis, Collins, & Berscheid, 2000). These sys- tems are simultaneously evolving and inﬂuencing each other over time. For example, two people in a romantic relationship are con- nected to many other people in the larger social environment, but only some of these other people are likely to have accurate per- ceptions of, or the ability to exercise inﬂuence on, the state and fate of the couple’s relationship (Agnew, Loving, & Drigotas, 2001). The nature of the dyadic relationship may change signiﬁcantly as the dyad’s embeddedness in the larger social network changes. For example, the extent to which a married couple maintains tradi- tional versus egalitarian spousal roles may depend not just on the views held by the couple but also on the extent to which the pre- marriage network ties of the husband and wife (to friends and fe- male relatives, respectively) are maintained (Bott, 1957).

Relationships vary in terms of strength, reciprocity, and type. Re- lationship quality is an important but overlooked aspect of the social resources available in a network (Krackhardt, 1999). In particular, some working relationships stabilize at a relatively superﬁcial level of exchange, others at rather deep levels of mutuality (Gabarro, 1987). Personality inﬂuences both the content and the structure of social networks in work settings, one relationship at a time. Our focus is on one particular set of dispositional motives shown to be relevant for understanding how individuals shape their social worlds: those associated with the construct of self-monitoring personality (Snyder, 1974, 1987).

Why do people form and maintain relationships? The answers to this purportedly obvious question are not so simple. There are multiple possible motives for every relationship that is formed, sus-

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 207

tained, or broken. According to social exchange theory (Blau, 1974; Thibaut & Kelley, 1959), relationships are built as a way of obtaining something of value from another person—a means to an end—in exchange for something offered to the other party. Re- search on the afﬁliation motive has shown that people prefer to af- ﬁliate with similar others, especially when they face uncertainty (Schachter, 1959). The social comparison motive proposes that af- ﬁliation choices are particularly important in situations where there is no objective standard against which to compare abilities, opinions, or behaviors (Festinger, 1954). Relationships are also used for purposes of status enhancement and self-validation (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000)—essentially, of presenting the self in the best possible light according to personal values.

Answering the deeper question of what people want from re- lationships is a way of understanding why they are formed. It is a way of understanding motive. In considering the motives of indi- viduals, it is apparent that individual differences at least partially guide what is desired from relationships. People do not all want the same thing from their relationships, and their desires are shaped by various individual motives.

# Self-Monitoring Personality

In addition to guiding individual thinking and behavior, motives are shaped by dispositional factors such as personality. One partic- ular personality construct with demonstrated relevance (validity) in organizational contexts is self-monitoring (Day, Schleicher, Unck- less, & Hiller, 2002; Snyder & Copeland, 1989). An underlying as- sumption of the self-monitoring construct is that people differ in the extent that they monitor (observe, regulate, and control) the public appearance of self they display in social settings and in cre- ating and managing their interpersonal relationships (Snyder, 1974, 1987). Interesting and somewhat unique aspects of self-monitoring as a personality construct are the emphases on the conceptualization and representation of self in social situations and two separate, dis- tinct, and independent self-monitoring orientations (Gangestad & Snyder, 1985). High self-monitors tend to be pragmatic in present- ing themselves in interpersonal situations in that they regulate their behavior to promote situationally appropriate interaction outcomes.

# 208 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Low self-monitors are more likely to adopt a principled interper- sonal orientation in which there is a high correspondence between their attitudes, beliefs, and values (that is, their genuine selves) and their social behavior.

Previous research has shown that self-monitoring has good discriminant validity with other personality constructs. As Sny- der (1987) noted, “The list of other measures with which self- monitoring is not meaningfully correlated is a long one” (p. 27). This list includes constructs such as locus of control, ﬁeld depen- dence, self-esteem, social desirability, neuroticism, trait anxiety, and intelligence. A recent meta-analysis of the relationships be- tween self-monitoring and the Big Five personality factors also in- dicates generally good discriminant validity (Schleicher & Day, 2002). The sample weighted correlations between self-monitoring and Agreeableness (r = .04), Conscientiousness (r = −.02), and Neu- roticism (r = −.01) all indicate construct independence (there were insufﬁcient study numbers to examine Openness to Experience). As would be expected, however, there was a moderately large over- all correlation with Extraversion (r = .37). This is expected because Extraversion is one of the subscales of the Self-Monitoring Scale (the others being acting and other-directedness). Nonetheless, self- monitoring has been shown to be a conceptually distinct and meaningful construct apart from its subscales (Gangestad & Sny- der, 2000).

Another interesting aspect of the historical development of the self-monitoring construct is that the scientiﬁc study of self- monitoring personality and social behavior has progressed through a sequence of increasingly more complex research strategies (Sny- der & Ickes, 1985). The early-adopted dispositional strategy as- sumed that consistencies in social behavior could be understood in terms of relatively enduring dispositional characteristics associ- ated with self-monitoring. In general, this approach worked to identify categories of people who demonstrated those dispositional and behavioral characteristics of interest and provided a psycho- metrically sound measure of those categories (the Self-Monitoring Scale). The interactional strategy that followed assumed that the noted variation in social behavior was due to the interaction of dis- positional and situational factors. Empirically, this general strategy sought to identify moderator variables that illuminated those con-

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 209

ditions in which self-monitoring personality predicted (or did not predict) behavior. The most complex situational strategy seeks to understand the reciprocal inﬂuences of situations and personality on social behavior, with a focus on understanding how high and low self-monitors choose and inﬂuence their situations. These choices regarding settings and situations are thought to reﬂect im- portant aspects of personal identity, such as representations of self, beliefs, attitudes, values, and traits (Snyder, 1987). The current state of self-monitoring research, which differentiates it from the focus of most other personality research, especially in industrial/ organizational psychology, is focused on this third strategy. It as- sumes that the situations in which people ﬁnd themselves are due in large part to their individual choices. In particular, we address the theory and research that pertains to the respective choices that high and low self-monitors make regarding their relationships with others in organizations.

A recent review and synthesis of the literature on self-moni- toring proposes that the relationships constructed by high self- monitors may derive from a status enhancement motive, whereas relationships constructed by low self-monitors may derive from a self-validation motive (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000). Relationships to high self-monitors are, in part, a means for impression and image management. Friends and associates may be important to the extent that they contribute to potential image enhancement associated with belonging to a prestigious social network. High self- monitors may be susceptible to the lure of basking in the reﬂected glory of others who are seen as important, accomplished, or oth- erwise celebrated (Cialdini, 1989). Afﬁliating with others of high status is an effective means of acquiring reputational capital and power for all actors in organizations (Kilduff & Krackhardt, 1994) and may be particularly appealing to high self-monitors.

The relationships of high self-monitors also tend to be activity based. That is, high self-monitors tend to choose friends and asso- ciates based on others’ relative ﬁt to the activity at hand (Snyder, 1987). In the realm of leisure activities, high self-monitors would tend to choose tennis or golf partners based on their ability level. In work relationships, help or advice would tend to be sought from those individuals considered to have superior expertise in the do- main of interest.

# 210 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Those who are relatively low on self-monitoring fulﬁll different motives through their relationships. Low self-monitors may eschew overt impression management, preferring to display attitudes and behaviors that communicate what they consider to be their gen- uine selves. Low self-monitors cultivate relationships based on per- ceived similarities in values, beliefs, and interests. Thus, it is not surprising that low self-monitors have more homogeneous social networks than high self-monitors (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000).

Low self-monitors tend to adopt a partner-based approach to relationships. They strive to maximize the ﬁt between themselves and their friends and associates; relationships are seen as partner- ships built around the mutual appreciation of shared values, ideals, or activities (Snyder, 1987). Low self-monitors, relative to high self- monitors, demonstrate greater levels of commitment to their per- sonal (Snyder & Simpson, 1984) and work relationships (Day et al., 2002), express less intent to leave their current jobs (Jenkins, 1993), and tend to remain with current employers longer (Kilduff & Day, 1994). These noted differences between high and low self- monitors have distinct implications for the respective types of so- cial networks that are created and maintained, as well as for the respective kinds of social capital that are constructed.

A recent review and reappraisal of the research literature on self-monitoring noted a wide range of external criteria that directly tap a central dimension measured by Snyder’s Self-Monitoring Scale (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000; Snyder & Gangestad, 1986). The categories of effects most strongly associated with the central di- mension of self-monitoring were (1) variation in the predisposi- tion to engage in impression management (behavioral variability, sensitivity to expectations, interpersonal orientation, and being im- pressed with physical attractiveness); (2) skills needed for effective image cultivation and projection (expressive control and nonver- bal decoding skills); and (3) the relationship between private be- liefs and public actions (attitude-behavior relations and attitude accessibility).

At its core, however, Gangestad and Snyder (2000) speculate that self-monitoring personality “relates to status-oriented impres- sion management motives” (p. 547). That is, high self-monitors may strive to cultivate public images that create the appearance of social status, and therefore their social networks may serve as a pri-

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 211

mary means for status enhancement. Low self-monitors are also con- cerned about their public images, but may be primarily focused on their reputations as “genuine and sincere people who act on their beliefs” (p. 547). Their social networks may reﬂect this motive, speciﬁcally in the types of connections that are made with others. A brief review of the basic aspects of social networks in organizations follows to provide a better understanding of the dispositional ef- fects on these systems and their relevance to important individual and organizational outcomes.

# Social Networks in Organizations

In considering the role of individual differences in the construc- tion and maintenance of work relationships, it is important to keep in mind that relationships do not exist in a vacuum; they are con- nected to other individuals and other relationships (Agnew et al., 2001; Bott, 1957). For this reason, every relationship represents a system (Reis et al., 2000). These relational systems can take on dif- ferent appearances and can yield vastly different resources; how- ever, not all conﬁgurations of networked relationships are equally helpful to an individual or an organization (Mehra, Kilduff, & Brass, 2001).

Social networks have been used as a primary method for mea- suring the social capital of individuals and organizations. In essence, social capital refers to relational resources that are em- bedded in the ties between individuals (Coleman, 1988). The struc- tural, relational, and cognitive dimensions of social capital have been theoretically linked to the facilitation, combination, and ex- change of resources within organizations (Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998). Subsequent empirical work has demonstrated positive re- lations between social capital and individual and group perfor- mance (Mehra et al., 2001; Sparrowe, Liden, Wayne, & Kraimer, 2001), individual career success (Seibert et al., 2001), innovation and value creation (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998), and the aggregate lead- ership capacity (Day, 2001) in organizations. Overall, theory and research suggest that social networks are critical to understanding why some individuals and organizations outperform others.

A social network is deﬁned as a set of nodes (individuals) and con- nections (relationships or ties) between nodes (Brass & Krackhardt,

# 212 PERSONALITY AND WORK

1999). The absence of a connection between individuals can be just as informative as the existence of a connection. The important construct of a structural hole (Burt, 1992) in social networks is based on the lack of ties between certain actors. Furthermore, a re- lationship (or lack thereof) could be an advantage or a disadvan- tage to an individual. Forming a large network may be of less importance than one’s position within the network. A critical fea- ture in building social capital is network centrality; related to this concept is the strength of connections or ties with others in the network. Both of these components, as well as the advantageous likelihood of occupying a structural hole, can be inﬂuenced by in- dividual self-monitoring orientation.

# Centrality

The concept of betweenness centrality has been shown to predict the most powerful actors in a network (Brass, 1984; Krackhardt, 1990), as well as the success of individuals and groups (Sparrowe et al., 2001). It is also a key component of social capital and effec- tive leadership in organizations (Brass & Krackhardt, 1999). Cen- trality refers to how central an individual is relative to others in a network. An individual who connects with those who are otherwise unconnected is considered to have high betweenness centrality and thus occupies a structurally advantageous position in the net- work. In more formal terms, betweenness centrality measures the frequency with which an individual falls between other pairs of net- work actors on the shortest (geodesic) paths connecting them (Freeman, 1979).

Recent research demonstrated that high self-monitors were more likely to have greater network centrality than low self-monitors and that high self-monitoring and central network positions con- tributed independently to predicting individual work performance (Mehra et al., 2001). One means of gaining a position of central- ity in a network is to make lots of connections (create a large net- work); however, this is not a very efﬁcient strategy. Creating and maintaining network ties requires a substantial investment in terms of time and energy. High self-monitors, in their eagerness to please others and create good impressions, may tend to agree to be part of many project teams, thereby imperiling their overall work per-

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 213

formance. Low self-monitors may be better able to refuse tasks that are not directly connected with their own interests (Mehra et al., 2001). There are several network strategy variations that can help individuals more optimally use their connections.

# Structural Holes

It has been argued that there has been “no more important advance in the social network literature within the past decade” than Burt’s (1992) structural hole theory (Krackhardt, 1999, pp. 183–184). This theory develops the concept of betweenness centrality to a guiding principle for many different network situations. Ties that bridge to unconnected parts of the network may enable an actor to obtain unique information, negotiate better agreements, and generally be more powerful than an actor whose ties do not pro- vide such a bridging role. Burt refers to this bridge or separation between nonredundant contacts as a structural hole. An individ- ual who has two friends who themselves are not friends spans across a structural hole, brokering information and resources be- tween two people who may be indifferent or even hostile to each other.

According to the structural hole perspective, actors can lever- age their investments in social relations by establishing connections to a diverse set of actors (preferably actors unconnected to each other) rather than establishing all of their relationships with mem- bers of one cohesive group. The likelihood of gaining diverse in- formation and other valuable resources may, it is suggested, increase in direct proportion to the extent that an actor manages network connections to avoid redundancy and increase hetero- geneity. Research on the structural hole concept has suggested that individuals who span across structural holes tend to get faster pro- motions in corporations (Podolny & Baron, 1997); however, there is also evidence that spending time mediating between discon- nected individuals in an organization’s work ﬂow network can neg- atively affect performance appraisals (Mehra et al., 2001). Spending time trying to work with groups that have no need to coordinate may not be helpful to one’s career. Furthermore, businesspeople who spanned across the social network in a community of indepen- dent entrepreneurs tended to experience lower ﬁrm performance

# 214 PERSONALITY AND WORK

and survival (Oh, Kilduff, & Brass, 2002), suggesting that time spent mediating the conﬂicts of others may be better spent mind- ing one’s own store. The current enthusiasm for the structural hole concept must be balanced by an awareness of the opportunity costs inherent in mediating relationships across social divides.

# Tie Strength

Structural hole theory is an elaboration and extension of earlier in- ﬂuential work on strong and weak ties. As a reminder, a tie is any connection (relationship) between any two individuals in a social system. Ties can vary in terms of their relative strength, with strong ties indicating greater emotional intensity, frequency, importance, or reciprocity than weak ties (Granovetter, 1973). Another way to think about strong ties is as friendships, whereas weak ties are more like acquaintances (Brass & Krackhardt, 1999). Research has shown that high self-monitors tend to demonstrate lower overall commit- ment to their social and work relationships than low self-monitors (Day et al., 2002; Snyder, Gangestad, & Simpson, 1983; Snyder & Simpson, 1984). Thus, it would be expected that high self-monitors would be more willing than low self-monitors to break strong tie re- lationships, to suffer less from strong tie disruptions, and to be less embedded in networks of constraining strong tie groups such as Simmelian ties—those in which two people are reciprocally and strongly tied to each other, and each is reciprocally and strongly tied to a third party in common (Krackhardt, 1999; Krackhardt & Kilduff, in press).

A deﬁning feature of strong ties is that they tend to be charac- terized by trust and mutual reciprocation. Strong ties provide for more credible and timely information than weak ties and also pro- vide social and emotional support. Thus, an advantage of strong ties is that they build social capital in the form of loyalty, trust, mu- tual respect, and emotional attachment, which provide a solid foundation for social inﬂuence. Strong ties have also been shown to be advantageous in the transfer of complex knowledge across organization units (Hansen, 1999). A disadvantage of strong ties is that they require a good deal of emotional energy to maintain; they require considerable investment in terms of an individual’s commitment to the tie. Strong ties also may be difﬁcult to break

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 215

and prevent access to new opportunities (Brass, 2001). As a result, strong ties might impede ﬂexible and adaptive responses when an environment changes quickly. Recent research has shown, how- ever, that in a community of Korean immigrant entrepreneurs, high self-monitoring business owners (compared to their low self- monitoring colleagues) were more likely to span across structural holes within the community and were faster to reach outside the community to build bonds with important role players (such as bankers) in the host community (Oh et al., 2002). Strong bonds of family and ethnicity were therefore less likely to constrain high self-monitors (relative to low self-monitors) from pursuing network connections.

Weak ties were not considered to be of much importance until Granovetter’s classic work (1973) on the “strength of weak ties.” His original research question examined how people ﬁnd jobs, with the expectation that strong ties were likely to provide instrumental con- tacts that led to identifying viable job opportunities (Granovetter, 1974). In other words, close friends and family members would be most inﬂuential in providing successful job leads. Surprisingly, Grano- vetter found instead that it was the friends of friends (or friends of acquaintances) who tended to provide the most helpful job infor- mation. The most important people in providing information were not immediate friends and family but rather people in different oc- cupations from the contact who had passed along information ob- tained through others who might not have been immediate friends with the source. Speciﬁcally, the short (fewer than two intermedi- aries), weak links provided the most useful job information.

One reason for the strength of weak ties resides in the quality of information that is transferred. People who are closest to us and con- stitute strong ties have many overlapping contacts and thus share much of the same information. Information received from a strong tie is likely to be stale in that it was already received from someone else (Scott, 2000). Fresh, or nonredundant, information is there- fore most likely to come from distant parts of the network. Weak ties are advantageous in terms of bridging otherwise unconnected groups and providing new information and entrepreneurial op- portunities. A disadvantage is that there is a relatively weak moti- vation to maintain the tie or provide other kinds of resources such as loyalty or emotional support.

# 216 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Weak ties are not the same as structural holes. According to Burt (1992), the strength of the tie is not as important as whether the tie bridges unconnected parts of the network. Regardless of their strength, bridging ties are less constraining on an individual than nonbridging ties. The fewer constraints that are imposed on an individual, the greater are the potential network opportunities. In addition, bridging with strong (as compared with weak) ties is preferred whenever possible because it provides for more leverage or inﬂuence in a social system. This provides a potential advantage for low self-monitors, because they are thought to be more likely to develop strong ties than high self-monitors. Low self-monitors also tend to have more homogeneous networks (connections with sim- ilar others), which reduce the likelihood of bridging to dissimilar others that creates structural holes (Popielarz, 1999). Nonetheless, with their tendency to form strong bonds of solidarity with family, friends, and similar others, low self-monitors may have powerful re- sources available in times of crisis compared to high self-monitors.

# Negative Ties and Multiplexity

Before elaborating more on the relationship between self-monitoring personality and social networks, two additional types of ties need to be mentioned because of their relevance.

There is little in the published literature on negative ties (Labi- anca, Brass, & Gray, 1998, is a notable exception); nevertheless, this type of tie is worth considering because of the known role of neg- ative affect on individual cognition and behavior. Negative ties de- scribe relationships in which one person has a negative affective judgment of another in the network; thus, negative ties can be con- sidered to be at the opposite end of the affective continuum from strong and weak ties (Brass, 2001). These are aversive relationships such that one (or more) of the actors is motivated to avoid the other. Low self-monitors are likely to surround themselves with strong, positive relationships, whereas high self-monitors may ﬁnd themselves mediating between individuals who dislike each other. High self-monitors, relative to low self-monitors, are also likely to ﬁnd themselves dealing with negatively connected relations (see the review in Brass, 1992). These situations occur when two peo- ple are competing for the same relationship with a third person. The classic example of two people with a negatively connected

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 217

relation is that of two suitors for the same marriage partner: the success of one suitor spells the failure of the other. The focal indi- vidual in the middle of two negatively connected people has the (sometimes) difﬁcult task of choosing between them for a lunch date, a business contract, or some other competitive outcome. High self-monitors, with their tendency to bridge across uncon- nected groups, are more likely than low self-monitors to face the stress of competing demands for their time and other resources. Whereas the low-self-monitoring strategy is likely to focus on bring- ing people together, the high self-monitor may be forced to choose between favoring one party or the other.

The second additional type of tie to consider is the multiplex tie. This describes relationships in which actors are connected in more than one type of association. For example, someone might be a work associate, a neighbor, and a friend. Although proximity is likely to be a strong predictor of multiplexity (Brass, 2001), the partner-based orientation of low self-monitors is also likely to con- tribute to multiplex ties being created. Low self-monitors tend to afﬁliate with others who are similar to them, regardless of the so- cial context, and they may prefer to form multiple relations with the same people rather than seek out specialist partners for dif- ferent activities.

# Social Capital of Network Conﬁgurations

Social capital refers to relational resources embedded in the ties between individuals (Coleman, 1988; Nahapiet & Ghoshal, 1998), which research has shown to enhance value creation in organiza- tions (Tsai & Ghoshal, 1998). Furthermore, different types of net- work connections are associated with different forms of social capital. Attempting to manage too many ties can consume valuable resources (time) and can also have dysfunctional effects if the ex- pectations of others are not met. This is a particular risk with hav- ing too many strong ties (Brass & Krackhardt, 1999), because a strong tie requires a greater mutual commitment than a weak tie. The most appropriate network strategy is therefore likely to be con- tingent on the surrounding network structure of possible connec- tions. Prescriptive advice on how to develop an optimal network with regard to the networks of others in a social system has been largely overlooked in the literature (Carley, 1999). The question

# 218 PERSONALITY AND WORK

of whether there are advantages and disadvantages of high self- monitors connecting with other highs, low self-monitors with other lows, or highs and lows connecting is worth considering.

# High Self-Monitor to High Self-Monitor

In general, the research literature has supported the superiority of high self-monitors over low self-monitors in obtaining desirable or- ganizational rewards such as more promotions (Kilduff & Day, 1994), better performance ratings (Day et al., 2002), and more ad- vantageous positions in social networks (Mehra et al., 2001). Thus, it would appear that connections between high self-monitors would lead to the most structurally advantageous network conﬁgurations. These types of conﬁgurations would tend to provide connections between central network actors and therefore be the source of novel, divergent, and nonredundant information (Brass & Krack- hardt, 1999); however, the connections that are formed would tend to be low-commitment ties. This would be a natural function of the overall lower commitment of high self-monitors to their social (Snyder & Simpson, 1984) and work (Day et al., 2002) relation- ships. Whereas low-commitment ties might be adequate for ac- cessing a wider variety of informational resources, they may be less likely to yield high trust or commitment. In addition, the physical and mental well-being effects that are associated with social rela- tionships (see Reis et al., 2000, for a review) are likely to be atten- uated if the nature of the relationship is one of low commitment. High self-monitors tend to be in the minority in most social set- tings, forming only about 40 percent of the overall population (Gang- estad & Snyder, 1985; Kilduff, 1992). Given their motivation to seek the limelight (status enhancement), high self-monitors may be rel- atively scarce in many organizational settings involving production and back-room tasks and relatively overrepresented in settings in- volving boundary-spanning activities (compare Caldwell & O’Reilly, 1982) and upper-echelon work (Day et al., 2002; Kilduff & Day, 1994). Thus, the chances of ﬁnding network connections between high self-monitors is likely to be a function of the particular orga- nizational setting and the proportions of high self-monitors in that setting. However, high self-monitors, relative to low self-monitors, are likely to reach across spatial and geographical boundaries in

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 219

search of speciﬁc friendship opportunities (Snyder et al., 1983). Therefore, it may be important in organizational settings to con- sider the possibility that the network relations of high self-monitors may spill outside the departmental or organizational boundaries that may enclose low self-monitors.

# Low Self-Monitor to Low Self-Monitor

In contrast to the status enhancement motives of high self-monitors, low self-monitors are motivated primarily by the desire to build close social relationships of mutual trust (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000). This type of strong tie also builds loyalty, respect, and emo- tional commitments, which are requisite commodities for effective leadership development (Day, 2000). Strong ties also may serve as a source of resilience in crisis situations (Krackhardt & Stern, 1988). It is not that low self-monitors are completely unconcerned with impression management or public opinion. They may be acutely concerned with holding reputations as genuine and sin- cere people who act on their beliefs (Gangestad & Snyder, 2000). Nonetheless, the generally lower levels of ability to manage im- pressions effectively may result in a misperception of the behavior and motives of low self-monitors (Turnley & Bolino, 2001).

When low self-monitors build ties with others of a similar dispo- sition, there are potential risks in addition to the advantages associ- ated with enhanced trust and commitment. One disadvantage has to do with informational resources. Because of their relatively ho- mogeneous social worlds (Mehra et al., 2001), low self-monitors will have more difﬁculty obtaining fresh, nonredundant information from their networks. A second disadvantage is that low self-monitors are more constrained by their social ties because these ties are more difﬁcult to break, which may prevent access to new opportunities (Brass, 2001; Oh et al., 2002). This could pose a serious disadvan- tage in rapidly changing environments that require forming and re- forming new networks in adapting to emergent challenges.

# High Self-Monitor to Low Self-Monitor

There may be unique advantages for both high and low self-monitors who afﬁliate. High self-monitors who build network connections

# 220 PERSONALITY AND WORK

with low self-monitors may be able to beneﬁt from resources that are more likely to be found in the relationships between low self- monitors. High self-monitors tend to look to others for cues as to the attitudes and behaviors that are normatively appropriate. Low self-monitors, by contrast, look within themselves for the attitudes and behaviors that express their true selves. High self-monitors therefore are more likely to be inﬂuenced by others in their atti- tudes and behaviors than are low self-monitors (Kilduff, 1992). The high self-monitors may gain from low self-monitors’ infor- mation concerning the range of opinions and behaviors that are possible in a particular social situation. Low self-monitors may look to the high self-monitors for help in negotiating across boundaries between individuals or groups holding divergent views. Considerable research shows that high self-monitors tend to emerge as leaders in leaderless groups (Zaccaro, Foti, & Kenny, 1991) and tend to resolve conﬂicts through collaboration and compromise (Baron, 1989). Low self-monitors may be able to in- ﬂuence many more people outside their own tightly knit groups by ﬁrst inﬂuencing a high self-monitor who is in a boundary- spanning position. Conversely, a low self-monitor would beneﬁt from the nonredundant information that a high self-monitor would likely bring to the network.

A risk in connecting a high and a low self-monitor is that a po- tential negative tie (that is, a relationship in which one person has a negative affective judgment of another person; Brass, 2001) will form. A risk to high self-monitors is that they will come across as disingenuous because of potential inconsistencies in their opin- ions and behavior. Appearing disingenuous or insincere is likely to be objectionable to low self-monitors and may contribute to a lack of respect. Low self-monitors may appear dogmatic and inﬂexible to high self-monitors. High self-monitors who value meeting oth- ers’ expectations and ﬁtting in with prevailing social norms may end up disliking low self-monitors, who tend to express deeply held opinions even when they are not normatively appropriate. Nonetheless, there are reasons that network ties between high and low self-monitors may be advantageous to both parties. Unfortu- nately, there are structural (in addition to the psychological) con- straints that discourage this type of connection.

## Homophily and Constraints on Heterogeneous Network Ties

There is a well-established tendency for individuals to associate with others who are similar to them in one or more ways, which sociol- ogists term homophily (Lazarsfeld & Merton, 1954). For this reason, ties between dissimilar people are less likely than ties between those who are similar. Support, information, access, and inﬂuence are therefore most likely to be from people who are similar to an actor. This is not always a desirable outcome because of the likelihood of receiving redundant information from similar others (Scott, 2000). A more desirable network conﬁguration would include a portfolio of ties to dissimilar others, which are likely to provide access to dif- ferent resources and information than completely homophilous ties. Recently, organizational constraints on network formation have been considered, especially constraints on heterophily, or ties be- tween people who are dissimilar (Popielarz, 1999). This literature might help to provide insight on and motivation to address orga- nizational constraints on network heterophily.

The principal structural constraint on heterophily is organiza- tional homogeneity (Popielarz, 1999). The more homogeneous the organization is, the greater is the likelihood of homophilous ties. This is because organizations provide the contact opportunities nec- essary to make connections with others. Whereas most of the re- search and theory associated with network homophily has been directed at demographic characteristics such as race and sex, there is reason to suspect that organizations also pose an inadvertent con- straint in terms of personality. Such constraints on personality-based heterophily can have deleterious effects for individuals and organi- zations. Speciﬁcally, research evidence suggests that organizations are relatively homogeneous in terms of the personality attributes of their managers, and personalities become more homogeneous as one advances to higher management levels.

# Homogeneity Within Organizations

A fundamental tenet of the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model of organizational behavior is that people self-select into and

# 222 PERSONALITY AND WORK

out of organizations. Furthermore, a key factor inﬂuencing a per- son’s decision to join and remain with an organization is the ﬁt be- tween his or her personality and the modal personality of the organization (Schneider, 1987; Schneider, Goldstein, & Smith, 1995). A test of this basic ASA principle using a sample of approx- imately thirteen thousand managers from 142 companies across a broad sampling of U.S. industries revealed the hypothesized ASA effect for organizational membership on the personality charac- teristics of managers (Schneider, Smith, Taylor, & Fleenor, 1998). An implication of this ﬁnding is that organizational members have contact with others who are more like themselves in terms of their personality attributes than in the society at large. Organizational constraints that tend to perpetuate homophily are the result of the dispositionally driven choices people make with regard to which organizations to join and remain with.

# Homogeneity in Upper Levels

A question of great interest to researchers as well as laypeople is why certain people win out in workplace contests. Clearly, ability and merit should be important factors; however, individual per- sonality has also been shown to shape the fates of organizational contestants. Research has demonstrated that high self-monitors have superior job performance to low self-monitors (Mehra et al., 2001), especially when performance is measured through super- visory ratings (Day et al., 2002), and receive more promotions early in their career (Kilduff & Day, 1994). Extending such ﬁndings across organizational hierarchies suggests that high self-monitors should be overrepresented in middle- and upper-management po- sitions. Because progression into middle management has been ar- gued to be mainly a function of likeability and perceived ability to work with senior management (Hogan, Curphy, & Hogan, 1994), high self-monitors may have a competitive advantage in promo- tional tournaments. As a result, they may be disproportionately rep- resented in the upper echelons of organizations.

This conclusion corresponds with ﬁndings from a large insur- ance company in which employees with higher-level jobs (manage- ment) were typically high self-monitors and those with lower-level

## SELF-MONITORING PERSONALITY AND WORK RELATIONSHIPS 223

jobs (clerical, technical, and support staff) tended to be low self- monitors (Sypher & Sypher, 1983). This overrepresentation of high self-monitors in management positions may occur because of the pragmatic facility with which high self-monitors are able to adjust their attitudes and behaviors to the prevailing norms and cultures of speciﬁc organizations and positions. Whereas low self-monitors may prefer to stay in organizations or positions that allow them to express their true selves, high self-monitors may seek out new op- portunities to demonstrate their skills and abilities in impression management, conﬂict mediation, and boundary spanning. Whereas the low self-monitors deﬁne themselves by their inner beliefs and values, the high self-monitors deﬁne themselves by the prestigious roles they play in well-deﬁned social situations. The ASA model therefore may apply more to low self-monitors than to high self- monitors as far as ﬁt between individual and organizational values is concerned. High self-monitors are likely to be more concerned with ﬁt between their desire for well-deﬁned and prestigious posi- tions and the organizational availability of such opportunities. Whereas low self-monitors are likely to be constrained by ho- mophily pressures, high self-monitors are likely to pursue het- erophilous connections.

To the extent that hierarchical position signals status in a par- ticular organization, we might expect to ﬁnd high self-monitors, relative to low self-monitors, seeking out those of higher formal position as friends. However, status in organizations is likely to be deﬁned both informally and formally. Ever since the Hawthorne studies, organizational researchers have been aware of the emer- gence of informal leaders who lack ofﬁcial recognition but wield inﬂuence among the workforce. High self-monitors, with their keenly adjusted social skills, are more likely than low self-monitors to detect the actual distribution of status in the organization and to cluster around the rising stars. In addition, high self-monitors (relative to lows) are likely to be better at winning the attention of high-status others through ingratiation behaviors, broadcasting their ties to high-status others through judicious name drop- ping (that is, basking in reﬂected glory), and using their contacts with high-status others for career advancement within and across companies.

# Conclusion

The personality compositions of teams and the differences in re- lationship content and context for different personality types are relatively unexplored topics. Despite the so-called greening of re- lationship science across many ﬁelds in psychology (Berscheid, 1999), there is a tendency to neglect the broader environments of relationships. If a goal of relationship scholars is to seek laws gov- erning individuals’ interactions with each other, we must consider dispositional as well as the structural inﬂuences in surrounding en- vironments. Just as recent research has led to the acknowledgment that romantic relationships do not exist in a vacuum (Agnew et al., 2001), a similar understanding is needed regarding work rela- tionships. Because of the fundamental importance of relationships in the social capital of individuals and organizations, this is an issue of critical importance to researchers and practitioners interested in work-related behavior.

A primary goal of this chapter was to build theoretically on pre- vious work, demonstrating that dispositional differences inﬂuence the structural advantage that some individuals have in organiza- tions through choices that shape their interpersonal environments. Another purpose was to expound on the reasons that a considera- tion of network conﬁgurations is important. One’s structural po- sition in a network is of interest, but previous work has tended to overlook the dispositional motives of others with whom network connections are sought. By widening the lens to consider the self- monitoring orientation of both members of a network dyad, we hope that a better understanding is gained of some of the chal- lenges associated with building networks that enhance the social capital of individuals and organizations.

Understanding the Dynamic Learner Linking Personality Traits, Learning Situations, and Individual Behavior J. Kevin Ford Frederick L. Oswald

Under whatever disciplinary ﬂag, . . . someone will always ask how individuals are different from each other, how behavior changes, how people perceive, think, and plan, and how people experience reality, and even what might be going on in the regions of the mind usually hidden from view [Funder, 2001, p. 216].

The term dynamic learner conjures up images of an active, contin- uously productive person who develops over time in knowledge, skill, and motivation with the goal of accomplishing some set of de- sired learning outcomes. Learners and those who design new learning environments in organizations may be energized about and dedicated to the concept of the dynamic learner (and its as- sociated buzzwords), yet it is important to understand the realistic boundaries for the individual learning process, as well as for learn- ing environments that can be created. There exists a continuum in that no learner is completely adaptable to whatever learning sit- uation presents itself, nor can a particular learning situation be well suited to all learners. To understand the middle ground on

229

# 230 PERSONALITY AND WORK

this continuum is to understand the learning process more fully. We must examine both the constancy and stability residing in the individual, as well as the dynamic qualities that arise from the process of the individual learner in interacting with the learning situation.

Two trends emphasize a need to understand the dynamic learning process better. The ﬁrst is in self-managed learning, where potentially the learner has ﬂexibility in choosing how, when, or even whether to explore different learning environments and var- ious aspects within them (Brown & Ford, 2002; Warr & Bunce, 1995). The second trend is in computer-adapted learning, where there can be great latitude in tailoring the learning environment based on a learner’s characteristics and responses while learning. These two trends, taken together, imply a much larger role for the personality of the learner to inﬂuence the learning situation, be- cause much of personality relates to motivational characteristics: the direction, frequency, and intensity with which learning activi- ties are carried out. This chapter presents a synthesis of the re- search literature and our thoughts on how personality traits relate to the processes and outcomes of learning and what the implica- tions are for designing better learning environments.

The ideas we present are somewhat speculative in nature be- cause the research literature combining personality with learning processes and outcomes is rather sparse. In personnel selection, Hough and Schneider (1996) note that the role of personality has been “phoenixlike,” historically held in disrepute but currently quite well established. By contrast, Mount and Barrick (1998) point out that when it comes to learning in organizations, “there remains a relative void in the literature regarding the relationship between personality dimensions and training outcomes” (p. 852). Although the amount of research conducted on personality and learning is small compared to the work on personnel selection, it is building toward a critical mass and deserves review. This research gap should be addressed because in the light of various training environments and training design considerations, it is theoretically and practi- cally useful to examine which broad personality dispositions or traits may be more effective in predicting individuals’ standing on key criterion constructs related to learning processes, such as mo- tivation to learn, attentional focus and self-regulation (Ford &

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 231

Kraiger, 1995), and learning outcomes such as knowledge and skill acquisition and training transfer (Kraiger, Ford, & Salas, 1993).

Approaches to studying personality effects applied to training or learning contexts have already led to some advances in our un- derstanding of individual differences, learning processes, and learning outcomes. The recent push toward self-directed learning and blended instruction, integrating traditional and more self- directed learning activities (Bassi & Van Buren, 1999), will increase our need to understand how personality inﬂuences the choices that individuals make. Such decisions include how much effort to place into the program, how much and what type of training con- tent to focus on, and how many practice exercises to complete in the training in which they decide to pursue and engage.

It is clear that the intent and goals of effective learning expe- riences such as those in training are to change how learners per- ceive, think, plan, and behave. What is not as clear is the context in which these changes occur: for whom, how, and when.

## Personality and Research on Learning in the Workplace

Traditionally, personality theory has been dominated by three mod- els that span the person-based and situation-based continuum: the trait model, the interactionism model, and the situational model (see Endler & Magnusson, 1976). The trait model views individuals as varying on a number of stable dimensions within the person. Traits are seen as the prime determinants of behavior: they predict important behaviors over time and across a variety of types of situ- ations. At the other extreme, the situational model focuses on the stimuli in the situation as major determinants of behavior. Differ- ences in situations are seen as producing differences in behavior within an individual as well as across individuals. The interactionism model takes a middle ground between the trait and situational model, stressing that behavior is a function of the continuous in- teraction between the person and the situation. Individuals are not passive to situations but can actively choose which situations to per- form in; conversely, situations can have different effects on differ- ent types of individuals. In outlining these three models, Endler and Magnusson made clear that no one is advocating entirely

# 232 PERSONALITY AND WORK

extreme roles of traits or situations; either extreme is too deter- ministic. Instead, researchers must adopt a stance or “useful ﬁction” that rests somewhere along this continuum, making choices about the relative importance to place on person- and situation-based fac- tors given the phenomena under study and the theoretical motiva- tions and practical implications of the research approach.

Examining research on training and learning shows that each of these three traditional approaches to personality is represented. These approaches to training research are clearly interrelated, yet can be meaningfully reviewed from each of these different perspectives.

# Traits and Learning

The research on traits and learning has focused on issues of the readiness of the trainee to take advantage of the learning experi- ences, as well as the inﬂuence of basic personality characteristics on knowledge and skill acquisition. Research has also focused on the inﬂuence of situational and person characteristics on learning processes and outcomes.

# Trainee Readiness

In the past forty years of research on training, the primary indi- vidual differences of interest have fallen under the broad factors of intelligence and experience. These two factors are directly re- lated to issues of trainee readiness, that is, whether individuals have the aptitude (Duke & Ree, 1996; Ree, Carretta, & Teachout, 1995) or background experiences necessary to be successful in the train- ing program. For example, Robertson and Downs (1989) report on twenty years of research that found it is possible to predict train- ing success across a large number of jobs (for example, carpentry, welding, and forklift operation) by having individuals learn about and perform a sample of the tasks to be learned in training.

More relevant to our chapter, trainee readiness does not in- clude just ability and skill components. For example, Tubiana and Ben-Shakhar (1982) found that a host of personality and motiva- tional factors contributed to trainee readiness. Sociability, active- ness, responsibility, independence, promptness, and motivation to serve in a combat unit added to the prediction of training success over and above success predicted by intelligence, education, and language scores.

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 233

Personality Training research focusing on personality has sought to under- stand the stable individual differences that have an impact on mo- tivation to learn and subsequent knowledge and skill acquisition (Noe, 1986). A number of researchers have provided evidence sup- porting a positive relationship between trainee motivation to learn and scores on learning measures (Mathieu, Tannenbaum, & Salas, 1992; Noe & Schmitt, 1986). Such research has also found that fac- tors such as demographics (age, education), work-related attitudes (job involvement, career planning, organizational commitment), and personality or trait factors (locus of control, anxiety, goal ori- entation) have an impact on learning processes and outcomes (see the review by Mathieu & Martineau, 1997).

A recent meta-analytic integrative review by Colquitt, LePine, and Noe (2000) linked trainee characteristics to motivation to learn and learning measures. These researchers accumulated evidence across results from over one hundred studies, revealing a number of important relationships. Regarding personality traits, the meta- analysis contained enough data from individual studies to report on three traits from the Big Five: locus of control, trait anxiety, and con- scientiousness. Results showed a strong relationship between locus of control and motivation to learn: those with an internal locus of control showed higher motivation levels on average than those with an external locus of control. In addition, trainee trait anxiety was related to motivation, with highly anxious trainees tending to be less motivated to learn and less self-efﬁcacious. An individual’s level of conscientiousness was indirectly related to the motivation to learn through its effect on pretraining self-efﬁcacy. Motivation to learn was positively related to knowledge and skill acquisition, reactions of the trainees to the training program, and transfer of training indexes.

These meta-analytic ﬁndings support the notion that personal- ity traits such as conscientiousness can affect learning outcomes through their inﬂuence on motivation to learn. Yet it is clear from the limited information that the meta-analysis could gather across studies that more research is needed. Only a small subset of the per- sonality domain has been incorporated into training studies. Colquitt et al. (2000) note that traits such as cognitive playfulness, positive and negative affectivity, need for dominance, and compet- itiveness have been examined in only one or two studies. Also, the meta-analysis could not examine aptitude-treatment interaction

# 234 PERSONALITY AND WORK

(ATI) effects. There are too few studies on ATI effects in the train- ing literature and an absence of a taxonomy of learning situations on which to build a cumulative review.

# Situations and Creating Learning States

Despite this lack of a taxonomy, the meta-analytic results of Colquitt et al. (2000) did show that measures of other situational characteristics, such as level of supervisory support, peer support, and a positive work climate, were positively related to measures of individual motivation to learn, learning, and training transfer. The assumption behind this correlational research is that climate fac- tors such as support create a stronger situational press than less supportive supervisors and that this support tends to lead to more effective training and work behaviors. Correlational research can- not rule out the converse explanation: those who more effectively apply trained skills to the job tend to experience or perceive greater supervisory and peer support.

Two sets of studies speak to strategies for enhancing learning states and creating “strong situations” that minimize the effects of individual differences on learning outcomes. One set of studies has focused on employee choice. Baldwin, Magjuka, and Loher (1991) found that giving individuals a choice about what training to at- tend can create a positive learning state—if individuals obtain their ﬁrst choice, that is. Similarly, Hicks and Klimoski (1987) found that trainees given a choice of attending a training program tended to report higher levels of motivation, were more positive about the program, and received higher test scores during training than those not given a choice. These studies on individual choice and outcomes of choice indicate that justice perceptions may bear im- portant relationships with the structure of the training environ- ment, and much recent research in personnel selection on justice may have some bearing on this (compare Bauer, Maertz, Dolan, & Campion, 1998; Ryan & Ployhart, 2000).

A second set of experimental studies has focused on positively framing the training situation for the trainee. Martocchio (1992) attempted to create a learning state by framing microcomputer training as an opportunity for career advancement rather than as a punishment for past mistakes. He found that the career opportu-

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 235

nity frame of reference generally led to higher self-efﬁcacy going into the program and ultimately to better learning. Quiñones (1995) examined different effects of framing training program assign- ments on learning outcomes. Assignments to a training program were described as remedial or advanced. Results indicated that the framing had an impact on attributions for past performance as well as fairness perceptions, motivation to learn, and learning out- comes. Quiñones notes that context really does matter and advo- cates designing interventions focusing on contextual factors that increase motivation to learn across participants rather than neces- sarily tailoring motivational interventions to individual trainees. Very few studies have investigated the effects of various types of strong situational presses prior to or during the training experi- ence itself.

# Person-by-Situation Effects

In a review of the training ﬁeld over thirty years ago, Campbell (1971) noted that one area of promise was the focus on person-by- situation effects, which take both individual differences and learn- ing situations into account. In particular, he directed attention to the problem of how to adapt the instructional process to individ- ual differences as an alternative to research examining trait effects on learning outcomes directly, without examining the training con- tent and process. Campbell’s approach is quite sensible because traits are more proximal to learning behaviors and the learning process that instruction entails, and they are more distal from the outcomes that the learning situation demands of the individual.

According to Cronbach (1957, 1967), individual differences and learning can relate to one another by tailoring a set of instructional goals, methods, and materials to the individual or to homogeneous groups of individuals. Typically, this sort of research has sought to investigate the effects of matching alternative modes of instruction to different characteristics of the individual so that each person uses the most appropriate learning procedure. In this context, aptitude is deﬁned as any stable characteristic that resides within the individ- ual, interacts with learning situations, and correlates with learning outcomes. Deﬁned in this way, aptitudes are broad in scope and in- clude cognitive, motivational, and affective factors such as cognitive

# 236 PERSONALITY AND WORK

abilities (the g factors and its components), prior knowledge and ex- perience (physics knowledge), personality variables (trait anxiety), and motivational factors (achievement motivation).

In the educational literature, several major aptitudes have been pointed out that relate to the learning environment in schools. Re- garding cognitive ability, high-ability students tend to do better in low-structure environments (discovery learning), and low-ability students tend to perform better in high-structured learning envi- ronments (Snow, 1990; Swanson, O’Connor, & Cooney, 1990). Re- garding personality constructs, students low in anxiety tend to perform better with heuristic instruction (low structure) than with algorithmic instruction (high structure). Personality also has been found to relate to the educational learning environment: ex- traverted and moderately anxious students seem to beneﬁt most in cooperative (versus competitive) learning situations (Hall, Dan- sereau, & Skaggs, 1990). In settings more related to work training, Savage, Williges, and Williges (1982) used motor and information- processing tests to develop empirical prediction models for assign- ing students to one of two training conditions based on predicted training time for each type of training. Making training assign- ments based on these individual differences resulted in a 47 per- cent savings in training time compared to random assignment and a 53 percent savings compared to a mismatched assignment.

As Campbell and Kuncel (2002) recently noted, all core train- ing issues are framed by the ATI parameters and the criterion of in- terest. Identifying the parameters and capitalizing on them by modifying the training environment requires a ﬁrm understanding of types of contexts in which the learner might be placed. Unfor- tunately, as we previously lamented, we have limited understanding of the effects of varieties of learning and learning environments, but the literature we have reviewed thus far has pointed to several broad and consistent themes on both the individual and situational sides of the equation.

## Beyond Broad Traits: Linking the Person, Situation, and Behavior

Traditional research on workplace learning has taken a fairly lim- ited approach to understanding personality and its effects on learn-

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 237

ing outcomes. More speciﬁcally, trait and outcome measures have tended to reﬂect stability in the person and situation, respectively. Increasingly, however, learners are becoming active participants in their own learning process, which leads to a more serious need to expand research in understanding learning situations and person- learning situation interactions. Recent research in personality psy- chology has offered some insights and methodologies relevant to this type of learning research.

In his review of personality research, Funder (2001) notes that the goal of personality theory has to be focused on increasing our un- derstanding of the interconnections among person, situation, and behavior. In particular, knowing about a person and his or her sit- uation should allow for predicting what he or she will do in that situation—or that understanding the person and knowing the be- havior exhibited should then tell us something about the situation the person is in. New perspectives have sought to locate the per- son within context, examine traits and behavioral variation, and understand the link between traits and psychological states and processes. These new perspectives have much to offer to research- ers interested in expanding the domain of research on personal- ity, learning processes, and learning outcomes.

In personality research, much effort in the 1980s and 1990s was focused on developing a consistent and coherent set of personality constructs for organizational research, particularly in personnel se- lection. As Hough and Schneider noted (1996), the development of personality and performance taxonomies has proven useful in ﬁnding clearer relationships between personality traits and im- portant criterion elements that had been previously obscured. As- sessment tools to operationalize these constructs have been well developed (for example, see Ozer & Reise, 1994), and the average or traited response of a person has been found to be useful in pre- dicting or explaining both training outcomes and job performance (Barrick & Mount, 1991).

Although traits are important in reﬂecting an individual’s con- sistent or typical behavior across situations, recent research efforts have begun to expand our understanding of personality as a more dynamic characteristic of a person. Similarly, there has been greater recognition that situations may contain different relevant psychological characteristics for different individuals.

# 238 PERSONALITY AND WORK

# Personality Traits in Context

Relevant to the previous point, Mischel and his colleagues have launched a long-term research program focusing on why disposi- tions lead to behavioral regularities (Mischel & Shoda, 1998; Mis- chel, Shoda, & Mendoza-Denton, 2002). They contend that research needs to analyze traits in a way that allows for understanding how individuals interact with situations to produce stable situation- behavior patterns (see Murtha, Kanfer, & Ackerman, 1996). This new perspective leads to reﬁning what is meant by a person-by- situation interaction, what is considered stability, and what is con- sidered a change in dispositions or the dynamic individual processes that underlie interactions between persons and situations. As Mis- chel and Shoda (1998) note, “This view is that the personality sys- tem is active and indeed proactive, not just reactive—a system that anticipates, inﬂuences, rearranges, and changes situations as well as reacts to them. Thus the personality system and the behavior it generates selects, modiﬁes, and shapes the environment in recip- rocal transactions” (p. 239).

This perspective highlights that clearly explicating cause-and- effect relationships demands taking a more dynamic interactive ap- proach. Mischel and Shoda (1998) promote an approach that focuses on how an individual’s stable personality can be expressed as a pattern of both consistency and variation in the ﬂow of a per- son’s behavior. These researchers have data supporting recurrent patterns of behavior that can be high for a trait in some situations and low in other situations. As an example in organizations, an em- ployee may display agreeableness when being teased by a supervi- sor but aggressiveness when being teased by a peer. Mischel and Shoda would call an individual’s pattern of trait-situation interac- tions such as this one a behavioral signature.

In addition, Shoda (1999) notes that situations can be thought of as similar to or different from one another along two dimen- sions that are similar to what have been discussed in the training literature: the physical ﬁdelity of the situation (school setting ver- sus home setting) or the psychological ﬁdelity of the situation. Shoda notes that the underlying “psychologically active ingredi- ents” may be consistent across situations in some respects but not others. For instance, a particular school environment and work en-

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 239

vironment may be similar in evoking individuals’ achievement mo- tivation but different in evoking extraversion. This suggests that learners may seek out the psychological ﬁdelity in a learning situ- ation to help them determine how to react or behave. The learner can then draw from experience in similar situations that evoke the same feelings of psychological ﬁdelity. This notion is yet another reason for further research on taxonomies of situational charac- teristics and their psychological underpinnings (see Hattrup & Jackson, 1996).

Taking a dynamic, active learning perspective on individuals and situations captures the reality of the learning context better. An active learning perspective requires considering how people with a certain level of personality characteristic respond to particular learn- ing situations, as well as adapt to changing learning situations. Fig- ure 9.1 provides three graphs for the frequency of a particular type of behavior exhibited by learners for three different learning situ- ations, given differences in a personality characteristic p across learners. Let us say that the behavior is feedback-seeking behavior, the personality characteristic is conscientiousness, and the three situations are such that S1 represents one-one-one training, S2 rep- resents group training, and S3 represents computer-based train- ing. The ﬁgure illustrates that learners with a particular level of conscientiousness show differences in the frequency of feedback seeking depending on the learning situation. The vertical arrow

represents individuals with the same level of conscientiousness, yet the amount of feedback seeking across the three different situa- tions varies for these types of individuals, with more feedback seek- ing in group settings than in one-on-one or computer-based training. What is important to note is that each of the three graphs in Figure 9.1, if taken separately, depicts a typical individual- differences approach to training research (whether the level of conscientiousness predicts a learning behavior or outcome in a particular situation), but across graphs, one sees conceptually the inﬂuence of different situations and the more complex interac- tions of the person, the situation, and learning.

## Personality Traits and Behavioral Variability

Another line of research has focused on personality as density dis- tributions. Fleeson (2001), like Mischel and his colleagues, con- tends that individuals actively react to situations and that the same individual will behave differently across these different situational contexts over time. Consequently, the individual’s behavior can be conceived of as forming a distribution that can be partially ex- plained by personality constructs. More speciﬁcally, he contends that within-person variability is actually predictable as an individ- ual difference in reactions across different types of situations.

In a recent study, Fleeson (2001) examined within-person vari- ability and stability of the Big Five personality relevant behavior. He conducted three experience-sampling studies in which undergrad- uate students described how they were acting and feeling at ﬁve scheduled times per day for about three weeks. Results supported the notion that there is high within-person variability: individuals self-reported a wide range of levels of personality characteristics across situations. At the same time, their average or central ten- dencies were highly stable over time. He also showed that the amount of variability in the distribution of behavior (skew and kur- tosis) is a stable individual-difference construct. For example, he found that the amount of within-person variability in the Big Five personality construct of Extraversion reﬂected individual differences in a person’s reactions to situational contexts high on extraversion- relevant cues (time of day and number of others present). Some Big Five dimensions showed more variability across situations, such as Extraversion, more than others, such as Conscientiousness.

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 241

This type of personality research highlights a process approach that links traits with behaviors that express the trait. The behav- ioral manifestations may reﬂect a temporary state that the person is in relevant to the typical modal trait like behavior one would ex- pect. Consequently, while there is stability in personality, behaviors can be thought of as trait-relevant states that are short term, con- tinuous, and concrete ways of acting, feeling, and thinking at a par- ticular time and place. The goal in a learning context, then, is to maintain states within individuals that lead to expressing learning- relevant behavior. In transferring the training knowledge to the workplace, maintaining these states outside the learning situation may be just as important as providing the opportunities and in- centives to express the behaviors learned.

As applied to learning, Figure 9.2 illustrates variability with each of the three graphs showing how particular learners tend to vary in the frequency of a particular learning behavior across sit- uations that vary in their personality-related content. Here we have three learners (L1, L2, and L3), and in this case the abscissa represents a continuum of a particular situational characteristic s within a learning situation or parts thereof (amount of structure, amount of priming for an internal or external locus of control). Each learner shows different frequencies of a particular type of learning behavior, where situations with the highest frequen- cies of behavior have the most situational press for that particular individual.

Taken together, Figures 9.1 and 9.2 illustrate a generalizabil- ity theory approach toward partitioning measured behaviors into different sources of variance; the graphs would be more of an exploratory supplement to generalizability theory statistics. Even a conceptual understanding that situations may vary in their personality-relevant characteristics—even when those character- istics cannot be empirically measured—implies that data should be collected on individuals across different learning situations if it is important for “the situation” to be understood as a potentially important source of variance with potential main effects and in- teractive effects on learning outcomes. Furthermore, this would be an empirical policy-capturing approach to creating classes of situ- ations with similar features.

## Personality Traits and Psychological States

Another line of research has focused on the differences and in- terrelatedness of traits and states. This research makes little dis- tinction between personality and motivation; both are seen as inﬂuencing the direction, frequency, and intensity of behaviors. In addition, personality and motivation can be considered at the traits and state levels that inﬂuence behaviors through proximal and dis- tal mechanisms (Kanfer, 1992). Individuals can have multiple traits that interact within particular settings to create various individual differences in states that have complex effects on thought, emo- tions, and actions (see Snow, 1990).

One example of this approach has been the work of Kanfer and her colleagues (Kanfer, 1990; Kanfer, Ackerman, & Heggestad, 1996; Kanfer & Heggestad, 1997) on a person-centered framework for the study of work motivation, achievement, and performance. The person-centered approach is based on the principle of the continuous and reciprocal inﬂuence of person characteristics and situational factors. These investigators note that to take such an in- teractionist perspective requires a clear conceptualization of the relevant person characteristics that affect work motivation pro- cesses. They identiﬁed two key motivationally relevant traits of achievement and anxiety. To understand the motivational pro- cesses, they employ a self-regulatory perspective to understanding the interrelationships of individual differences in motivational

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 243

traits and subsequent psychological states. More speciﬁcally, Kan- fer and Heggestad (1997) contend that self-regulatory processes are affected by cognitive, motivational, and affective states of the person that are linked in complex ways back to more stable indi- vidual differences in personality and motivational traits.

From a cognitive perspective, research has focused on meta- cognition—the planning, monitoring, and evaluating of one’s own thought processes. Research has shown that individuals who are more aware of their cognitive processes (what strategies they are using, how they are allocating their attention, how well they are suc- ceeding on a task, what they need to do to correct ineffective strate- gies) and are more effective at monitoring and evaluating their strategies concurrently with performing complex tasks are more likely to be successful (Ford, Smith, Weissbein, Gully, & Salas, 1998; Pintrich & DeGroot, 1990; Volet, 1991). From an affective perspec- tive, researchers have highlighted the need to understand actions that individuals take that allow for emotional control. Emotional control is viewed as central to minimizing anxiety, fear of failure, and other distractions so as to maintain concentration on a task (Kanfer & Heggestad, 1997). Research has shown that interventions to re- duce anxiety and fear of failure lead to more effective learning (compare Barrios & Shigetomi, 1979; Kanfer et al., 1996). Individu- als with good motivation-control skills are viewed as having high levels of mastery orientation as well as desiring high levels of achieve- ment. Research shows that individuals with high levels of moti- vational control are better at self-generating goals and ﬁnding ways to challenge themselves to improve their performance even if the task does not demand it (Dweck & Leggett, 1988).

The implication for these emerging research directions is clear. Prediction-type questions relating personality traits to learning out- comes are not enough. We agree with Ozer and Reise (1994) that a model of traits without understanding process reﬂects only a mea- ger portion of the psychology of learning. We now have conceptual frameworks that have begun to better link more stable and un- derlying characteristics like motivation to approach and avoid sit- uations to process questions such as what cognitive, behavioral, and affective type responses are changing as an individual experiences a learning event (state mastery goal orientation) and how these re- sponses can be modiﬁed or changed. We need additional training

# 244 PERSONALITY AND WORK

research to understand how cognitive, affective, and behavioral learning responses result from the complex interaction of various person traits and psychological states that the learner exhibits across various types of learning contexts.

## Advancing Research on Personality and Learning

All three perspectives—traits within context, traits and behavioral variability, and traits and psychological states—focus attention on taking the interrelationships among people, situations, and be- haviors more seriously. These new perspectives for understanding personality highlight the opportunities for advancing our thinking about the learner within a learning situation.

Overall, research is needed that moves beyond the focus on the modal or average level of a personality trait for an individual as a predictor of learning outcomes. In this way, we can begin to match the dynamic process of learning with a more dynamic under- standing of the person. This requires us to begin with the as- sumption that individuals with a particular trait do not always behave the same way in all situations, and to some extent the vari- ation in behavior implies within-person variability around the av- erage level of a personality trait. This highlights that although traits may have stability, training designers and trainers themselves can have inﬂuence over the variability around that average level, cre- ating situations that push individuals out of their average trait zone. Three questions are key for advancing research and practice on training and learning: What interventions can help create ef- fective learning states and processes? When are aptitude-treatment interactions important to consider? and How do individuals mat- ter given strong learning situations?

## What Interventions Help Create Effective Learning States and Learning Processes?

It is clear that to understand the person within situation, we need a better understanding of situations that learners face. The situa- tional context of learning that has been most studied in the train- ing literature has been workplace climate and management support for learning. Goldstein and Ford (2002) discuss how work-

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 245

place climate needs to be part of the initial organizational analysis during the needs assessment phase. In addition, climate has been found to affect motivational and training transfer outcomes (Bald- win & Ford, 1988; Colquitt et al., 2000).

Much less attention has been paid in the industrial/organiza- tional psychology literature to what situations are embedded in the pretraining and delivery of training and how they affect learning states, motivation to learn, self-regulatory strategies, and ultimately knowledge and skill acquisition. Based on this understanding, we can begin to develop interventions to create more effective learn- ing states.

Research in educational psychology is beginning to show that certain student learning contexts matter in terms of affecting mo- tivation to learn and learning activities. One focus of the research deals with classroom practices that positively affect intrinsic moti- vation (Brophy, 1998). For example, Guthrie, Wigﬁeld, and Von Secker (2000) designed an instructional environment for reading that included multiple pathways for affecting student intrinsic mo- tivation. They found that regardless of individual differences, an instructional context that emphasized learning goals, real-world interaction (hands-on activities), competence support (instruction on strategies to use), and autonomy support (self-directed learn- ing and collaboration) led to higher motivation and greater strat- egy use than a traditional classroom instruction that addressed the same content. Thus, the incorporation of effective learning and design principles can create learning states that are beneﬁcial for all learners (Noe & Colquitt, 2002).

Research also indicates that many trait variables that training research has shown are important to pretraining motivation also have state variable analogues. These learning states provide a point of leverage for trainers in developing pretraining motivation. Sev- eral examples of variables that have been treated as both traits and states include locus of control, anxiety, and goal orientation (Chen, Gully, Whiteman, & Kilcullen, 2000; Fisher, 1998; Rotter, 1966; Spielberger, 1966, 1977; Weiner, 1983, 1985). For example, Chen et al. found that statelike individual difference factors such as goal orientation and state anxiety mediated the relationships between traitlike individual differences and learning performance. The fact that these variables can be viewed as states implies that they can be

# 246 PERSONALITY AND WORK

modiﬁable or created in ways beneﬁcial to the motivation of the learner. As another example, Button, Mathieu, and Zajac (1996) contend that goal orientation is a stable trait but can be manipu- lated by a strong situation. Although a personality trait may be the dominant manner in which an individual prefers to learn, it is clear that learning states can also be induced by characteristics within the learning situation. It is an open question as to how to create a state that has an impact on learning prior to the person’s reverting back to his or her natural tendencies, strategies, and interpretations as- sociated with his or her dominant trait orientation (Elliot, 1999). A recent study by Weissbein and Ford (2002) shows one ap- proach to an intervention to affect learning states and subsequently learning outcomes. They focused directly on creating learning states regardless of the person’s stable traits. For example, it is dif- ﬁcult to change a person’s locus of control. Instead, they argue for the need to develop an intervention to affect trainee attributions or state level of locus of control. This argument is consistent with the work of Mischel, Fleeson, and others who have focused on sit- uations, variance in personality, and behavioral signatures. In par- ticular for this study, they showed videotapes of former trainees that attributed success in an assertiveness training program as based on persistence, effort, and strategy. The goal of this attribu- tional retraining was to change any unproductive attribution pat- terns that encourage helplessness, such as attributing failure to stable and uncontrollable factors (lack of ability), into constructive attributions, such as attributing success in training to unstable and controllable factors (effort). Trainees were exposed to the attri- butional retraining prior to attending a training program on as- sertiveness. Results indicated that the intervention had an impact on learning states. These learning states were related to pretrain- ing motivation, over and above the impact of the trait measure of locus of control, and this relationship was mediated by the attri- butional learning states. Motivation to learn was found to have an effect on learning in the assertiveness training program and led to better performance in the transfer setting in which the trainees conducted a salary negotiation task. Thus, even a relatively brief intervention prior to beginning the training session was found to induce beneﬁcial attributional patterns and discouraged mal- adaptive attributional patterns.

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 247

This research direction shows that learning states can be cre- ated that have important impacts on self-regulatory processes and learning outcomes. Research from the clinical and social psychol- ogy literatures on affecting states should be considered for ideas on other types of interventions that have relevance for learning sit- uations. For example, Fosterling (1985) discusses a number of other types of attribution retraining approaches such as the use of persuasion. Barrios and Shigetomi (1979) have identiﬁed ﬁve types of programs for anxiety management. Such interventions have the potential to provide trainers and training designers with a number of strategies for improving learning.

# When Are ATIs Important to Consider?

ATIs are of interest because they imply that to some extent, learn- ing experiences such as training can be optimized across speciﬁc groups of individuals. In other words, one training intervention may beneﬁt some individuals more than others in terms of their standing on a learning outcome; in turn, those who do not bene- ﬁt from this intervention will beneﬁt from another one (or from some variation of it). Campbell and Kuncel (2002) stress that there are always relevant individual differences and always differences in training programs that make ATI relevant to any training effort. Yet there has been scant attention to examining ATIs in organiza- tional learning situations.

Recent research has begun to reexamine the usefulness of ATIs in workplace training situations. Gully, Payne, Koles, and Whitman (2002) examined the effectiveness of error training for trainees with different levels of ability and personality traits such as open- ness to experience and conscientiousness. They found that the ef- fectiveness of the training was dependent on both ability and personality traits. For example, individuals more open to experi- ence beneﬁted more from error-encouragement training than less open individuals did. Schmidt and Ford (2002) examined the in- teractive effects of goal orientation and metacognitive instruction on learning outcomes within a Web-based training environment. They found, consistent with expectations, that the metacognitive intervention (prompting learners to self-reﬂect) resulted in lower levels of metacognitive activity and learning for those with a high

level of performance-avoidance orientation as opposed to those with low levels of performance avoidance.

These types of studies show that ATIs can be important for un- derstanding motivational and learning outcomes. We contend that the next logical step is to begin to examine when ATIs are impor- tant enough to have practical signiﬁcance. Figures 9.3 and 9.4 qual- ify the conditions when designing training interventions tailored to ATIs might be useful and when doing so might be less so. The gray boxes reﬂect the range of scores on pre- and posttraining measures, and the white dots reﬂect particular individuals’ scores. Figure 9.3 exempliﬁes the strong situation where training is very effective for all involved. This may happen frequently when the training out- come is somewhat narrow, for instance, some sort of knowledge ac- quisition in a domain relatively unknown prior to training (training computer programmers to learn a procedure in a particular com- puter programming language). Here, despite possible individual differences in preference for the structure of training, trainee anx- iety, and so on, all who were trained achieved mastery.

Figure 9.4 is perhaps a more interesting example, combining possible ATIs shown in scores on pretraining and posttraining mea- sures. The rank order of individuals on scores differs from pre- training to posttraining measures (that is, some ATIs are present). The point here is that the mastery level established on the train- ing outcome informs the extent that designing training to ATIs matters. An extreme case is where any increase on the learning outcome, no matter how slight, is valuable to the organization. In

that case, the cost of training tailored to ATIs must be balanced with the beneﬁt realized (realizing that the cost and the beneﬁts may not entirely expressible in dollar amounts). A more practical case is where a mastery level on the training outcome is set, and individuals must achieve a posttraining score above that level. Scores beyond that level may be of value to the organization, but the explicit training goal is for trainees to obtain a score at or above the mastery level. In this case, where the mastery level is set is a key inﬂuence on whether training interventions should address ATIs that may be present. Consider, for instance, mastery level A. All individuals are below that level pretraining, but most are above that level posttraining. In this case, the training goal is met despite ATIs that may be present. Tailoring training to ATIs here may not be so important (although such tailoring may still make reaching the training goals easier or reactions to training more favorable, say, for those who prefer less structured training). Contrast this sit- uation with one where the mastery level is set at mastery level B. Here, approximately half the trainees achieve the mastery level and half do not, so training speciﬁc to ATIs might be more valuable. ATI training may entail a supplement for some of the individuals in a training course, or it may imply different training experiences for different sets of individuals. Of course, ﬁnding the ATIs has been and will continue to be a challenge. What is also needed to link re- search and practice, though, is a greater appreciation of the cir- cumstances under which ﬁnding ATIs is important.

## How Do Individuals Matter Given Strong Learning Situations?

Research on situational interventions to affect psychological states and person-treatment interactions must also be balanced with con- tinued work on understanding when and how individuals matter in learning contexts. This calls for more complex examination of stable individual characteristics and the multiple ways in which peo- ple progress through learning situations. In addition, it calls for longitudinal research to study how an individual progresses through various learning situations.

Dweck (1986) identiﬁed two very different goal orientations that people can have toward learning activities. Mastery-oriented individuals believe that their efforts can lead to improved learning and retention. Individuals with a mastery orientation view ability as malleable. They focus on developing new skills, attempt to un- derstand their tasks, and deﬁne their success in terms of challeng- ing self-referenced standards. In contrast, performance-oriented individuals believe that ability is demonstrated by performing bet- ter than others, even during training events. Moreover, they deﬁne success in terms of normative-based standards. Thus, mastery and performance orientations represent fundamentally different ideas of success and different reasons for engaging in learning (Ames, 1992). Much of the research on goal orientation has focused on demonstrating the adaptive nature of mastery over performance goals.

Elliot and his colleagues have expanded on our understanding of achievement striving, emphasizing that approach and avoidance goals are critical to understanding achievement in learning and performance situations (see Elliot, 1999; Elliot & Church, 1997; El- liot & McGregor, 2001). Approach motivation is seen as directed toward a positive or desirable event, while avoidance motivation is directed against a negative or undesirable event. They have linked these concepts with the personality characteristics of mastery and performance goal orientations to form a four-factor model of achievement goals: mastery approach, mastery avoid, performance approach, and performance avoid. Elliot and McGregor (2001) found evidence in support of the four achievement goal types as empirically distinguishable, with differential effects on learning

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 251

processes such as deep processing of material, study strategies, and anxiety levels. In addition, Elliot and Thrash (2002) present a more integrative perspective of personality, approach-avoid motivations, and goal orientation. They present evidence that personality char- acteristics such as extraversion and positive emotionality load on the approach dimension, while neuroticism and negative emo- tionality load on the avoid dimension.

From a training or learning perspective, a key issue is how much of an inﬂuence one can have on achievement goals. The framework of Elliot and colleagues suggests that the basic temperaments or un- derlying motivational pushes of approach and avoid are probably fairly well ingrained by adulthood. This leads to a question as to the extent to which organizations can create motivational states that are contrary to an individual’s natural and personality-driven tenden- cies. Although the answer to this is yet unclear, some recent re- search provides a window into the possibility of directing attention to affecting mastery- and performance-oriented states of the learner in particular learning situations. For example, Kozlowski, Gully, Smith, Nason, and Brown (1995) instructed participants in a mas- tery goal condition to focus on learning the components of a task, trying out new skills, and exploring new strategies. Individuals in the performance goal condition were instructed to achieve a difﬁ- cult and speciﬁc outcome goal. Results indicated that compared to trainees with performance goals, trainees with mastery goals tended to be more self-conﬁdent, gained more knowledge from training, and were more likely to generalize skills from the train- ing task to a new and more complex transfer task.

Recent work in the educational ﬁeld has gone beyond study- ing the simple additive effects of goal-orientation traits on behav- ior to focus on the multiple traits and multiple pathways that link traits to achievement-related outcomes. Increasing our under- standing of these traits and pathways is critical to developing ap- propriate interventions to aid learning.

A multiple goal perspective (for example, see Wentzel, 1991, 1992) takes more of a developmental or process perspective to achievement motivation and learning. An assumption of this approach is that mastery goals may lead to different learning pro- cesses and different outcomes than do performance goal orienta- tions. These different pathways and outcomes provide a more

# 252 PERSONALITY AND WORK

complex picture of the learner than the somewhat static view of a mastery goal orientation as being “better” than a performance goal orientation in terms of motivation, strategy use, and performance outcomes. For example, in some situations, performance goals may be adaptive—or at least not maladaptive. There may be learning objectives that are not intrinsically motivating to most individuals, even to those who tend to be mastery oriented in other situations, where individuals with a high performance goal orientation may strive to perform well. Or in some dynamic situations, staying with a mastery goal rather than moving to more of a performance goal over time may not be beneﬁcial to continued improvement. From a multiple pathways perspective, performance-oriented learners may feel less interest and have more anxiety and more trouble dealing with failure, employ different strategies to deal with fail- ure than a mastery-oriented person would, and yet still reach the same level of outcomes. This calls for going beyond between-subjects designs to consider examining multiple goals for individuals and their interactions across different settings or situations.

Recent studies have found support for taking a multiple goal perspective. For example, Pintrich (2000) examined goal orienta- tion and changes in motivation, affect, strategy use, and perfor- mance across three waves of data collected from 150 eighth and ninth graders in math classes. In general, he found that the process measures such as self-efﬁcacy, task value, and positive affect de- clined over time. More central to a perspective of multiple goals, he found that performance approach goals, when coupled with mastery goals, were just as adaptive as mastery goals alone. He also found that the two types of goal orientation had differential rela- tionships over time to psychological processes such as positive af- fect, the use of self-handicapping strategies, and perceived task value.

Riveiro, Cabanach, and Arias (2001) conducted a study of 595 college students. They examined relationships between goal orien- tation and the use of various types of cognitive, self-regulatory, and motivational strategies. They found that from a multiple-goals per- spective, students who developed the most positive self-regulatory strategies were those who not only were concerned about mastery but also had a desire to avoid being judged negatively by others. This outcome highlights the importance of engaging learners in

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 253

both the learning goals and self-regulation in achieving those goals in order to “manage their learning and make it more ﬂexible so they can achieve whatever seems most appropriate in each situation” (p. 570).

As a ﬁnal example, Harackiewicz, Barron, Carter, Lehto, and Elliot (1997) examined the short- and long-term consequences of student achievement goals during college. Consistent with a multiple-goal perspective, both mastery and performance goals had positive and complementary effects on different measures of academic success. In particular, they found that mastery goals in the short run predicted interest in an introduction to psychology course, and in the long run they predicted the number of subsequent psychology courses students enrolled in. Performance goals pre- dicted both short- and long-term academic performance.

These three studies show the need to consider multiple goals within training research. The studies also are consistent with calls by Snow (1992) to understand how constructs work together in the light of learning outcomes, as opposed to studying a number of learning and motivational constructs in isolation from one another. In particular, the multiple-goal idea implies that a single interven- tion to induce a mastery orientation may not always be appropriate or realistic. Instead, we need a better understanding about motiva- tional traits such as goal orientation and a focus on what combi- nation of interventions may be needed to create an effective and longer-lasting learning state.

The idea of multiple pathways can certainly be applied to other personality traits that have relevance for learning beyond goal ori- entation. For example, training research indicates that high inter- nal locus-of-control individuals tend to be more motivated to learn and learn more than those low on internal locus of control or high on external locus of control. Research is needed that goes beyond these simple effects to address the question of when or under what conditions external locus of control is adaptive rather than mal- adaptive. In addition, investigators can begin to examine the multi- ple pathways that lead some externals to positive learning outcomes. Finally, prior to recommending appropriate interventions to create a learning state such as state mastery orientation, investiga- tors might want to focus more attention on affecting learning processes. For example, efforts could be directed toward having

# 254 PERSONALITY AND WORK

learners use particular study strategies or be devoted to develop- ing skills in planning, monitoring, and evaluating their own learn- ing. Trainees could be asked to set challenging learning goals, visualize possible courses of action, reﬂect on how much they have learned, and consider whether alternative learning strategies might be more effective. These efforts are more proximal to the desired learning outcomes. What is interesting is the extent to which dif- ferent personality characteristics affect and are affected by inter- ventions to improve the learning processes of the learner.

# Conclusion

Most of the research on traits, situations, and aptitude treatment interactions has been conducted in traditional classroom settings. We have highlighted key advances that need to be made in train- ing research. In meeting this research agenda, it should be noted that there is a trend toward a decrease in instructor-led classroom instruction and an increase in the use of emerging learning tech- nologies such as distance learning, CD-ROM and multimedia in- struction, Web-based training, intelligent tutoring systems, and virtual reality training (Goldstein & Ford, 2002). For example, a survey from the American Society of Training and Development suggests that classroom instruction will decline from over 80 per- cent of all instruction in 1996 to less than 60 percent by 2002 (Bassi & Van Buren, 1998).

The changes in learning technologies also have clear implica- tions for training research. First, the emerging learning technolo- gies allow for a more individualized approach to instruction. For example, Web-based and CD-ROM courses provide a number of hyperlinks that allow individuals to choose how much breadth and depth to go into in the topics in the course. Thus, the learning is more in control of the student’s own learning pace, as well as the content to attend to. Second, techniques such as intelligent tutor- ing systems hold the promise of a learning process that can be in- dividualized or customized to meet the training needs of each learner better. Third, individuals have more choice over when to engage in a learning activity. For example, they may choose when to attend a distance-learning program. Perhaps more important, with courses on CD-ROM or the Web, they can choose to work on

# UNDERSTANDING THE DYNAMIC LEARNER 255

a learning activity for a period of time and decide when to stop and return to it later. Finally, most traditional instruction can provide only a minimal amount of time for skilled practice because the practice time must be shared across all members in the course. The promise and potential of virtual reality training is that individuals have more options regarding how much practice they aspire to ob- tain and how many different scenarios or situations they practice. Increasing learner control and customization of training pro- vide opportunities for researchers to advance training theory of in- dividual differences and learning while examining issues within relevant and interesting training contexts. Which traits are rele- vant to study in learner-controlled contexts might vary somewhat from those that have traditionally been examined, although it is an important coincidence that self-efﬁcacy and need for structure are a major aptitude and treatment, respectively, that have gained a foothold in ATI research and at the same time are important characteristics that inﬂuence the implementation of new training technologies. The types of individuals who might learn more in a customized training approach over a normative training approach needs to be studied more carefully, so that the cost-beneﬁt analy- sis of implementing new training technologies can be made more explicit. More generally, we assert a real need for research on cre- ating learning situations, examining relevant aptitude treatment interactions, and studying multiple traits and multiple pathways across traditional and more innovative learning contexts.

Focusing on Personality in Person-Organization Fit Research Unaddressed Issues Ann Marie Ryan Amy Kristof-Brown

Kristof-Brown (2000) noted that one can distinguish person-job (PJ) ﬁt, or the match between an applicant’s knowledge, skills, and abilities and the job requirements, and person-organization (PO) fit, that is, the match between the person and broader organizational attributes. One of the primary foci of person-environment ﬁt re- search has been person-vocation (PV) ﬁt (Holland, 1985), or the match between an individual’s attributes and preferences and his or her occupation. Furthermore, researchers have recently begun to explore what could be labeled person-group (PG) ﬁt (Barrick, Stewart, Neubert, & Mount, 1998; Kristof-Brown & Stevens, 2001; Chapter Seven, this volume), or the ﬁt between a person and mem- bers of his or her immediate work group. In all of these types of ﬁt— PO, PJ, PV, and PG ﬁt—personality may play a role. Furthermore, there are relationships between these (with a poor PV ﬁt, one may also experience poor PJ ﬁt; poor PJ or PG ﬁt might negatively in- ﬂuence perceptions of PO ﬁt), although research has supported their distinctiveness (Kristof-Brown, 2000; Lauver & Kristof-Brown, 2002; Saks & Ashforth, 1997). We focus our chapter solely on PO ﬁt because research on PJ and PV ﬁt and personality is more ex-

262

tensive, PG ﬁt is discussed in Chapter Seven in this volume, and the role of personality in PO ﬁt assessment is less understood.

Our goal in this chapter is not to review the literature on PO ﬁt. Indeed, several comprehensive reviews already exist (Judge & Kristof-Brown, in press; Kristof, 1996; Werbel & Gilliland, 1999). Considerable research has demonstrated that perceptions of PO ﬁt relate to important individual and organizational outcomes (for example, satisfaction, organizational commitment, extra-role be- haviors, organizational attraction, hiring decisions, turnover; Cable & Judge, 1997; Judge & Cable, 1997; Lauver & Kristof-Brown, 2002; Kristof-Brown, 2000; Verquer, Beehr, & Wagner, 2001). Instead, we discuss four pertinent issues regarding the role of personality in PO ﬁt.

- Does PO ﬁt on personality even matter? • When is good PO ﬁt on personality bad, and when is bad PO ﬁt on personality good for individuals and organizations?

- How accurate are personality PO ﬁt perceptions? • How does ﬁt relate to adaptability?

# Does PO Fit on Personality Matter?

When choosing her ﬁrst academic job from several good offers, Carolyn was most concerned about working in a department that truly valued and rewarded research activity. After two years at “Level 1 U,” she began to question her ﬁt as she became more concerned with collegiality than pub- lishing. Without much thought, she accepted a job at Friendly U, where her new colleagues were all agreeable but not particularly conscientious. She realized that although she had felt things were amiss at Level 1 U, she did not experience as much daily frustration there as she now was at Friendly U.

When researchers ask people what PO ﬁt means to them, they provide a wide range of answers. Bretz, Rynes, and Gerhart (1993) and Rynes and Gerhart (1990) reported that recruiters consider such diverse characteristics as grade point average, attractiveness, job- related course work, work experience, articulateness, cognitive abil- ity, cooperative attitude, focus, work ethic, self-conﬁdence, goal ori- entation, and interpersonal skills in their assessments of ﬁt. Despite

# 264 PERSONALITY AND WORK

this broad array, Kristof (1996) noted that the most frequent op- erationalization of PO ﬁt in research has been values congruence, or the match between the values of the individual and the organi- zation (Bretz et al., 1993; Cable & Judge, 1996; Cable & Parsons, 2001; Chatman, 1991; Judge & Cable, 1997; Meglino, Ravlin, & Ad- kins, 1989; O’Reilly & Chatman, 1986; O’Reilly, Chatman, & Cald- well, 1991; Posner, Kouzes, & Schmidt, 1985; Schneider, Goldstein, & Smith, 1995).

In a follow-up investigation, Kristof-Brown (2000) asked re- cruiters to identify speciﬁc characteristics they used to assess PO ﬁt in a set of common job applicants and had independent coders categorize these characteristics as (1) knowledge, skills, and abili- ties, (2) personality traits, (3) values, or (4) other things. Results indicated that 100 percent of the recruiters mentioned at least one personality trait as indicative of PO ﬁt, whereas only 65 percent mentioned values. These results suggest that personality represents an important but understudied component of PO ﬁt.

Our purpose is not to suggest that personality-based ﬁt is more important than values-based ﬁt, or vice versa. Instead, we hope to clarify the conditions in which each basis of ﬁt is likely to maximize prediction of individual and organizational outcomes. To address this issue, it is necessary to clarify the relation of personality and values. This is not an easy task, as the terms have sometimes been used interchangeably. For example, Campbell (1963) included val- ues and personality, along with habits, attitudes, and beliefs, in a list of acquired behavioral dispositions. Furthermore, studies com- paring the two often ﬁnd support for strong, positive relationships between particular personality traits and speciﬁc values. For ex- ample, people high on the Five-Factor Model (FFM) trait of open- ness to experience have been found to consistently hold the values of a “world of beauty” and being “broadminded” and “imaginative” (Dollinger, Leong, & Ulicni, 1996). Extraverts have been found to value comfort and excitement, and people high on neuroticism to value independence and freedom from conﬂict (Furnham, 1984). Judge and Cable (1997) found that FFM traits predicted organi- zational culture preferences or values, although they noted that the relations between the two were small.

Despite incidences of corresponding values and personality traits, examining the deﬁnitions of these two sets of constructs care-

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 265

fully suggests that they differ in meaningful ways. Values are de- ﬁned as enduring beliefs about modes of conduct that are per- sonally preferable (Rokeach, 1973). Value attainment has been described as comparing one’s life activities to some predetermined standard of success (Hochwarter, Perrewe, Ferris, & Brymer, 1999). They are “what people believe to be important” and what goals they wish to pursue (Schwartz, 1994; Schwartz & Sagiv, 1995). Al- ternatively, personality traits are “what people are like,” or their pervasive tendencies to show consistent patterns of thoughts, feel- ings, and actions (Herringer, 1998; McCrae & Costa, 1990). Thus, values are fundamentally aspirational or goal oriented, dealing with what a person wants to achieve, whereas personality is more descriptive, concerning how a person prefers to act or strive to achieve their goals.

A second distinction between values and personality is that al- though both are considered stable, traits are considered to be de- ﬁnably stable, with substantial internal or genetic causes (see Conley, 1984a; Dollinger et al., 1996; Rowe, 1987). Alternatively, values are susceptible to a variety of learned inﬂuences including self-confrontation, changes in society, and the inﬂuences of new environments (Cable & Parsons, 2001; Dollinger et al., 1996; Judge & Cable, 1997). Rohan (2000), in a review of the values construct, notes that an individual’s value system is a way to order which re- quirements or desires are more or less important to “best possible living.” She notes that value priorities will change in response to changes in circumstances as the deﬁnition of “best possible liv- ing” changes (for example, people tend to become more conserv- ative in values when they become parents).

In the light of these differences, there are several reasons to ex- pect that PO ﬁt based on personality should be at least as inﬂuen- tial as ﬁt based on values. First, because values are less stable than personality, ﬁt between a person’s and an organization’s values might be more susceptible to change over time than ﬁt based on personality. For example, a person who feels achievement is an im- portant value might decide as she ages that interpersonal warmth is more important and change her assessment of PO ﬁt with a given organization. In addition, there are numerous examples in the lit- erature of people’s values becoming more congruent with their or- ganization and occupations over time (Hall, Schneider, & Nygren,

# 266 PERSONALITY AND WORK

1975; Mortimer & Lorence, 1979), although Kraimer (1997) notes that the extent of this change is likely to depend on the strength of initial beliefs. Because an individual’s personality is expected to be more stable over time and situations, a PO ﬁt assessment based on personality (I am a conscientious individual, and this is a con- scientious organization) should not be expected to change dra- matically over time.

A second reason that PO ﬁt based on personality should be as inﬂuential as that based on values is that personality is proximal to behavior. Personality deﬁnes how a person prefers to behave, whereas values deﬁne what a person hopes to achieve. It is rea- sonable to assume that the former is more closely related to be- havioral intentions (and, subsequently, to behaviors) than the latter. Moreover, values are notably equiﬁnal. That is, there are many behaviors that could be used to attain them. Thus, simply knowing someone’s values offers little information on the speciﬁc behaviors they will use in a particular situation.

A third reason is the relative observability of personality and values. Judge and Cable (1997) note that values may be less ob- servable than personality, and therefore judgments of ﬁt by others (recruiters) may be more likely to be made on personality traits than on the less observable values. Kristof-Brown’s results (2000) support this notion.

Based on these considerations of stability, proximity, and visibil- ity, personality-based PO ﬁt should have at least as strong an inﬂu- ence on individuals’ attitudes and behaviors than would values- based ﬁt. However, a recent meta-analysis of the PO ﬁt literature suggests that this is not true. In a meta-analysis of ﬁfteen studies, Verquer et al. (2001) found that value congruence had stronger relations with outcomes than did other types of congruence, in- cluding personality. When compared with studies assessing ﬁt as goal congruence, personality-climate match, and congruence with core principles and characteristics, value congruence studies showed a slightly larger mean correlation with satisfaction (r = .24 versus r = .22), organizational commitment (r = .32 versus r = .21), and intention to quit (r = −.38 versus r = −.15). While these results combined other types of ﬁt with personality congruence studies, the results suggest that ﬁndings in the personality PO ﬁt domain may be weak.

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 267

To understand this ﬁnding, we believe it is useful to look more closely at how ﬁt is conceptualized and measured in studies of value-based versus personality-based PO ﬁt. In particular, it is im- portant to consider how the “O” is operationalized. In values-based studies, PO ﬁt is typically assessed as the similarity or congru- ence between an individual’s values and those of the organization. It is generally accepted that organizational cultures are charac- terized by values (Schein, 1992). These can be measured in a va- riety of ways, such as by examining written statements of espoused values (mission statements, for example) or asking members of the top management team to report the organization’s values. When an individual’s personal values are matched against com- pany values measured in any of these ways, the type of ﬁt being as- sessed is supplementary ﬁt (Muchinsky & Monahan, 1987); that is, ﬁt is demonstrated by similarity between individual and orga- nizational characteristics.

Unlike studies of values, which tend to use the congruence ap- proach, a recent review by Judge and Kristof-Brown (in press) re- veals that personality ﬁt has been operationalized in as many as six different ways. Of these, most studies of personality-based PO ﬁt can be separated into two general types of ﬁt assessments. The ﬁrst is similar to value congruence research, in which supplementary ﬁt is inferred if the individual’s personality is similar to the organization’s personality. One concern with this approach is that although it is widely accepted that organizations have values, the idea of ascrib- ing traits to organizations is more often considered anthropomor- phizing (Chatman, 1989). Slaughter et al. (2001) conducted a series of studies to demonstrate that individuals can ascribe human per- sonality traits to organizations. However, they found that there is not a completely commensurate set of traits that is ideal for de- scribing individuals and organizations (that is, some traits relevant for describing individuals are not readily adapted or often used to describe organizations). Because of these challenges, some re- searchers have resorted to assessing organizational personality as the aggregate of the personality traits of incumbent employees.

Results of studies using this approach to assessing personality- based PO ﬁt have been equivocal at best. Day and Bedeian (1995) ex- amined whether the relationship between an individual’s FFM traits and those of current employees predicted important individual-level

# 268 PERSONALITY AND WORK

outcomes in a medical center setting. Although they found a pos- itive relationship between similarity on agreeableness and job per- formance, their results indicated a negative relationship between conscientiousness congruence and organizational tenure, and no relationship between extraversion similarity and any work-related outcome. Similarly, in a study of 476 managers and professionals working in a large government agency, Tischler (1996) found no evidence of a signiﬁcant relationship between individuals’ similar- ity to the modal organizational personality type on the Myers- Briggs Type Indicator with either salary increases or number of promotions over time. Finally, in a study of training performance of ﬂight attendants, Ferris, Youngblood, and Yates (1985) found no support for a relationship between newcomer-incumbent per- sonality congruence and withdrawal behaviors, with congruence assessed as the correlation between the employee’s 16PF (Cattell, 1970) proﬁle and the proﬁle of an average successful incumbent. The second way personality-based PO ﬁt is typically assessed is by testing for an interaction between an individual’s traits and “ob- jective” organizational characteristics, like reward system or size. Using this approach, commensurate measurement between indi- vidual traits and organizational characteristics is not necessary. Un- like studies of personality congruence that evaluate supplementary ﬁt, these studies appear to be assessing complementary ﬁt, in which the environment meets the needs or preferences of the individual (Muchinsky & Monahan, 1987). Thus, the basis for what consti- tutes a ﬁt is very different in these types of studies. In addition, these studies emphasize ﬁt on speciﬁc personality traits, whereas most of the congruence studies assess similarity of individual and organizational personality proﬁles. Because proﬁle correlations conceal the individual contribution of the speciﬁc traits (Edwards, 1993), it is difﬁcult to determine whether there are important ﬁt relationships that are being concealed in the overall proﬁle.

In contrast to the personality congruence studies, results of studies using the interaction approach have successfully demon- strated signiﬁcant effects of personality-based PO ﬁt. Turban and Keon (1993) found that job seekers’ personality characteristics of self-esteem and need for achievement moderated the impact of or- ganizational characteristics such as centralization, size, and reward structure on organizational attraction. Similarly, Bretz and col-

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 269

leagues (Bretz, Ash, & Dreher, 1989; Bretz & Judge, 1994) reported that personality traits including locus of control and risk aversion moderated the relationship between human resource systems and job seekers’ attraction to organizations. Cable and Judge (1994) extended these ﬁndings with a policy-capturing study that demon- strated that interactions between personality traits (materialism, locus of control, individualism/collectivism, self-efﬁcacy, and risk aversion) and compensation system attributes predicted job choice. Turban, Lau, Ngo, Chow, and Si (2001) found that prospective labor market entrants’ risk aversion and need for pay moderated the relationship between type of ownership (wholly owned foreign enterprise versus international joint venture) and organizational attractiveness, probability of seeking an interview, and probability of accepting a job offer. Taken as a whole, these results support the importance of a ﬁt between a wide array of individual personality traits and organizational characteristics.

Reviewing the personality-based PO ﬁt literature reveals a num- ber of important implications. First, there are several reasons to support the notion that examining personality-based PO ﬁt is meaningful. Personality is stable over time and proximal to be- haviors, and certain traits are relatively easy to observe. Therefore, the personality ﬁt between a person and an organization is unlikely to change much over time, should inﬂuence behavior as well as at- titudes, and may be easy for recruiters to assess. Having said that, the empirical evidence suggests that how personality-based PO ﬁt is conceptualized and measured matters a great deal. Speciﬁcally, it is a useful predictor when assessed as the complementary ﬁt be- tween individuals and objective organizational characteristics, such as compensation system, centralization, or ownership form. In these instances, the organization is meeting the individual’s needs or preferences and therefore providing something that the indi- vidual desires. However, when PO ﬁt is measured as the congru- ence between individuals’ personalities and those of others in the organization, it is not typically a useful predictor. This is perhaps not surprising when one considers that the individual interacts with only a small percentage of the total workforce in an organization. We believe it is more likely that an individual will be inﬂuenced by personality compatibility with those in his or her immediate work group. This implies that if ﬁt is to be assessed as personality

# 270 PERSONALITY AND WORK

congruence rather than as an interaction, it may be more inﬂu- ential when assessed as PG rather than PO ﬁt. Constructs at adja- cent levels of analysis (person and group) should be more strongly related than those that are more distal (person and organization; Simon, 1973).

Referring back to our example at the beginning of this section, Carolyn was initially unhappy with her position because of a poor PO ﬁt on values. Her values regarding collegiality were not con- gruent with those of others in her organization. After moving to a new university that shared her value for collegiality, she was struck by the lack of ﬁt in terms of conscientiousness with the others in her department. Because she interacts with these individuals on a daily or at least weekly basis, this lack of ﬁt on personality was neg- atively affecting her attitudes about her work and coworkers. Both types of misﬁt (PO misﬁt on values and PG misﬁt on personality) resulted in negative consequences for Carolyn.

We believe that an important next step in ﬁt research is to in- vestigate the relative impact of these various types of ﬁt. Kristof- Brown, Jansen, and Colbert (2002) have conducted preliminary research in this area, using a policy-capturing design to demon- strate that PJ, PG, and PO ﬁt each has important independent ef- fects on satisfaction. Their results also showed that people with different amounts and types of work experience weight each type of ﬁt differently and that most individuals use complex strategies for combining their perceptions of these multiple types of ﬁt. Ad- ditional research demonstrating when, and for whom, a particular type of ﬁt will be most inﬂuential is needed.

In addition, research on personality-based PG ﬁt is clearly nec- essary. In one of the only studies on PG ﬁt, using separate samples of M.B.A. project teams and long-standing manufacturing teams, Kristof-Brown, Barrick, and Stevens (2001) demonstrated that members’ attraction to their teams was highest when their level of extraversion was different from that of their team members. Their results show a complementary ﬁt relationship for the trait of ex- traversion. Additional personality traits should be investigated to understand more fully how ﬁt on personality operates within teams.

One issue for this research to consider is how best to opera- tionalize the personality of the team or organization. Kristof-Brown

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 271

et al. (2001) assessed the team’s extraversion by using the average of team members minus the person whose ﬁt was being assessed. However, results by Barrick et al. (1998) suggest additional ways in which team personality may be modeled. They described three methods of operationalizing team personality composition: mean score for the group, variability (variance, proportion of members possessing a particular trait), and minimum and maximum scores on a trait. Whether these methods could be applied to the assess- ment of PG or even PO ﬁt with any meaning is another question worth pursuing.

One ﬁnal issue is that the question of whether personality- based PO ﬁt matters may be too simplistic. Given our knowledge of the usefulness of certain personality traits as predictors of per- formance, we could ask whether any organization cares about ﬁt on conscientiousness and emotional stability; instead, ﬁrms want to hire individuals high on these traits regardless of the current lev- els in the workforce. However, PO ﬁt on these two traits will still matter for outcomes such as satisfaction, as the highly conscien- tious individual will be less satisﬁed when there is low ﬁt. Thus, it is overly simplistic to talk about PO ﬁt on personality affecting out- comes. We must consider what traits we are talking about and what outcomes we are hoping to predict. We expand on this more fully in the next section.

## When Good PO Fit Is Bad and Bad PO Fit Is Good

Juan recalls his short tenure at XYZ Inc. as an unpleasant time but a valu- able experience. Juan naturally strives to get along with others, so he was surprised to ﬁnd himself in a workplace where criticism, backbiting, and overt hostility were the substance of interpersonal interactions. Juan was glad to leave XYZ, though he notes that he learned a lot about dealing with difﬁcult coworkers. He says that now he can more quickly spot what the difﬁculties will be in working with a particular client and has devel- oped strategies for more effectively handling disagreeable clients.

Schneider, Smith, and Goldstein (2000) argued that traditional PE ﬁt theory argues for positive, individual-level outcomes (higher job satisfaction, lower turnover, greater commitment) from good ﬁt, but that the attraction-selection-attrition (ASA) model suggests neg- ative, organizational-level outcomes from good ﬁt (for example,

# 272 PERSONALITY AND WORK

inability to adapt, less innovation, groupthink). They note that this occurs because the ASA model suggests that organizations will tend toward homogeneity of personality. Schneider and colleagues argue that in general, good ﬁt leads to personality homogeneity and poor organizational health. Thus, the current wisdom is that personality-based PO ﬁt is good for the person and short-term in- dividual affective outcomes, but bad for the organization and long- term performance outcomes.

In this section, we discuss this dark side of personality-based PO ﬁt and when it is likely to occur. Building on some comments of Schneider et al. (2000), we discuss when good PO ﬁt can be bad and, expanding on that, argue that bad PO ﬁt can sometimes re- sult in good consequences. We reiterate that our focus is on PO ﬁt in terms of personality. Schnedier et al. noted that good ﬁt on goals might always be good, but good ﬁt on personality characteristics sometimes might not be.

When discussing the potential dark side of personality ﬁt, it is important to remember the distinctions that we drew in the ﬁrst section of this chapter. When personality-based PO ﬁt is concep- tualized as complementary ﬁt, such that individuals’ needs are met by an objective organizational characteristic (compensation system or type of ownership), it is difﬁcult to anticipate negative conse- quences for individuals. It is possible, of course, that an individ- ual’s personality may change in such a way that the organizational characteristic no longer meets his or her needs. However, per- sonality is inherently stable and is therefore unlikely to shift dramatically over time. Conley (1984b) demonstrated that self- opinion traits (self-esteem) are more variable than other types of personality traits, so there is the potential for a person’s self- esteem to change over time, thereby changing the level of PO ﬁt. Even in this situation, however, the resulting negative conse- quences are more likely due to a worsening of PO ﬁt than to neg- ative effects of good ﬁt.

Even if it is unlikely that good complementary personality- based PO ﬁt would have negative consequences for individuals, it is possible that poor complementary ﬁt may offer some individual- level beneﬁts. When there is a poor ﬁt between an individual’s per- sonality and organizational characteristics, turnover is only one option. For example, a risk-averse individual who is working in an

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 273

organization where a large portion of pay is at risk may put more effort into performing well so that his or her pay will be more se- cure. A person with a high need for achievement working in a ﬂat organization may learn to value lateral moves rather than just pro- motions. A different but also favorable consequence is that the per- ception of misﬁt may lead the individual to become more self-aware and seek other employment options, where his or her needs would be better fulﬁlled. Research has indicated that many people have in- accurate self-views (see Mabe & West, 1982, for a review), and incon- sistent information can lead to questioning one’s self-perceptions (Dilto & Lopez, 1992). Thus, misﬁt may afford an opportunity for development.

When personality-based PO ﬁt is assessed as the congruence between individuals and other members of the organization (sup- plementary ﬁt), somewhat different outcomes may be expected. The PO ﬁt literature generally discusses congruence (on values or personality) as having only positive consequences for the individ- ual. While we would agree with this in terms of affective outcomes (satisfaction), it may be that good ﬁt can have negative conse- quences for individual productivity depending on the type of per- formance required and the personality traits being considered. If performance involves problem solving or decision making, good ﬁt may suppress content-related conﬂict, which is necessary for high-quality decisions (Chatman, 1989). Therefore, when perfor- mance requires creativity or problem solving, poor PO personality ﬁt may offer an advantage. The type of personality trait also is likely to determine the relationship between ﬁt and productivity. For ex- ample, an individual low in conscientiousness in an environment with little emphasis on organization and details may be quite sat- isﬁed, but his or her lack of persistence is likely to lead to a low- ered level of productivity than someone who was a misﬁt because of higher conscientiousness. This example highlights the fact that the main effects for personality on performance should not be ig- nored when considering the effects of personality-based PO ﬁt on outcomes.

Furthermore, we propose that the lack of personality congru- ence with others in the organization could offer potential advan- tages for people. In the PV ﬁt area, Holland’s theory suggests a developmental value to bad ﬁt (Holland, 1985), with individuals

# 274 PERSONALITY AND WORK

learning and adjusting from bad ﬁt experiences (spending a sum- mer working in a psychiatric hospital, for example, may convince an individual to pursue other ﬁelds of psychology). As we sug- gested previously, the person who works in an organization that does not allow for expression of his or her true personality can learn a lot about himself or herself from the experience, as well as a lot to bring to future job situations. The person may decide to learn new behaviors or gain new skills to ﬁt into the company bet- ter. This may stimulate an overall increase in adaptability that would beneﬁt the person regardless of his or her organizational circumstances—as in the case of the skills that Juan in our scenario was able to garner from his poor-ﬁt situation. The literature on ex- ecutive development often points to the need for challenging or stretch opportunities as ways for individuals to grow as leaders (Hall & Mirvis, 1995).

Moos (1987) argues that we should help people select envi- ronments that promote personal maturation, not just maximize congruence. For example, it might be good to suggest to a person low in conscientiousness to work with a group of highly conscien- tious individuals. The strong environment might force this person to attend to things against his or her natural proclivities. Finally, it is possible that by having a different personality from others in the organization, an individual might draw attention to himself or her- self in a favorable way. For instance, the extraverted engineer may receive greater accolades and promotions than his or her intro- verted counterparts because of willingness to self-promote and call attention to past accomplishments. Kristof-Brown et al. (2001) pre- sented evidence from two independent samples that being differ- ent from other team members on extraversion leads individuals to view their team as more cohesive and subsequently to contribute more fully to the performance of the team.

An interesting question is whether particular types of individ- uals might seek organizations where there is less than perfect con- gruence for reasons of self-enhancement. Pervin (1992) argued that people prefer similarity where they value part of themselves but not where a nonvalued part of the self is involved. He argued that in the latter case, individuals would desire environments seen as taking them in the direction toward which they aspire. Thus, a nonconscientious individual who would like to be more conscien-

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 275

tious should prefer an environment that is conscientious. Others have noted that those with a positive self-image prefer environ- ments like their self-image and those with a negative self-image se- lect environments least like their self-image (Keon, Latack, & Wanous, 1982). Thus, low-self-esteem individuals may actually seek out poor ﬁt.

Touting the developmental value of poor personality-based PO ﬁt can be stretched only so far. Personality is stable in adulthood, so we should not expect individuals to change their dispositions after a bad-ﬁt experience. What can be changed is the ability to adapt (see the next section) and ways of coping with an incom- patible environment. As Schneider et al. (2000) have also pointed out, not only does the environment act on the person but the per- son acts on the environment. While someone may be unlikely to change his or her personality because of poor ﬁt, it is possible that the person might attempt to change the environment, with the consequences of such a change depending largely on the nature of the personality characteristic. For example, positive conse- quences would likely result for an organization from a poor-ﬁtting conscientious individual who raises standards of performance, whereas negative results might be expected for a company with a poor-ﬁtting supervisor high in neuroticism who has a negative ef- fect on the work of others. Moreover, the amount of change will likely depend on the power of the individual, with upper-level man- agers having a greater impact on the work environment than front- line employees. We encourage researchers to explore more thoroughly the factors that inﬂuence an individual’s decision to in- ﬂuence the work environment in situations of poor ﬁt.

In none of these cases are we suggesting that the individual will be more satisﬁed when there is a poor ﬁt. Instead, we propose that poor ﬁt is likely to lead to some kind of discomfort, which in turn might lead to development, self-awareness, better performance, or attention from others. The caveat is that the degree of misﬁt can- not be so extreme as to make the person withdraw or seek other employment.

Shifting the focus from the individual to the organization, we ask, “When is good PO ﬁt bad for the organization?” Schneider et al. (2000) do qualify the assertion that good ﬁt is bad for the or- ganization by noting that it may be bad for certain groups in the

# 276 PERSONALITY AND WORK

organization (top management teams), but that homogeneity for other groups (line workers with little decision-making latitude) may not be so problematic. They also note that good ﬁt may be more problematic in situations such as crises, where a diversity of view- points is important. A similar argument can be made with regard to situations requiring innovation. Chatman (1989) argued that high levels of ﬁt could lead to reduced innovation in organizations. Walsh and Holland’s review of the PV literature (1992) found neg- ative outcomes of ﬁt for problem solving and decision making, which would be in line with this prediction for PO ﬁt. Thus, good PO ﬁt of members has been suggested as bad for decision-making purposes or in decision-making contexts.

We think that this proposition may need reﬁnement for person- ality traits that involve adaptability, ﬂexibility, or openness to change. Because these traits deal speciﬁcally with the ability to change, ex- cessive levels of these traits are unlikely to lead to stultiﬁcation or strategic myopia. Indeed, the opposite effect would be expected: the organization would become highly responsive to the environ- ment. Given the rapid nature of change in today’s businesses, it is difﬁcult to see how increased responsiveness could have negative consequences for the company. As Schneider et al. (2000) noted, good ﬁt can be bad if homogeneity leads to groupthink, but it seems unlikely that homogeneity on personality characteristics dealing with ﬂexibility would create that problem.

In summary, a determination of whether personality PO ﬁt is a good thing should consider the type of ﬁt (congruence/supple- mentary versus complementary), the speciﬁc traits that are being assessed, and the outcomes (affect, performance) to be addressed. Because complementary ﬁt implies that needs are being ﬁlled, it is unlikely to generate negative consequences for individuals or or- ganizations in performance or affect. In terms of personality con- gruence, however, good PO ﬁt may result in positive individual attitudes but not have beneﬁts for productivity, depending on the traits under examination. Moreover, bad ﬁt of either type might result in positive individual consequences for both performance and affect when it leads to growth and development. For organi- zations, we agree with Schneider and colleagues that good sup- plementary ﬁt will generally lead to negative consequences in productivity. However, we suggest the caveat that when the trait has

to do with ﬂexibility, openness, or adaptability, good ﬁt might ac- tually improve organizational responsiveness and result in positive consequences for the company. Additional research is clearly needed on the individual and organizational-level consequences of good and bad personality ﬁt, with particular attention to traits that represent ﬂexibility and responsiveness and the speciﬁc out- comes of concern.

# Accuracy of Fit Perceptions

Fiona was delighted with the offer from Acme Corporation. Of all the places she interviewed at, this was the one she really resonated with, where she thought she would ﬁt best. The people she had met, as well as the organization’s literature, conveyed a sense of sophisticated, worldly, witty people—just what Fiona longed to be.

After just a short time on the job, however, Fiona was surprised at how misguided her thinking had been. She hardly got a word in at meet- ings because she was less assertive than her colleagues, so her boss felt she was “not contributing much.” She found the wittiness translated into an ofﬁce where barbs and snipes were used as put-downs. Her lack of experience and frugal lifestyle left her with little to contribute to nonwork discussions about travel abroad and the hottest restaurant in town. How could she have so misjudged her ﬁt with this workplace?

This scenario raises the question, “How accurate are people’s ﬁt self-assessments?” Given that relationships have been found be- tween PO ﬁt perceptions and outcomes (turnover, job offer ac- ceptance), it seems plausible to argue that perceptions are at least somewhat accurate. However, studies comparing subjective ﬁt to objective or actual ﬁt indicate a relatively low correlation (Cable & Judge, 1997; Kristof-Brown & Stevens, 2001). Some have argued that ﬁt perceptions are often inaccurate (Cable, Aiman-Smith, Mul- vey, & Edwards, 2000; Saks & Ashforth, 1997), particularly when in- dividuals have little information on which to form impressions (job seekers early in the search process).

We would argue that the distinction between complementary and supplementary ﬁt might be important to understanding the ac- curacy of self-perceptions. Supplementary ﬁt perceptions based on personality may often be inaccurate. Job seekers may lack “organiza- tion personality” information. Web sites, brochures, and recruiting

# 278 PERSONALITY AND WORK

activities may not convey much or even accurate information on which to judge personality congruence, even if they contain direct statements of values. The source and accuracy of the information conveyed in recruiting should inﬂuence the accuracy of supple- mentary ﬁt assessments. The realistic job preview (RJP) literature clearly attests to how the nature of information inﬂuences expecta- tions (see Phillips, 1998, for a meta-analysis); one would expect that realistic organizational previews that provide information related to personality congruence would be helpful.

Alternatively, complementary ﬁt assessments should be more accurate because they are based on objective organizational char- acteristics and self-assessments of personality. Thus, the differences already noted in ﬁndings of studies examining supplementary and complementary ﬁt based on personality may be reﬂective of the ac- curacy with which one can assess the “O” side of the ﬁt equation in these instances.

A second issue with regard to the accuracy of ﬁt assessments is the extent to which individuals are able and willing to change those assessments given feedback regarding objective ﬁt. Dineen, Ash, and Noe (2001) pursued the behavioral plasticity hypothesis with regard to self-esteem and ﬁt, which would suggest that those with low self-esteem would be more affected by ﬁt feedback when forming impressions of attraction than high self-esteem individu- als who are less behaviorally malleable. They found that high self- esteem individuals were more likely to follow their objective ﬁt regardless of whether they were given feedback regarding high or low ﬁt with the organization; individuals with low self-esteem devi- ated from their objective ﬁt when told they did not ﬁt. They did not ﬁnd a similar effect for conscientiousness. Thus, personality traits may inﬂuence how individuals respond to information about ﬁt and the extent to which they can adjust ﬁt assessments. Stated another way, are there certain types of individuals who misjudge ﬁt more often than others? Could these be individuals with less ac- curate self-assessments? Or are these individuals who look in terms of aspirations (what one would like to be) rather than what is and seek an environment that will affect the self? We expect that cer- tain individual differences are related to the accuracy of ﬁt assess- ments (self-esteem) just as they are related to the accuracy of self-assessments (Mabe & West, 1982).

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 279

It is also important to understand whether organizational rep- resentatives can accurately assess personality-based PO ﬁt. Cable and Judge (1997) found that interviewers’ assessments of appli- cants’ values and PO ﬁt were fairly inaccurate (there was a fairly small relation between actual and perceived values congruence). However, recruiters often rely on personality assessments in mak- ing ﬁt judgments (Kristof-Brown, 2000). A considerable literature shows that strangers or acquaintances can assess certain personal- ity traits with some accuracy after brief exposure to people (Al- bright, Kenny, & Malloy, 1988; Borkenau & Liebler, 1993; Colvin & Funder, 1991; Funder & Colvin, 1988; Gangestad, Simpson, Di- Geronimo, & Biek, 1992). In work with recruiters, Barrick, Patton, and Haughland (2000) found moderate correlations between in- terviewer assessments of personality traits and self-reports; however, they found that interviewers were more accurate in assessing Ex- traversion than Emotional Stability and Conscientiousness. One question would be what the relative roles of various traits are in re- cruiter ﬁt assessments. Reliance on traits that have a social com- ponent, and are thus more likely to be evident during interpersonal interactions, should have better predictive validity for ﬁt assess- ments than reliance on less accurately evaluated traits. However, it is interesting to note that in terms of overall performance, the less observable traits of Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability are better predictors (Barrick & Mount, 1991).

In summary, we suggest that personality-based ﬁt assessments that are complementary may be more accurate than those that are supplementary (evaluations of personality congruence). We fur- ther note that there are likely individual differences in the ability to self-assess ﬁt accurately. Finally, recruiter assessments of per- sonality congruence may possess some degree of accuracy for cer- tain traits.

# Adaptability and Fit

Lauren believes that we all should make the best of our situation, what- ever it is. Al believes, “to thine own self be true.” Both are organized and efﬁcient workers who avoid missing deadlines, pay attention to details, and willingly pitch in to help others. At eAcme, a growing Internet startup, Lauren initially found the lack of planning, the last-minute calls

# 280 PERSONALITY AND WORK

to work all night to meet a deadline, and the many slip-ups to be some- what of a shock. However, she applied her philosophy and learned to work within the environment, maintaining organization in what she did, but not letting the poor planning of others cause her stress (it served as a source of amusing stories over dinner with her husband). Al, in contrast, feels perpetually frustrated at work and resents having to “mop up” the problems of others. He feels an urgent need to ﬁnd a new job. What leads Lauren to be able to adapt to a poor ﬁt and Al not to?

Muchinsky and Monahan (1987) noted that whether a good ﬁt today will be a good ﬁt tomorrow depends on the stability of the variables on which matches are made. We have already noted that personality is viewed as stable in adulthood; however, today’s or- ganizational environments have been characterized as more ﬂuid than ever before, with the only constant being change (Howard, 1995; Offerman & Gowing, 1990). Organizations are seeking adaptable people so that they might be responsive to organiza- tional change (LePine, Colquitt, & Erez, 2000). Thus, the ﬁnal re- search area that we address is the relationship of adaptability to personality-based PO ﬁt.

We see a wealth of research opportunities related to the em- phasis in hiring practices on seeking both adaptability and ﬁt. First, if an organization selects adaptable individuals, how important is initial ﬁt? Would adaptable individuals simply adapt to whatever organizational environment is present? Second, in organizations where most employees have good personality-based supplementary PO ﬁt, there will be little need to adapt in terms of internal orga- nizational environments because of the homogeneity. But will the organization necessarily fail to adapt to the external environment and fail (as Schneider, 2001, suggests) if all of these good-ﬁtting employees are also high in adaptability? Third, does adaptability lead one to change oneself to increase PO ﬁt, assess environments as having good ﬁt regardless of their characteristics, or develop ef- fective strategies for coping with poor ﬁt? In terms of our scenario, why is Lauren able to adapt and Al is not?

Morrison and Hall (2001) present a model of adaptability that may prove useful for this discussion. They propose that adaptabil- ity consists of adaptive competence (the ability to change) and adaptive motivation (the willingness to change). Perhaps those high in adaptive competence may not need good ﬁt to be success-

## PERSONALITY IN PERSON-ORGANIZATION FIT RESEARCH 281

ful; they can change to ﬁt the situation. Those low in adaptive mo- tivation may need good ﬁt to be satisﬁed; they are unwilling to change to secure PO ﬁt.

Besides understanding the relationship of adaptability and personality-based PO ﬁt, we also need research on how to enhance both adaptation and PO ﬁt. The topic of adjustment and PE ﬁt is a long-standing one (Caplan & VanHarrison, 1993), with an inter- est on who generates the ways to cope with poor ﬁt, that is, the in- dividual or an imposed intervention. For example, an organization might increase ﬁt through interventions that aid self-selection, such as RJPs (Wanous, 1992), and interventions that aid adaptation, such as orientation programs (Cable & Parsons, 2001; Klein & Weaver, 2000). However, Cable and Parsons (2001) found that ﬁrms using random, variable tactics of socialization might be de- creasing values congruence, suggesting that poorly planned or poorly implemented interventions can leave individuals without the tools needed to adapt or to a worsening of ﬁt. Further research on socialization that examines how poor ﬁt can be decreased or adjusted to is needed.

There is a need to integrate research on the effects of person- ality on adaptation with that on personality-based PO ﬁt. For ex- ample, LePine et al. (2000) found that Openness to Experience was positively related to decision-making performance after change, and the dependability facets of Conscientiousness were negatively related to adaptation. This might be interpreted as suggesting that individuals low in openness or high in dependability may be less able to cope with poor-ﬁt situations than others. Alternatively, it may be that in this particular context (a decision-making task), there is low ﬁt on these traits, but they do not affect adaptation to poor ﬁt situations in general. Furthermore, as LePine et al. point out, adaptability in task performance or to planned changes may relate to different traits than adaptability in contextual behaviors or to shifting organizational missions. Thus, the role of personal- ity congruence in adaptation may be contingent on the nature of the adaptation.

In summary, we need to investigate how adaptive competence and adaptive motivation relate to adjustment to poor-ﬁt situations and responsiveness to organizational interventions to enhance ﬁt. We need to discover whether the role of personality traits in

# 282 PERSONALITY AND WORK

adaptation to change is related to personality congruence (supple- mentary ﬁt).

# Conclusion

We have raised four issues of relevance to understanding the role of personality in PO ﬁt assessments. First, we considered the ques- tion of whether personality-based PO ﬁt even matters. Because of the stability, proximity, and visibility of personality, we argue strongly that PO ﬁt on personality does matter, but that it depends on the speciﬁc type of ﬁt that is being assessed. Our review of the literature suggests that when personality-based PO ﬁt is measured as complementary ﬁt rather than personality congruence, stronger results are found.

The second question we addressed was when good PO ﬁt on personality has negative consequences and when bad PO ﬁt might actually beneﬁt individuals and organizations. In particular, we de- scribed the positive outcomes of bad ﬁt when it leads to growth and development and when good ﬁt exists on characteristics that in- volve ﬂexibility and adaptability.

Third, we considered the accuracy of personality-based PO ﬁt perceptions and concluded that again it depends on whether com- plementary or supplementary ﬁt is being considered and the spe- ciﬁc traits involved. Complementary ﬁt should be more accurately assessed because it tends to be based on personal needs and objec- tive organizational characteristics, whereas supplementary ﬁt is more contingent on accurate assessments of others’ personalities. More visible personality traits (those that involve a social compo- nent) should lead to more accurate ﬁt assessments by recruiters, coworkers, and other observers. Moreover, we suggest that individ- uals may systematically differ in the extent to which they accurately perceive ﬁt and are willing to change themselves or the environ- ment in order to increase ﬁt.

Finally, we discussed what we see as a fruitful area for future re- search: the link between personality-based PO ﬁt and adaptability. Although we do not claim to answer the four questions we set out at the beginning of the chapter, we hope that by raising them and discussing the issues that are relevant to their resolution, we will inspire further research on personality-based PO ﬁt.

# CHAPTER 11

Emerging Trends and Needs in Personality Research and Practice Beyond Main Effects Leaetta M. Hough

Changes in world economies and their workforces continue to change the world of work, and thus the practice and science of industrial/ organizational (I/O) psychology. Movement from an industrial economy to a service and information economy, globalization, dig- itization, workforce diversity, and the increasingly rapid rate of change have created work settings that require different compe- tencies and different models for understanding and explaining behavior. I/O psychologists have responded, and personality con- structs and theories have provided the content for advances in I/O thinking (Hough, 2001).

# Brief History

During a dark ages period from about 1965 to 1985, the accepted wisdom was that personality variables explained little, if any, vari- ance in outcomes of interest to I/O psychologists. Personality vari- ables played virtually no role in our ﬁeld’s models and theories of performance.

Then during the 1990s, personality variables experienced a re- naissance with a phoenix-like rise to prominence. Research surged.

# 290 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Meta-analyses that grouped personality measures into constructs, such as the Five-Factor Model (FFM) of personality, allowed previ- ously obscured relationships between personality constructs and criteria to emerge. Personality variables were related to criteria of interest. They accounted for signiﬁcant variance above and beyond cognitive variables and experience; personality variables were shown to have main effects. A renaissance occurred in the research and use of personality variables in the workplace.

Project A, the major research project in our ﬁeld during the 1980s, provided incontrovertible evidence of the importance of per- sonality variables for understanding and predicting behavior at work (see Campbell & Knapp, 2001, for a description of the proj- ect and many of its ﬁndings). Project A had a number of seminal ﬁndings:

- When validity coefﬁcients from previous validity studies are summarized according to personality constructs and criterion constructs, meaningful relationships emerge (Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, & McCloy, 1990).

- Different personality constructs predict different work perfor- mance criteria (Hough et al., 1990).

- Socially desirable responding can be detected; more impor- tant, it affects criterion-related validity minimally, if at all (Hough et al., 1990).

- Cognitive ability tests predict some performance criteria bet- ter than personality scales (for example, “can do” criteria), whereas personality scales predict other criteria better than cognitive ability tests (“will do” criteria; McHenry, Hough, Toquam, Hanson, & Ashworth, 1990).

- Accuracy of prediction increases when personality variables are combined with cognitive ability measures (McHenry et al., 1990).

- When personality variables are added to models of the deter- minants of supervisory ratings of performance, variance ex- plained increases signiﬁcantly (Borman, White, Pulakos, & Oppler, 1991).

These ﬁndings fueled interest in personality variables during the 1990s.

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 291

Barrick and Mount’s meta-analysis (1991) of the criterion- related validities of the Big Five personality variables for predict- ing performance criteria provided the next critically important set of ﬁndings that focused I/O attention on the relevance of per- sonality variables for predicting performance at work. Indeed, this meta-analysis became the most cited Personnel Psychology article in the 1990s (Hollenbeck, 1998). The Project A ﬁndings, the Barrick and Mount meta-analysis, and earlier research by such eminent personality psychologists as Paul Costa, Lew Goldberg, Harrison Gough, Robert Hogan, Douglas Jackson, Robert McCrae, and Auke Tellegen provided a solid foundation for the renaissance of personality variables in I/O in the 1990s.

# Change in Models of Work Performance

The nature of work and work performance has changed dramati- cally (Howard, 1995; Ilgen & Pulakos, 1999). Virtually all aspects of work and many worker requirements have changed. Much more than ever before, work is team based, service and information ori- ented, and digital. Organizations and teams are ﬂatter, even vir- tual. The job description, reﬂecting a stable description of the job incumbent’s duties and responsibilities, is no longer a ubiquitous phenomenon. Stable job descriptions still exist in many settings, but most work settings today require ﬂexibility and quick response to rapidly changing business conditions. Our theories and models needed, and still need, a different set of variables.

# Early Models of Performance

Hunter (1983) meta-analytically investigated the relationships among three variables: cognitive ability, job knowledge, and per- formance (measured with work samples and supervisory ratings). Path analyses supported a causal model in which cognitive ability is indirectly related to supervisory ratings of performance through its direct effects on job knowledge and work sample performance (both directly related to supervisory ratings of performance). Job knowledge is directly related to both work sample performance and supervisory ratings of performance. Hunter (1983) recognized

# 292 PERSONALITY AND WORK

that other factors “account for a very large part of the variation in ratings” (p. 265).

Guion (1983) critiqued Hunter’s model (1983), concluding that “although Hunter has found some validity for ratings, he has not found much” (p. 269). Guion suggested that the model should be enlarged to include characteristics of ratees (appearance, an- noyance syndrome, frequency of communication with a supervi- sor, and interpersonal skill), characteristics of raters (bigotry, cognitive complexity, and leadership roles), and context variables (level of peer performance, quality of equipment and material, and incentives).

Nonetheless, the next major addition to the causal model was job experience (opportunity to learn). Schmidt, Hunter, and Out- erbridge (1986) added this variable to their causal model of the determinants of performance, ﬁnding it had a role similar to cog- nitive ability: an indirect effect on supervisory ratings of job per- formance through its direct effect on both job knowledge and work sample performance.

# Later Models of Performance

Although personality constructs were not among the variables in Hunter’s model (1983), Guion’s enlarged model (1983), or Schmidt et al.’s expanded model (1986), they now play prominent roles in theories and models of the determinants of work performance.

# Broad Models

Using Project A data, Borman et al. (1991) partially conﬁrmed Hunter’s model (1983), but accounted for more than twice the variance in ratings with a model that added achievement orienta- tion, dependability, awards, and disciplinary actions (for problem behavior). In this expanded model, achievement orientation and dependability had both a direct inﬂuence on supervisory ratings and an indirect inﬂuence through their substantial effects on awards and disciplinary actions, respectively. The analyses demon- strated the importance of personality constructs as determinants of supervisory ratings of performance and highlighted the role of dependability in the acquisition of job knowledge.

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 293

Additional personality variables were included in the Borman, White, and Dorsey (1995) model. They identiﬁed four personality factors—dependability, friendly, obnoxious, and show-off—and ex- amined their effects, as well as the effects of cognitive ability, job knowledge, technical proﬁciency, and performance ratings, on su- pervisory and peer ratings. Dependability inﬂuenced performance as it had in the Borman et al. (1991) study. Friendly (or agreeable- ness) did not inﬂuence overall performance ratings provided by either supervisors or peers, whereas obnoxious inﬂuenced (nega- tively) peer ratings of overall performance but not supervisor rat- ings, and show-off inﬂuenced peer ratings of overall performance (positive correlation, acting perhaps as suppressor variable) but not supervisor ratings. With the inclusion of the three personality variables—dependability, show-off (a compound variable consist- ing of high Extraversion and low Agreeableness according to Hough & Ones, 2001), and obnoxious—variance accounted for in supervisor ratings of overall job performance was approximately twice that accounted for by the Hunter (1983) model and more than two and a half times for peer ratings.

The Borman et al. models (1991, 1995) are certainly improve- ments over the Hunter (1983) and Schmidt et al. (1986) models. Nonetheless, even the Borman et al. models are hampered by the kinds of jobs studied, use of overall job performance as the outcome variable (albeit a carefully developed criterion), and inadequate the- ory. The Borman et al. (1995) study examined determinants of su- pervisory and peer ratings of overall job performance of soldiers in ﬁve military jobs: infantrymen, armor crew members, radio tele- type operators, light wheel vehicle mechanics, and medical spe- cialists. (The Borman et al., 1991, study also included only soldiers in military jobs.) Borman et al. studied the determinants of the performance as measured by raters, hence the thought that ratee agreeableness might be relevant.

However, a good theory about the determinants of overall per- formance in military jobs is not likely to include ratee agreeable- ness as a determinant. Meta-analytic evidence existing at the time indicated that across jobs, agreeableness is not related to overall job performance (Barrick & Mount, 1991; Hough, 1992; Hough et al., 1990), and even more important for military jobs, agreeableness is not related to combat effectiveness but rugged individualism is

# 294 PERSONALITY AND WORK

(Hough, 1992). Rather than demonstrating that agreeableness is not a determinant of performance, the Borman et al. (1995) study demonstrates that ratee agreeableness is not a factor in inﬂuenc- ing subjective ratings of overall performance made by peers or su- pervisors of several military jobs. If, instead of military jobs, civilian jobs involving signiﬁcant customer contact had been studied, agreeableness might have been a causal factor in determining over- all performance (Frei & McDaniel, 1998; Hurtz & Donovan, 2000; Mount, Barrick, & Stewart, 1998). If instead of overall perfor- mance, teamwork had been the outcome variable, ratee agree- ableness might have been a causal factor in determining soldier performance (Hough, 1992; Mount et al., 1998; Neuman & Wright, 1999), especially since it was a garrisoned force. Our theories, and hence our models, need to be more speciﬁc yet more integrative in terms of causal and outcome variables.

More Speciﬁc Models Theories with more speciﬁc independent, dependent, and inter- vening variables, type and form of the relationships, and situational variables that moderate or deﬁne the limits of generalizability are needed. A step in the right direction is Motowidlo, Borman, and Schmit’s framework (1997) for a theory of individual differences in task and contextual performance. Although they do not specify the precise variables and relationships, they do describe in general the kinds of variables and their roles in determining two types of per- formance. Similarly, Robertson and Callinan (1998) provide a frame- work for a theory of speciﬁc determinants of performance that incorporates genetic and perceptual factors as well. These frame- works provide useful guides to future theory building and research.

# New Directions: Dependent Variables

We make many choices when building models and conducting re- search. An especially important set of choices involves the outcome variables, that is, the dependent or criterion variables in our mod- els. The relationships between personality variables and a wide va- riety of criteria have been examined. Most of our research and hence knowledge relates to individual-level performance variables,

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 295

although research with teams has focused our attention on group- level performance variables as well. In addition, our theories and models need to be sensitive to change in performance over time (the dynamic criteria), hence changes in relationships between variables over time (Hough & Oswald, 2000), as well as differences that may be due to other characteristics of criteria, such as typical versus maximum performance.

# Individual-Level Performance Variables

Although research examining the determinants of overall job per- formance is extremely important, the array of other criterion vari- ables relevant to the world of work is enormous. In addition to overall job performance, personality variables have main effects on a variety of other important outcome variables. Examples are coun- terproductive behavior, contextual performance, task perfor- mance, educational and training outcomes, career success, life satisfaction, job satisfaction, accidents, stress, decision making under stress, goal setting, conﬂict attributions, workplace aggres- sion, evading capture by the enemy, leadership, embracing and adapting to change, entrepreneurial risk taking, innovation and creativity, job search behavior, job offers, tenure, work-family bal- ance, and volunteerism. Meta-analyses have been performed in sev- eral of these areas. Hough and Furnham (2003) provide a list of meta-analytic ﬁndings summarized according to personality con- struct and criterion construct. Taken together, the results demon- strate the importance of matching predictor constructs with criterion constructs, the importance of a variety of personality vari- ables other than the Big Five, and useful levels of criterion-related validity of personality variables for many important workplace cri- teria in both military and civilian settings.

With the increasingly rapid rate of change in the workplace, the importance of other criteria such as initiating, embracing, and adapting to change, change leadership, decision making in rapidly evolving situations, and innovation is greater today than yesterday, and their importance will not diminish anytime soon. The chang- ing world of work requires that criterion constructs such as these become part of our models.

# 296 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Besides criteria such as overall job performance, our models need to include other broad, individual-level criteria such as work adjustment, training, and career success. In addition, our perfor- mance models need to incorporate speciﬁc individual-level per- formance criteria.

# Group-Level Performance Variables

Research with teams has advanced our thinking about the impor- tance of and differential prediction of group-level outcomes, but we have barely skimmed the surface. Jackson (1992) identiﬁed six types of team effectiveness outcomes: creative decision making, problem solving, task execution, internal group processes, group stability, and external liaison. Cohen and Bailey (1997) categorized team effectiveness criteria into somewhat different categories: per- formance, attitudinal, and behavioral outcomes. In their sum- maries, Jackson (1992) and Cohen and Bailey (1997) reviewed previous research, concluding that criterion type moderated the relationship between predictor variables and team effectiveness. Perhaps a hierarchical (or nested) taxonomy that integrates both sets of group-level criteria (Jackson’s and Cohen and Bailey’s) would be useful.

A test of a multilevel model found that group-level processes affect group-level creativity; they moderate the relationship be- tween aggregated individual creativity (group-level predictor) and group-level creativity (Taggar, 2002). Emerging evidence also sug- gests that individual- and group-level personality characteristics pre- dict different individual- and group-level performance variables and have different types and forms of relationships with group-level performance variables as compared with individual-level perfor- mance variables. These complex ﬁndings are described in some- what more detail later in this chapter.

# Dynamic Criteria

Our models need to reﬂect the changing nature of within- individual job performance over time, hence change in the rela- tive contributions of the determinants of performance. Using a la- tent growth curve framework, Ployhart and Hakel (1998) examined

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 297

personality predictors of interindividual differences in latent in- traindividual sales performance. Self-assessed empathy was mod- erately and positively related to initial performance and rate of performance improvement and negatively related to performance decrements (absolute r ranged from .15 to .21), whereas self- assessed persuasiveness was positively related to initial performance, rate of improvement, and performance decrement (r ranged from .10 to .15). Although complex, the ﬁndings are sensible. Empathic salespeople relate to and understand their clients’ needs, whereas use of persuasive tactics ultimately alienates clients. In this study, although the predictor-criterion relationships did not appear to change over time, performance did, demonstrating the impor- tance of incorporating links between predictors and temporal per- formance variability in our models of performance.

## Typical Versus Maximum Performance Criteria

Another important characteristic of performance criteria is whether they are maximum or typical performance indicators. Ac- cording to Sackett, Zedeck, and Fogli (1988), three characteristics distinguish maximum from typical performance measures: short time duration of performance, evaluative context, and acceptance of the challenge to perform maximally. Not surprisingly, person- ality variables relate differently to criteria that are categorized as maximum or typical based on these three characteristics. Open- ness to Experience, for example, is most predictive of maximum transformational leadership performance criteria, whereas Emo- tional Stability is most predictive of typical transformational lead- ership criteria, with Extraversion predictive of both (Ployhart, Lim, & Chan, 2001).

Most personality scales are regarded as measures of typical be- havior and as such might be expected to correlate with measures of typical rather than maximum performance criteria. The Ploy- hart et al. (2001) study indicates that is an overly simplistic ex- pectation. Speculating on other possible examples, the predictors of decision-making quality (typical performance criterion) versus decision-making quality under stress or in rapidly changing cir- cumstances (maximum performance criterion) may differ. Emo- tional Stability (reaction to stress) may predict quality of decision

# 298 PERSONALITY AND WORK

making under duress but not under normal circumstances. Our models should incorporate the distinction between maximum and typical performance criteria.

# New Directions: Independent Variables

Another important set of choices we make when building models and conducting research is the independent variables we include. Compound variables, newly important Big Five variables such as Openness to Experience, variables more speciﬁc than Big Five vari- ables, non–Big Five variables (such as interest and emotion), group-level personality variables, and situational variables (such as type of task/team/job, ﬁt, and culture) have received some atten- tion. They deserve more.

## Compound Personality (Predictor) Variables

Compound variables, deﬁned by Hough and Schneider (1996) as a combination of basic personality traits that do not necessarily co- vary, have rapidly become a new frontier of personality research. There are a number of examples of insights gained about impor- tant work-related outcomes and the role of compound variables in those outcomes:

- Fox and Spector (1999) in their study of work frustration and aggression

- Penner and his colleagues (Penner & Finkelstein, 1998; Pen- ner, Fritzsche, Craiger, & Freifeld, 1995; Penner, Midili, & Kegglemeyer, 1997) in their study of prosocial personality • Bateman, Crant, Seibert, and Kraimer (Bateman & Crant, 1993; Crant, 1995; Seibert, Crant, & Kraimer, 1999; Seibert, Kraimer, & Crant, 2001) in their study of the proactive person- ality variable

- Judge and his colleagues (Erez & Judge, 2001; Judge & Bono, 2001a, 2001b; Judge, Locke, Durham, & Kluger, 1998) in their study of core self-evaluations

- Leach (2002) in his study of soldiers who evade capture by the enemy

- Ones, Viswesvaran, and Schmidt (1993) in their meta-analysis of integrity scales

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 299

- Frei and McDaniel (1998) in their meta-analysis of customer service scales

- Ones and Viswesvaran (2001) in their study of criterion-focused occupational scales

- Ones, Hough, and Viswesvaran (1998) in their meta-analysis of managerial potential scales

- R. Schneider and his colleagues (R. Schneider, Ackerman, & Kanfer, 1996; R. Schneider, Roberts, & Heggestad, 2002) in their study of social competence

- Sternberg and his colleagues (Kihlstrom & Cantor, 2000; Sternberg, 1985) in their study of social intelligence

- Goleman (1995, 1998) and Salovey and Mayer and their col- leagues (Salovey & Mayer, 1990; Mayer & Salovey, 1993, 1997; Mayer, Salovey, & Caruso, 2000) in the area of emotional intelligence

One of the risks of the proliferation of compound variables is the return to the chaotic situation of the dark ages in which we lacked an understanding of the taxonomic structure of personal- ity variables and, hence, the relationships among personality vari- ables. We do not want to return to the “good old daze” (Hough, 1997, p. 233). We can avoid such chaos if we do our homework re- searching the nomological nets of our compound variables to un- derstand their relationships to more basic personality variables. For example, do the compound variables proactive personality and core self-evaluation consist of the same basic personality variables? Similarly, do the compound variables social competence, social in- telligence, and emotional intelligence consist of the same basic per- sonality variables? The research examining the nomological net of integrity tests and customer service scales is instructive. These two compound variables consist of the same Big Five factors but in dif- ferent concentrations (Ones & Viswesvaran, 1996, 1998).

More research on the nomological nets of compound variables is needed. We need to form compound variables with an under- standing of their construct validity—their nomological nets—so that we can form new compound variables to predict behavior in work settings that represent unique conﬁgurations of work re- quirements and situations (Hough, 2001; Hough & Furnham, 2003). Hough and Ones (2001) provide a structure for categoriz- ing, examining, and understanding compound variables using the

# 300 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Big Five factors and their facets. This structure can help integrate our research with compound variables into bodies of knowledge, thereby enhancing understanding of personality variables and their many roles in work settings. A “back to the future” scenario must be avoided.

## Openness to Experience (Big Five Predictor Variable)

This variable will play an increasingly important role in explaining behavior in a world of work characterized by diversity and rapid change. However, as currently deﬁned, it is too amorphous and het- erogeneous. The conceptual underpinning of the Openness to Ex- perience factor includes components such as culture, inquiring intellect, intellectance (intelligent, perceptive, knowledgeable, ana- lytical), absorption (capacity for absorbed and self-altering atten- tion), regression in service of the ego, emotional sensitivity, aesthetic interests, liberalism, independence, independent judgment, intel- lectual ﬂexibility, emotional ﬂexibility, depth and intensity of atten- tion, scope of awareness, tender-mindedness, imagination, sensation seeking, rebelliousness, nonconforming, unusual thought pro- cesses, and preference for complexity (McCrae & Costa, 1997a). An example of the confusion surrounding the Openness construct is present even in the gold standard of Big Five personality inven- tories, the Revised NEO Personality Inventory (NEO PI-R; Costa & McCrae, 1992). The NEO facet excitement seeking, thought by some to be a part of Openness, is instead a part of the NEO Ex- traversion scale. In the NEO PI-R, Openness consists of six facets— fantasy, aesthetics, feelings, actions, ideas, and values—with a subscale to measure each.

Although Openness to Experience is the most controversial and debatable of the ﬁve Big Five factors (Digman, 1990), it is an important construct. However, it is too heterogeneous for com- municating ﬁndings effectively. Many of the components and facets correlate differently with criteria; many undoubtedly play differ- ent types of roles in explaining behavior. A theme of openness is apparent in several of the components of Openness; nonetheless, some of the components are likely to warrant status as separate constructs. Our models of performance will improve when the nomological nets (construct validity) of the components of Open- ness to Experience have been better explicated.

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 301

# Non–Big Five Predictor Variables

Personality variables that are more speciﬁc than Big Five factors or simply not included in the Big Five are also important. An exam- ple of insights gained about important outcome variables and the role of a speciﬁc personality variable not a part of the Big Five is work by Stewart and Roth (2001) in their meta-analysis of risk propensity of entrepreneurs. Risk propensity is greater for entre- preneurs than managers; even larger differences exist between ven- ture- or growth-focused entrepreneurs and family income-focused entrepreneurs. A provocative study by Douglas and Martinko (2001) found that trait anger, attribution style, negative affectivity, attitudes toward revenge, self-control, and previous exposure to ag- gressive cultures (several non–Big Five personality variables) ac- counted for 62 percent of the variance in self-reported workplace aggression. (For a list of other variables not well represented in the Big Five, see Hough and Furnham, 2003.)

Entire domains of variables are not well represented in the Big Five and need to be incorporated into our taxonomy of personal- ity variables and theories about performance. In this section, two such domains—interests and emotions—are described and their importance portrayed.

# Interests

Research with Holland’s hexagon model (1985) of personality types (RIASEC, that is, Realistic, Investigative, Artistic, Social, En- terprising, Conventional), their overlap with the Big Five factors of personality, and their usefulness in predicting important work criteria has been growing among I/O psychologists. Although the Big Five is the favored personality taxonomy of many I/O psy- chologists for examining relationships between personality vari- ables and individual work performance, Holland’s RIASEC types play important roles in theories of team performance (Muchinsky, 1999) and, hence, group-level work performance.

Researchers examining the overlap between Holland’s six per- sonality types and the Big Five factors have come to different conclu- sions. Larson and Borgen (2002) concluded that only three Holland themes—Artistic, Enterprising, and Investigative—are consistently related to Big Five factors. Ackerman and Heggestad (1997), how- ever, in their summary of relations between personality and interest

# 302 PERSONALITY AND WORK

variables, concluded that three of the Big Five—Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Openness to Experience—correlate moderately with Holland’s interest themes, and all of the RIASEC themes are rep- resented, at least at the facet level, in the Big Five. A meta-analysis to determine more precisely the overlap between personality and interest variables would be informative.

However, even if much of the variance in Holland’s RIASEC per- sonality types is shown to overlap with Big Five factors, research that has examined the criterion-related validity of Holland interest and Big Five personality variables indicates that they predict different types of work-related outcomes. De Fruyt and Mervielde (1999) found that the Holland RIASEC personality types and the Big Five personality factors differed in their validity for predicting employ- ment status (employed versus unemployed) and nature of em- ployment (type of job). RIASEC types were clearly superior in ex- plaining the type of work in which participants were employed (re- alistic, artistic), whereas Extraversion and Conscientiousness (Big Five factors) were superior in predicting employment status, such as employed or unemployed. If Hough’s nomological-web cluster- ing approach (Hough & Ones, 2001) were used to investigate the taxonomic structure of the two sets of variables, an expanded tax- onomy of personality variables would undoubtedly emerge to ac- count for the different nomological nets of these variables.

Emotion and Affect Emotionality, emotional expressivity, emotional regulation, and af- fectivity variables are important for understanding work behavior. Research on the subject has burgeoned. Theories (Weiss & Cro- panzano, 1996), books (Ashkanasy, Hartel, & Zerbe, 2000; Lewis & Haviland-Jones, 2000; Lord, Klimoski, & Kanfer, 2002), journals (Emotion), special issues of journals, and hundreds of articles on the subject exist. Emotionality and affectivity play a role in models re- lated to satisfaction (Judge & Hulin, 1993), leadership (Glomb & Hulin, 1997), organizational citizenship behavior and workplace deviance (Lee & Allen, 2002), workplace violence (Glomb, Steel, & Arvey, 2002), counterproductive behavior (Iverson & Deery, 2001), voluntary work behavior (Spector & Fox, 2002), happiness (Diener, 2000), and burnout (Brotheridge & Grandey, 2002; T. Wright & Cropanzano, 1998), to name just a few. (See Chapter Five, this vol- ume, for more information about personality and affect.)

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 303

The differences among emotion, affect, mood, and personal- ity traits need to be clariﬁed. Lord and Kanfer (2002), for exam- ple, argue that emotions are different from mood, although affect, which they consider to be a more general term than emotion, can be either a mood or an emotion. Plutchik (1997) argues that emo- tion and personality variables are part of the same domain. Averill (1997) believes that emotions are characterized by three prototypic features—passivity (beyond personal control, almost), intention- ality (focused), and subjectivity (inner experiences)—and are or- ganized by researchers categorically (and often hierarchically, using terms such as sadness, pain, fear, and anxiety at the generic level) or dimensionally with two bipolar dimensions repeatedly used: evalu- ation (negative-positive) and activation (aroused-unaroused). He argues that personality traits play a prominent role in emotion and are at a higher (broader) level than emotions in the hierarchy of behavior. In spite of the already excellent thinking in this area, more research is needed to clarify the relationships among vari- ables in this (enlarged) domain.

## Group-Level Personality Predictor Variables

The results of the few studies that have examined the relationships of group-level personality variables with individual- and group-level criteria are provocative. Fascinating results are emerging. For ex- ample, (1) dyad (group) levels of Extraversion and Conscien- tiousness correlate with relationship conﬂict, (2) although dyad levels of Conscientiousness correlate with relationship conﬂict, dif- ferences between dyad members in levels of Conscientiousness do not, and (3) Agreeableness and Openness correlate with relation- ship conﬂict at the individual level, although the strongest effects are at the dyad level (Bono, Boles, Judge, & Lauver, 2002). In an- other study, teams higher in Conscientiousness, Agreeableness, Ex- traversion, and Emotional Stability received higher ratings on team (group level) performance, and teams higher on Extraversion and Emotional Stability received higher ratings on team (group level) viability (Barrick, Stewart, Neubert, & Mount, 1998). Using a con- junctive task, Neuman and Wright (1999) found that group-level Agreeableness and Conscientiousness predicted objective and sub- jective indicators of group-level (team) performance. Group-level Conscientiousness has both main and interaction effects on outcome

# 304 PERSONALITY AND WORK

variables (LePine, Hollenbeck, Ilgen, & Hedlund, 1997). In addi- tion, type of task may moderate the relationships. For example, group-level Extraversion appears to be related curvilinearly to team performance on creative problem-solving tasks (Barry & Stewart, 1997) and linearly to team performance on compensatory tasks (Barrick et al., 1998). Although the complexities of the relation- ships are almost overwhelming, they must be reﬂected in our mod- els of performance.

The research in this area highlights the importance of con- ducting a mission analysis (akin to job analysis at the individual level) that takes into account required group-level (team) compe- tencies, group-level criterion variables, type and form of the rela- tionships, and situational variables. Studies in this area also highlight the difﬁculties of operationalizing group-level predictor variables.

# Situational Variables

Hattrup and Jackson’s plea (1996) for learning about individual dif- ferences by taking situations seriously has been taken seriously. The once extreme positions of early situationism and trait psychology are today blended; even Mischel has modiﬁed his position (Mischel, Shoda, & Mendoza-Denton, 2002). The importance of both indi- vidual differences (especially personality variables) and situations is now recognized, and it is nowhere more apparent than in the study of teams—their composition and their effectiveness. Situa- tions can interact with individual differences in personality, differ- entially eliciting cooperative and competitive behavior (Graziano, Hair, & Finch, 1997). Situations can mediate and moderate the ef- fects of personality variables on outcome variables. The growing awareness that an individual’s ﬁt with the environment affects work adjustment is a clear recognition of the importance of situations.

The following variables incorporate the situation into their de- ﬁnition or measurement: type of task, type of team, type of job, cul- ture, research setting, and ﬁt. (See Chapter Ten, this volume, for a discussion of ﬁt between the individual and the organization.) Each of these “situations” can interact with independent variables in our models to affect dependent variables. These situations also act as moderator and mediator variables as well.

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 305

Type of Task Steiner (1972) developed a set of task types (additive, compen- satory, conjunctive, and disjunctive) that potentially moderates re- sults and is thus helpful in organizing research ﬁndings. If another task type—creative—were added to Steiner’s set, the differences in the Barrick et al. (1998) and Barry and Stewart (1997) results would be conﬁrming rather than seemingly conﬂicting. Speciﬁcally, Bar- rick et al. (1998), working with manufacturing teams (primarily compensatory tasks), found that Conscientiousness (as well as Agreeableness, Extraversion, and Emotional Stability) predicted team performance. Barry and Stewart (1997), working with teams involved in creative problem-solving tasks, found that Conscien- tiousness did not predict team performance. Given the ﬁnding that dependability (one facet of Conscientiousness) correlates nega- tively with criteria involving creative tasks (Hough, 1992), these re- sults, when organized according to a revised Steiner taxonomy, demonstrate that task type moderates the relationship between predictor (personality) variables and team effectiveness. We need additional research on the taxonomic structure of tasks to better deﬁne the boundaries beyond which our results do not generalize.

Type of Team Cohen and Bailey (1997) reviewed research on teams conducted between 1990 and 1996, concluding that type of team (work teams, parallel teams, project teams, and management teams) moderated relationships between independent and dependent variables. Other classiﬁcations of teams exist (Gibson & Kirkman, 1999; Kli- moski & Jones, 1995). Perhaps instead of types of teams, we need a set of independent variables on which teams vary that can be used to proﬁle team situations. Such a set of variables would be helpful in increasing the precision of our theories and models.

Type of Job or Job Characteristic In addition to more team-based work settings, also more common are customer service jobs requiring interpersonal skill and au- tonomous work settings, all of which have been shown to moderate relationships between personality variables and performance. For example, degree of interpersonal interaction is a job characteristic that moderates relations between personality characteristics and

# 306 PERSONALITY AND WORK

performance (Frei & McDaniel, 1998; MacLane, 1996; Mount et al., 1998). Another example of a job characteristic that can mod- erate relationships between personality characteristics and per- formance is autonomy. In managerial jobs, degree of job autonomy moderates the validity of Conscientiousness, Extraversion, and Agreeableness (Barrick & Mount, 1993). Conscientiousness and Extraversion are more highly positively correlated with perfor- mance in high-autonomy jobs than in low-autonomy jobs; Agree- ableness is more highly negatively correlated with performance in high-autonomy jobs than in low-autonomy jobs. This study high- lights the importance of situations and their impact on both the type (moderator) and direction (positive versus negative) of rela- tionships in our models.

Researchers conducting meta-analyses often summarize validi- ties within job (manager, police ofﬁcer, sales job), and often va- lidities are found to differ depending on the job. However, the number of jobs in any economy is enormous, and in today’s econ- omy, many are changing. Building separate theories about the de- terminants of performance for each job is unhelpful to the science and practice of I/O psychology. Theory building requires better strategies to deﬁne situations.

Some researchers have used Holland’s RIASEC model as a tax- onomic structure for classifying work environments and educa- tional specialty. When criterion-related validities of personality variables are examined within the six job types, validities differ, in- dicating the importance of type of job as a moderator variable (Fritzsche, McIntire, & Yost (2002; Hogan, Hogan, & Roberts, 1996). Hough and Furnham (2003), however, provide a caution to this interpretation. They suggest that if, instead of overall job performance, speciﬁc performance constructs were the criteria, the apparent moderating effects of the RIASEC job types would disappear.

# Fit

Instead of conceptualizing the work environment as a moderator variable, many researchers have conceptualized its role in terms of ﬁt between the individual and the environment. “Fit” indexes thus involve measurement of both the individual and the situation, re- sulting in a variable indicating degree of congruence between the

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 307

two in terms of some set of variables. When ﬁt concepts are part of a model, interest and cognitive ability variables are often included (Dawis & Lofquist, 1984; Gottfredson, 1986). Personality variables are now playing a more important role. De Fruyt (2002), for ex- ample, concluded that when RIASEC person-environment ﬁt in- dexes include Big Five personality variables, predictive validity increases. (See Chapter Ten, this volume, for a thorough discus- sion of ﬁt.)

The concept of ﬁt is not new; it is fundamental in vocational counseling and personnel psychology (Dawis and Lofquist’s the- ory of work adjustment [1984], Holland’s theory of vocational choice [1985], Gottfredson’s occupational aptitude patterns map [1986]), as well as in organizational psychology (B. Schneider’s attraction—selection—attrition cycle [1987]). Nonetheless, more careful and complete integration of congruence and ﬁt concepts in our models is needed. For example, the emphasis on classifying jobs into types or categories in some theories is unwise. Tax- onomies of jobs (job types or job families) require a stable envi- ronment, an essentially unchanging work environment. Given the changing nature of the world of work, any model we build that in- corporates job types is akin to building a sandcastle. Such models are destined to be temporary, unable to stand the test of time. In- stead, our models should incorporate individual difference vari- ables and work difference variables, not person types or job types. Fit indexes should be based on proﬁle or pattern analyses, not type analyses.

# Culture

The world of work is multinational and multicultural. Culture moderates, mediates, and interacts with personality in complex ways to affect performance, and this added complexity of cultural plurality must be reﬂected in our performance models. Its impor- tance is demonstrated in a study of the different inﬂuences of per- sonality variables on life satisfaction in two individualistic and three collectivistic cultures (Schimmack, Radhakrishnan, Oishi, Dzokoto, & Ahadi, 2002). Research on the determinants of expatriate per- formance is another example where the importance of culture (for example, adjusting to an environment other than one’s own) is ac- knowledged. Culture is important in ways other than adjusting to

# 308 PERSONALITY AND WORK

it. Leadership, for example, is affected by culture (House, Wright, & Aditya, 1997).

Incorporating culture into our performance models requires that we describe culture on a set of dimensions. A good taxonomy of cultural variables is required. House et al. (1997) reviewed cross- cultural differences and concluded that Hofstede’s four constructs (power distance, uncertainty avoidance, individualism versus col- lectivism, and masculinity versus femininity; 1980) were the most useful for describing and differentiating cultures. Recently, Hof- stede and his colleagues (Hofstede et al., 1998) proposed many more constructs. Triandis and Suh (2002) suggested a hierarchi- cal structure consisting of four—complexity, tightness, collectivism, and individualism—at the highest level, with subdimensions, such as vertical and horizontal, within the broader dimensions of col- lectivism and individualism. These cultural variables need to be in- corporated into our models of performance if we expect to understand the conditions under which our models are accurate portraits of the determinants of performance.

An important issue when studying personality and culture is the structure of personality across cultures. Proponents of the Big Five argue for the universal nature of the ﬁve factors, citing as evi- dence similarity of factor structures of Big Five personality ques- tionnaires administered in different cultures and languages (McCrae & Costa, 1997b). Recently, however, Big Five researchers have acknowledged that the ﬁt is better in some countries than in others and recommend that more attention be given to middle- level personality constructs (Saucier & Goldberg, 2001), a point of view I have long advocated.

Research Setting Student settings are often used to test our theories with the hope that the results will generalize to work settings. Recent ﬁndings re- iterate the importance of ensuring that our ﬁndings do generalize to work or applied settings. For example, evidence of the fake- ability of personality inventories is clear, and the magnitude of dis- tortion in directed faking studies is signiﬁcant (Ones, Viswesvaran, & Reiss, 1996). However, in actual applicant settings, intentional distortion is less signiﬁcant, and although criterion-related validi- ties are signiﬁcantly lower in directed faking studies, validities are higher in applicant settings, indeed similar to the level of validity

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 309

obtained in incumbent settings (Hough, 1998a). Another exam- ple of the tenuous nature of generalizing from student settings to work (business) settings is research on the personality correlates of leadership behavior. In business settings, conscientiousness cor- related .05 (corrected) with leadership, whereas in student settings, conscientiousness correlated .36, corrected (Judge, Bono, Ilies, & Werner, 2002). Research setting is a potential moderator variable that our meta-analyses should routinely incorporate into the cod- ing scheme and analyses.

## New Directions: Types of Relationships and Roles for Personality Variables

Although many, if not most, of our models portray personality vari- ables as having main effects, personality variables have moderator, mediator, suppressor, and interaction effects as well. Moreover, the direction (positive, negative) and form (linear, curvilinear, con- ﬁgural) vary depending on a variety of variables. For example, re- search on the determinants of team performance indicates that a relationship between a personality variable and an outcome vari- able may be curvilinear in one situation and linear in another, as in creative problem-solving tasks versus compensatory tasks (Barry & Stewart, 1997; Barrick et al., 1998). Moreover, interpersonal in- teraction can affect outcomes. For example, personality charac- teristics of team members can interact with those of the leader to determine team performance (LePine et al., 1997). Team-based and customer service work settings are interpersonal in nature and are thus dynamic within short episodes of interactions as well as over time. The form and type of relationships between personality variables and outcome measures are thus also likely to change over time. These are but a few examples of the complex nature of the type, form, and direction of relationships of personality variables with other variables in our models.

# Other New Directions

Our research and model building are changing in other ways as well. For example, researchers are examining and proposing different personality theories and taxonomies. Researchers have gained new insights about the measurement of personality variables, and new

# 310 PERSONALITY AND WORK

methods have emerged. In addition, the social, demographic, and legal environment has changed, with personality variables playing a prominent role.

## Other Personality Theories and Taxonomies

Much of the I/O research investigating the role of personality in affecting workplace behavior is based on a hierarchical model of trait variables, speciﬁcally, the FFM (often referred to as the Big Five) identiﬁed through analysis of lexical terms (language). (For a review of the advantages and disadvantages of this model of per- sonality from an I/O perspective as well as other hierarchical mod- els, see R. Schneider & Hough, 1995; Hough & Schneider, 1996; and Chapter One, this volume.)

Many other models of the structure of personality variables exist. One of the more recent approaches to developing a taxon- omy of personality variables is Hough’s nomological-web cluster- ing approach (Hough & Ones, 2001). Hough and Ones call for research and reﬁnement of the initial set of constructs, arguing that once I/O has an understanding of the nomological webs of personality variables, compound variables can be synthesized to predict behavior in a rapidly changing work world with unique conﬁgurations of criterion (performance) constructs. Other struc- tural models integrate emotion and personality (Plutchik, 1997) and interpersonal behavior (Wiggins, 1980) into a circumplex structure. The ﬁeld of personality psychology has many theories of personality as well. Already, our models incorporate motiva- tional forces as part of our deﬁnition of personality, forces that ac- tivate and energize behavior. Our models of performance will beneﬁt from greater use of some of these other personality theo- ries. (See Hogan, Johnson, & Briggs, 1997, and Roberts & Hogan, 2001, for an in-depth review of personality theories and their rel- evance to I/O.)

# Measurement Methods

With the surge in research with personality variables has come a renewed interest in improving our measurement strategies, un- derstanding the threats to the accuracy of our measurement, and

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 311

developing entirely new ways of measuring personality variables. A focus on the content of the individual item (referred to as item frame of reference) and bandwidth issues reﬂects interest in im- proving the validity of self- or other-report measures of personality. A focus on the cross-cultural applicability of our measures reﬂects the reality of globalization and its impact on our measures and gen- eralizability of our models. Different sets of instructions to test tak- ers are now recognized as a way to affect validity and decrease intentional distortion. New content, new constructs, and new modes of measurement have emerged.

Item Frame of Reference A growing body of evidence indicates that specifying the context or situation portrayed in items moderates validity. Responses to complete sentences that provide context yield higher criterion- related validities than adjectives (Cellar, Miller, Doverspike, & Klawsky, 1996). Items that provide context by describing the situa- tion yield higher criterion-related validities, lower error variances, and more accurate differentiation among groups than items that ask about feelings or behavior in general (Schmit, Ryan, Stierwalt, & Powell, 1995; Robie, Schmit, Ryan, & Zickar, 2000; J. Wright, Lindgren, & Zakriski, 2001). These results provide support for Murtha, Kanfer, and Ackerman’s suggested interactionist taxon- omy of personality and situations (1996), as well as J. Wright and Mis- chel’s “conditional” approach to personality measurement (1987). Our models will provide more accurate predictions when the situ- ation is considered during scale development.

Bandwidth The nature of the controversy concerning narrow versus broad bandwidth measures has changed. The answer to the question, “Which is better, broad or narrow measures?” is, “It depends on the nature of the criterion.” Criterion-related validities are higher when a construct-oriented approach is used to match predictors to criteria, including bandwidth considerations, whereby narrow pre- dictor constructs are matched with narrow criterion constructs and broad predictor constructs are matched with broad criterion con- structs (Hough & Furnham, 2003). This is an important conclusion that can help guide theory building and research.

# 312 PERSONALITY AND WORK

Cross-Cultural Issues When personality measures are developed in one language, trans- lated, and used cross-culturally, construct equivalence is critically im- portant. Most of the research addresses the extent to which the factor structure of the personality inventory replicates in different languages and cultures. A review of the evidence indicates that for most of the well-known inventories, the same or similar structures are found cross- culturally; however, relatively little evidence exists regarding the gen- eralizability of criterion-related validities of personality variables across cultures (Paunonen & Ashton, 1998). (For a review of the many is- sues involved in cross-cultural measurement, see Church, 2001.)

Instructions to Test Takers Studies of the effects of intentional distortion on validity often involve instructions to test takers, for example, “Respond honestly” or “Re- spond in a way to maximize your chances of being hired as a sales- person.” Many think that the motivation to portray oneself favorably on a self-report personality inventory in an applicant setting results in lower validity (criterion-related and construct validity) of person- ality scales, an example of the situation moderating validity. The sit- uation does moderate validity, but not in a way often thought.

When validities of personality scales are examined according to applicant versus incumbent versus directed faking settings, va- lidity is approximately the same in applicant (motivated) and in- cumbent (honest) settings, but dramatically lower when test takers are instructed to fake, that is, directed faking studies (Hough, 1998a; Hough & Furnham, 2003). Another example of instructions to test takers that affects responses (reduces the amount of distor- tion) is informing or warning test takers that distorted responses can be detected and that consequences exist for such distortion (Dwight & Donovan, 1998). Another type of instruction to test tak- ers that can affect responses is informing people of the character- istic being measured (Kleinmann, Kuptsch, & Köler, 1996). Our models need to be sensitive to instructions to test takers as an in- dependent variable that can affect dependent variables.

New, Promising Methods Several approaches to measuring personality characteristics have emerged in terms of content measured and mode of measurement

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 313

(see Hough & Furnham, 2003). Subjective methods other than self- report (for example, others’ reports, descriptions, and observations) are more common, as are objective methods such as conditional rea- soning, a strategy pioneered by James (1998) for measuring per- sonality characteristics based on the logic an individual uses to justify behavior. Although genetic testing (mouth swabs for DNA) is infrequently used, it may become more common. In the United States, however, legislative actions, Equal Employment Opportu- nity Commission guidelines for interpreting the Americans with Disability Act, and case law may preclude its use. Similarly, technol- ogy (digitization) has changed the mode of testing, making new con- structs possible, as well as new modes of measuring existing constructs (for example, response latency to measure extraversion). Testing using virtual reality has yet to come to fruition, but it will. Of course, new constructs and modes of measuring them bring new concerns about construct validity, equivalence, intended and unintended consequences, and new, unforeseen issues.

# Multilevel Perspective

A multilevel perspective is one of the most important recent trends in our ﬁeld. It represents a paradigm shift from a focus on just the individual or just the organization (or a subunit such as a team or work group) to a perspective that incorporates multiple levels of analysis. The multilevel personnel selection framework that B. Schnei- der and his colleagues (B. Schneider, Smith, & Sipe, 2000; Ployhart & Schneider, 2002) propose exempliﬁes this approach to theory building. New ways of thinking about work—tasks; required knowl- edge, skills, and abilities (predictor constructs, including personality variables); and performance constructs—as well as validation mod- els are required. The research and trends already described for group- level performance variables and group-level personality predictor variables are especially relevant to multilevel research and theories.

Another study highlights the importance of using a multilevel approach to conceptualize, measure, and analyze variables and data. Grifﬁn (2001) hypothesized and found different effects when different levels of analyses were used to examine the effects of sta- ble personality characteristics and work characteristics on worker reactions. Speciﬁcally, between-group variance in worker reaction

# 314 PERSONALITY AND WORK

outcomes increased when emotional stability and extraversion were included, with group-level variables explaining more variance in worker reactions when dispositions were included, whereas stud- ies using only individual-level analyses indicate a decrease in the relationship between work characteristics and worker reactions when stable personality variables are included. In addition to all the factors described throughout this chapter, the usefulness, ac- curacy, and validity of our theories also depend on level of analy- sis. Our theories need to reﬂect the multitude and complexity of world of work outcomes and their multiple determinants.

# Social and Legal Implications

With increased ethnic diversity within national workforces and globalization of markets comes a desire for greater representation of all ethnic groups in all areas of employment (equality in per- sonnel selection ratios across jobs). Two streams of research indi- cate that merit systems (as opposed to forced equality or quota systems) can be used to advance this important social and business goal. First, the evidence is persuasive that overall validity increases when personality and cognitive measures are used in combination (Schmidt & Hunter, 1998). Second, summaries of mean score dif- ferences between ethnic groups indicate that most ethnic groups score similarly on most personality variables (Hough, 1998b; Hough, Oswald, & Ployhart, 2001) whereas on measures of cogni- tive ability, signiﬁcant mean score differences exist.

One obvious strategy for obtaining more equal selection ra- tios is to include both personality and cognitive ability measures in selection systems. However, even when a typical cognitive abil- ity measure is equally weighted with a personality variable on which all ethnic groups score similarly, the reduction in the com- posite mean score difference between whites and, for example, African Americans will be less than the expected half (Sackett & Ellingson, 1997). Moreover, on some facets of the Big Five, small mean score differences do exist, with whites scoring lower than some minority groups on some facets and higher on other facets. For example, whites score approximately .12 standard deviations lower than African Americans on surgency but approximately .31 standard deviations higher on afﬁliation, both of which are facets of Extraversion.

# EMERGING TRENDS AND NEEDS 315

Employment law cases now include arguments about the use of alternative predictors such as personality variables (for exam- ple, United States of America v. City of Garland, TX, 2002). Employers increasingly are expected to include personality variables in their personnel selection systems.

# Conclusion

We make many choices when building models and conducting research. Examples are choice of independent (antecedent, pre- dictor) variables, dependent (criterion) variables, intervening (mediator) variables, individual- versus group-level outcome vari- ables, situations (tasks, jobs, culture) within and across which rela- tionships are hypothesized, and type of hypothesized relationships or effects (linear, curvilinear, conﬁgural, moderator, interaction). Given the complexity of the measurement of the constructs, rela- tions between variables, direction, shape, and type of relationships, it is not surprising that during the dark ages between approximately 1965 and 1985, I/O psychologists (with the exception of a few such as Ghiselli, 1966) accorded personality variables a minor, if any, role in theories of the determinants of work-related behavior. Research during the 1980s and 1990s demonstrated the important main ef- fects of personality variables in determining behavior and perfor- mance. Now, evidence for the many roles of personality variables in determining behavior and performance is persuasive.

Besides a need for more complex models, we must examine and develop additional taxonomic structures of personality, cri- terion, and situational variables, structures that incorporate more variables than the Big Five in the personality domain and more vari- ables than overall, task, and contextual performance as depen- dent variables. We need to develop an adequate taxonomy of situational variables. We need to incorporate other theories of per- sonality into our models of the determinants of performance. We need models that recognize that variables and relationships are dynamic, changing over time. Our models of performance must include multilevel measures of independent and dependent vari- ables and address relationships between variables at multiple lev- els. The complexity is enormous. Unless our theories and models reﬂect this complexity, the variance our theories and models ex- plain will be minimal.

# CHAPTER 12

# Research Themes for the Future

## Michael K. Mount Murray R. Barrick Ann Marie Ryan

If we were to choose one overarching theme that has consistently re- curred throughout this book, it is that understanding personality- related phenomena in the workplace is a very complex undertak- ing, perhaps more so than previous research has acknowledged. Most authors agree that a great deal of progress has been made in understanding the relationship of personality to work outcomes. Greater understanding of the structure of personality, coupled with meta-analytic methods for cumulating results across studies, were major reasons for these advances. The approach used in studies by Barrick and Mount (1991), Hough (1992), and Hough, Eaton, Dunnette, Kamp, and McCloy (1990), whereby the Big Five per- sonality factors (or some close variant) were related to performance criteria for different jobs, was a useful starting point. Perhaps the most important contribution of these studies is that they legitimized the study of personality and its relationship to performance. That is, after a period of about twenty-ﬁve years when personality re- search was largely absent from the industrial/organizational (I/O) psychology literature, it was once again acceptable to investigate personality-performance relationships.

However, in some respects, these studies may have oversimpli- ﬁed the nature of the relationship between personality and per-

326

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 327

formance. This may be explained partially by the fact that at that time, we were just beginning to demonstrate that personality mat- ters at work. Thus, the overall theme that emerges in these chapters is that although we have made considerable progress, there is much left to be accomplished. Further advancements require that more complex questions and methodologies be incorporated into stud- ies. In Chapter Eleven, Hough makes these points quite forcefully. Overall, each of the chapters provides stimulating and thought- provoking ways that we can further understand the relationship of personality to work-related criteria.

At least ﬁve other major themes resurface throughout this book. One that appears in several chapters is that researchers must give careful consideration to the meaning and relevance of speciﬁc personality traits. This construct-oriented approach to studying per- sonality underscores the importance of assessing appropriate traits for the questions being addressed. Second, researchers need to ac- count for mediating inﬂuences when studying relationships be- tween personality and work-related outcomes. Third, and relatedly, researchers need to account for the moderating inﬂuences of sit- uational factors when studying relationships between personality and outcomes. Fourth, researchers must specify with greater pre- cision the criteria of interest. To this end, it is clear that in order for us to advance, we must develop an accepted taxonomy of per- formance that delineates levels and content of criterion constructs. This theme recognizes the way the lack of a classiﬁcation scheme for personality traits hindered personality research more than a decade ago. Finally, researchers need to examine personality and its role with models that consider multiple levels of analysis.

## Relevant Personality Constructs at the Appropriate Level

The importance of studying personality at the appropriate con- struct level was discussed in several chapters throughout the book (Saucier and Goldberg, Lucas and Diener, Day and Kilduff, Ryan and Kristof-Brown, and Hough in Chapters One, Two, Eight, Ten, and Eleven, respectively), albeit in somewhat different ways. Chap- ter One by Saucier and Goldberg was intentionally unique because it discusses progress pertaining to personality attributes and how

# 328 PERSONALITY AND WORK

they can best be organized and structured. The purpose in invit- ing these authors to contribute to this volume was to provide the I/O community of researchers with a summary of research on the structure of personality from the perspective of two leading schol- ars from the broader ﬁeld of personality psychology. They point out that Allport (1937) reviewed deﬁnitions of the concept of per- sonality and catalogued over ﬁfty distinct meanings for the term. This is not a trivial issue; deﬁnitions force researchers to make ex- plicit their assumptions, and they also inﬂuence which criterion variables will be selected. After reﬂecting on these comments, we were struck by how seldom researchers studying the role of per- sonality in the workplace explicitly deﬁne personality (we count ourselves among the guilty!). The de facto approach seems to be that personality is deﬁned as whatever constructs are measured by the inventory the researcher has chosen to use.

An important contribution of Saucier and Goldberg is that while the Big Five factor solution is robust, other factor structures emerge that may also be useful. For example, one-, two-, three-, seven-, and nine-factor solutions have also been derived. Support for the Big Five model is strong in terms of social importance, breadth, stability, cross-observer agreement, and generality across peer and self-rating data. But the Big Five compares less favorably to alternative models on criteria such as causal clarity, correspon- dence to main lines of biological inﬂuence, predictive validity, gen- eralizability across cultures and languages, association with theory, and comprehensiveness.

Saucier and Goldberg also discuss a vexing problem for our ﬁeld: the relative advantages of subdividing the broader factors into more speciﬁc subcomponents (facets). The problem with this approach is the difﬁculty in achieving consensus about how many facets there are and what they measure. An advantage of measur- ing subcomponents pertains to the potential gain in predictive va- lidity, which comes from tapping into many speciﬁc sources of variance. In general, however, it appears that the more speciﬁc the level of constructs is, the more potential confusion is engendered for researchers.

The challenge for I/O psychologists becomes one of deter- mining which structural model of personality is best for predicting work outcomes. A question we need to address is whether we have

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 329

become overly reliant on the Big Five model when framing re- search questions. Ultimately, the appropriate personality structure or set of traits to examine depends on the intended purpose of the researcher. For example, in some situations, a one- or two-factor model of personality may be appropriate. Saucier and Goldberg note that one-factor solutions consistently yield an unrotated fac- tor labeled Evaluation, with desirable traits at one end and unde- sirable traits at the other. If this factor reﬂects a general evaluative (desirable versus undesirable) component, it may be useful to ex- amine how scores on this scale predict general overall perfor- mance compared to speciﬁc performance. Scullen, Mount, and Goff (2000) have shown that performance ratings capture both a general and a speciﬁc performance component associated with the particular attribute being rated. The evaluative personality factor may be a better predictor of the general performance component than of the speciﬁc performance components.

Similarly, two-factor solutions constantly yield personality traits related to positively valued dynamic qualities associated with indi- vidual ascendancy and socialization. These two factors have been alternatively labeled Agency and Communion (Bakan, 1966), Get- ting Ahead and Getting Along (Hogan, 1983), and Factors Beta and Alpha (Digman, 1997). Digman (1997) showed that Factor Alpha consists of the Five-Factor Model (FFM) factors of Conscientious- ness, Emotional Stability, and Agreeableness, whereas Factor Beta consisted of the FFM factors of Extraversion and Openness to Ex- perience. It may well be that the second higher-order construct, Factor Alpha, depicts a “functional personality” at work (Mount & Barrick, 1995), and emerging evidence suggests that this may be a valid predictor of overall performance across numerous occupa- tional groups. For example, a second-order meta-analysis by Bar- rick, Mount, and Judge (2001) revealed that at least two of the components of Factor Alpha, Conscientiousness and Emotional Stability, predict performance across jobs. Further evidence is pro- vided by research on employee reliability, which found that in- tegrity test validities were generalizable ((cid:1) = .41) and that these measures consisted of Conscientiousness, Emotional Stability, and Agreeableness (Ones, Viswesvaran, & Schmidt, 1993). In addition, Customer Service Orientation has been found to consist of these same three personality traits, and this composite measure again

# 330 PERSONALITY AND WORK

has moderately large ((cid:1) = .50) and generalizable validity (Frei & McDaniel, 1998).

Taken together, this research illustrates there may be a func- tional personality at work. Those who are planful, dependable, and achievement oriented (Conscientious), as well as calm, not de- pressed, and conﬁdent (Emotional Stability), and those who are kind, courteous, and trusting (Agreeable) are likely to be better performers. And again, it may well be that these validities are pri- marily due to the underlying relationship with the common, over- all performance component rather than speciﬁc performance facets.

One other example of the type of question that may focus on a higher-order structure than the Big Five has to do with the rela- tionship between two major individual difference paradigms: per- sonality traits and vocational interests. Prior research has shown that the RIASEC vocational interest types (Holland, 1985) can be explained by higher-order factors, similar to Factors Beta and Alpha found in the Big Five. For example, Hogan (Hogan, 1983; Hogan & Blake, 1999) argues the RIASEC vocational interest types consist of two higher-order dimensions, which he labels Confor- mity and Sociability. In many respects, the deﬁnitions of these two dimensions correspond closely with those provided previously for Factors Alpha and Beta. Consequently, analyses of vocational in- terests and personality traits at the higher-order level may show that the personality factors of Alpha and Beta have counterparts in vo- cational interest. Thus, when the construct that personality is being compared to is broadly deﬁned, as are interests in the RIASEC model, the personality constructs need to be equally broad to en- hance understanding. In the case of understanding structural re- lations between personality and vocational interests, it may be best to use a higher-order model of personality than the Big Five.

Conversely, as a number of chapters emphasize (Saucier and Goldberg in Chapter One, Johnson in Chapter Four, and Hough in Chapter Eleven), it is likely to be appropriate and even neces- sary to use a lower-level model of personality than the Big Five when the goal is to enhance understanding about the relationship between personality and speciﬁc performance facets rather than to predict overall performance. That is, to examine how personal- ity relates to speciﬁc performance components, there is likely to

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 331

be value in assessing equally speciﬁc personality traits. The same might also be said of other outcomes discussed in this book (affect, counterproductivity, team processes, social relations, and learning in, respectively, Chapters Five through Nine) in that greater speci- ﬁcity in the criterion may warrant greater speciﬁcity in the per- sonality construct. Indeed, Day and Kilduff (in Chapter Eight) eschew the Big Five and focus on the role of self-monitoring in dyadic relations. However, the ﬁeld will be advanced more quickly if there were a widely accepted classiﬁcation scheme for facets of personality available for researchers to use fully.

The importance of studying personality-related phenomena at the appropriate construct level is also illustrated in Chapter Two per- taining to relationships between worker happiness and productivity. Lucas and Diener recommend that researchers who are interested in studying subjective feelings of well-being and happiness focus on one or more of four separable components of happiness at work. The ﬁrst two components are positive affect and negative affect, which refer to a person’s affective well-being. The third and fourth components refer to cognitive judgments about one’s satisfaction with one’s life and satisfaction with one’s job. This distinction is im- portant because a single worker could be simultaneously high on positive affect, average on negative affect, low on life satisfaction, and average on job satisfaction. Lucas and Diener contend, as do several other authors (Barrick, Mitchell, and Stewart in Chapter Three; Johnson in Chapter Four; Cullen and Sackett in Chapter Six; Ford and Oswald in Chapter Nine; and Hough in Chapter Eleven), that challenges in understanding these relationships are increased given the multiple ways that productivity is deﬁned, ranging from objective measures (including worker output, efﬁciency, turnover, and absenteeism) to subjective ratings of performance, potential, counterproductivity, and citizenship. Thus, in order to understand worker happiness, it is critical that the individual difference mea- sure matches the criterion of interest.

# Mediators and Moderators of Personality

The second and third themes that emerge across several chapters are that we must account more fully for the mediating inﬂuences of motivational processes and the moderating inﬂuences of situational

# 332 PERSONALITY AND WORK

factors if we are to understand how personality relates to workplace behavior and affect. These two themes, discussed by Barrick et al. (Chapter Three), Johnson (Chapter Four), Cullen and Sackett (Chapter Six), Stewart (Chapter Seven), Ford and Oswald (Chap- ter Nine), and Hough (Chapter Eleven), present new sets of challenges for researchers. For example, Barrick et al. propose that cognitive-motivational work intentions must be accounted for as an explanatory mechanism for why personality traits are associated with high levels of work performance. They focus on the role of three motivational components or personal strivings, which they deﬁne as speciﬁc means of attaining desired end states. Accom- plishment striving is cognitively accessible as representing inten- tions to exert effort and work hard, communion striving refers to getting along with others, and status striving refers to gaining power and refers to getting ahead of others. These three cognitive- motivational intentions or strivings are proposed as a core set of higher-order goals that regulate behavior at work. Consequently, an important contribution of this chapter is that it provides a the- oretical model for understanding how cognitive-motivational in- tentions link personality and outcomes.

Johnson (Chapter Four) also discusses the need to understand mediating variables through which personality inﬂuences perfor- mance. He illustrates how different personality variables inﬂuence different components of motivation, which in turn inﬂuence dif- ferent components of performance. An important contribution of this chapter is the discussion of three components of motivation: motives, proactive cognitive processes, and on-line cognitive pro- cesses. Motives include variables such as job attitudes (for example, organizational citizenship behaviors, job satisfaction, and organi- zation commitment), as well as the three cognitive-motivational in- tentions discussed by Barrick et al. Proactive processes include motivational constructs such as self-efﬁcacy, expectancy, and goal setting. On-line cognitive processes refer to the translation of in- tention to action. Johnson’s view is that a complete understanding of motivation requires consideration of all three categories of mo- tivation. The common theme of the chapters by Barrick et al. and Johnson is that self-regulatory processes represented by motivation are important mediators of relations between personality and per- formance, and previous research has inadequately accounted for

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 333

their effects. As Johnson states, self-regulatory processes are im- portant for several reasons. They are strongly related to personality, they help explain how people overcome habits, and they account for situations where those with similar ability, knowledge, goals, and desires differ in their performance levels.

Other chapters also suggest mediational links between per- sonality and criteria of interest. For example, Cullen and Sackett (Chapter Six) discuss how a motivational variable (a motive to comply with norms) might be a mediator between personality and counterproductive work behaviors, but they also discuss attitudi- nal and affective constructs as potential mediators of these rela- tions. The complexity of their model reﬂects the complexity of the inﬂuence of personality on work behavior.

In proposing and examining mediational processes in these models, we think Weiss and Kurek’s admonishment in Chapter Five is important to consider: a productive analysis will tie together ex- isting constructs (for example, well-accepted personality traits and well-accepted motivational constructs) rather than create new in- dividual difference measures. Furthermore, we note the ongoing discussion in the self-regulatory literature of considering motiva- tional individual differences, such as goal orientation, as traits or as states. Models that explain personality as operating through mo- tivational processes will eventually need to clarify whether the in- ﬂuence is on motivational traits or motivational states.

The theme that situations must be more fully accounted for as moderators of the personality-motivation and personality- performance relationships is present in a number of chapters as well. In the Barrick et al. model in Chapter Three, situational in- ﬂuences moderate the relationship between the three cognitive- motivational intentions and personality-performance relationships. Examples include whether the job involves cooperative or com- petitive demands and the degree of autonomy in the job. In the Johnson model in Chapter Four, situational moderators that can inﬂuence the magnitude of personality-performance relationships include situational strength, occupation, time on the job, and au- tonomy. Hough’s discussion in Chapter Eleven focuses on the ef- fects of situations such as type of task, type of team, type of job, culture, research setting, and ﬁt. Regardless of the speciﬁc type of situation, the theme across these chapters is that situational factors

# 334 PERSONALITY AND WORK

are important because they inﬂuence both which traits will be ex- pressed and how they will be expressed.

To determine which set of personality traits and behavioral cri- teria is particularly important in a speciﬁc job, it is apparent today that we need to consider the situation thoroughly. Although job analysts have long assessed situational attributes of the job, many of the authors in this book call for a different approach. For ex- ample, Ford and Oswald (Chapter Nine) discuss the role of the types of contexts in which the learner is placed. Thus, training re- searchers need to consider such situational characteristics as level of supervisory and peer support, the role of a positive work climate, and the strength of the situation (referred to as situational press). However, they also emphasize the dynamic nature of the situation in recognizing that people can choose whether to attend training or what type of training to attend. They also propose a new per- spective on the viability of accounting for person-by-situation ef- fects. Furthermore, in Chapter Seven, Stewart demonstrates that one can also consider a work group as a dynamic context, in that members of the group exert change on the situation over time. The chapters in this book highlight the necessity of thinking about a person’s traits and their effects within contexts that are not sta- tic and that can even be changed because a person with those traits is in situations that are rapidly changing. That is, the situation in- ﬂuences a person’s behavior, but people also inﬂuence situations. Given the importance of the situation for understanding the role of personality on work-related outcomes, how can we charac- terize situational variables to obtain consistency across studies? In Chapter Three, Barrick et al. approach the development of a tax- onomy of situational features by focusing on one key aspect of work: the social setting. They argue that people spend consider- able time in social situations, and how effectively we navigate these settings has considerable impact on our success and well-being. Furthermore, personality traits are likely to be important predic- tors of how we function in social settings (Barrick, Stewart, Neu- bert, & Mount, 1998). Based on this reasoning, there seems to be considerable value in examining whether the person’s “personal- ity” interacts with how work is coordinated and controlled, when predicting behavior. Another approach, advocated by Hough in Chapter Eleven, suggests that Holland’s RIASEC (Realistic, Inves-

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 335

tigative, Artistic, Social, Enterprising, Conventional) model may be a meaningful way to describe the “psychological” characteristics of a work setting. Such an approach underscores the importance of the attributes of the people in the situation. Both Chapters Three and Eleven suggest a different perspective on assessing the situa- tion than traditional job-analytic approaches that focus on the im- portance of the things people do on the job. Many other chapters in this book contain expanded thinking about the situation or pro- pose novel ways to assess contextual inﬂuences.

# Speciﬁcation of Criteria

A fourth theme that runs throughout nearly all of the chapters in this book is the need for greater explication of the criterion that researchers are interested in predicting. I/O psychologists are in- terested in personality because it predicts what we feel and do (that is, our behavior) at work. To deepen our understanding of per- sonality at work, researchers must adopt a behavioral focus. Ironi- cally, although we are now giving more thought to which speciﬁc personality traits are relevant in a work setting, there is consider- ably less theoretical or empirical work focused on which behaviors we are interested in predicting with personality constructs and why. The authors in this book have implicitly and explicitly recognized this criterion problem and thus have developed a number of propositions about ways in which personality traits are likely to af- fect how people perform and what activities involve them. More important, a careful reading of this book would help identify the basic kinds of behaviors and what ways are useful for assessing them. Thus, many of these behaviors are likely to be fundamental components of any behavioral taxonomy at work. Although we do not propose such a taxonomy here, the chapters in this book re- view many of the important components that such a model would have to consider.

Job performance is obviously an important indicator of the value of an employee’s behavior because it indicates the over- all value of his or her contributions to the organization. Further- more, selection decisions tend to rely on a composite measure of individual performance. For this reason, a measure of overall per- formance dominates many of the models discussed here, such as

# 336 PERSONALITY AND WORK

those by Barrick et al. (Chapter Three) and Johnson (Chapter Four). However, as these authors and others make clear, overall performance is not the only important outcome or set of behav- iors. For instance, Lucas and Diener (Chapter Two) focus on worker happiness, Weiss and Kurek (Chapter Five) highlight af- fective experiences, Cullen and Sackett (Chapter Six) illustrate the importance of counterproductive workplace behavior, and Ford and Oswald (Chapter Nine) discuss the learning and training per- formance of the dynamic learner.

This book also goes beyond these innovative ways of thinking about more traditional outcomes by examining a number of other criteria that are also worthy of consideration. For example, Ryan and Kristof-Brown (Chapter Ten) emphasize the nature and importance of the ﬁt between individuals and the job, group, or organization, while Stewart (Chapter Seven) focuses on the fundamental role of personality in work team outcomes. Day and Kilduff (Chapter Eight) also underscore the importance of social networks and en- courage researchers to examine the individual’s skill in monitor- ing and managing relationships in groups and organizations. Johnson (Chapter Four) and Hough (Chapter Eleven) identify other fundamentally important behavioral variables at work, in- cluding career success, job and life satisfaction, safety, conﬂict at- tributions, workplace aggression, leadership, adaptive performance, and adaptability to change.

In short, development and evaluation of models emphasizing behavioral criteria will provide an essential step toward a greater scientiﬁc understanding about how personality inﬂuences success at work. We believe that valid measurement of behaviors that lead to or detract from important organizational outcomes will signiﬁ- cantly enhance the contributions that personality research can make to the broader ﬁeld of psychology. Furthermore, clearly iden- tifying and deﬁning the outcomes we are trying to predict should enable us to make better selection decisions. For example, Cullen and Sackett (Chapter Six) explicate the covariance structure of counterproductive work behaviors and their relations to organiza- tional citizenship behaviors and contextual performance; knowing how speciﬁc outcomes we are interested in relate to one another will enable a clearer understanding of personality’s inﬂuence.

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 337

Another way to think about outcomes is to evaluate the role of personality using two critical questions: “Are you able to do it?” and “Are you happy doing it?” Research on personality in work settings tends to focus on the former question (satisfactoriness) rather than the latter (satisfaction). Thus, today we have greater understand- ing of how personality relates to satisfactoriness or performance at work. And yet it is also important to consider how personality af- fects life and job satisfaction and other affective constructs, as Lucas and Diener (Chapter Two) and Weiss and Kurek (Chapter Five) attest. Recent meta-analyses illustrate that personality traits, particularly Emotional Stability, Extraversion, and Conscientious- ness, are important predictors of job satisfaction (Judge, Heller, & Mount, 2002) and different facets of subjective well-being (DeNeve & Cooper, 1998). Similarly, in this book, Lucas and Diener (Chap- ter Two) review ﬁndings related to worker happiness and produc- tivity. To illustrate this further, they show that happy workers have many beneﬁts when interacting with the world, but the impact of these individual differences on worker productivity depends on the nature of the tasks the workers perform. Happy workers may be more talkative and friendly, but whether this affects work outcomes depends on the nature of the tasks performed. Another recent meta-analysis (Barrick, Mount, & Gupta, in press) reveals that al- though personality traits (the FFM) share some common variance with interests (the RIASEC), the two sets of dispositional measures are not as highly correlated as we might expect. This ﬁnding un- derscores the need to examine the unique effects of personality on satisfaction and other affective variables.

Lucas and Diener (Chapter Two), Weiss and Kurek (Chapter Five), and Hough (Chapter Eleven) discuss a number of different ways researchers might approach the question regarding the na- ture of the relationship between personality and satisfaction or af- fect. Weiss and Kurek’s emphasis on striving to understand the process through which personality inﬂuences the generation of emotional change, as well as the consequence of these behavioral and emotional changes, is particularly promising and is likely to lead to a number of fruitful scientiﬁc inquiries. As researchers, we need to recognize that only when there is a high degree of corre- spondence achieved on both of these dimensions—that is, we are

# 338 PERSONALITY AND WORK

both happy and effective at work—will we maximize beneﬁts for both individuals and organizations. For these reasons, satisfac- tion and affect, in addition to satisfactoriness, are important issues for future research to address.

# Personality in Multilevel Theories

A ﬁnal theme that is apparent across a number of chapters in this book is recognition of the increasing examination of the role of per- sonality in organizational life across multiple levels of analysis. Ex- plicit examples can be found in Stewart’s chapter (Chapter Seven) on the multilevel role of personality in teams, Hough’s discussion of group-level personality predictor variables in Chapter Eleven, Day and Kilduff’s discussion in Chapter Eight of self-monitoring and dyadic work relationships, and Ryan and Kristof-Brown’s dis- cussion in Chapter Ten of organizational personality in person- organization ﬁt research. But multiple levels of analysis also enter into the models presented in many other chapters (Lucas and Diener in Chapter Two, Barrick et al. in Chapter Three, Johnson in Chapter Four, Cullen and Sackett in Chapter Six, and Ford and Oswald in Chapter Nine), as many of the situational antecedents and other moderators proposed in their models are group-level or organizational-level characteristics of environments. Thus, this book makes clear that the traditional focus on the individual level, which permeates research on personality and work, is being supplanted with a richer understanding of personality and work that incorpo- rates multilevel theorizing.

What are the implications of incorporating multiple levels into our theories and research on personality and work? Kozlowski and Klein (2000) noted, “Virtually all organizational phenomena are embedded in a higher-level context, which often has either direct or moderating effects on lower-level processes and outcomes. Rel- evant contextual features and effects from the higher level should be incorporated into theoretical models” (p. 15). This principle is applied in a number of the models presented in this book. Lucas and Diener (Chapter Two) mention the nature of the job as a moderator of the happy worker–productive worker hypothesis, Bar- rick et al. (Chapter Three) discuss cooperative and competitive de- mands, Johnson (Chapter Four) mentions situational moderators

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 339

of individual motives to individual performance links, Cullen and Sackett (Chapter Six) mention organizational events, Stewart (Chapter Seven) discusses the team setting as a moderator between individual traits and individual performance, Day and Kilduff (Chap- ter Eight) discuss features of networks, Ford and Oswald (Chapter Nine) consider learning situations, and Ryan and Kristof-Brown (Chapter Ten) relate how organizational features result in individ- ual complementary ﬁt assessments. It is clear that no formulation of the effects of personality in work settings, even on individual-level outcome variables (such as learning, counterproductivity, or per- formance), should leave out a consideration of the inﬂuence of the higher-level context. As we have already noted, researchers in the area of personality and work must avoid simplistic theorizing and embrace models that contain concepts at multiple levels.

Another principle of multilevel theory building stated by Koz- lowski and Klein (2000) is that “conceptualization of emergent phenomena at higher levels should specify, theoretically, the na- ture and form of these bottom-up emergent processes” (p. 18). In the area of personality and work, one example of these processes occurs when assessing the personality of a team or an organization. Ryan and Kristof-Brown (Chapter Ten) noted the problems of con- ceptualizing the “personality of the organization,” and Hough (Chapter Eleven) mentions the difﬁculty of operationalizing higher-level predictors such as dyadic levels of extraversion. Day and Kilduff (Chapter Eight) provide an illustration of how one might examine the role of personality in the formation and main- tenance of dyadic relations in their chapter on self-monitoring and social networks. Stewart (Chapter Seven) also tackles this difﬁcult task and provides a detailed discussion of team-level personality and a genetic analogy to describe the possible nature of the processes by which a team-level trait might be formed. In order for our understanding of the attraction-selection-attrition model, so- cial network formation, and team composition effects to advance, such conceptualization is critical.

Multilevel theories generally recognize the concept of bond strength (Simon, 1973)—that relationships across levels are greater for more proximal levels. As Ryan and Kristof-Brown (Chapter Ten) note, it may be more fruitful to pursue the notion of per- sonality ﬁt at the team or group level than at the organizational

# 340 PERSONALITY AND WORK

level because more proximal levels are being connected. Stewart (Chapter Seven) illustrates this by providing a good rationale for cross-level linkages between personality and performance at the individual and group levels. Similarly, Day and Kilduff (Chapter Eight) discuss the complexity of considerations at the dyadic level that underlies social network analysis. It may thus be more fruitful to focus research resources toward understanding the role of per- sonality in predicting dyadic or group-level phenomena than organizational-level outcomes.

Multilevel theories must also consider how effects are mani- fested over time (Kozlowski & Klein, 2000). The effects of individ- ual personality on dyadic, group-level, and organizational outcomes are not likely to occur quickly. For example, a change in the per- sonality composition of a team may not have immediate effects on team coordination, productivity, or other group-level outcomes but may have considerable long-term effects on these same variables. One implication for many of the issues presented in this book is that future research must examine the role of personality over long time periods. For example, research in groups or organizations must allow sufﬁcient time to pass so that the effects of personality are allowed to emerge. This may mean that the study of personal- ity and dyadic or group-level or organizational-level phenomena necessitates longitudinal or time-series designs.

Kozlowski and Klein (2000) noted the importance of a sam- pling strategy that allows for between-unit variability at all relevant levels of the model if one wishes to test a multilevel theory ade- quately. Thus, assessing the role of team personality or organiza- tional personality requires sampling to ensure variability across the range of personality combinations that one would expect at that level. Furthermore, it suggests that sampling for variability in situ- ational determinants of personality (such as cooperative or com- petitive demands) is also of importance.

In conclusion, several of the chapters in this book recognize that we must expand our theories of personality and work out- comes to be truly multilevel theories. This will include opera- tionalizing concepts at multiple levels, specifying emergent processes, and hypothesizing cross-level relationships. In short, fu- ture research on personality and work must take a multilevel focus.

# RESEARCH THEMES FOR THE FUTURE 341

# Applications

Although much of what is presented in this book is based on ap- plied research in the workplace, there is not a speciﬁc chapter on practical applications of research on personality in organizations. We believe that issues related to application such as cross-cultural equivalency of measures, socially desirable responding, applicant perceptions of personality inventories, and the like are certainly im- portant, but our focus here is on understanding the role of per- sonality in work-related behaviors and affective responses to work rather than on how personality can or should be assessed for work- related applications. Nevertheless, we believe that this book does speak volumes about considerations in assessing personality for per- sonnel decision making and organizational intervention purposes. One example is in the area of employee selection. Recent re- search has highlighted the utility of personality in predicting valued outcomes in organizations (for example, less counterproductive be- havior, higher quality and quantity of performance, and lower like- lihood to withdraw), as well as obtaining more diverse hiring (that is, low disparate impact). Although this book does not have a chap- ter dedicated to selection issues, many, if not all, of the chapters ad- dress the implications that personality has for the practice of hiring. For example, Barrick et al. (Chapter Three) note that higher performance can be obtained across all jobs if one hires employees who are highly conscientious and emotionally stable, but whether other personality traits (Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Open- ness to Experience) result in higher performance depends on whether these traits are relevant to the actual job activities. Hough (Chapter Eleven) illustrates that although Openness to Experience has not been found to be relevant to performance at work, facets of Openness are likely to be relevant to outcomes related to the in- creasing diversity and rapid change of the workplace.

Also, several chapters imply a fundamentally different approach to selection than that typically conducted. For example, the chapter on ﬁt (Chapter Ten, by Ryan & Kristof-Brown) emphasizes the idea that whom an organization hires may depend on who is currently in the job, group, or organization. Similarly, Stewart’s discussion of teams in Chapter Seven recognizes that the role of personality is

# 342 PERSONALITY AND WORK

more complex in such situations because the effect obtained from personality traits may be dependent on the personality of other employees in the work environment. Consequently, a team com- posed entirely of extraverted members is likely to be less effective than a team composed of members varying on extraversion (some extraverted and some introverted members). As a ﬁeld, we have not thought these implications through sufﬁciently, and these chapters provide guidance regarding ways to proceed in examin- ing these novel yet critical selection issues. We think similar analy- ses of the content of the book would provide insights for other applications where personality must be assessed in the workplace.

# Conclusion

The overarching theme of this book is that future theoretical and empirical work investigating the role of personality at work requires a complex analysis of the person, the situation, and behaviors. To reﬂect this complexity fully, researchers will have to incorporate one or more of the themes discussed in this chapter. A critical theme is that future research must take a construct-oriented perspective of the personality trait and give careful consideration to the appro- priate hierarchical level. A second theme necessary to advance re- search is to explain the mechanism through which distal personality traits affect performance outcomes at work. As suggested here, mo- tivational processes are likely to serve as important mediators of these relationships. Third, the context within which these variables are related will play a crucial role in determining the magnitude of the relationship, particularly for those traits (such as Extraversion, Agreeableness, and Openness to Experience) that have consistently been found to have contingent relationships with performance. Fourth, researchers must attend more thoughtfully and systemati- cally to the criterion of interest. Fifth, we need to give careful con- sideration to the appropriate level of analysis of many of these variables, including the situation and motivational processes. It is difﬁcult to ﬁnd an example of research on personality and work that would not be enhanced by incorporating one or more of these themes. Consequently, to advance the ﬁeld signiﬁcantly beyond our present understanding, future studies must address one or more of these themes in a complex way.
