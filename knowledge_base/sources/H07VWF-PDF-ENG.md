The beneﬁts of paternity leave are many. Research has shown that

taking time oﬀ work to care for a newborn child is good for father-baby

bonding, the baby’s development, and the parents’ relationship with

each other. But there’s one more huge beneﬁt that we’re just now

learning about thanks to new data and research: paternal brain training.

# What Is Brain Training?

Parenting is not as “instinctual” as previously believed. While decades

of research have focused on the maternal brain, revealing fascinating

changes that train the brain for the demands of keeping a small human

## alive, new research on the paternal brain shows similar changes. And

these changes happen even though fathers do not have the physical

## experiences of pregnancy, birth, and the related hormone shifts.

Parental instinct brain training is possible for all parents.

Over the last decade, the research community has done extensive

work demonstrating adult neuroplasticity: the brain’s ability to alter its

## structure and function in response to experiences and environmental

## changes. The transition into parenthood marks a key window for adult

## neuroplasticity. Darby Saxbe, professor of psychology at the University

## of Southern California, studies this particular shift and the importance

of early parenting experience on the structural and functional changes

related to the “fathering brain.” This research has led Saxbe and fellow

researcher Soﬁa Cárdenas to emphasize that “fathers are made, not

born: Time with infants is a key ingredient in building the fathering

# brain.”

For dads, the brain changes initiated by cues from their babies link

to the father-infant connection, suggesting that such neural changes

prepare the brain for fatherhood. One key factor in this research is that

the most impactful, neurologically expanding experience is engaged

experience. “No one is born with this magic ability to fall into the

[parent] role easily. But we need to do the work of fully engaging

because that is the thing that’s going to drive the neurobiological

changes to give them the tools that they need to build over the

long term,” explains Chelsea Conaboy, author of Mother Brain: How

## Neuroscience is Rewriting the Story of Parenthood.

What does engaged experience mean? In this case, it’s quality one-on-

one time between a father and his infant. Research has shown that

## the more hours alone with an infant, the greater the functional neural

changes. This enables fathers to become more eﬀective, instinctual

# caregivers for their children.

One study by Saxbe and colleagues highlights the potential power of

paternity leave in shaping the dad brain. The research teams compared

## brain scans in ﬁrst-time fathers in California with those of ﬁrst-time

fathers in Spain. Both groups of fathers showed changes. However,

comparing the two countries showed interesting diﬀerences. One key

diﬀerence? Only the fathers in Spain showed signiﬁcant changes in

regions associated with sustained attention, which in turn likely prepare

## the brain for the cognitive and emotional demands of parenting. One

potential explanation for this diﬀerence comes down to a cultural

norm — widespread access to generous paternity leave policies allows

Spanish fathers to spend more time with their newborns. It serves

## as additional evidence that dedicated time during the transition into

fatherhood can be viewed as a neural workout to build muscle memory

for the challenges ahead; think of it like boot camp for developing your

parenting instinct.

In other words, paternity leave equals a free brain-training program.

Like most training programs, the beneﬁts become clear with every eﬀort

you put in. The beauty of fatherhood brain training is that it does

not require an intensive workout, a stack of books, or long days in a

conference room. The only thing you need for this training program is

engaged time with your baby. When you engage, your neural network

tweaks itself to respond to your baby more quickly. When your brain

responds more quickly the next time your baby needs you, you spend

more time engaging with your baby. When you spend more time

engaging with your baby, your neural network ﬁne-tunes itself a little

# more — and on and on.

Spending engaged time with your new baby is a rare opportunity for

long-term success in fatherhood. This short-term time investment has

the potential to pay a lifelong dividend in dad instincts.

# Expect a Learning Curve

With any training program, the ﬁrst few days are fun — there’s

excitement that comes with new hobbies or projects. But then the real

work sets in, and to get better, you have to stick with it. Improvement

requires dedication, tenacity, commitment, and time. You have to

plug through the hard days and can’t give up when things get rough.

Otherwise, you’ll never meet your goal.

Brain training with an infant is no diﬀerent. Everyone who has spent

time with a baby knows how hard it can be: the sleep deprivation, the

crying, the uncertainty, the monotony. But like other training programs,

you need to persevere, and give your brain the stimulation it needs to

grow and adapt, preparing you for a lifetime of parenthood.

## Erez Levin, father of two, adtech specialist at Google, and paternity

leave “dadvocate,” agrees. Levin took advantage of his employer’s

parental leave entitlement when his children were born, and does not

think the question should be if you take parental leave, but how you

take parental leave. “When my daughter was four months old, my wife

returned to work, and that’s when I began my full 12 weeks of paternity

leave. I learned that bonding happens during the challenging moments,

and I had plenty of those, especially in the ﬁrst few weeks of my solo

leave,” he told us. “I beneﬁtted in more ways than I could list, but

overall I am conﬁdent that taking my leave got me comfortable being an

# independent caretaker across all tasks.”

Just like any training program, the real growth — the real conﬁdence,

the real victory — of fatherhood brain training comes with the hard

work. But like other accomplishments, once you achieve success and

look back, all those hard days and nights were worth it.

# Where Do We Go from Here?

# For dads with access to parental leave.

There are very real social norms that push men into the income-earning

role and dissuade them from taking their leave. Find a way to work

## around this, push back, and ﬁght for your leave.

Although scheduling some overlap time with your partner is nice for

building a family bond, it’s important to use part of your leave to spend

time with your baby alone — it’s the best opportunity for brain training.

When you’re the only adult at home, you tackle the challenges, so you

learn how to solve those daily baby problems.

## For dads without access to parental leave.

Not many employers in the U.S. provide paid paternity leave. If you

don’t have access to paid leave and cannot aﬀord unpaid leave, you can

still train your brain by ﬁnding baby-engagement time outside of work.

To maximize brain training, one-on-one time needs to be a priority

during your baby’s infancy, so make the time to be alone with your

baby. Will you be exhausted? Absolutely. Is it going to be worth it? 100%.

Of course, if your partner is breastfeeding, the role of feeding the

baby may be covered. But there are still plenty of other baby-focused

roles you can take on: diaper duty, gas-bubble eradicator, tummy-time

instructor, master soother, nap captain, expert swaddler, lullaby singer,

scrubber and bather — or just strap on a baby carrier and head out for a

walk. You don’t have to read your infant Proust; you don’t have to strive

for perfection. You just have to spend time with them.

# For employers, managers, and leaders.

As decision-makers, you have the power to push for policies that allow

all new parents to take parental leave — and the power to initiate the

cultural shift necessary to encourage men to take advantage of parental

leave entitlements. Take parental leave yourself, tell others about your

brain training, and set an example for other new dads to do the same.

If parental leave wasn’t an option for you when you had kids, join the

voices of other men who regret their lack of leave by advocating for

better policies for today’s new dads.

# For grandfathers, uncles, friends, neighbors, colleagues, employers, and everyone else.

Fight for parental leave for all parents. Gender norms are so entrenched

in our culture that we have come to mistake them as biology. But

science tells us that females do not have any more parenting instinct

than people of other genders. In reality, the “biology” of the “parenting

instinct” is far more expansive — it’s an innate skill that also requires

# exposure, experience, and practice.

And lastly, support the new dads in your life. It’s hard for men to assert

their desire to spend dedicated time at home with their infant. Men

who do push back against social norms will need support. You can be

## supportive in the simplest ways: forward this article, talk about their

amazing brain-training opportunity, tell them you believe in them. A

few words of encouragement might mean more than you’ll ever know.

- • •

The more men have access to parental leave and take it, the more dads

we’ll have in the world with brains trained for parenting. If we want

to see greater gender equality, we need to not just focus on women’s

participation in the professional world — we need to encourage more

men to participate in the caregiving world.
