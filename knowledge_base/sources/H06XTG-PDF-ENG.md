When expanding into international markets, how much autonomy

should home-oﬃce leaders give local teams? Maintaining excessively

tight control over your overseas divisions can get in the way of their ability to operate eﬃciently and make decisions eﬀectively — but giving

them too much autonomy can also backﬁre, leading to quality issues,

inconsistencies, duplicated work, and a host of other challenges.

To explore this tricky question, my colleague and I conducted

corporations based all around the world. We asked them how they

have struck this balance in their organizations, and identiﬁed three

questions that leaders should ask to determine the best way to support

## and collaborate with their international teams.

- 1. How fast-paced is your business sector?

The ﬁrst key question to ask is, what is the pace at which your

business sector has been growing in this new market? Fast-paced sectors

usually require faster decision-making to respond to rapidly evolving

opportunities and threats, and so teams in these sectors often beneﬁt

# from greater autonomy.

For example, our interviews suggested that in the tech sector, Chinese

customers expect new rollouts, features, and updates at a much faster

rate than those in other global markets. Thus, to compete in this space,

companies have to move fast or risk getting left behind. China’s leading

ride-hailing app Didi Chuxing, for instance, launched its core product

just three months after the company was founded — a lot faster than

## typical rollouts of similar products in other markets.

To succeed in such a market, multinational companies will beneﬁt

from giving their local teams substantial leeway to respond to shifting

demand and competitive landscapes. For example, when the Indian

mobile ad company InMobi expanded into China, it granted its China

unit a lot more autonomy than it had given other local teams: While

all other international teams worked with a shared product team based

in India, the China unit had its own product team. Furthermore, local

marketing, sales, ﬁnance, and many other business divisions reported

## directly to the general manager of the China team, not to headquarters.

This allowed InMobi to act with the speed and agility of a startup,

eventually partnering with more than 30,000 local apps to become

## China’s largest independent mobile ad network.

Importantly, this isn’t just a matter of the overall pace of an entire

market. While the Chinese market moves quickly in many industries,

executives should be sure to analyze the pace of the speciﬁc industry

in which their businesses operate. Sectors such as chemical engineering

and traditional manufacturing, for instance, grow relatively slowly and

experience fewer changes (even in a generally fast-paced market such as China). Companies in these sectors will be better oﬀ centralizing

decision-making in order to streamline operations and avoid costs associated with duplicating similar functions across diﬀerent teams.

For example, ExxonMobil has had a relatively stable customer base in

China for years, and has experienced minimal need for rapid product

development or other major changes. As such, its leadership decided

to keep business operations and structures fairly centralized, with most

key decision-making power remaining at the headquarters.

- 2. How much does your business depend on local assets?

Next, managers should consider the extent to which their business

depends on local assets. If a global company relies heavily on

capabilities such as local procurement, production, and sales,

decentralization is necessary. Global fast-food chain Yum! Brands serves

as a good example: When it launched Yum! China, it began sourcing,

producing, and selling more and more products in China, leading

headquarters to take a looser approach to management. Eventually, Yum! Brands even ended up spinning oﬀ its China division entirely,

letting it operate and be publicly traded as a separate company.

In contrast, for businesses that depend less on local assets, a higher

degree of centralization often makes more sense. For example, we

talked with executives at many American and European luxury brands

which have expanded into Middle Eastern markets to reach the

substantial customer bases in the region. These companies typically

## retain relatively tight control over their global teams, in part because

the resources required to design and produce luxury products are

not located in these regions (e.g., specialized facilities, expertise,

etc.). Luxury brands also typically depend heavily on the strong,

centralized brand of the parent company, and so it makes sense for

these organizations to integrate their regional teams closely with their

headquarters to ensure this key asset isn’t diluted.

## For instance, the French luxury brand Cartier designs and manufactures

its products exclusively in France and Switzerland, and so it made

sense for the company to keep its governance structures centered on its

headquarters. In addition, Cartier’s key executives based in the Middle

East (including its CEO and head of HR) are Cartier veterans originally

from Paris, helping to ensure the company’s values and norms are

## consistently upheld even in this geographically distant subsidiary.

- 3. How strong is your relationship with local leadership?

The ﬁnal question to ask yourself is, how much do you trust your local

counterparts? The stronger and more trusting your relationship, the

more it will be feasible to give local teams greater autonomy.

For example, one of the reasons that Amazon India enjoys substantial

autonomy is because the Indian team is led by Amit Agarwal — an Amazon veteran and longtime member of Jeﬀ Bezos’s leadership circle

who is deeply trusted by the home oﬃce. In contrast, interviews with

the company’s senior leadership in 2019 suggested that HQ had less

trust in its China team, and as a result Amazon China’s autonomy

was more limited, with most of its functional units required to get

permission from headquarters on many decisions (Amazon has since

closed down its domestic business in China). Similarly, when InMobi

hired a new, untested China manager, the company decided that only

the local sales team would report to her, with all other China teams

reporting into headquarters. But over time, as she built a track record

of growth and won the trust of her bosses in India, she was able to gain

# more autonomy for her team.

It’s also helpful to note that there are diﬀerent ways trust can develop.

In some cases, it may simply take time to develop naturally, while in

other cases, organizations can build trust into their cultures through concerted, intentional eﬀorts. Netﬂix oﬀers a particularly illustrative

## example of the latter: Its culture of radical transparency and trust

encourages managers to only hire people whom they feel they can

really trust, and to whom they can therefore feel comfortable giving

substantial autonomy. This is evident across its global teams — for

example, its business development director in Brazil was given the

authority to sign contracts and agreements on behalf of Netﬂix without

approval from anyone. Similarly, its director of marketing in Italy was

entrusted to use the entire marketing budget for Italy however he

wanted, with no oversight from his American boss.

Effective implementation takes planning and communication.

These three questions can help you determine how much autonomy

to provide your international teams — but of course, ﬁguring this

out is just the ﬁrst step. The next step is to develop a plan to actually implement these diﬀerent levels and types of autonomy around the world. That means working with diﬀerent departments to

specify exactly where and how autonomy should be granted, and then

making sure that information is clearly documented and communicated

# throughout the organization.

To start, managers should explicitly describe the categories of decisions

that will likely be encountered (with speciﬁc examples of each), and

determine who will be responsible for making them. Once they’ve

developed this plan, home oﬃce managers can work with their

counterparts on the ground to ensure smooth implementation. For

instance, in answering the questions above, an executive at a U.S.-

based Internet company determined that they should give their China

team greater autonomy — they just weren’t sure exactly where or

how. As such, they began conducting detailed planning sessions with

representatives from every major department to identify areas where it

would make the most sense to increase the China team’s autonomy. This

led to concrete agreements with several departments:

## On the sales team, managers both at headquarters and in local oﬃces

agreed that if a customer from the Chinese market was a global

customer, the home oﬃce would take the lead, with the local team

providing support. But if a customer was local, the China team would

handle it themselves, and would have the authority to decide on prices,

# hold events, etc.

Marketing took a slightly diﬀerent approach: Leadership decided that

the local team should entirely develop its own marketing strategies, since eﬀective user acquisition strategies were very diﬀerent in the U.S.

and Chinese markets. They decided that to ensure speed and agility, the

local team shouldn’t have to consult with the home oﬃce before making

marketing decisions, as long as they stayed within the approved budget

and reported on the return on these investments.

Conversely, on the product front, the company determined that less

autonomy was needed. Since the China market used the same product

as other markets, the product team was centralized at the home oﬃce.

However, a few engineers were assigned to focus on requests from

the Chinese market in order to meet location-speciﬁc needs for new

# features or product modiﬁcations.

Of course, this is just one company’s approach. The details will vary

widely based on the speciﬁc industry and market you’re hoping to enter.

Depending on the pace of the sector, your reliance on local assets, and

your level of trust in local leaders, you’ll need to determine which

overseas divisions will beneﬁt from a more centralized structure, and which will be better oﬀ making decisions more independently — and

then develop a detailed, well-communicated plan to turn those ideas

# into actions.
