Executives have always been—and always will be—expected to

produce results. But today they’re expected to produce them in a

fundamentally diﬀerent way. Gone are the days of the heroic individual

leading from the front. Instead, in most corporations decision-making

has become decentralized, and leaders are now supposed to empower

and enable their people. Because of that they’ve had to give up

considerable control. As Raﬀaella Sadun and her colleagues reported in

2022), people skills—often described as “soft skills”—are now especially

# critical for leaders.

We’ve observed ample evidence of this new reality in our work as

researchers, coaches, and leadership advisers. And we’ve also observed

that executives are having a hard time adapting to it. For starters, the

terms “soft skills” and “people skills” are used to refer to a wide range of

competencies and capabilities, leaving many executives confused about

what exactly they entail. (For more on this, see the sidebar “What Kind

of People Skills Do You Need?”) In addition, few aspiring CEOs entering

the succession process have mastered the complete array of these skills,

and few newly appointed CEOs have them fully ready to deploy. That

shouldn’t be surprising. No leader who has built a career on making

expert contributions and exercising hands-on control can be expected

to make the leap overnight to a people-centric style.

Yet reliable information about how to acquire people skills is scant. To

ﬁnd out more—about what skills executives struggle to learn and what

learning strategies pay oﬀ—we analyzed assessment, development,

and interview data gathered by Spencer Stuart, one of the world’s

top leadership advisory ﬁrms. Most Fortune 500 companies partner

with advisers like Spencer Stuart to discover and develop succession

candidates, so this data can be considered strong evidence of today’s

# leadership requirements.

In our analysis we studied 75 CEO successions, involving 235

candidates, that took place at large-cap companies in the United States

and Europe from 2009 to 2019. Forty-seven of those companies were

public. We examined the correlation between CEO skills and ﬁrm

performance, as measured by shareholder return, revenue growth, and

operating margins. We also interviewed a subset of leaders about their

development experiences to understand the variety of styles they used

to deliver results. In doing so we looked for evidence of strengths

## and developmental opportunities along the spectrum between directive

and empowering styles. We also studied the executives’ ability to

work through networks and to enhance organizational performance by

instilling and leveraging people skills.

In this article we’ll outline our ﬁndings. First, showcasing the stories

of several of the candidates in our study, we’ll describe the extended

journey that most aspiring CEOs must go through to properly develop

the people skills necessary for leadership today. Then we’ll lay out a few

guidelines for anyone embarking on such a journey. (We’ve disguised

the identities of the people whose stories we share, at times combining

them to protect their privacy and capture the full range of experiences

we observed.)

# What Kind of People Skills Do You Need?

Leaders need to work effectively with people in small groups, across

networks, and across the organization. Here are the skills most important in

# each situation.

Asking good questions, listening, empathizing, and empowering (in

## small groups and one-on-one interactions).

These skills allow leaders to draw wisdom, insight, and creativity out

of their people, solve problems collectively, and foster a sense of

# psychological safety.

Collaborating and influencing (across networks).

Agility and innovation depend on cooperation among disciplines and units

both inside and outside the organization and the ability to build and work

# through informal relationships.

## Culture-shaping and aligning (across the organization).

To enable, motivate, and inspire people on a large scale, leaders must be

able to communicate a compelling direction or purpose, ensure that the

organization’s processes and culture support the stated objectives, and act

# as role models in the day-to-day.

# A Three-Stage Journey

How can leaders who fall short on soft skills develop a more enabling

# style?

The primary lesson we gleaned from our interviews is that there’s no

one moment when everything snaps into place. People love stories of

sudden conversions, which exist in every culture. Think of the biblical

story of Saul, who suddenly became the Apostle Paul after being struck

blind by God on the road to Damascus. However, most transformations

don’t happen this way. Instead they involve wandering and uncertainty,

inner battles, and protracted periods of personal struggle. A better

analogy might be the story of Odysseus, who had a long and arduous

# journey back to Ithaca from Troy.

So it is with broadening your repertoire of people skills. It’s not a

single event but an involved process that unfolds over time, often

uncomfortably, with many twists and turns. That said, there are

## predictable stages and challenges along the way.

The ﬁrst stage is the departure, during which the leader recognizes the

need for a change and deliberately starts to leave behind familiar ways

of working. The second is the voyage, a time of transition during which

the leader encounters obstacles and trials that teach important lessons

and open the path to transformation. Finally, there’s the return, during

which leaders arrive at a new understanding of who they are and what

kind of leader they want to be and start to transfer what they’ve learned

# to others.

Now let’s explore each of these stages.

# The Departure

Leaders alter their habitual—and successful—ways of doing things only

when they become aware of a gap between where they are and where

they want to be. The catalyst might be a particular event or feedback

from colleagues or coaches. But usually people embark on a concerted

eﬀort to change only after multiple experiences and conversations make

them realize that their behavior is impeding outcomes they care about.

Take Flavio, who worked as the general manager of engineering at a

major technology ﬁrm before becoming its COO and then its CEO. In his

role as general manager, Flavio was eager to enhance the ways that his

sales teams positioned products and to increase sales. In his view they

weren’t getting products to market fast enough, so he drove them harder

and harder. Soon he began to hear that people felt he was pushing his

own agenda instead of the company’s—but he dismissed that as the

grumbling of those resistant to change. Then colleagues he respected

began to withdraw from conversations with him—including people

whose support was critical. His behavior, one former team member told

him candidly, was alienating the very people he needed to make his

go-to-market strategy work. An executive coach helped him understand

the core of the problem—he wasn’t crafting strategy jointly with others

—and acknowledge the urgent need to change.

Broadening your repertoire of people skills is not a single event but an involved process that unfolds over time, often uncomfortably, with many twists and turns.

The impetus for change can come in other ways. We’ve often seen

executives emulate bosses with more-developed people skills—usually

## in the context of an organizational shift toward a more empowering

culture—and discover that their new behaviors help them achieve

valued results.

That’s what happened with Rajiv, a newly appointed divisional CEO.

Rajiv’s boss, the company’s CEO, had launched an initiative to instill

## a culture of collaboration and psychological safety in his leadership

team, which included Rajiv. Keen to follow the lead of his boss, Rajiv

replicated the eﬀort with his own unit. Though he initially did so in

a perfunctory, “tick the box” manner, he was surprised to ﬁnd that

he and his team were having more-open conversations. He also began

to receive candid feedback on his leadership style—which, he learned,

instilled fear and encouraged silence. Rajiv turned to an external coach,

assuming the “ﬁx” was a simple matter of picking up better listening

skills. But the coach helped him recognize a big disconnect between

how he saw himself and how others saw him and made him see how

deeply rooted, pervasive, and alienating his controlling tendencies had

become. His “aha!” moment—the real beginning of his journey—came

when he realized just how much time and eﬀort he would have to devote

to improving the way he worked with others.

In our experience many leaders underestimate the extent of change

required and need the help and perspective of a trusted partner—an

adviser, a mentor, or a coach. Not all of them reach the departure stage.

And the ones who do embark on a genuine voyage of discovery will need

humility, self-awareness, patience, and resilience to complete it.

# The Voyage

Having watched many leaders move through this stage, we’ve found

that those who succeed engage in three key practices.

Creating a new context for learning. Executives tend to pursue two

main kinds of learning as they work on changing their behavior. One

involves putting themselves in situations where they have no direct

authority and so are compelled to develop a more indirect, empowering

style. We call this outside-in learning.

Outside-in learning can be particularly helpful for CEO candidates

whose leadership style is ﬁrmly rooted in holding people accountable,

driving performance, and achieving results. Such leaders often have a

hard time experimenting with a new style while working with teams

that are familiar with their old one. By taking on roles or projects

outside their own areas—roles in which they have no history and must

adopt a collaborative manner—leaders can develop people skills to use

# later with their own teams.

Take Karen, a leader in a big industrial ﬁrm who had worked her way up

through the hierarchy by cultivating a directive leadership style. With

every promotion, Karen had taken on additional responsibilities, but

when she ﬁnally moved into a C-suite position, she realized she wasn’t

well-known outside her division and didn’t know how to lead people

who weren’t her direct reports.

Many leaders underestimate the extent of change required and need the help of a trusted partner—an adviser, a mentor, or a coach.

Luckily, at around that time she took on an external board role

that gave her an opportunity for outside-in learning. The board

meetings demanded that she and her fellow directors navigate complex

multistakeholder situations with competing interests, and to do that

work successfully she had to learn how to exert inﬂuence without

authority—for example, by asking questions and probing for desired

outcomes. She was able to sharpen those skills further when, in addition

to her new role in the C-suite, she was asked to lead her ﬁrm’s diversity,

# equity, and inclusion eﬀorts.

Those experiences helped Karen become the kind of leader that she knew she needed to be. Even so, the transition was diﬃcult: Working

under the pressures of her new role, she found herself at times striving

to control even minute aspects of the tasks at hand, an old habit at odds

with a more inclusive style of leadership. In those moments the outside

work she was doing helped her avoid ingrained patterns and maintain

her focus on empowering others.

Leaders can also transform their style by taking skills that they’ve

developed within their own teams and subunits or even in their

personal lives and using them more broadly. We call this inside-out

# learning.

Consider Alex, a recently promoted C-suite executive in an industrial

company. For years, Alex had been struggling to adopt a softer style. His

drive to succeed often made him feel the need to control outcomes,

and at times he was perceived as competitive, highly strung, and

overbearing. His opportunity for inside-out learning started at home,

where he and his wife were working on developing a collaborative

parenting style that would allow them to support their son through his diﬃcult teenage years.

# Giulia Neri

When Alex took on his new C-suite role, he realized that some of the

skills he was cultivating with his family—active listening, recognizing

and managing his own emotions, asking more than telling—might be

useful to him as a leader, so he tried them out. The feedback he received

was positive, and he kept going. Previously, he had sought to push his

unit’s interests over those of his peers’, but now, gradually, he started

seeing win-win opportunities. What he had learned on the inside, in his

personal life, helped accelerate his journey.

Enlisting helpers. At every stage in the development journey, you need

partners who can hold you accountable, provide honest feedback, help

you connect the dots, and hold up mirrors revealing your true nature.

Odysseus would never have been able to make it past the Sirens on his

# own.

Kevin, the CEO of a large ﬁnancial ﬁrm, is a case in point. He joined

the ﬁrm ﬁve years before being appointed CEO. At his old ﬁrm, where

he had been the head of the ﬁnance function, he had developed a

reputation for having sharp elbows. But his new ﬁrm prided itself on

a culture of mutual respect and warmth, and in that context his style

was jarring.

When the ﬁrm began its CEO succession process, Kevin’s stellar results

made him an obvious candidate. But his ﬁrm’s head of HR made it clear

that he’d never get the top job unless he improved his ability to consider

and include others’ views. With stakes that high, he began working on

his people skills in earnest. As is often the case with smart, ambitious

people, Kevin was able to adapt enough to get the top job. But the

changes he made were superﬁcial, representing his “best” but certainly

not his “everyday” self. Once in the CEO role, he regularly found himself

falling into old patterns.

To really change, Kevin realized, he needed the help of others.

He started by setting up an accountability system with an external

coach, who in regular sessions worked with him to form new habits

and understand what triggered his domineering tendencies. He also

asked a small group of trusted colleagues to call him out on his old behaviors. Initially, he had a diﬃcult time getting honest feedback from

the people in his inner circle because they were afraid of upsetting

him. So he started working to create greater psychological safety. He

began regularly expressing gratitude for feedback, making a point of

identifying aspects of it that he particularly appreciated, even if he

disagreed. That simple technique set a virtuous cycle in motion: The

more he allowed his team members to help him, the more they were

willing and able to give him support.

Persisting through (and learning from) setbacks. The line to the ﬁnish

is rarely straight. As the stakes get higher and performance anxiety

ﬂares up, executives often fall back into the old style that made

them successful for years. Alternatively, they demonstrate only a naive

understanding of their new skills, which produces less-than-optimal

results. Two steps forward, one step back. The adaptation journey

almost invariably involves backsliding and overshooting. To keep going,

you need to focus on small wins.

One new CEO, Maria, was eager to fully empower her team but fell

into the trap of delegating ownership of too many decisions. At two

## weeklong strategy oﬀ-sites with her top 30 leaders, for example, she

hoped to co-create a new strategic direction. She was aware that the

last time she had tried to give her team more authority over wide-

ranging decisions, it had accomplished little—and its members had

felt frustrated by what they perceived to be a lack of direction. In a

conversation with her coach, Maria recognized that a better approach

would be to retain authority over key decisions but gather input more

inclusively. The process worked at the ﬁrst oﬀ-site and set the stage for a

## more freewheeling and productive second session.

Paradoxically, as their capacity to be more empowering evolves, leaders can more intentionally—and effectively—use a directive approach in situations that call for it.

By demonstrating the potential of a new style and eliciting positive

feedback, small wins start to shift the leader’s motivation from necessity

(“I need to be a better communicator”) to possibility (“I’m working on

communicating better because it will help me accomplish my goal”)

and identity (“I’m working on communicating better because that is

who I want to be”). These subtle changes help leaders become more

self-reﬂective and persistent—invaluable traits for anybody trying to

deﬁne and anchor a new self.

# The Return

## The moment of return arrives when, after the trials and tribulations of

the voyage, leaders at last internalize a more empowering leadership

style, see it as a genuine reﬂection of their new selves, and can employ

it across the board in their professional lives. Their learning is far from

ﬁnished at this point, but it has become self-sustaining.

To be clear, there’s no “best” style. Leaders must always exercise

judgment about when to be more directive or more enabling. We’ve

seen several instances of executives veering too far in an inclusive

direction when a more commanding one was called for. But when

leaders are equipped with a broader repertoire and hard-won insights

about the impact of their behavior, they’re better able to ﬂex in

response to what’s needed. Paradoxically, as their capacity to be more

empowering evolves, leaders can more intentionally—and eﬀectively—

use a directive approach in situations that call for it.

A second marker of having entered the return stage is a desire to share

and amplify your learning. This is critical because it increases your

organization’s capacity for developing its workforce.

Three examples come to mind. One executive implemented a long-

term succession-planning process to ensure that up-and-coming leaders

would have the opportunity to learn how to exert inﬂuence without

authority. Another executive, a lawyer who led one of his ﬁrm’s biggest

practices, realized that his ﬁrm’s performance-management system was

impeding the kind of developmental discussions that he had beneﬁted

from, so he worked with HR to overhaul the entire system. A third

executive realized that the way his organization conducted quarterly

business reviews didn’t lend itself to the introspective conversations

he had come to value in his adaptation journey. So he revamped the

process to encourage others to own their mistakes and make themselves

# vulnerable for the sake of learning.

# What Best Predicts Success as a CEO?

Hint: It’s not how well candidates have delivered results in the past.

The successful CEO candidates in our sample scored higher than the

# unsuccessful ones on three dimensions:

Delivering results (the ability to meet or beat goals and personally improve

# performance)

Collaborating and influencing (the ability to work with and through others

who are not under their direct control)

Self-evaluation and adjustment (the capacity to update your point of view

## and behavior on the basis of new information)

Once candidates took office, however, their past success at delivering

results did not have any effect on their performance. Collaborating

and influencing, on the other hand, were associated with higher total

shareholder return, and self-evaluation and adjustment were associated

## with higher revenue growth and greater increases in operating margins.

# Starting Your Own Journey

Most high-performing executives today intellectually “get” the case for

better people skills and know that their well-honed directive styles have

signiﬁcant downsides. But learning and sticking to new habits and skills

## —especially under pressure—demands commitment and eﬀort. Here

are a few tips to help you get on your way.

Know what you’re in for. At the outset upping your people skills can

seem simple enough. But people who lack knowledge or experience

often overestimate their own competence—the notorious Dunning-

Kruger eﬀect. And even experienced managers tend to believe they’re

better at coaching than they really are. So it’s important to develop a

realistic sense of the time and eﬀort required to genuinely adapt your

style. Knowing what milestones to look out for—such as early wins and

# recovery from a setback—can help.

Map out your learning agenda. Remember that you might need to

work on your skills in particular settings. You might be great at

collaboratively navigating complex multistakeholder situations where

you have no direct authority over those you’re working with, but have

a hard time doing the same with your own team. Or you might excel

at listening and fostering psychological safety with your team but ﬁnd

yourself unable to leverage those interpersonal skills to get things done

# with your peers across the organization.

Once you’ve identiﬁed a strength that you want to develop, experiment

with using it in diﬀerent contexts. Recall Karen, whose roles on an

external board and heading her ﬁrm’s DEI initiative helped her learn

to exert inﬂuence without having direct authority. Her experience was

akin to that of many executives we’ve worked with: Only after they

gained perspective in a new project, role, or setting did they truly

understand the meaning of developmental advice they had received—

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Leadership Odyssey

## one reason that temporary assignments, side projects, and job rotations

can be such eﬀective triggers for transformation. It’s hard to change if

you just keep doing more of the same.

Create space for learning. Carving out regular time for reﬂection is a

simple way to speed your progress, capitalize on small wins, and learn

more from your inevitable setbacks. But this sort of daily exercise works

best if you also periodically pause to contemplate the big picture. As

Ron Heifetz of Harvard’s Kennedy School has put it, it’s important to

## spend time “down on the dance ﬂoor” and “up in the balcony.”

Two of the aspiring CEOs in our study used the strategy of regular

reﬂection very eﬀectively. One spent her 20-minute ride to work every

morning thinking about the interactions of the previous day and

deﬁning one learning intention for the day. The second blocked out

a regular time in his week to reﬂect on his successes, failures, and

challenges as a leader. He also used that time to seek feedback from

his colleagues, often by asking them such questions as “What did you

see me do/hear me say?” and “What would you like to see me do/hear

me say?”

Learning requires you to recognize the patterns you fall into. Kevin

identiﬁed his by writing in a journal about the many situations in

which he could have been more appreciative and less hard-charging

with colleagues. Later he would analyze those situations in detail—

and visualize other ways of responding. A coach helped him recognize

that his abrasive self often emerged when he felt impatient, so they

developed a plan: Whenever he sensed his impatience rising, he would

press each ﬁngertip with his thumb before responding. Just creating

that small space between stimulus and response helped him react as he

intended.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Leadership Odyssey

Don’t go it alone. Coaches and mentors outside your normal reporting

lines can be very helpful, but you’ll also need to rely on close colleagues

## and in some instances even your family or friends—people who can

hold you to account and oﬀer in-the-moment feedback in ways that

# nobody else can.

With that in mind, select a couple of colleagues you can trust to provide

you with honest feedback and ideas for improvement. By doing so,

you’ll demonstrate your commitment to becoming a better leader. You’ll

also make clear to those around you that you care, which ensures that

when you slip up, as you inevitably will, you’ll get help and the beneﬁt

of the doubt. But watch out: When you ask for feedback, be prepared to

follow up on it. We’ve found that the leaders most likely to fail in their

adaptation journeys are those whose colleagues tire of giving feedback

because nothing seems to come of it.

. . .

More than ever, we need leaders who can harness ingenuity and foster

engagement. At the top level of organizations, success requires a broad

repertoire of people skills that make it possible to lead others indirectly

on a large scale. For many executives, gaining them will involve a

journey of transformation, one that’s likely to be longer and more diﬃcult than they’d imagined—but ultimately also more rewarding.
