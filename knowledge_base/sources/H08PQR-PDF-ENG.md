Family businesses operate in a space where trust is assumed, roles

are inherited, and emotions run deep. That intimacy can be a strength,

but without structure, it’s also a vulnerability. When family dynamics

become the guiding factor when a business faces a big decision, it’s only

## a matter of time before misaligned expectations, unequal treatment, or

legal ambiguity threaten the very thing everyone is working to protect.

In my teaching on and advisory work with family-controlled companies,

I use a simple mantra to get people to focus on this vital message. The

mantra is: Make policies before it’s personal.

This is more than just a governance ideal—it’s a survival strategy. It

## ensures that rules, not relationships, drive decisions. When formal

policies exist, families can focus on growing the business rather than

untangling disputes or nursing resentments.

Let’s explore what this looks like in practice through the story of a real

(but anonymized) family business that got it wrong before learning to

get it right.

# A Family at a Crossroads

The Rossis were a third-generation European family in the hospitality

## business. With 15 luxury boutique hotels across multiple continents and

a growing brand, the business had expanded signiﬁcantly under the

stewardship of the founder’s children. But success bred complexity.

When a member of the third generation, John, married and brought

his spouse into the company as an employee, questions about fairness,

accountability, and ownership surfaced. Other family members quietly

wondered: Was John’s wife qualiﬁed? Who made that decision? Should

other spouses be allowed to join the business, too?

At the same time, roles among the siblings and cousins began

to blur. Though a second-generation family member still held the

CEO title, decision-making increasingly shifted to third-generation

## relatives without formal acknowledgment of the change. One third-

generation cousin began running operations. The CFO from the second

generation increasingly found themselves sidelined. Other members of

the third generation started stepping in as well, some without clear

responsibilities, others uncertain if they were expected to join the

business or if simply expressing interest would be enough to secure a

# role.

When John later ﬁled for divorce, and his now-estranged spouse

claimed a share of business ownership, everything that had gone

unspoken came to a head.

The Rossis faced a messy legal challenge because they hadn’t put in

place rules or policies that set out how they’d handle a family member’s

divorce. At stake was more than a slice of equity: As the family disagreed

over the path forward, they faced the very real risk of tearing apart the

# business and the family behind it.

# A Lack of Basic Governance Structures

The Rossis had grown rapidly, but their governance had not kept pace.

# Speciﬁcally:

- There were no shareholder agreements deﬁning who could own

## shares, no dispute-resolution process, and no clarity on what would

happen in the event of divorce.

- There was no buy-sell mechanism setting out a process for family

members who wanted to liquidate their holdings.

- There was no requirement that any family member who holds equity

and plans to marry needed their partner to sign a prenup and create an

estate plan that limited non-family ownership in the event of divorce

# or death.

- There was no formal governance structure for decision-making and

# conﬂict resolution.

- There was no board of advisors that included independent members to

## guide strategy, succession, and sensitive decisions.

Although all of these deﬁciencies created problems, the lack of an

## eﬀective board structure for a company of this size and complexity

created special challenges. Decisions were made informally among

family members, often based on emotion rather than objectivity.

Had the Rossis established a board of advisors, and included

independent, non-family members, they would have beneﬁted from

## external perspective, professional accountability, and a buﬀer between

## personal dynamics and business governance. Independent board

members don’t just lend credibility; they oﬀer objectivity when the

family is too close to see clearly.

Standardizing a process around documents such as a prenup is also

important. It’s not enough to decree that every family member who

owns a share of the company must have a prenup; it’s also vital that the

terms set out in these agreements be relatively uniform, so there are no

surprises if an equity-owning couple does divorce. To further level the

playing ﬁeld, couples that married before this policy was put in place

can be encouraged to create post-nuptial agreements that set out terms

for how business equity would remain with the spouse who was born

into the family if the marriage ends.

Formal, legally binding policies like these aren’t about distrusting

family members. They’re about protecting everyone equally from

unnecessary risk. They also reduce the risk of unilateral decisions

by clarifying who has authority and under what conditions.

More importantly, they help ensure that the business can survive

# generational transitions.

Although the documents and structures are the end result of this

process, the discussions that are required to put them in place are

valuable, too. The way families decide how to handle situations in

which someone wants to sell their share, or what happens if someone

divorces, tend to surface diﬀerences in the way people view the kind

of relationship, commitment, and duty that family members have to

the business—and to each other. The open dialogue it takes to put

these policies in place can be beneﬁcial to get issues and diﬀerent

# perspectives into the open.

# Setting Hiring Rules

John’s spouse had been hired without a formal interview or job

description. Other family members had come through opportunity;

others through obligation. Performance expectations were vague.

Titles were handed out based on family hierarchy, not qualiﬁcations.

Compensation for family members was all over the map: Some family

members were paid signiﬁcantly more than non-family members who

held the same role, and others appeared undercompensated because

their salary had been set with an eye toward how much they stood to

# gain from their equity in the business.

This left non-family employees demoralized and created tension among

cousins. When John’s marriage ended, the debate over whether John’s

spouse should stay employed became personal, emotional, and divisive.

It didn’t need to be this way.

This company, like all family-controlled ﬁrms, needed a set of

employment practices for family members. These policies should:

- Create a formal hiring process for all roles, family and non-family.

- Write down clear expectations around which family members are

eligible for employment, and what qualiﬁcations they need to be

considered for roles.

- Ensure everyone hired has a clear job descriptions and performance

metrics tied to accountability.

- Set in place a code of conduct and grievance procedures applicable to

# everyone.

- Agree on a fair and standard way to set compensation for family and

# non-family members.

Clearly deﬁned hiring and employment criteria help dispel perceptions

of favoritism. Transparent processes promote fairness, ensuring no

one feels that a family connection outweighs performance. A formal

grievance process empowers all employees to raise issues safely and

constructively before they spill into the family dynamic.

# The Turning Point

The Rossi family’s crisis was painful, but it was also clarifying. The

family hired a family business advisor and began putting the necessary

policies in place. They created a family charter, drafted employment

and ownership policies, and agreed that all future marriages involving

family shareholders would be accompanied by a prenup.

Today, the business is stronger and so is the family. Roles are clearer.

Expectations are aligned. And when disagreements arise, they’re

handled through process, not personality.

. . .

My message on these issues should be clear: Don’t wait for a crisis

to get clarity. Too many family enterprises treat formal policies as

## something optional, or worse, as something cold and untrusting.

Proactive policies are the most powerful tools for preserving what

makes family businesses special: unity, purpose, and continuity.

Putting policies into place doesn’t mean turning your back on trust. It

means creating a structure that honors it and allows families to focus on

building their legacy instead of putting out ﬁres.

If your family business doesn’t yet have a clear policy on ownership,

employment, and marital agreements, now is the time to act. Not

because conﬂict is inevitable, but because peace is worth protecting.
