Chris’s product management team is faltering. Despite managing to

hit their deadlines and churn out the basic product upgrades, sales are

down, and it’s hard to remember the last time they had a breakthrough

idea. They want to innovate, but can’t seem to muster the energy to do

# it.

Chris’s team is hardly alone. Business stressors like layoﬀs, economic

headwinds, and geopolitical instability are depleting teams, causing

one in four employees globally to feel burned out. These factors

are compounded by the strains of hybrid working, which has made

collaboration harder for teams that are increasingly siloed and

fragmented.

Yet in this era of cutbacks and constraint, not only do we expect our

teams to do more with less, but we need them to innovate — and quickly

— to drive growth.

The blow to eﬀective collaboration matters enormously. Smarter

collaboration leads to higher revenue and proﬁt, more comprehensive

## solutions, and deeper customer and employee satisfaction. But until

these beneﬁts start to ﬂow in, collaboration is often seen as costly, risky,

and time consuming. With a boost of energy, however, people are much

more motivated to put their heads together and come up with novel

# solutions.

Leaders who promote positive energy are associated with stronger

## innovation and organizational performance as well as employees

who are more engaged, productive, and satisﬁed with their jobs.

These leaders are not necessarily charismatic or extroverted or

any other speciﬁc personality type. Rather, research shows that

leaders who are seen as energizing behave in certain ways, such as

exhibiting compassion and humility and recognizing others’ eﬀorts

# with generosity and gratitude.

Beyond that baseline, though, today’s complicated times require even

more from leaders because teams need diﬀerent approaches depending

on why their energy is ﬂagging. In our forthcoming research, my

colleagues and I surveyed 3,000 employees and conducted in-depth

interviews with leaders and working professionals. We discovered

three diﬀerent paths that successful, energizing leaders must take to

## harness positive energy for strong hybrid collaboration and its resulting

performance outcomes: channeling, generating, and multiplying.

# Channeling Energy

In some teams, the problem isn’t that individual team members lack

energy, but rather that their eﬀorts are scattered across too many

diﬀerent projects at once. A leader of this kind of team needs to channel

energy by focusing everyone’s disparate attention and eﬀorts in the

same direction to become more collectively powerful.

Since the start of Covid-era hybrid working, time spent in virtual

meetings has skyrocketed (one Microsoft study showed an increase

of 252% since February 2020). Employees are increasingly pulled into

back-to-back meetings, leaving them no time to even handle critical

follow-up tasks, let alone recharge. In these situations, the problem is

not only that people’s energy is sapped by the constant switching costs

but also that their remaining energy is split across too many priorities.

And at companies with recent layoﬀs, remaining employees may be

tapped for even more tasks and projects.

Another insidious aspect for these teams is that managers may

misinterpret team members’ divided energy and attention. For example,

a manager of a hybrid team might jump to a conclusion that a person

working from home is actually lazy, checked out, or otherwise unhelpful

when the actual root cause of their low energy is overcommitment. This

is a case of the fundamental attribution error, a common cognitive bias

where people downplay situational factors and exaggerate personality-

related ones. This faulty assumption leads to a ﬁxation on monitoring

inputs or micromanaging, which were cited in our research as some of

the most common ways leaders deplete energy.

This joint problem of overstretched employees plus leaders who are

under-empathetic about their situation is so prevalent in hybrid teams

that leaders need to investigate why their team’s energy seems so low.

Asking them directly is one approach (especially if it’s part of a naturally

ﬂowing conversation), but in certain cases — such as when trust or

psychological safety is low — an anonymous, open-ended team survey

could generate more candid feedback.

In either case, the leader of an overstretched team needs to channel

the collective’s energy by focusing disparate energies toward common

# aims. They must:

Emphasize overarching goals — not missed opportunities. Even if

people have many responsibilities, it’s easier to cope when the objective

is clear. During your meetings and in-person interactions, regularly

reframe competing demands in this context. For example, emphasize

how various initiatives come together to improve overall customer

service, or visually chart out how diﬀerent work streams merge into a

# single product-development roadmap.

On the ﬂip side, don’t stew over the opportunity cost of this vision: Once

you’ve made and communicated priorities, accept that your team needs

to say no to some new opportunities that might arise. As one survey

respondent put it, “Don’t expend your energy on what didn’t happen.”

Workers are already on edge: Don’t make it worse by introducing

# unnecessary stressors.

## Make overcommitment transparent — but don’t valorize busyness.

Great leaders create a forum for direct reports to share their priorities

with peers so people can spot overlaps, competing demands, and

ways to help each other. Because it’s easy to lose track of others’

work when they’re out of sight, holding this discussion frequently is

especially important for hybrid teams. But make sure the focus is on

problem-solving ways to channel employees’ attention, rather than on

celebrating folks who are swamped with work.

Leaders who funnel brain power to a common goal make the diﬀerence.

As you might recall from your introductory physics class, the ﬁrst law

## of thermodynamics tells us that the total energy of systems remains

constant. What matters is how that energy is directed.

# Generating Energy

Some teams are genuinely depleted overall. Groups of employees

who survived the latest round of layoﬀs often experience a sense of

exhaustion and emotional turmoil, having lost frequent contact with

people who were not only coworkers but also friends. The hybrid or

## remote environment compounds feelings of isolation because in online

meetings we typically have fewer shared sidebar conversations that

build rapport and interpersonal trust.

To combat this problem, leaders need to generate energy — essentially

building something from nothing. This approach is potentially the most

well understood of the three outlined in this article and has been an

area of focus of organizational leaders during the pandemic. That said,

our research has surfaced three crucial actions for leaders to take to

# generate energy:

Co-create a sense of meaning — don’t force your own vision. People

often get caught up in the minutiae of their ﬁelds or customer

engagements, but adopting a bigger-picture view of how they’re helping

clients, patients, or other stakeholders has measurable and lasting

eﬀects on motivation and performance. Leaders trying to increase

a group’s energy should work with employees to unearth these

connections between their work and a greater purpose. Don’t make

your own purpose something you force onto others (or even politely

impose on them); this kind of egotistical or self-serving behavior is one

of the biggest energy drains our survey respondents identiﬁed, whereas

co-creation is respectful and empowering.

Elevate others’ dignity and worth — not just their utility. Leaders need

to treat their people as multifaceted individuals who are integral to the

company’s success. Acknowledging their special attributes can ﬁll them

with a deeper sense of value and determination. As one survey taker

noted, these leaders “ask how you are with a smile, listen to what you

have to say, and make eye contact.”

The opposite behavior is using employees as a mere means to an

end, which can be a bigger trap in a remote context — where email, eﬃciency, and the quantity of output tend to be overemphasized.

Focus on momentum — not only the end goal. As shown by Teresa

Amabile’s research, frequent progress in one’s work boosts positive

## emotions, motivation, and creative output, while setbacks of any size

can have an outsize negative eﬀect. So, while a group might not have

the energy to take a big leap forward, small achievements can play

a huge role in generating momentum and oﬀsetting the energy loss

associated with defeat. These wins shouldn’t occur haphazardly, but

instead be grounded in a strategic goal that has been divided into short-

# term milestones.

# Multiplying Energy

Perhaps the most powerful of the three paths to boosting energy,

leaders who are energy multipliers seek out and harness the seemingly

## unrelated variety of strengths, talents, and experiences of team

# members.

Back when I was leading teams at McKinsey & Company, it became

clear that certain teams were fully tapping into each team member’s

professional, cultural, and educational diversity, while others seemed

to coast on common experiences, leading to far less innovative or

# insightful solutions.

In hybrid teams, the risk is that unique sources of strength are not even

uncovered, let alone put to their full use. Remote work is associated with

more siloed working, which limits people’s opportunity to understand

not just others’ knowledge bases and perspectives, but potentially to

uncover their own strengths as well.

Our research shows that energy multipliers:

Reveal their own idiosyncrasies — despite the vulnerability. By

speaking about the various aspects of their expertise, personality, and

life experiences, leaders get others thinking and sharing about their

own multidimensional proﬁles — which is generally a fun and exciting

exercise for people to engage in.

One survey taker gave this advice to his manager as the single biggest

energy booster: “Talk to me about what’s going on in your life and who

you really are.” While this self-revelation might feel risky, it’s actually

a low-cost, proven way of building trust that’s often lacking in hybrid

# teams.

Notice others’ different sides — not just your own. Leaders shouldn’t

talk about themselves too much. They must also show interest in their

employees’ complex competencies and viewpoints. If asking people

about themselves doesn’t get them energized, not much else will. And

according to our research subjects, this interest can lead to a “morale

boost,” “greater focus,” and “wanting to do more,” among countless

# other beneﬁts.

Focus on learning and growth — and not so much on control. Energy

multipliers are not afraid of experimentation or losing control. They

embolden others to use their individual strengths to make original and

valuable contributions to the team’s strategic goals. If someone misses

their target, the energy-multiplying leader doesn’t consider it a failure

but rather an opportunity for growing skills and business sense. In a

similar vein, energy multipliers don’t micromanage — they trust their

people to do their best to improve and perform. But they also don’t leave

them in the dark, especially if they need guidance working through an

# issue.

One example comes from Abigail Posner, director, creative works at

Google. A creative team’s morale initially sank when its clients weren’t

acting on the team’s written strategic recommendations for their

advertising campaigns. The advertisers struggled to envision how the

changes could help.

The team leader was known for celebrating diﬀerences, however,

which opened up the opportunity for one person with a ﬁlmmaking

background to jump in and create a mock YouTube ad that incorporated

the recommended changes. Then a former journalist volunteered to

craft sales materials for the new ad. Combining these talents allowed

the team to present their recommendations in a way that was more

resonant for their clients, which resulted in greater client value,

# increased sales, and a reenergized team.

Smarter collaboration requires infusions of energy. Leaders of

collaborative teams have the opportunity to promote stronger results,

## faster innovation, and higher employee engagement when they

generate, channel, or multiply employees’ energy. What we’ve seen

from the recent upheavals brought by Covid, economic uncertainty, and

global instability is that low or negative energy is a threat to business

growth. And as this uncertainty still prevails, positive energy is no

longer a nice-to-have but a must-have so that teams can focus, innovate,

and ultimately grow their businesses.
