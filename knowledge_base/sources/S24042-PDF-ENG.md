New CEOs frequently face a conundrum. While the people around

them publicly express high hopes for what they’ll be able to achieve,

in private those same people are skeptical. As a result many new CEOs

underestimate how much work it takes to build conﬁdence in their

leadership—something that’s crucial to their ability to eﬀectively drive

change. Buoyed by outward expressions of support and eager to make

their mark, they steam ahead with bold new initiatives before they’ve

won the full support and trust of all stakeholders—and that gets them

# into trouble.

You can’t blame new CEOs for falling into the speed trap. The

conventional wisdom, after all, is that they have roughly 90 days to

prove themselves to their organizations. But the process actually takes

longer than that—far longer, according to our research and experience.

Gaining the conﬁdence of all stakeholders, it turns out, takes a full two

years. And only by focusing strategically and purposefully on building

trust during that period can CEOs genuinely create the conditions for

# long-term success.

How did we arrive at that two-year ﬁgure? By carefully studying nearly

1,400 CEOs who have led S&P 500 ﬁrms during this century. First we

had to devise a reliable way of deﬁning and measuring conﬁdence in

them. Typically, we think of conﬁdence as a quality that has a social

value, helping leaders inﬂuence others. But it also has a monetary

value: Investors assign multiples to stocks that reﬂect their conﬁdence

in companies’ continued ability to generate shareholder returns. We

reasoned that the enterprise multiple could be considered a measurable

proxy for the conﬁdence in their leadership that CEOs build during the various phases of their time in oﬃce. (For more on that see “The CEO

Life Cycle,” HBR, November–December 2019.) The enterprise multiple

is a company’s total enterprise value divided by its earnings before

## interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization (EBITDA); the higher

it is, the greater the conﬁdence in a CEO’s ability to deliver superior

# performance in the future.

Once we had established a widely applicable measure, we rewound

the clock to analyze how the CEOs in our study had gained people’s

conﬁdence year after year. We combined those insights with interview

data gathered by Spencer Stuart, a leadership-advisory ﬁrm that

routinely partners with organizations to improve CEO performance

(and that employs Claudius and Jason). We also looked at a range of

other indicators of CEO eﬀectiveness, including revenue growth, total

## shareholder returns, proﬁtability, and ESG performance. This blend

of quantitative and qualitative data provided us with strong evidence

about the pace at which leaders earn stakeholders’ support over time,

the ways they manage that challenge, and the beneﬁts that accrue from

getting things right.

This led us to a striking discovery: While it typically takes far longer

than we think for new CEOs to get others to believe in them, when they

focus strategically on conﬁdence building during their ﬁrst two years,

they set oﬀ a virtuous cycle that leads to a remarkable and consistent

increase in their companies’ enterprise multiples in the years that

follow. We call this increase the conﬁdence premium. (See the exhibit

During the ﬁrst two years of a CEO’s tenure little to no premium

emerges. During that period a new CEO’s words and actions are closely

monitored, but it’s generally too soon for anybody to meaningfully

evaluate their consequences. Starting in year three, however, things

change. CEOs who began with comparable multiples gradually come

to be seen as higher or lower performers—and from that point on, the

gap between the two groups continues to widen, ultimately reaching a

diﬀerence of nearly four points. That may sound small, but when one

considers the eﬀect of such a multiplier on, say, the $30 billion median

## market cap of an S&P 500 organization, the conﬁdence premium

amounts to close to $10 billion.

There’s an important lesson here: If you’re a new CEO who wants to

maximize the value you’ll create in the long term, during your ﬁrst two

years you’ll need to patiently and methodically earn the conﬁdence of

all stakeholders. In this article, drawing not only on our research and

analysis but also on Mahesh’s personal experiences as a CEO, we’ll oﬀer

guidance on how to do just that.

# A Marathon, Not a Sprint

Few things instill more conﬁdence than a strong track record does, yet if

you’re a new CEO, you start with a blank slate. So how to proceed? We’ve

identiﬁed six key practices that you should apply systematically.

Set a deliberate pace. This is crucial. We’ve worked with many new

CEOs who, feeling the pressure to deliver quick wins, hit the ground

at a full sprint, launching a variety of initiatives and pursuing multiple

objectives without having secured the alignment of the board, their

leadership team, or other key stakeholder groups. Needless to say, that

approach backﬁres because the race they’re running is not a sprint but a

marathon. A marathon requires patience, endurance, and a sustainable

long-term strategy. In a marathon time is on your side. You need to go

slow to go fast. Accepting that idea and pacing yourself accordingly will

allow you to steady your eﬀorts and help others develop faith in your

# leadership.

When Mahesh found himself caught in the speed trap as a new CEO

at Bacardi, he freed himself from time pressures by making sure all

his stakeholders appreciated that they were at the very beginning of a

marathon. Assuming the helm after spending 20 years at the company

and on the heels of several short-tenured CEOs, he recognized that

Bacardi was unstable, lacked a long-term strategic outlook, and had a

culture that didn’t support its stated values. So at the outset he made it

clear—with the board, the ownership family, and the company—that he

intended to be in the role for 10 years. Those years, he told them, would

be the best the company had ever seen.

His next task was to reboot the culture. He and his leadership team

gave their new programs memorable names like the “Best 10 Strategy”

and the “3Fs” (for “fearless, founder, family”) and talked about them

regularly. Once the employees started to understand that they had a

CEO who planned to stick around, provide stability, and bring back

## Bacardi’s culture of innovation and entrepreneurship, Mahesh and his

team began to celebrate small wins in performance and reward long-

tenured executives with new leadership positions. They showcased

daring ideas, rewarded desirable founder and family behavior, and,

ﬁnally, traveled across the world to meet workers in town halls and

# one-on-ones.

Pick your battles strategically. New CEOs can beneﬁt from quickly

launching just a few well-structured initiatives, designed to help them

## gain momentum and signal to audiences inside and outside the

organization the direction they plan to take. That approach allows you

not only to demonstrate how and where you’ll focus your energies but

also to develop a track record that gets stakeholders on your side. It

gives you a chance to notch a few early successes while building a

foundation for the larger strategic moves you’ll eventually make.

How do you decide what to focus on ﬁrst? From day one you’ll ﬁnd

yourself besieged with requests from multiple groups, all expressed

with the highest degree of urgency, and as you try to build trust and

generate support, you’ll naturally feel pressured to address them all.

Resist that impulse, which will put you on the fast track to failure.

Instead, learn to say no to most requests, no matter how exciting they

might seem. Start small and be methodical. Identify which stakeholders

you need to prioritize, choose just a few of their most critical demands,

and attend to them well.

One new CEO we worked with was swamped by the sheer volume of

requests that she received after stepping into the job. Each issue was

described to her as the most important and urgent matter she had to

contend with. As she took stock of it all, she felt overwhelmed: What

was truly important and urgent? When we began working with her not

long afterward, we found her struggling to treat all requests equally.

That approach, we told her, was a recipe for inaction and failure. To

help her move beyond that impasse we sat down with her, mapped

out all the requests she’d received across the stakeholder landscape,

and then worked with her to identify three primary and ﬁve secondary

stakeholders whose issues she felt she could successfully respond to

with a small set of early signature moves—each of which she knew

would earn the stakeholders’ conﬁdence. The process allowed her to

be proactive rather than reactive: By focusing strategically on the few

rather than trying to respond to everyone, she was able to act with

purpose, communicate clearly, and gather feedback that would help her

make subsequent moves.

Start small and be methodical. Identify which stakeholders you need to prioritize, choose just a few of their most critical demands, and attend to them well.

In a well-run succession process, new CEOs will be set up for early

wins by their predecessors. In one situation we were involved with, the

outgoing CEO had recently acquired a business and deliberately left

## his successor with a clear mandate: Integrate that business. The new

CEO embraced the mandate during her ﬁrst two years and skillfully

merged the two businesses, both operationally and culturally. That

accomplishment earned her the trust she needed for a more radical

growth agenda, which she was then able to pursue in the years that

followed.

Align your team. The most successful new CEOs recognize that to win

others’ conﬁdence early on, they have to focus right away on assembling

a high-performing leadership team. But all too often new CEOs delay

that task, which doesn’t grab headlines the way the launch of bold new initiatives does—and can involve making diﬃcult decisions about

senior personnel. The problem is, if you don’t have a team in place

that’s cohesive, in agreement on objectives, and able to act eﬀectively in

support of your plans, it’s almost impossible to gain people’s conﬁdence

# widely.

When one new CEO we worked with stepped into the role, he wanted

to ﬁll two key positions before he tried to get his top team on board

with his objectives. He ﬁgured the searches would take a couple of

months—three tops. However, as sometimes happens, they took longer

than expected, and while they dragged on, another key executive

left the company, creating yet another vacant seat. Waiting to start

moving forward cost this CEO valuable time and made him appear both

# ineﬀective and indecisive.

New CEOs who come from inside the organization obviously beneﬁt

greatly from having already developed strong relationships within their

ﬁrms. But they also have a special conﬁdence-building challenge: They

must convince their former peers and colleagues—who have known

them in other capacities—that they have what it takes to lead the entire

enterprise. This challenge hit especially close to home for one CEO who

had spent much of his long career with his company. When he stepped

up from CFO to CEO, he wanted the organization to know him better

and see him diﬀerently. So he actively shared more about himself and

his personal life than ever before. He opened up about how he spent his

weekends and the challenges he had to overcome, such as the severe

illness of his child. Doing so, he believed, was the best way to show his

human side, rally his team behind him, and allow the organization to

# gain trust in him.

New CEOs who come from outside the company face a diﬀerent

conundrum. They’re still strangers to the organization, and all eyes

are on their every step as stakeholders try to decipher their point of

view. One CEO we worked with observed that everyone wants you to

say something dramatic. There is a real temptation to give in to that

and make bold statements. However, the bigger risk is in being forced

into premature opinions that may limit your options down the road

and potentially even corner you. This CEO realized that the insecurity

of being new in the job made him prone to weigh in too quickly and

show oﬀ his smarts. To counter those tendencies, we worked with him

to develop a clear executive agenda while learning the fundamental

parameters of the business that would help him align all stakeholders

# around the new path forward.

Engage stakeholders at the right time. For most new CEOs, this process

starts with the board. Building trust, familiarity, and support here is

a priority, but new CEOs rarely recognize just how much time they’ll

need to invest in learning the subtleties of boardroom dynamics and

developing a strong relationship with each director. Mahesh devoted

himself to this important task almost immediately after becoming CEO,

intent on understanding not only the domain expertise of his various

## directors but also their preferred engagement rhythms and forms of

interaction. He arranged for the directors to spend meaningful time

getting to know his senior team. This work paid oﬀ: At a stage when

many new CEOs become an information bottleneck, he instead became

an eﬀective conductor of information and was able to get his executive

team to chart a path forward collectively.

Earning the conﬁdence of all employees is also key and should become

a daily practice. One often eﬀective approach is to run regular “ask me

anything” sessions with employee groups and gather data about what

people are thinking, how trends are developing, and where the focus

may need to be adjusted. That will help you learn what your employees

are concerned about and has the added beneﬁt of making them feel

heard—all of which naturally engenders trust. Of course, don’t forget

the obvious: To maintain that trust, you’ll need to make sure that your

actions match your words (those you speak on the public stage and in

# private settings).

You’ll need to engage investors too. At a public company a good place to

start is during quarterly earnings calls. One new CEO learned the hard

way that emphasizing only positive outcomes and bullish scenarios

tends to backﬁre—and when that happens, it harms credibility. He

reconsidered his approach and began conducting earnings calls in

which he oﬀered a balanced discussion of what was going right and

what could go wrong, and at the end of the calls he would spend time

with analysts to gather their views on the company. Because he now

came across as a thoughtful steward of the company, he found that

investors changed their perception of him and became increasingly

# conﬁdent in his leadership.

Communicate clearly and relentlessly. Communication is critical to

building conﬁdence in your leadership across stakeholder groups.

What’s the best way to handle it eﬀectively? Repetition, repetition,

repetition. No matter whom you’re addressing or in what setting, you’ll

need to tell people what you’re going to tell them, tell them, and then

tell them what you told them. You’ll get tired of this process, but

## HBR / Spotlight Article / How CEOs Build Confidence in Their Leadership

remember: Much of what you’ll be saying either will feel new to your

audience or will start to sink in only after many repetitions.

Similarly, in all your communications, make sure to repeatedly signal

progress: Remind your stakeholders where you started, where you

are, and where you’re going. To help them recognize advances, break

## your overall journey into smaller, shorter parts with easily measurable

## objectives. Map your goals against the calendar—and communicate

your achievements reliably. Then make course corrections as necessary.

A plan that made a lot of sense six months ago may no longer do so

because of changes in your competitive environment. Share the nature

of such changes regularly with your audiences and make sure they

understand that you’re making the necessary adjustments. This is yet

another way to inspire their conﬁdence in you over the long term.

Better yourself. With so many constituents to serve, most new CEOs

don’t prioritize their own learning. That’s a mistake. Continued

investment in your own abilities will help you gain stakeholders’

conﬁdence and build your self-conﬁdence more quickly.

CEOs typically lack peers within the organization who can help

them with this goal. Mahesh vividly remembers the ambiguity and

uncertainty that came with suddenly being the person who was

supposed to know all the answers. Having few people with whom he

could share his concerns about the size of the task ahead, he focused

on learning, engaging, and adjusting his style, and he developed

techniques—such as documenting his intentions and desired outcomes,

taking evening walks with his wife, and making time for yoga and

meditation—that allowed him to stay anchored in the present.

Most CEOs, new or experienced, beneﬁt from having a coach or an

adviser—somebody who can regularly hold up the mirror, help them

grow, provide new perspectives, and push their thinking. With one new

CEO we did that by focusing intently on strategic goal setting. The

process began with her personal purpose and then expanded to her

organizational purpose—with an emphasis on determining where they

overlapped. With our help and the engagement of an inner circle of

conﬁdants, which included her heads of strategy and communications,

she got the constructive feedback and encouragement she needed to

ensure that she could do her job conﬁdently and with a strong sense of

# purpose.

. . .

As a new CEO, you’ll ﬁnd it tempting to seek out quick wins and

take bold actions that reveal a decisive attitude. When you start

your job, the excitement is high—and so is the pressure. But the

journey to earning your stakeholders’ trust and support is neither short

nor easy. By following the steps we’ve recommended in this article—

pacing yourself, strategically picking your battles, mobilizing your team,

engaging stakeholders at the right time, communicating clearly and

relentlessly, and investing in self-betterment—you’ll build conﬁdence

in your leadership over time and speed your transition from being the

new CEO to simply being the CEO. Patience, persistence, and consistent

communication during your early years will be key to navigating the

complexities of leadership and maximizing the value you create in the

long term. As Bill Gates said many years ago, “We always overestimate

the change that will occur in the next two years and underestimate the

change that will occur in the next 10. Don’t let yourself be lulled into

# inaction.”
