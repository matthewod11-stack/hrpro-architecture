## HBR / Digital Article / 3 Ways to Make All Your Stakeholders Feel Heard

Consider the case of the PGA Tour, the most prestigious golf circuit in

# the world.

In 2023 the CEO of the PGA Tour, Jay Monahan, along with two

members of its board, concocted a partnership with the Saudi Public

Investment Fund (PIF) without consulting other board members or any

of the PGA Tour’s key stakeholders: players, sponsors, broadcasters, and

# fans.

The move came as a big surprise. For two years Monahan had belittled

the eﬀorts made by the Saudi PIF to launch its own golf circuit —

LIV Golf — and had justiﬁed not getting involved by publicly and

moralistically invoking the memory of 9/11 and Saudi involvement in

the attacks. But then all of a sudden, on June 6, there he was on

primetime television, appearing alongside the governor of the Saudi

PIF and announcing that they had privately reached an agreement

for the Saudi PIF to become a multi-billion-dollar investor in the PGA Tour. This partnership, the oﬃcial press release declared, would ensure

that “all stakeholders beneﬁt from a model that delivers maximum

## excitement and competition among the game’s best players.”

For years PGA Tour executives and board directors had successfully

coordinated the divergent interests of stakeholders, preserving a fragile

equilibrium in which no stakeholders could impose their interests at the

expense of the others. However, when the most powerful stakeholder

— the players — realized that their voice had been ignored during the

negotiation of the Tour-Saudi PIF agreement, they reacted in ways that

upset that fragile equilibrium and threatened to harm the PGA Tour’s

# business model.

To begin with, they forced executives to grant them a majority on the

board, so that the plan could only proceed with player approval. They

also forced executives to steeply increase tournament prizes (money

that would be paid in part by sponsors), a response that stemmed from

some of those players having previously turned down multimillion-

dollar oﬀers from LIV Golf because of the PGA Tour’s moral stance.

In response, sponsors reduced their commitment: Some moved from

## a long-term to a short-term relationship with the tour (Royal Bank

of Canada told the tour it would renew its sponsorship annually, in

contrast to previous multi-year agreements) and others discontinued

their relationship altogether (Wells Fargo and Farmers Insurance had

been tour sponsors for more than a decade).

The eﬀect of all of this was that the once-successful PGA Tour business

model, which had taken decades to build, began to fall apart. Today,

a year and a half after the initial announcement, men’s professional

golf appears more divided than ever, with a ﬁnal agreement yet to be

reached between the PGA Tour and Saudi Arabia’s PIF, due in part to

## adverse stakeholder reaction to the announcement.

This problem — not including stakeholders in important decisions — is

not uncommon. Famously, for example, in 2007, with Apple’s popularity

growing, Microsoft rushed to release Windows Vista, after having kept

## many details of this new operating system secret from key stakeholders

to prevent competitors from getting ahead of Microsoft’s plans.

Windows Vista required higher hardware speciﬁcations than previous

Windows versions, so original equipment manufacturers, who had

been informed late, were unable to adapt properly and struggled with

## customer dissatisfaction over performance issues on older hardware.

Similarly, many third-party developers had trouble adapting, which left

consumers unable to use their applications. Retailers also expressed

discontent that Microsoft did not provide adequate and timely training

for their sales and support staﬀ, which led to higher return rates. All of

this caused many developers and consumers to stick with Microsoft’s

previous operating system — Windows XP — or abandon Windows in

favor of other operating systems, notably Apple’s macOS. Widespread

consumer dissatisfaction and complaints also led to a class-action

lawsuit that Microsoft had to settle, further damaging its ﬁnances and

# reputation.

## In our work on corporate governance, business models, and the

## dynamics of stakeholders in cross-organizational collaborations, we

have studied this problem extensively. In this article, we’ll oﬀer

guidance on how to solve it — or avoid it altogether.

# Mechanisms for Improvement

In our work on this topic, we’ve identiﬁed three ways through which

you can ensure that your key stakeholders — those without whom the

proper functioning of your business model would be disrupted — have a

## voice, listen to one another, and work together as eﬀectively as possible.

Create a forum.

To enhance communication with and among key stakeholders, you

need to create a space where everybody can share their interests.

When the Saudi PIF threat appeared, the PGA Tour’s board of directors

should have opened up a forum in which stakeholders could have

voiced and discuss their interests. If such a forum had existed, the

stakeholders would have quickly recognized the degree to which they

were interdependent and needed to work on this challenge together.

Before demanding that the PGA Tour increase their prizes, for example,

the players would have beneﬁtted hearing from sponsors how that

move might aﬀect them — speciﬁcally that it would put them under

ﬁnancial strain at a time when they were already struggling. (Because

of defections to LIV Golf, sponsors were getting less exposure due to a

# weakened TV audience.)

# Serve as mediator.

Having a forum where stakeholders can voice their interests improves

their mutual awareness, but it does not guarantee that stakeholders’

often divergent interests will be automatically aligned. That’s because

although all key stakeholders are necessary for the business model to

work, some are naturally more important than others and can therefore

exert their power in the forum to impose their interest. As an executive

at the center of the stakeholder nexus, you’re in a unique position to

mediate and identify compromises so that no stakeholder is favored at

others’ expense or blocks decision making.

# Stipulate information rights.

The prior two mechanisms increase the chances that a balance will

be found among stakeholders’ interests, but they don’t ensure that

stakeholders will actually discuss the issues that are most relevant to

them, because executives might be withholding important information

from them. If you want to improve transparency and build trust among

stakeholders and executives, you should make it possible ﬁrst for

everybody to declare what issues are most important to them, and

second you should stipulate that every stakeholder has the right to

## information about important decision-making processes. In December

2023, partly as a result of the atmosphere of mistrust generated by the

Saudi-PIF announcement, a large group of PGA Tour players sent a

letter to the tour’s board of directors demanding full disclosure of the

information regarding the agreement with the Saudi PIF.

# Bridging the Gap

New York City’s Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) is an excellent example

of an organization that has ﬁgured out how to facilitate contributions

and integrate feedback from various key stakeholders: notably, artists,

patrons, and trustees. In addition to providing information rights to

certain stakeholders, the MoMA makes a deliberate eﬀort to give voice

and facilitate dialogue among stakeholders by regularly hosting focus

groups where stakeholders can exchange ideas on speciﬁc initiatives.

## For example, in the 2019 MoMA renovation and expansion project, in

which the MoMA reimagined and enlarged its physical space, artists

whose works had been exhibited in the museum were involved in

deﬁning how the new space would allow for innovative exhibitions that

might move beyond painting and sculpture to include multimedia art.

Patrons, for their part, were involved in a discussion of how creating

dedicated spaces named after major donors might help fund the

project, in alignment with MoMA’s curatorial goals. Lastly, trustees were

included to ensure that the new design would be thought through with

underrepresented groups of museum goers in mind. To bridge the gaps

among artistic, ﬁnancial, and community perspectives, MoMA brought

all of these stakeholders together in focus groups and facilitated

discussions among them — and then later held follow-up meetings with

stakeholders to inform them about how their feedback was incorporated

into the design. This kept them engaged and enhanced their mutual

# sense of ownership.

Naturally, facilitating an open dialogue with and among stakeholders

can slow down decision-making and create more time for competitors

to learn about the company’s plans. However, as the PGA Tour case

illustrates, ignoring and overriding the voice of stakeholders can end in

# far worse consequences.

# Questions to Ask

To assess how necessary these three mechanisms are for you, ask

# yourself the following questions.

First, would it be diﬃcult to substitute your stakeholders? If their contribution is diﬃcult to replace, that speaks to how important they

are — if they leave, they can seriously disrupt the functioning of your

business model. In the case of the PGA Tour, there are only a limited

number of corporations who can aﬀord to pay more than $15 million to

sponsor a tour event and have that investment ﬁt into their marketing

# strategy.

Second, in your business model, is your main role to coordinate your

stakeholders? If so, you’ll need to do everything you can to make sure

you can do it well, because your business model depends on it. And

that means you’ll probably want to engage all three of our mechanisms.

The PGA Tour, for example, doesn’t own the facilities where its golf

tournaments are held, nor does it fund the tournaments it hosts or

even employ the golfers, who are independent contractors. Instead, the

PGA Tour’s primary role is to coordinate the contributions of players,

sponsors, and broadcasters to deliver the best possible tournaments to

# fans.

Third, are some of your key stakeholders absent from your governing

bodies? If so, especially if you’ve answered “yes” to the two previous

questions, then our mechanisms may be very necessary. Despite the

## importance of sponsors and broadcasters on PGA Tour’s business

model, they were largely absent from its governing bodies, had no

forum to voice their interests, did not have a tour executive to mediate

among them, and had no information rights.

. . .

## In an era when stakeholder expectations and interdependencies

are increasingly central to success, the ability to navigate these

relationships is not just a matter of fairness or optics — it’s a strategic

imperative. When leaders embrace transparency, facilitate dialogue,

and balance competing interests, they not only safeguard their business

models but also strengthen the trust and engagement of those who

make success possible. The PGA Tour’s experience is a cautionary tale

that reminds us: Sidelining stakeholders may seem expedient in the

moment, but the long-term cost can be immeasurable.
