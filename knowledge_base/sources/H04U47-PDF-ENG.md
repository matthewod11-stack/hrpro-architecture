It’s a common feeling: while you are busy doing a good job, others seem

to be advancing much faster in their careers. What’s going on?

The answer in many cases is your contributions are not being seen

and recognized. One important reason this happens is that people

are simply not great at assessing competence — a crucial trait for

succeeding at work — and perceptions of competence are just as

## important for success as actual competence.

But don’t results mostly speak for themselves? They don’t, even when

it’s all about numbers. Consider a salesman: his sales may rise, but they

could have risen without his eﬀort due to the superior quality of the

product or marketing eﬀorts that ﬁnally bore fruit. If sales go down, it

could have been the result of increasing competition.

It’s often diﬃcult to disentangle actual drivers of performance, including how much luck and diﬃculty level played a role. Because

of this, people tend to evaluate competence based on other factors,

meaning you have to do more than produce results to convince them

of your expertise. One way to do this is by demonstrating conﬁdence in

# your abilities.

A pioneering study from 1982 explored this connection between

conﬁdence and perceptions of competence. Psychologists Barry

Schlenker and Mark Leary asked 48 subjects to rate the competence

(among other characteristics) of 60 imaginary people who were facing

a tennis tournament or a class ﬁnal examination. Subjects received two

crucial pieces of information: they learned what the imaginary people

predicted their performance to be — from very poor to very good; then

they learned the people’s “actual” performance. After that, they had to

# rate each imaginary person’s competence.

Lo and behold, the person’s prediction had a strong inﬂuence on

how subjects perceived their competence: Observers evaluated those

who made optimistic predictions as much more competent than their

modest contemporaries — no matter how accurate those predictions

were and how well they actually performed. Even with an optimistic

forecast and a horrible result, they were still rated as almost twice as

competent as those who accurately forecasted their poor performance.

This seems to suggest that if someone asks how you expect to perform,

you should give a positive, conﬁdent response. A negative forecast may

lead you to be perceived as distinctly less competent — no matter how

well you actually perform.

Over the last few decades, researchers have scrutinized the eﬀects of

projecting conﬁdence versus modesty, gathering rather contradictory

## conclusions. But a recent replication of Schlenker & Leary’s 1982 study

supported those original ﬁndings. This found that projecting conﬁdence

does lead to positive eﬀects, but only when it is non-comparative. In

other words: praising your competence seems to be ﬁne as long as you

do not claim that others are incompetent.

But why do people view conﬁdent others as more competent, even

when their performance suggests otherwise? One explanation is that

we have a tendency to believe what we are told, and to conﬁrm our

beliefs by selecting information that supports them. The term for this

is conﬁrmation bias. So if you project conﬁdence, others tend to believe

you know what you’re talking about, and they will then ﬁlter ambiguous

information (like how much luck may have helped or hurt you) to ﬁt

# their initial impression.

While it’s unwise to project fake conﬁdence when you know you won’t

perform well, being too modest likely won’t serve you well either. As we

saw in Schlenker & Leary’s study, people tend to penalize humble actors

by deciding against them and choosing the conﬁdent ones. Modesty

is regarded as hedging against possible failure, an attempt to take the

wind out of critics’ sails. If the expert doesn’t trust in his or her abilities,

# how could anyone else?

In order to convince others of your abilities, you should make it a habit

to communicate that you are good at what you do — without any self-

deprecation regarding your core competencies.

This doesn’t always come easy. To feel more authentic demonstrating

conﬁdence, you may ﬁrst have to convince yourself. Ask yourself: What

am I good at? What was my greatest success so far? Why should others

be led by me? What do I know that they don’t? If you have a hard

time answering these questions, you have a problem — how should you

convince others of your expertise if you aren’t convinced yourself?

“Praise yourself daringly,” the philosopher Francis Bacon said, because,

as he continued, “something always sticks.” If you want to ensure

that your achievements are recognized, think about how your manager

and colleagues see you and your abilities. Do you think they have a

good sense of your competence and expertise? If not, could you be

demonstrating more conﬁdence in your tasks? This doesn’t necessarily

mean praising yourself at every opportunity; rather it means projecting

an optimistic attitude. By displaying more conﬁdence in your abilities,

you set yourself up to be recognized for your competence and your
