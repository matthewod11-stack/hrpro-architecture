According to a report by TeamStage, 70% of projects globally fail.

And big projects, with greater complexity and more moving parts,

fail at signiﬁcant rates. This can be for a variety of reasons, ranging

## from passive project sponsors and inadequate resources to a shifting

## organizational context or lack of internal alignment and stakeholder

# buy-in.

Poorly performing projects not only impact the bottom line, they also,

understandably, impact morale and engagement. If one of your projects

is going sideways or south, here are some ways to motivate your team to

help get things back on track.

## Re-establish or re-define the project purpose, goals, and vision.

The project may not be going well because the organization’s goals and

vision aren’t clear. In fact, a lack of clear goals is the most common

factor, leading to 37% of project failures. A changing internal and

external organizational context could aﬀect the relevance of the project

goals or stakeholder buy-in, as priorities shift. According to TeamStage,

44% of projects fail due to lack of alignment between the business and

# the project goals.

Getting the team together to re-establish or re-deﬁne these goals can

breathe a second life into the project — assuming the context hasn’t

changed so much that the project is no longer relevant. No one likes

working on “road to nowhere.” Research from the Standish Group

shows that more than 30% of projects will get cancelled prior to

completion. According to Antonio Nieto-Rodriguez, author of HBR’s

Project Management Handbook, “Consider revising the project charter

if necessary.”

As part of this process, make sure you have executive sponsorship for

the project. The TeamStage study also shared that 62% of successfully

completed projects had supportive sponsors. Nieto-Rodriguez shared

that “Having a high-level executive articulate the project’s importance

to the organization can give the team a renewed sense of purpose.”

Involve the team in trouble-shooting and defining the path forward.

Enlist the team in trouble-shooting in a collaborative way that doesn’t

place blame, but seeks to get to the root cause and ﬁnd a better path

forward. Nieto-Rodriguez recommends holding a “state of the project”

meeting where “everyone can express concerns and oﬀer solutions

# without fear of retribution.”

As the team leader, you can also create psychological safety and model

a growth mindset by going ﬁrst in sharing mistakes that you’ve made

that might have contributed to the project’s lackluster performance and

what you’ve learned from them. In these meetings, encourage open

communication and transparency, which not only builds trust, but also

empowers the team to ﬁnd a solution together. This reinforces a sense of

“being in it together,” which can bring a greater sense of motivation for

# the team.

Help remove obstacles.

A key part of your job as project leader is to help remove obstacles

for the team. This includes re-prioritizing or re-assigning other work,

and re-allocating resources for the project — including people, time,

and budget. According to the Standish Group research, more than 50%

of projects will cost almost double the original budget estimates. “If

possible, reallocate resources to alleviate bottlenecks,” Nieto-Rodriguez

suggests. “This may involve bringing in additional team members,

extending timelines, or securing more budget.”

Another obstacle you can eliminate as project leader is to provide role

clarity for your team members. Role clarity can prevent the duplication

of eﬀort, working at cross-purposes, or the unnecessary friction on the

team and morale issues that come with stepping on other people’s toes.

Another one of these bottlenecks might be you. By empowering decision

making amongst the project team members, not every decision needs to

come to you. You can still give general guidance as to what’s important

to consider in these decisions, where you want to be kept informed, and

what needs to be escalated to you.

Understand what motivates different team members.

While some general principles will apply for everyone when it comes to

motivating your project team, also recognize that diﬀerent people are

motivated by diﬀerent things. Nieto-Rodriguez points out that “some

are motivated by public recognition, others by monetary incentives,

and still others by career development opportunities. Tailoring your

approach can go a long way.” Know what “currencies” are most

important to each of your team members and what you have to oﬀer

to them individually. In addition to the ones mentioned above, these

currencies can include visibility, gratitude or appreciation, support,

## creative freedom, or intellectual challenge, among others.

# Connect regularly as a team.

Scheduling a standing weekly project meeting can help create regular

feedback loops about what’s working and what’s not working so course

corrections can be made in a timely way, thereby keeping the project

on track and increasing the chances of success. These regular check-

ins will also allow the team to get important issues on the table for

key discussions, debate, and decisions – while straightforward status

updates can be done asynchronously on platforms like Slack.

These meetings can also provide the opportunity to do some team

building in order to strengthen the relationships and connective tissue

amongst team members, as well as ensure ongoing alignment. Nieto-

Rodriguez shared, “Depending on the project’s urgency, a short team-

building session away from work can often reset the team’s energy and

improve collaboration.”

Celebrate small wins and provide recognition

Recognizing small wins can help mark progress for the team and raise

their spirits. Celebrating project milestones as a team can not only boost

morale, but also gives the team a sense of traction against their goals

and feelings of optimism. Nieto-Rodriguez shared that achieving even

minor milestones can be a source of motivation.

In addition, providing individual recognition that is personalized can

also help motivate team members, keeping in mind that introverts tend

to prefer more private, one-on-one recognition and extroverts tend to

# appreciate more public recognition.

By focusing on the above strategies, you can both re-energize your

project team and help put a poorly performing project back on track,

creating a virtuous cycle that leads to the project and team’s success.
