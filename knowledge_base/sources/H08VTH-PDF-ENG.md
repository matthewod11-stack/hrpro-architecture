In today’s uncertain economic climate, organizations often ﬂatten

structures to cut costs and accelerate decision-making, eliminating

layers of middle management. In 2023 and 2024 alone, companies like

Meta, Google, and Amazon laid oﬀ tens of thousands of employees,

consolidating roles, shrinking teams, and widening managerial spans.

On paper, the org chart may look eﬃcient, but the day-to-day can

feel overwhelming if you’re a senior leader suddenly responsible for a

sprawling team. Slack messages pile up. One-on-ones multiply. Every

ﬁre drill lands on your desk.

We call this phenomenon the “leadership avalanche.” Without a clear

strategy, scale becomes a liability. We’ve seen this pattern play out

repeatedly through our work advising dozens of companies navigating

## high-stakes transformations (Kathryn as an executive coach and

## keynote speaker and Jenny as an executive advisor and learning and

development expert). We’ve identiﬁed ﬁve time-tested strategies that

can help leaders rise to the occasion and lead at scale.

- 1. Reset How You Work—Together

When your team size multiplies overnight but your resources don’t,

something has to give. Too often, leaders cling to familiar routines:

## weekly 1:1s, constant availability, and involvement in every decision.

However, what works for a lean team won’t work for a larger, more

complex one. Trying to lead the same way just accelerates burnout.

Instead, reset expectations, and do it in partnership with your team.

Clarify what you’ll continue to deliver as their leader (e.g., priorities,

## presence during critical moments, support for blockers) and what may

need to shift (e.g., instant responsiveness, deep involvement in every

project). Then, co-create new ways of working, like how decisions are

made, how meetings are run, and how conﬂict is surfaced.

One leader we coached who inherited a merged team of 30 direct

reports hosted a “Team Reset Workshop” and asked:

- What helps you do your best work?

- What gets in the way?

- What agreements can we establish to work more eﬀectively together?

From that discussion, the team co-authored a few norms: “Assume

positive intent,” “Raise risks early,” and “No meetings before 9 am

unless critical.” This gave everyone permission to contribute, reduced

friction, and fostered a stronger sense of psychological safety.

Keep it simple with no more than ﬁve to seven agreements. Make

your team norms visible, revisit them quarterly, and hold each other

# accountable.

- 2. Prioritize Ruthlessly and Communicate What Matters

When your attention is spread across multiple people and projects, your

job becomes one of strategic triage. You can’t do it all, nor should you

try. Focus on what’s most impactful, delegate what you can, and let go of

what’s no longer essential.

But prioritization is only half the battle. The other half is making it

unmistakably visible. As a leader, the challenge often isn’t knowing

what matters—it’s making that clear to everyone else. Without shared

clarity, teams either try to do everything or hesitate to act at all. Both

lead to burnout, misﬁres, and missed opportunities.

One tech executive, Jane, inherited a team of 25 after layoﬀs and

consolidation. At ﬁrst, she was overwhelmed, but she quickly realized

that her old way of working wouldn’t scale. She pivoted her approach

and introduced a weekly “Top 5” priorities message. This simple, high-

signal update cut through the noise, aligned everyone around what

mattered most, and reduced escalations to her desk by 30% within a few

months. It reassured her team she had their backs and gave them clarity

to move forward conﬁdently. Jane hadn’t vanished; she was simply

# operating from a higher altitude.

Use a decision framework, such as urgent vs. important, RACI, or a

customized team-wide rubric, to create a shared language for what

should make it to your desk and what shouldn’t. This will help the team

## distinguish between critical, strategic, and nonessential work. The goal

isn’t to micromanage—it’s to light the path clearly enough for others to

# move without you.

- 3. Level Up Your Delegation

Managing a team that’s exponentially larger requires more than just

trusting others. It’s about multiplying your impact through them. You

can’t scale by doing more. You scale by focusing on what only you can

do and empowering others to lead the rest.

Identify and develop your next-level leaders, team leads, trusted

lieutenants, or senior individual contributors who can own decisions

and drive outcomes in their domains. Then empower them: Give them

autonomy, coach them regularly, and provide the context they need to

lead with insight, not just instructions. Done well, it doesn’t just lighten

your load; it grows your inﬂuence and your bench.

For instance, an SVP at a healthtech company implemented this

strategy by appointing “area leads” across her major functional

domains. Each had ownership to make decisions, run meetings, and

escalate only when necessary. This resulted in faster decision-making,

higher morale, and better execution. It also positioned three team

# members for future leadership roles.

Use a delegation ladder to clarify expectations and signal trust. For

example, instead of telling a report, “Draft a recommendation and I’ll

decide,” try, “You decide and loop me in only if there’s a risk.” The

more explicit you are, the more conﬁdent others will be. Delegation isn’t

abdication; it’s a strategic investment in your team’s growth.

- 4. Simplify the System to Accelerate the Work

As your team grows, what once felt like structure can quickly become

clutter. Communication gets noisy. Processes multiply. Tools overlap.

What began as a helpful structure becomes a drag on speed, clarity,

and motivation. We’ve seen ﬁrsthand that the more systems expand,

the more teams go through the motions instead of moving the work

# forward.

Your job isn’t to control the chaos but to eliminate what slows the work

down. That means questioning legacy systems, removing unnecessary

steps, and aligning processes to what matters now. Ask yourself and

your team what’s creating unnecessary drag. Is it clunky handoﬀs?

Endless status reporting? Meetings that feel like time sinks? These

aren’t small irritants; they’re system-wide energy leaks. One study

found that bad meetings alone cost large companies as much as $100

million a year, with respondents reporting that they could’ve skipped

30% of the meetings they attended in a week.

Dave, one ﬁntech executive we coached, realized that critical updates

were being shared across multiple platforms, including email, Teams,

and team-speciﬁc update decks. Information was often repeated,

missed, or misunderstood. He launched a two-week “process audit

sprint,” empowered his area leads to map what was working and what

wasn’t, and simpliﬁed the team’s internal communication ﬂow. The

payoﬀ? Less noise, faster alignment, and more time spent on work that

# moves the needle.

Not every system change needs a transformation roadmap. Start

with the systems closest to you, considering how priorities are

communicated, how decisions are made, and how progress is tracked.

Ask your team what’s getting in their way and then remove it.

Simpliﬁcation at this level may seem small, but it sends a powerful

# signal about what you value.

- 5. Protect Your Energy and Model Resilience

When your team grows quickly, the demands grow with it. Your calendar

ﬁlls up. Your energy drains, too. And if you’re depleted, your team

will feel it. How you show up under pressure becomes the emotional

# baseline for everyone around you.

Leadership at scale is a marathon, not a sprint. While protecting your

energy may seem indulgent, it’s an investment in your leadership.

You’re not just managing deadlines; you’re setting the tone. This means

being honest about your bandwidth, building in recovery time, and

making choices that prioritize sustainability over urgency. Modeling

resilience and sustainability for your team requires presence over

# performance.

At the end of each week, take a few minutes for a simple red/yellow/

green check-in to spot unsustainable patterns early. This is a self-

reﬂection tool for you as a leader, not a performance assessment of your

# team.

Ask yourself: How am I doing right now? What pace have I been keeping?

Then assign a color rating:

- Red: Depleted and need recovery • Yellow: Stretched, but managing • Green: Energized and focused

You can keep this private or occasionally share your status with your

team to normalize conversations about capacity and sustainability.

When you protect your energy and trust your teams, autonomy and

# creativity rise.

Resist the temptation to push through at all costs. Resilience requires

knowing when to step back so you can step up when it counts. Whether

it’s conducting walking 1:1s, putting up clear calendar boundaries, or

having a “no meetings” block, protect your energy like it’s part of the

job—because it is.

. . .

When your span of control stretches overnight, it’s easy to feel buried by

decisions, demands, and sheer volume. But leadership at scale is about

leading diﬀerently, not simply doing more. You won’t get it perfect—

you don’t need to. But if you can shift from reacting to intentionally

resetting how you lead, you won’t just survive the avalanche; you’ll help

your team ﬁnd solid ground and start building again.
