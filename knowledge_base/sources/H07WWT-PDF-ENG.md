My client Jacob sighed in exasperation as he told me about the

year-end presentations he’d unexpectedly been asked to create for his

company’s executive team. “Every year, it’s the same frantic scramble as

December approaches,” he said. “It’s like everyone’s surprised that the

year is almost gone.”

The December deadline deluge involves last-minute, often complex

requests that go beyond your day-to-day tasks. Requests can fall into

# areas such as:

- Budget updates

- Expense reporting

- Headcount reporting

- Salary and bonus discussions

- Sales cycle status updates

- Churn or customer retention reports

- Inventory and supply-chain assessments

This syndrome can be especially prevalent at organizations with a

culture of false urgency or when you have a leader who struggles with

focus. While it’s easy to believe the old phrase that “poor planning

on your part doesn’t constitute an emergency on my part,” the reality

is that when that emergency is coming from your boss or senior

leadership, it’s suddenly your emergency, too.

How do you handle these last-minute requests as the year’s end grows

closer? Here are strategies to mitigate the crunch.

Anticipate and ask if you suspect a recurring request is heading your way.

If you’ve noticed a pattern of year-end requests piling up in previous

years, it’s time to take a proactive approach. Initiate conversations with

## your leaders about their needs. For example:

- “For the past three years I’ve been here, we’ve needed to provide a

## sales update and next-year projections by the end of November. I

haven’t received that request formally yet; is it still on the plan for

# this year?”

- “Typically our performance reviews are due December 15, but I haven’t

seen any of the usual tools shared yet. Who could I check with to

conﬁrm this year’s timing so my team is prepared?”

While it’s frustrating, there could be an understandable reason behind

a last-minute request. Research from Columbia Medical School suggests

that our brains can forget what happened in the past in an eﬀort to

make room for the information we need each day. Plus, with increased

turnover of recent years, your leaders or coworkers may not have been

# in their roles last year.

So don’t wait for others to remember or to initiate requests you suspect

may be coming. Anticipating and asking about possible requests isn’t

being nosy; it’s being helpful.

# Commit to your PTO.

One of the biggest challenges during year-end tasks is managing time

oﬀ, especially when urgent requests pop up. According to a 2023 Pew

research study, many Americans hesitate to take all their paid time oﬀ

due to concerns about falling behind at work.

To avoid giving up your well-deserved vacation days (and your overall

well-being), conﬁdently communicate your plans with your colleagues.

# For example:

- “Alex, I just wanted you to know that I’m out of the oﬃce and

unplugged from December 18th through January 3rd. I won’t be

tracking work emails or Slack during that time, so if there’s anything

you’re going to need from me before the end of the year, I’ll need to

know by December 1st to make sure it’s covered.”

- “Sondra, I’m out for two weeks in December, so let’s put a catch-up

## meeting on our calendars now for early January.”

By communicating and committing to your own time oﬀ, you’re helping

others plan ahead — and you’re serving as a good role model, too.

Even if you’ve done the work to communicate your time oﬀ, others may

try and push your vacation boundaries. For example, a boss or team

member might and ask for “just one more thing,” and you might be

tempted to help out.

Instead, decide in advance how you’ll handle this situation — before

anyone even asks. Being prepared with a simple answer like “That’s

not going to be possible, so let’s talk about other solutions” can help

you hold yourself accountable to the break you need. Besides, it’s great

practice at the art of saying no — a skill we all need in our nonstop world

# of work.

Clarify what you’re being asked to do.

In his mind, the presentations my client Jacob was asked to make

would require him to spend several evenings designing a fat deck of

detailed PowerPoint slides. But as we began to talk through next steps,

he realized he was jumping into action without clarifying the need.

Most of us aren’t experts in the art of making requests. Jacob’s leaders

were no exception. When he took a moment to clarify the scope of the

request, Jacob uncovered that the need could be satisﬁed by sharing an

existing report and scheduling a more planful, deep-dive overview of

the full-year results in January. What would have been an after-hours

slog turned into a simple, less-stressful solution.

When you get a last-minute request, don’t hesitate to ask more

questions to understand the problem your leaders want you to solve

— and their reasons why it needs to be done now.

Reprioritize your commitments.

No matter how well you’ve planned your time, last-minute requests may

still emerge. Take a hard look at your calendar now to create white space

for what may pop up. Ask yourself:

- What work am I spending time on that’s no longer useful or relevant as

the end of the year draws closer?

- What meetings are better rescheduled for January to hit reset and take

## advantage of full attendance and fresh energy?

- Which items on my to-do list have been lingering without making a

# signiﬁcant impact?

While you don’t want to build a habit of cancelling or rescheduling

meetings, the end-of-year rush can justify an honest review of the

commitments you’ve made.

Look for ways to prevent next years’ scramble.

Even if you can’t ﬁnd any solutions to stop this year’s requests from

coming your way, there’s still one action that’s completely in your

# control.

Open up your calendar for next year. Add a reminder for early

September to start a conversation with your leaders about what they

may want to know or do before the year ends.

The end of the year can be stressful enough without extra pressure that

comes from last-minute requests due before New Year’s Eve. With the

right mindset and tools, you can not only survive but thrive in the face

# of the December deadline deluge.
