Not surprisingly, nearly six in 10 workers say U.S. society is uncivil.

Polarized political discourse, changing social norms during the

pandemic, and ill-mannered online interactions have all played a role.

This means walking into the oﬃce these days can feel like stepping

into a mineﬁeld. Social and political polarization divides colleagues into

camps with “us-versus-them” mentalities. People are uncertain about

what to say—or whether to say anything at all. Even casual remarks,

lighthearted jokes, or well-meaning feedback can spark conﬂicts or

smolder resentment. With some major companies mandating a ﬁve-day

return to the oﬃce, the tension is likely to escalate.

Which is a shame, because the consequences of incivility are profound.

## Johnny C. Taylor Jr., CEO of the Society for Human Resource

Management (SHRM), estimates that incivility costs U.S. businesses

$2 billion per day in lost productivity. When on the receiving end of

incivility, 63% of employees in a 2013 survey reported losing work time avoiding the oﬀender, 66% said their performance declined, 80% lost

work time worrying about the incident, and 25% admitted to taking

# their frustrations out on customers.

In contrast, creating a civil workplace has a range of beneﬁts at the

individual, team, and organizational levels. In a meta-analysis, civility

was shown to increase employees’ job satisfaction, mental health,

and organizational commitment, while reducing people’s emotional

exhaustion and intention to quit. And yet, 71% of workers say their manager or supervisor could have made more of an eﬀort to prevent

# incivility.

# Civility Seems Simple, But It’s Not

The beneﬁts of civility are clear, and nobody wants to work in a “mean”

workplace, so why is it so diﬃcult to achieve?

Part of the problem is that behaviors considered uncivil vary with

individuals, cultures, and power dynamics. On one extreme of the

spectrum are obvious behaviors, such as rude or demeaning comments,

ignoring others, public shaming, or emotional putdowns. More subtle

—yet still damaging—behaviors include interrupting, speaking in a

condescending way, asking for input and ignoring it, or failing to

share credit. In some cultures, certain behaviors like making direct eye

contact—especially with a superior—is considered rude, while in others,

it’s expected.

And even with the best of intentions to remain civil, others’ words

or actions can cause us to react rudely in a moment of frustration.

Then, our own incivility spreads to bystanders like a virus, creating a

workplace contagion that decimates productivity and well-being.

Incivility can be ambiguous, but everyone knows it when they feel it, and it aﬀects our ability to be engaged and productive. Even just

witnessing an act of incivility toward another person can impair our

# own cognitive function.

But there’s good news: Preliminary research presented at the 2024

NeuroLeadership Summit indicates that civility is even more contagious

# than incivility.

# 3 Habits of Civility

The science of emotional regulation informs three habits that can help

stop the incivility spiral before it starts. Let’s look at how you could

handle a tricky situation using the behaviors of civility.

Imagine you’re giving a progress report at a meeting, and a colleague,

Carl, begins harshly criticizing a major part of your work. You feel his

manner is condescending, the criticism is unjustiﬁed, and besides, who

is Carl to judge? He doesn’t know half as much as you do about this

project. He’s just trying to look good at your expense. Anger boils up, and a sharp retort is on the tip of your tongue. But before ﬁring it oﬀ,

you pause to consider three steps:

- 1. Notice your automatic response.

When the brain perceives a threat, it diverts cognitive resources away

from regions involved in executive control, such as the prefrontal

## cortex, and toward threat-response networks, such as the limbic system.

By pausing and noticing this response, you can remind yourself to avoid speaking or acting automatically, since you’re likely suﬀering from a

reduced ability to focus, make decisions, and collaborate.

- 2. Name your automatic response.

To stop yourself from speaking rashly, it helps to identify what’s driving

your threat response. Labeling why you’re feeling a certain way re-

engages your prefrontal cortex, allowing you to regain control of your

# thinking and actions.

The NeuroLeadership Institute has identiﬁed ﬁve domains that can help you understand and label diﬀerent types of threat and reward

# responses:

- Status, or your sense of importance relative to others. In the above

example, you worry that Carl’s critique of your work will harm your

coworkers’ views of your competence and intelligence.

- Certainty, or your ability to predict what happens next. As much as

you hate to admit it, Carl’s remarks spark seeds of doubt. Are you

missing something crucial that will hinder successful completion of

# the project?

- Autonomy, or a feeling of control over events of your environment.

After Carl’s remarks, you experience a reduced sense of control over

the direction of your presentation. You planned it so well, but now everything’s going oﬀ the rails.

- Relatedness, or your feeling of connection to others. You feel betrayed

by Carl and want to avoid working closely with him in the future.

- Fairness, or your perception of equitable interactions. Because Carl

has less experience, it feels unfair that he could derail you.

A threat to any of these domains could trigger an uncivil response, but

with all ﬁve domains threatened, it’s no wonder you almost snapped.

By identifying what’s driving your emotions, you can put the brakes on

your response and stop yourself from reacting in an uncivil manner.

- 3. Break the cycle.

Once you’ve re-engaged your prefrontal cortex, you can consider how you’re going to communicate eﬀectively. Focus on maintaining a neutral

manner. You don’t need to be overly friendly; you just want to avoid

creating a threat response in anyone else.

You want to be clear enough that recipients have little need to interpret

your message or intent. Communicate everything that’s essential and

nothing that isn’t so people don’t read hidden meanings into your

# words.

In the above example, perhaps after taking a pause, you realize that

although Carl’s delivery could be improved, and most of his criticism

is baseless, there is one item that warrants further consideration. You

can say: “Thanks for the feedback, Carl. While I can easily address most

of your concerns, there’s one I’d like to discuss further. Can you tell

me more about…?” Such a response avoids shaming or blaming anyone

while redirecting the team’s attention from irrelevant distractions to a

# clear, actionable task.

# From Civility to Respect

The word civility is often used interchangeably with respect, but they’re

actually two separate concepts. Civility is about being polite, while

respect goes further in valuing people and their contributions. Of

course, all workplaces should strive for a respectful environment, but

civility is an important ﬁrst step (and one society is currently struggling

# with).

Civility isn’t about loving or even liking everyone at your workplace, but

it is about establishing the baseline conditions for people to be able to

think clearly and do their jobs.

Respect takes even more intention than civility. It requires the

development of speciﬁc cognitive behaviors, such as a growth mindset,

bias mitigation, and inclusion. While everyone contributes to a

company’s culture, leaders in particular have an outsized ability to

inﬂuence workplace behavior. People pay attention to the highest-status

member of their community and unconsciously assume their habits

and emotions. But by role modeling the three habits of civility and

managing our own emotions and responses, we can help set ourselves

## and our colleagues on the pathway toward respect.
