When Dmitriy Zaporozhets and I decided, in 2013, to launch an

## enterprise business around GitLab—the open-source collaborative

software-development application that he’d designed and I’d been

working on—it wasn’t with the intention of turning it into one of the

world’s largest all-remote organizations. It was just that we lived 2,000

kilometers apart—he in Ukraine and I in the Netherlands—and our ﬁrst

hire was in Serbia. None of us wanted to move, so GitLab began its

## corporate life with a small, distributed workforce.

When we brought on a few more Netherlands-based team members,

my house was initially our oﬃce. They came over each morning, we

coded side by side, and then they went home. But within a few days we realized that we didn’t need to be colocated to work eﬀectively, so the

team dispersed.

By 2015 we had participated in a Y Combinator boot camp and were

ready to expand our business into the United States. Our investors were

supportive but suggested that we establish a U.S. headquarters, arguing

that although our engineers might be able to work from anywhere, our

sales and ﬁnance teams would have trouble doing so. I moved to the

San Francisco Bay area, and we opened an oﬃce there. Again our new

team members came in for a few days but then retreated to their homes

or other workspaces. Again we saw that colocation wasn’t necessary for

us to create and market a great product. Dmitriy and I made it oﬃcial:

GitLab would be an all-remote company.

Today our more than 2,000 team members are spread across some 60

countries and regions around the world. We neither own nor rent any

corporate oﬃce space, and we believe that our early adoption of an

all-remote approach has made us a better, more scalable company.

Well before the Covid-19 pandemic hastened such a shift for other

organizations, we embraced and developed best practices around

virtual collaboration. We’ve learned that success depends on measuring

output, not input; aligning our people on norms and values; ensuring

that policies and processes are continually and openly documented; and

reinforcing self-management and people-management skills. As a result

we’ve been able to hire top talent from around the world and harness

its energies to drive GitLab’s quarterly revenue to $113 million and year-

over-year growth to 69% as of the quarter ended October 31,2022. Now

that other corporations and start-ups are experimenting with going all

remote, we hope to share our lessons.

# Output, Not Input

It won’t surprise you to learn that we use the GitLab platform to

collaborate on writing, reviewing, troubleshooting, launching, and

monitoring the performance of our code. Managers create a project, or

“milestone” in our parlance, within which speciﬁc tasks, or “issues,”

are to be completed. Those issues are assigned to one or more team

members via a “merge request” labeled “work in progress.” Colleagues trade oﬀ working on the issue until they deem it ready to “stage” and

“commit.” Their code is then run through a series of diagnostics that

test for accuracy, security, and performance. If it passes muster, it’s

launched, and we continue to track how it performs. If problems are

identiﬁed, the team iterates on solutions. This entire history of work

## remains accessible to everyone for reference.

Dmitriy’s initial version of GitLab was an open-source tool, and

programmers who used it contributed to the underlying code. I joined

with the aim of developing a more robust version to sell to corporations, and in 2014 we shifted our business model to focus on that paid oﬀering

while leaving a core tool available to all at no cost. That’s when we

started hiring more.

I’ll admit that I was a little worried when those ﬁrst few Dutch team

members stopped coming into the home oﬃce I’d fashioned for us.

Were the chairs not comfortable enough? The snacks not tasty? Had

I forgotten to shower? My colleagues assured me that it was them,

not me: They were simply more productive on their own time, in

their own spaces, without commutes. We had all the technology we

## needed—Slack, Zoom, webcams, Google Docs, and of course GitLab

—to communicate, collaborate, and even develop rapport. And what

mattered most to Dmitriy and me? Progress and results. Success isn’t

measured in input such as hours spent at an oﬃce. It’s about output—

what you achieve.

Today at GitLab, I work with the executive team to set company-level

## objectives and key results (OKRs) for each quarter, but the relevant

teams decide how they want to meet those goals. Each group agrees on

its own OKRs and on how action items should be assigned, and then

individual members can do the work when and where they choose.

Rather than tracking hours logged, we follow the metrics that matter

most for each department. For salespeople, they are sales totals and client satisfaction; for customer support staﬀers, they’re response and

## resolution time; for software engineers, speed of development and

deployment. Interestingly, when we decided to start measuring how

many items of work the engineers were able to ﬁnish, or “ship,” in

a month—rather than the number of whole projects they’d completed

—many people told us they could game the results by breaking up

the work into ever smaller parts. We told them to go ahead, and the

piecemeal approach generated faster and better results.

# Cultural Alignment

Another way we measure team members’ performance is by how well

they work on the GitLab platform and uphold our values, because

that alignment is crucial, especially in a fast-growing, all-remote

# organization.

Every corporate culture rests on norms and values. Norms are the

policies and practices that guide how work gets done, how colleagues

communicate, and so on. Values are what the organization cares about.

At GitLab the top two values are results and iteration.

The GitLab handbook both documents and reﬂects our culture. It is an

evolving online encyclopedia that contains more than 2,000 web pages

of information, including answers to basic questions such as “How do I

create a merge request?” and “How do I ﬁle an expense report?” and

a list of the 22 ways we reinforce our values, from promoting only

those people who espouse them to having a corporate songbook full of

adaptations such as “You’re the Iteration,” sung to the tune of Chicago’s

“You’re the Inspiration,” which we often belt out on team karaoke

# nights.

I and the rest of the executive team also practice what we preach. If you

drill down into the handbook’s team section and click on my picture

and the “read me” link, you’ll ﬁnd not just my bio but also a list of

my ﬂaws (with a directive to tell me when I succumb to them or to

point out ones that I haven’t yet noticed), advice from my direct reports

on how to work with me, instructions for arranging one-on-one time

with me, and a schedule of my regular meetings—among them monthly

“iteration” oﬃce hours, during which I meet virtually with any and

all team members to talk about how we can get better at incremental

innovation and reducing the scope of each project so that we can ship

# sooner.

One big concern about distributed workforces is that people will miss

out on the knowledge transfer that comes from being in the same place

and able to consult colleagues spontaneously. The handbook helps us

solve that problem because it provides a single source of truth accessible

to anyone at any time. Our team members can’t stop by a peer’s oﬃce

to ask for help, but they can consult an up-to-date, collectively edited

resource to get the answers they need.

If what they need to know isn’t there, the next step is to work with

colleagues via Slack or Zoom to understand or decide on the right

information or course of action and then add those insights to the

handbook. It takes a bit of time and energy in the short term but creates

# great long-term beneﬁts.

GitLab is fortunate to have operated this way since the beginning. At co-

located start-ups culture tends to emerge and spread informally. But as

organizations expand into multiple oﬃces, cities, and countries, formal

documentation and reinforcement of norms and values become more

important. Many companies struggle with the transition. We never had

to make that shift. We’ve always known how to ensure that our team,

while fully dispersed, is nonetheless in sync.

# Open Everything

A primary reason that GitLab gravitated to distributed work and

adopted transparency as a core value is the open-source nature of

our tool. From the start Dmitriy wanted everyone to be able to see

the code and build on it, and we get hundreds of contributions from

our community every quarter. By eschewing oﬃces, we put external

collaborators—including customers such as Goldman Sachs, T-Mobile,

and Lockheed Martin—on a level playing ﬁeld with GitLab team

members. We’re all connected in the same online workplace, making

## collaborative software development more eﬃcient.

We are also open with most of our corporate information, and we publish a detailed list of what we aren’t willing or able to share. Public is

the default, and any exceptions are noted. The handbook, for instance,

is online for all to see: programming rules, the songbook, the rundown

of my ﬂaws—everything. As a result, GitLab team members aren’t

the only ones who use it to solve problems. Many people outside the

company—especially those working on software development—have

told us that when they don’t know how to proceed with a task, they

often Google their issue plus “GitLab handbook” to see if our policies

and practices can help them—or at least provide inspiration.

Our commitment to transparency has helped us win customers,

investors, and talent because it creates trust. Our stakeholders

understand that being so transparent makes us accountable for

addressing problems and providing solutions. For instance, by

publishing our product road map in the handbook, we let everyone

see what’s forthcoming. And if you Google “GitLab onboarding,” you’ll

manager, and the rest of the company. Applicants and new hires tell us

they appreciate knowing exactly what to expect from us. As for work

on our enterprise product, all team members can review the merge

# requests, issues, and commits of others.

An idea we talk about a lot is the need for short toes—ones that can’t

be stepped on. If a colleague, close or distant, sees your code and has a suggestion for making it better, don’t be oﬀended. Embrace it. We encourage handing oﬀ work in progress to ensure that happens as often

# as possible.

Recently we’ve also introduced something we call “key meetings”:

We ask each department to give virtual presentations on its progress

## toward quarterly OKRs, key indicators, and top-of-mind issues not just

## to the executive team but also to a wider, interdisciplinary audience

from across the company. We circulate an agenda and people submit

questions. Some attend live, others listen to a recording, and it becomes

## a group rather than a siloed conversation.

# Good Management

Whether you lead an in-person or an all-remote team, many of the same

good-management rules apply. The ﬁrst is exhibiting and encouraging

self-management—what we call being a manager of one. We hire and

train self-starters who can both handle the autonomy associated with

working remotely and proactively engage with their teams.

We expect all managers and executives to host regular team and one-

on-one meetings and to have an open-door (Slack and Zoom) policy.

Being too busy for others should not be a point of pride. Informal

communication is critical, especially for virtual teams, so we should all

make the time for it. Indeed, a team member in Israel popularized the concept of a coﬀee chat—booking a colleague for a short virtual meeting

with no agenda so that the conversation can unfold naturally, as if in an

elevator or at a watercooler. That’s been standard practice across GitLab

# for years now.

We also encourage in-person meetings. Diﬀerent teams do it with

varying frequencies, but during the ﬁrst month of every quarter we

invite team members to use a “get-together grant” to meet up with a

team member either in person or virtually. Before the pandemic the

entire company gathered once a year in a destination such as Cape

Town or New Orleans for a week of workshops and activities focused on

# strategizing and team building.

In some areas we follow the same best practices that other thoughtful

companies do. For example, we work with team members to create a

formal career and growth plan. That helps even the most far-ﬂung to

feel safely tethered. In other managerial realms we are establishing new

standards. Consider team meetings. Most of ours last 25 minutes, which

forces greater eﬃciency. Notes are taken collaboratively in real time in

a Google Doc, which helps clarify and record the resulting action items

while giving people who couldn’t attend greater insight into what they

missed. We’ve distilled these and many other ideas into something we

call “TeamOps” and have made it public as a guide for any organization

—remote, hybrid, or colocated—that’s looking to improve and speed up

its collaborative decision-making and execution. Since October 2022 we have also oﬀered a TeamOps certiﬁcation externally.

As more knowledge-work companies consider how they want to operate

in a post-Covid world, it’s been surprising to see so many insisting

that employees return to an oﬃce, either full- or part-time, despite the

widespread productivity jumps that occurred during lockdowns.

In our view, an in-person workplace operates well until you grow out of

a single room. Once you spread to other ﬂoors and locations, the work

becomes more virtual anyway. Hybrid, meanwhile, is the worst of both

worlds, because it creates a divide between those in the oﬃce and those

outside it. I think we can all admit that meetings with half the people in

a room and the other half on Zoom are typically disastrous.

At GitLab we believe that tech-enabled distributed teams are the future

of knowledge work. We’ve been able to hire exceptional talent from

all over the world and introduce our employees to a more ﬂexible

and productive kind of teamwork that has propelled our company to

new heights. But our success has rested on careful adherence to the

principles I’ve described. We hope that more organizations will follow

our lead and learn how to run an all-remote workplace well.
