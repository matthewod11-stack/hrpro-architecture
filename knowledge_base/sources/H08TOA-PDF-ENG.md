Over the 20 years I have spent coaching executives, there is one topic

that comes up at almost every level of leadership: delegation. Most

leaders know that they should be delegating, and many of them know

how to do so. The stumbling block that holds most leaders back is knowing what to delegate.

## HBR / Digital Article / A Data-Based Approach to Delegating

When I ask executives, “What, according to you, should you delegate?”

I can see them scanning their memories for tasks they would be

comfortable handing over to someone else. Rarely have I seen them

come up with anything signiﬁcant. As a result, they talk about giving up

a few low-risk activities but miss the opportunity to hand over anything

substantive and meaningful. The truth is: Many senior leaders carry

out tasks that might appear seemingly small but are surprisingly time

consuming, and the value they generate isn’t proportional to the time

spent on them. In essence, these tasks rob senior leaders of valuable

time that can be spent on more strategic, higher ROI activities.

To help my clients give visibility into (and measure) these tasks, I ask

them to use a classic time management tool for identifying ineﬃciency

and redundancy: a time log. Instead of relying on a leader’s memory, a

time log presents data of where their time is actually being spent.

Consider the example of a CFO (let’s call him Mike) I was recently

coaching. Mike had been promoted from a corporate controller position

internally. He knew at a conceptual level that he should be reallocating

how he spent his time but was struggling to identify what he could

delegate to his team. Once he had two weeks of time log data, he quickly

recognized all of the tasks he carried forward from his old job into his

new one. There were some reports that he was still running for the CEO,

as well as some reconciliation tasks that he had not gotten around to

teaching his new controller how to perform. He also spotted several

meetings he was attending that would be better attended by a member

of his team. In all, Mike found about 20 hours a month of activities

(tasks and meetings) that he could delegate. He learned so much from

keeping his own time log that he asked each of his direct reports to do

# the same.

## HBR / Digital Article / A Data-Based Approach to Delegating

While a time log might feel tedious, it can be a very eﬀective way to

start freeing up your day for more strategic work. If you’re ready to put

this into action, I recommend approaching this exercise in four steps:

# capture, analyze, delegate, reﬂect.

# Capture

Start by creating a spreadsheet and dividing the workday into 15-minute

increments. Some people ﬁne tune this with 10-minute blocks, others

broaden it to 30 minutes. Those are okay, too, but I do not suggest going

all the way up to 60 minutes, as a lot of the smaller tasks will start to get

lost.

While there are excellent apps out there for time tracking, many of

them have a decent-sized learning curve that results in leaders giving up

before they get going. If you have an app that you like and will reliably

use, you should do that. Otherwise, the humble spreadsheet is an easy

tool most of us know how to use.

Once you have created your log, take some time, two to three times

a day, to reconstruct how you spent your time over the prior two to

four hours (yes, this can feel a lot, but it reaps beneﬁts in the long

term). Anything that took longer than ﬁve minutes goes into the log,

including people dropping by with a question, lengthy text exchanges,

reading reports, and meetings you attended. For the ﬁrst week, just

capture everything; don’t start analyzing your data yet. You want to get

a realistic accounting of what you are doing without judgment. Also, try

to add to your log multiple times each day instead of waiting until the

end of the day (or the next day). Most of us can’t remember what we had

for lunch yesterday, let alone how long we spent answering questions

when someone dropped by.

# Analyze

Once you have at least two weeks of data, start reviewing how you spent

your time. Categorize the tasks into the following four categories:

Should delegate. These are tasks that could be handed over to someone

else without too much diﬃculty. Don’t be surprised by the number

of tasks you see here. For example, you might be preparing monthly

or quarterly reports (like Mike was) or attending meetings that should

actually be your direct report’s responsibility. These may even be carry

over tasks you brought with you from a prior role or tasks you inherited

from your predecessor that you never questioned.

Could delegate. These are tasks that could be given to someone else, but giving them up could take some time and eﬀort. You may realize

that some of these tasks are on your plate because you feel like there

isn’t anyone on your team who has enough skills or experience to do the task, which leads to you keeping it. For example, a diﬀerent CFO

I coach (Tina) would prepare the annual budget presentations for the

company president herself because she worried that her employees did

not have enough expertise or experience with such reports and wouldn’t

complete them to her standards. I had to point out that they weren’t

going to learn how to prepare the presentations if she kept doing it for

them. And the good news is that taking time to teach someone to do something generally pays oﬀ within a few weeks or months (depending

on the activity), both in terms of reallocating your time and growing

# your people.

Should not delegate. These tasks are core to your job and rely on your skill set and position to be eﬀectively executed. If you are able

to delegate tasks in the other two categories, you will have more time

to spend on these activities. For example, a CEO I coached lamented

that he didn’t have any “strategic thinking” time because of all of the

demands on him. He felt like he was constantly working in the business and never had time to work on the business like his predecessor and

mentor had. When he started delegating some of the tasks that were

consuming his time, he was able to schedule 90 minutes with himself

every week to review ﬁnancial projections, read industry publications,

and reﬁne his vision for his business.

Automate or eliminate. This ﬁnal category is for those tasks that

shouldn’t be done by you or your employees. They are either vestigial

tasks or meetings that should be eliminated from your day or tasks that

could be automated, perhaps by an app or with the help of artiﬁcial

intelligence. Tasks that fall under these could include meetings where

your attendance isn’t really necessary, status updates that no one reads,

or manual analysis that could be programmed. For instance, if you can

get other work done during a meeting without negatively impacting the

quality of the meeting, you probably don’t need to be there.

# Delegate

Armed with this data, it is time to create a list of responsibilities that

you need to delegate. My clients usually start with what is in the “should

delegate” category and make a plan to bring someone else in to take

# them over.

Begin by selecting someone whose strengths, interests, and/or

developmental goals align with the task. Then, make some notes on the

task and gather examples or materials that would help the person get up

to speed. Finally, schedule a little time to gauge interest, review the task,

## communicate expectations, and invite questions.

The time such a transition will take depends on both the task and the

employee’s readiness to take it on. More complex tasks, especially those

on the “could delegate” list, probably need a longer plan with additional

times to touch base. You may actually perform the task together the ﬁrst

few times before you start to back out of doing it.

In addition, you may want to delegate meetings that you have

historically been a part of, but don’t really need to be at anymore.

Meetings also merit some preparation and explanation. So, you may

want to prepare notes on what the overall purpose of the meeting

is, what is expected of the employees who attend it, why you have

continued to attend the meeting, or what you’d like to be made aware of

after the meeting once you stop attending it. Like the “could delegate”

tasks, you may attend a few meetings with the person you’re delegating

the meeting(s) to and answer any questions they may have before you

# back out of the meeting entirely.

Throughout the whole process, you’ll want to be aware of the temptation

to take tasks back, especially at the ﬁrst sign of a mistake or hesitation.

When Tina, the CFO I worked with, delegated the annual budget presentations, she actually took the day oﬀ when her team was working

on it and went to a movie so she wouldn’t be tempted to check up

on them. I’m not saying everyone should go to the movies when they

delegate a task, but you should remember one thing in times like these:

you probably weren’t as good when you ﬁrst started performing the task

as you are today.

# Reflect

The last step in the process is to analyze how you have reallocated your

time. After, say, two months, you may consider restarting your time log

for a few weeks to calculate the return on your delegation investment.

At the very least, you can look at your original time log and add up how

much time the meetings and tasks took before and what replaced them.

That is how the CFO, Mike, identiﬁed the 20 hours a month he had been

spending on the tasks he delegated.

If you want to get granular on the return on investment from keeping

the time log, multiply the hours the delegated tasks used to take you

by an estimate of what your hourly pay is (the value of your total

compensation divided by the number of hours you work in a year).

Assuming you are paid more than the person to whom you delegated,

you will be able to see how much value you created by moving that work

over so you can focus on more strategic work.

. . .

Data mined from time logs can be supremely useful for deciding what

you should and could delegate. One beneﬁt of using this tool is how it

changes your view of the tasks that you have in front of you. The other?

You actually end up making space for more strategic things that should

consume your day and have an impact on how business functions.
