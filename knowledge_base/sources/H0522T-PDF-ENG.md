It’s been nearly two years since the #MeToo movement took on wide

momentum, and some big questions remain: What has changed? Do we

know if reports of sexual harassment in organizations have decreased?

What has happened to the women who have spoken up?

It helps to look at data. In 2016, before #MeToo took oﬀ, we surveyed

250 working women in the U.S., asking about the pervasiveness of

sexual harassment in their workplaces and how it impacts them at

work; we also interviewed 31 women in the U.S. about their individual

experiences. We conducted a second survey after #MeToo, in September

2018, of 263 women, and we reconnected with some of the women we

previously interviewed to see whether they’ve seen changes or have

changed their views. The survey was meant to gather quantitative

evidence about changes since #MeToo, and the interviews were meant

to provide insight into why and how the changes occurred.

We measured sexual harassment along three dimensions: gender

## harassment, unwanted sexual attention, and sexual coercion. Gender

harassment involves negative treatment of women that is not

necessarily sexual, but may include things like a supervisor or coworker

making sexist remarks, telling inappropriate stories, or displaying sexist

material. Unwanted sexual attention includes coworker or supervisor

behaviors such as staring, leering, ogling, or unwanted touching. Sexual

coercion includes bribing or pressuring women to engage in sexual

behavior. We also measured participants’ self-esteem and self-doubt, to

see how these correlated with their experiences.

What did we ﬁnd? In terms of what has changed, we saw that fewer

women in our sample reported sexual coercion and unwanted sexual

attention following the #MeToo movement. In 2016, 25% of women

reported being sexually coerced, and in 2018 that number had declined

to 16%. Unwanted sexual attention declined from 66% of women to 25%.

In contrast, we noticed an increase in reports of gender harassment,

from 76% of women in 2016 to 92% in 2018. This data suggests that

while blatant sexual harassment — experiences that drive many women

out of their careers — might be declining, workplaces may be seeing a

## “backlash eﬀect,” or an increase in hostility toward women.

When we examined women’s feelings of self-esteem and self-doubt,

we found an increase in self-esteem and a decrease in self-doubt

## since 2016. More important, the relationship between unwanted sexual

## attention and both of these outcomes (lower self-esteem, higher self-

doubt) was weaker in 2018. Likewise, the relationship between gender

harassment and the outcomes decreased. We believe that the knowledge

that so many women experience sexual harassment has tempered its

## deleterious eﬀects on self-doubt and self-esteem.

Social psychological theories suggest that stigmatizing experiences, like

sexual harassment, can be very damaging to self-esteem, especially

because the stigmatized individuals fear that they are alone and share

in the blame for their mistreatment. Knowing how pervasive sexual

harassment is, and hearing other women’s experiences, can help buﬀer

## one’s self-esteem from the stigma of harassment.

The women we interviewed told us that the #MeToo movement helped

them realize that they were not alone in their experiences. A marketing

executive in her late thirties explained, “I started seeing [#MeToo posts]

coming in, and I was just like, ‘Oh my gosh, they’re being so brave.

Telling very personal stories that I never knew about.’….It isn’t like I’m

vindicated; it is more, I’m validated.”

What should companies and managers be doing now? On the most basic

level, we need to continue to highlight the importance of preventing

## sexual harassment. Within organizations, human resource departments

need to maintain this as a priority, by oﬀering bystander intervention

training, having clear zero-tolerance policies on sexual harassment, and

responding dutifully to complaints.

Several women told us that it is imperative that human resource

departments remain vigilant in responding to concerns around

harassment. One woman said, “I think that it’s more and more

common for people to say something when they see something, or feel

uncomfortable….The bigger issue isn’t somebody saying something in

the ﬁrst place; it’s the response from an employer when they learn

that one of their employees is sexually harassing another.” Managers

can also ensure that women and men feel safe to speak up about

# harassment.

Organizations should also pay attention to gender harassment,

including bullying and sexist comments about women. One woman told

us she believes that women who have been empowered by #MeToo

to call out inappropriate behavior have faced more hostility among

coworkers. It is important that organizations are aware of this, as

constant exposure to gender harassment can be just as damaging to

## women as the most egregious forms of sexual harassment.

Oﬀering training that is focused on this issue, as well as on

microaggressions and unconscious bias, could be useful not only for

encouraging civil behavior but also for empowering peers and leaders to

step in when they see bullying or harassing behavior in the workplace. It

can be stressful for a woman to stand up to sexist comments when they

are directed at her, but it can be a lot easier for a bystander to step in

and diﬀuse the situation.

These eﬀorts will be the most successful if organizations are able

to successfully enlist male allies in the gender equity conversation.

Importantly, men need to hear the message that taking these issues

seriously is not an accusation against them, but rather is a mutual

eﬀort to create an environment of respect in the workplace. I like the

Twitter campaign #yesallwomen, which is intended to remind men (and

women) that no one believes all men are sexual harassers, but that all

women do experience harassment in their careers. As one woman told

us, “[#MeToo] is bringing out a community of men who are supportive

of women and supporting them in whatever challenging situations,

whether it’s to the extreme of the #MeToo movement or just down to,

How do I get equal representation and equal voice in a meeting? It’s

developing a network of men who are comfortable saying, ‘Yeah, I’ll be

your supporter, and I can speak out on your behalf.’”

And we cannot forget the most vulnerable workers. Most eﬀorts around

gender equity and reducing sexual harassment in the workplace focus

on full-time, salaried potential leaders. However, there is evidence that

the people at greatest risk for harassment are gig workers, those making

minimum wage (or server wages), and part-time or temp employees.

People in these roles are often the most powerless because they are

not protected by EEOC laws. Creating a safer workplace means keeping

everyone in mind. Greater legislation to protect non-employees would

be an obvious ﬁrst step, but until that happens gig workers and

organizations can be proactive in putting anti-harassment clauses in

their contracts to increase worker protection. Gig workers can also use

online platforms to crowdsource information about which organizations

are safe

While our results point to the beneﬁts of #MeToo in reducing sexual

harassment over the last two years, we need to ensure that we maintain

these changes, that women and men provide support for those who are

harassed, and that vulnerable workers are not ignored. The goal of these

eﬀorts is continued progress on workplace equity, and this goal beneﬁts

# all employees.

# More on our sample

The overall sample for the survey data consisted of 513 women who

responded to our Qualtrics panel (n = 250 in 2016 and n = 263 in 2018).

The participants ranged in age from 25 to 45 and were working as full-

time employees in the US. The sample for the interview data was 31

women in 2016 and 21 of those women in 2018. They commented on

sexual harassment and the #MeToo Movement. We focused our sample

on women because, while men certainly do experience sexual harassment,

they experience it at a lower frequency and with fewer psychological

outcomes compared to women. We controlled for factors such as work

experience, position level, and race to account for differences between the

2016 and 2018 samples. The 2018 qualitative data was collected with a

subset of the same women interviewed in 2016.
