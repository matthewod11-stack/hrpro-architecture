Companies often need to reduce the size of their workforce. But how

do managers decide which employees to let go and which to keep?

One often-overlooked parameter in the decision-making process is

motivation. The math is simple: All else being equal, the more

motivated employees are, the higher their value — which means

managers should prioritize keeping highly motivated employees

on board. The problem is, employees know that companies value

motivation, so they have a strong incentive to appear motivated, even

if they’re not. To work against that tendency, managers need to create

incentives that will encourage employees to reveal their true levels of

# motivation.

# The Pay-to-Quit Program

One such strategy is to oﬀer employees money to resign voluntarily —

the so-called Pay-to-Quit strategy. Zappos, the online shoe and clothing

retailer, was the ﬁrst to employ the strategy, making what has become

known as “the oﬀer”: a bonus for new hires to quit following a four-week

training period if they didn’t feel that their job was a good ﬁt for them.

Zappos started the bonus at $100. When almost no trainee took the

oﬀer during training, they raised it all the way up to $4,000, and still

almost no one took it — a sign that the company’s workforce was highly

motivated.

Amazon, which bought Zappos in 2009, adopted a variation of this

strategy. Here’s how Jeﬀ Bezos explained it in his letter to shareholders

in 2014, the ﬁrst year Amazon put the program into eﬀect:

Pay to Quit is pretty simple. Once a year, we offer to pay our

associates to quit. The ﬁrst year the offer is made, it’s for $2,000.

Then it goes up $1,000 a year until it reaches $5,000. The headline

on the offer is “Please Don’t Take This Offer.” We hope they don’t take

the offer; we want them to stay. Why do we make this offer? The goal

is to encourage folks to take a moment and think about what they

really want. In the long-run, an employee staying somewhere they

don’t want to be isn’t healthy for the employee or the company.

Amazon made its program available to warehouse workers for years, but

at the beginning of 2022, because of a tightening in the labor market, the

company suspended the program for warehouse workers and now only

oﬀers it to graduates of its Career Choice upskilling program.

In the work I do as a behavioral economist who advises organizations,

I’ve found that the Pay-to-Quit strategy can be remarkably eﬀective. In

many organizations, dissatisﬁed employees have no reason to disclose

their true sentiments, but you can incentivize them to do so by oﬀering

them money to resign, making it costly for them to be dishonest. One

outcome of this strategy is that those who stay are more motivated,

of course. But an additional beneﬁt is that those who stay feel the

need to justify that decision to themselves — which they typically do

by working harder toward longer-term objectives. If they turn the Pay

to Quit money down, in eﬀect they invest it in their future with the

company. This boosts their productivity and commitment.

Everybody wins with this strategy. It allows managers to identify

which employees are genuinely motivated and which are not; it

allows unmotivated employees to make an amicable departure with

money in hand; and it allows motivated employees to genuinely

demonstrate their commitment. And if nobody takes the oﬀer, as

recently happened at Trainual, a company that provides automated

## training and onboarding processes, that’s also a positive outcome: The

company ends up learning something important about its new hires and

providing them with a motivational boost — at no cost.

# Testing the Program

It’s hard to judge the success of such incentive-based programs without

running a controlled study. How can you really know if the right people

are quitting, or if those who stay get a moral boost from doing so? To

ﬁnd out, you need to run an experiment that includes a control group

that is not oﬀered the incentives, which you can compare to a group that

is oﬀered them.

I’ve recently been working with a large consulting company that is

conducting such a test. The model is instructive. The company decided

to implement a signiﬁcant technological change in the way it operated

— a change that would require senior employees to invest time in

learning new technology and drastically alter their working methods.

Some of these employees were enthusiastic about the opportunity, and

others were not, but management couldn’t distinguish between them.

Company leaders recognized that they needed to ﬁgure that out in one

particularly important context — when they were considering which

employees to name as partners. Why? Because when the company

chooses who to promote, it is declaring them highly competent

and valuable, which immediately makes them interesting to other

companies, who often begin eﬀorts to lure them away. The company

wants to avoid a situation in which it trains employees and promote

them to partner at the expense of others, only to see those partners take

their knowledge and training and go elsewhere. In addition, it’s hard

to ﬁre partners even if they don’t do a good job or embrace necessary

changes in how work gets done. That’s why the company wanted to

ﬁgure out which employees were the most motivated before it decided

which of them to name as partners. If the company could do that, it

could then make its investments in training much more strategically

# and cost-eﬀectively.

The Pay-to-Quit strategy seemed perfectly suited to this situation. So the company launched an experiment. In some of its many oﬃces

around the world, it oﬀered employees an exit bonus if they chose to

leave prior to the partnership decision, and it then compared those oﬃces to somewhat similar ones (the control group) where no bonus

was oﬀered. To be considered a success, the program would have to lead to retention rates in the oﬃces where the program was oﬀered that were

# better than that of the control group.

So far, the program has been a success. In the oﬃces that oﬀered the

bonus, close to 12% of the employees chose to take it. Revealingly,

those employees were not the worst performers on the team, which

suggests the program was doing the job it needed to: identifying capable

employees who don’t necessarily feel a strong commitment to the

company and might leave after being named partners. The retention rates of new partners in the oﬃces where the bonus was oﬀered has

also been higher than the rate in the control group. The program was

temporarily put on hold because of Covid-19, but the company now

plans to relaunch the program on a larger scale.

# How to Launch a Pay-to-Quit Program

If you’re considering adopting a Pay-to-Quit program, make sure you

follow these ﬁve rules:

- 1. Be transparent.

When you launch the program, make sure to explain exactly how the

program works and why you’ve decided to launch it. Employees will

respond better to the program if they understand its purpose.

- 2. Offer the right amount. The amount you oﬀer should be suﬃcient to motivate some employees to take it but not so high that lots of them do. That amount will be

diﬀerent at every company, so run a pilot to ﬁgure out what works best

# for you.

- 3. Be selective.

Not all employees should be eligible for the oﬀer. Determine which

groups or positions are most likely to beneﬁt from it (as the consulting

company above did, when it targeted potential partners), and limit the

# oﬀer to those employees.

- 4. Set a deadline.

The program should not be open-ended. Give employees a relatively

short period during which to decide whether to accept the oﬀer, and

make it clear that the oﬀer will not be available after that date.

- 5. Monitor and evaluate.

The program will only succeed if you regularly measure its eﬀectiveness

and make adjustments as needed. This will only be possible if you

ﬁrst clearly deﬁne your long-term goals and then monitor and evaluate

# success relative to them.

Ultimately, the Pay-to-Quit program is an instructive example of how

companies can use the power of incentives to ﬁnd out more about their

employees. Remember, talk is cheap. Simply asking employees about

their preferences may not reveal what you need to know — but with a

smart inventive plan in place, you can learn a lot.
