# Abstract

In this paper authors are aiming to explore the lev el of perception on the topic of trainings from employees ’ perspective, as well as learning and development of employees after they reached the labor market and their impact in human capital. To stay competitive and su rvive in job market it is suggested to acquire higher a nd broader skills and competencies. To achieve this, i function of Human Resources Management. Therefore, impact of training and development and the concept of lifelong learning. For this research 450 questionnaires were used with the public and private institutions regarding the level of trainings they have participated. The importance of trainings increases with technological changes and information technology, globalization and a lot of other factors have their impact in importa nce of continuing adult education and lifelong learning. In this paper will be explored also what training prac management. Where from our findings we can say that most of the trainings in Kosovo are on job trainings, with highest level of participants in the age from 21- 35, this age group uses trainings for learning, age group of 36 -50 years use trainings mostly for sharing in trainings for learning and sharing information, the development. Most of the employees find trainings a trainings are positively correlated with on job tra ining Pearson Correlation 0.83 which is significant .000 at the 0.01 level (2-tailed) from the descriptive data we can find that depending on the age group and ed ucation level Information technology training s have different results. Employees with higher edu cation have less interest in Information Technology trainings compar ed to employees with lower leve ls of education. So, in general, this research aims to give a clear descriptio n of employees’ perspective regarding trainings as on job trainings, IT trainings, and their transfer of trainings to the job market some of employees use it for learning, some employees for sharing information and some for further professional development.

countries, but it is especially important in the co untries that are still in transi tion period, taking into account the lack of skills that employees might hav e. The fast change of technology is giving us the opportunity and access to a variety of information’ s and knowledge, that just in recent years it would be much difficult to find. For this reason many of us have accepted that is essential for the new technologies to be learned, and that we need to adapt with the changes that are happening. The emphasis on constant learni ng and change brings with it some interesting workf

orce challenges Ball & Gotsill (2011). Li felong Learning is important part of working life of employees as well it is important for employers, investing in im proving working skills through formal and non- formal education helps in enhancing creativity, fl exibility and productivity of employees, while for businesses investing in these skills helps them to face the challenges of competition in their field. The potential benefits of training may seem obvious, they will not necessarily follow that training analysis, and it will lead to improved performance. Organi zations nowadays should have an appropriate and effective training culture. Therefore, continuous training is a key element of improving organizational performance and the need for a determined staff de velopment process. Training is one of the tools management often uses to ensure effective responsibility of the Human Resources department. On Job training program is implemented in the working environment where the person being trained will work. The trainee learns by observing the work of experienced employees and working with curr ent work materials, personnel, and machinery under direct supervision. Chen, G., & Klimoski, R. J. (2007) argue that there is a gap in training and development theories and empirical research and that this field should be developed further, due to its importance and lack of research in macro le training effects organizational outcome.

Employee training and development programs represent an important component of human resource management practice. The management of the compan ies should be acquainted with the level of trainings that are needed from its employees, and accordingly establish training programs that will help to optimally apply their skills in order to achieve companies objectives (Kennedy, 2009). In recent years there are changes in education system s, labor markets and the system of trainings and skills acquired. Lifelong learning according to ILO (2019), concerns also the future of the education systems and trainings, so they can be flexib globalization, and after they ente prepared for the situations as between jobs. Educ settings as universities and by attending a training, but it might also happen in less formal settings as online training, but nevertheless it has limited value if it isn’t put into practice (Cervero & Wilson, 2001). EC (2006) for the inclusion in European Union states emphasizes that the adult continuation of learning is very important in order to improve basic skills as well as di gital skills. Which, than enables better economic benefits from the learners side and from employers with increased level of skills and gaining the acquired qualification neede d for the job, and from employers side the more motivated and active workforce which have their im pact in increased profitability for the business. According to Helms (2016) employers and individuals depend on continuing education, employers in order to have highly skilled workers, and from em ployees perspective they need continuation of the education to be able to move forward in their car eer. The method of continuing education should be determined by the content and learning interest. Tr ainings and lifelong learning can be developed at any age and at any time, not only during the working hours.

There have been various theories to explai

organization. In social learning theory, employees obtain new skills and learn how to do their job by perceiving their supervisors or other more expe erudite (Bratton and Gold, 2007). Gogunskii et al, 2016 says that employees and specialists in their fields should be able to identify which skills and knowledge they are missing, and try to find a way a s educational needs, or training needs under the te and development. As the employees grow older their motivation to attend trainings and development will not weaken from their internal forces, but als o from their supervisors’ beliefs that it’s not worth investing in them.

The important re search question is how do employees understand trai nings and how do they use it in their workplace? Results from figure 3 show that for age group 21-35 years trainings are mostly used for learning, for age group from 36 -50 years results show that they use trainings mostly for sharing information’s, while age group 51-65 years use trainings for learning and for sharing information, they also have the highest level of using training velopment.

# 3.2 Correlations Matrix

In this research we have used the Pearson correlation matrix generated from SPSS, to find out to what extent the variables regarding different train ing methods are linearly linked to gender and age and how they affect each other. According to findin gs of Good, (2009) The Pearson correlation test is robust and it gives robust significance levels not relating to means and distribution levels from which statistics are taken.

Correlation analysis is done by means of the correlation coefficient, which gives us a value that

determines the size between two categories or variables. This correlation can take values from -1 to 1.

With regard to this study we explored the level and methods of trainings distributed to different age groups, taking in to account traditional method s as on job training and se minar trainings as well as more contemporary methods of Information te descriptive results we found that the highest level of employees which think that trainings should be compulsory are the older generations and the method of seminar trainings is not distinguished by any age we have a similar participation in all age groups. Alongside professional skills soft skills trainings are very important, there are a numerous of studies that show that there is a lack of soft skills in the job force including, people skills, p roblem solving skills and also problem solving skill s, which are key to professional development. Some of the more contemporary trainings that are in line with labor market needs as soft skills training are attended more from the younger generations in the workforce.
