## Tech Companies Should Speak Up for Refugees, Not Only High-Skilled Immigrants

Refugees depend on their digital services for safety and survival. by Mark Latonero

The Trump administration’s latest travel ban is back in U.S. federal

court. The Fourth Circuit, based in Virginia, and Ninth Circuit, based in

San Francisco, are hearing cases challenging the latest executive order

banning immigrants and refugees from six Muslim majority countries

from entering the United States. Joining the fray are 162 technology

companies, whose lawyers collectively ﬁled an amicus brief to both

courts. Amazon, eBay, Google, Facebook, Netﬂix, and Uber are among

the companies urging federal judges to rule against the executive order,

detailing why it is unjust and how it would hurt their businesses.

While the 40-page brief is ﬁlled with arguments in support of

immigration, it hardly speaks about refugees, except to note that

those seeking protection should be welcomed. Any multinational

company with a diverse workforce would be concerned about limits to

international hiring and employee travel. But tech companies should

also be concerned about the refugee populations that depend on their

## digital services for safety and survival.

In researching migration and the refugee crisis in Europe, my team

and I interviewed over 140 refugees from Syria, and I’ve learned

that technology has been crucial to those ﬂeeing war and violence

across the Middle East and North Africa. Services like Google Maps,

Facebook, WhatsApp, Skype, and Western Union have helped refugees

ﬁnd missing loved ones or locate safe places to sleep. Mobile phones

have been essential — refugees have even used them on sinking boats to

call rescue oﬃcials patrolling the Mediterranean.

Refugees’ reliance on these platforms demonstrates what tech

companies often profess: that innovation can empower people to

improve their lives and society. Tech companies did not intend for their

tools to facilitate one of the largest mass movements of refugees in

history, but they have a responsibility to look out for the safety and

security of the vulnerable consumers using their products.

Some tech companies have intervened directly in the refugee crisis.

Google has created apps to help refugees in Greece ﬁnd medical

facilities and other services; Facebook promised to provide free Wi-Fi

in U.N. refugee camps. A day after President Trump issued the ﬁrst

travel ban, which initially suspended the U.S. Refugee Admissions

Program, Airbnb announced it would provide free housing to refugees

left stranded.

Notable tech leaders have spoken out against policies that turn away

refugees. Soon after the ban, Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg wrote on

his personal page, “We should also keep our doors open to refugees

and those who need help.” He noted that his wife’s family came to the

U.S. as refugees. Brian Chesky, CEO of Airbnb, tweeted, “Not allowing

countries or refugees into America is not right, and we must stand with those who are aﬀected.” And Google cofounder Sergey Brin joined

## the protests against the executive order at San Francisco International

Airport, saying, “I’m here because I’m a refugee.” (He later said that he

## and his family ﬂed oppression in the former Soviet Union.)

These eﬀorts to directly help and advocate for refugees have been

admirable. But collective action from the tech sector would be more eﬀective for swaying the opinions of the courts and the public. The

amicus brief would have been the best opportunity for an industry-wide

statement that the government should welcome refugees, particularly

those who have already cleared stringent security checks to enter the

U.S.

A stronger stance would be in the companies’ best interest.

Corporations are facing greater pressure from their employees and

customers to take a stand on political issues and uphold certain values.

## As Ken Shotts, professor at Stanford Graduate School of Business, told

me, “Many employees (U.S.-born as well as immigrants) expect tech

companies to live up to their grandiose claims about values and doing

good in the world. Unlike employees in most companies, they have

## leverage, due to the tight labor market in Silicon Valley.”

Consider how, a few days after Trump’s ﬁrst travel ban, thousands of

Google employees walked out of their jobs in a day of protest. Consider, too, how Uber suﬀered a PR crisis for seeming tone-deaf immediately

following the ban. Despite CEO Travis Kalanick’s statements in support

of immigrants and refugees, many Uber employees and consumers were

furious that he still planned to attend Trump’s meeting of economic

advisors a few days later. In the wake of the #DeleteUber campaign that

followed, Kalanick stepped down from the advisory council.

In recent years technology companies have tried to convey to the public

that they will protect their consumers against government overreach.

For example, Apple has refused to give government authorities a

backdoor key to encrypted iPhones, and Microsoft recently won a

federal case wherein it refused the U.S. government’s demands to hand

over consumer data stored overseas.

The sector should extend these eﬀorts by making sure its technologies

aren’t used to target broad groups of people based on nationality or

religion. Already the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CPB) is asking

for the social media accounts — even passwords — of visitors from

other counties. The Council on American-Islamic Relations has ﬁled

complaints against the CPB, stating that Muslim American citizens have

been subjected to enhanced screening that includes scrutiny of their

# social media accounts and cell phones.

Trump has talked about creating a database to identify and register

Muslims in America, including refugees. A number of companies,

including IBM, Microsoft, and Salesforce, have stated they will not help

build a Muslim registry if asked by the government. In addition, a

group of nearly 3,000 American tech employees signed an online pledge

promising they would not develop data processing systems to help the

U.S. government target individuals based on race, religion, or national

# origin.

Tech companies need consumers’ trust now more than ever. Deserved

or not, tech is getting blamed for an array of societal ills, from social

media perpetuating fake news to artiﬁcial intelligence taking away

jobs. Trump’s executive order will likely be challenged in other high-

proﬁle cases, giving companies an opportunity to highlight how their

innovations help refugees ﬂeeing conﬂict. The industry can use future

amicus briefs to make stronger collective arguments to the courts and

to the public. In speaking up for the most vulnerable members of our

global community, the tech industry would send the message that it

# cares about more than the bottom line.
