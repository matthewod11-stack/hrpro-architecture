Working with someone who doesn’t pull their weight is more than just

a routine frustration; it can also negatively aﬀect your work—and even

your career. What can you do about a colleague like this? How much

support should you give this person? Do you go to your boss? And how

can you safeguard your reputation within the organization?

# What the Experts Say

Having a colleague who makes mistakes, misses deadlines, or is just

plain lazy is hardly unusual, says Judith White, teaching professor

## of business administration at The University of Illinois at Urbana-

Champaign. “It is probably the single most common complaint: ‘I

have a colleague who doesn’t do their work and I have to pick up the

slack.’” Just because it’s a common problem doesn’t make it easy to

deal with, however. “You need to go back to your basic organizational

behavior class from business school and pull out every tool in your kit,”

she says. Even then, “there’s no quick solution,” says Brian Uzzi, the

## Richard L. Thomas Professor of Leadership and Organizational Change

at Northwestern’s Kellogg School of Management. But when your job

performance suﬀers because of your colleague’s behavior, you need to

take action. It’s not worth “gritting your teeth and waiting it out,” he

says. Here are some thoughts on how to handle the situation.

Diagnose the problem. For starters, says Uzzi, you need to assess the

situation to pinpoint the problem and its root cause. Look at the big

picture, says White. Ask yourself: Why is your colleague falling short?

Do they lack the bandwidth, ability, or resources to do the job? Do

other people see your colleague’s underperformance as a problem? What

impact is it having? And is this is a new situation? “If it’s been going on

for a long time, it will be harder to deal with. Patterns are ﬁxed,” she

says. But if not—maybe this person is junior or new to the organization

and getting up to speed—it will be easier. Answering these questions

will help you ﬁgure out how to address the issue. Remember, though,

“you’re not going to be able to change your colleague.” Rather, you need

to identify what you can do to change the situation.

Be introspective. In that spirit, it’s also wise to reﬂect on your

own behavior, says Uzzi. Make sure you’re not falling prey to the

fundamental attribution error. “When we do well, we tend to credit all

of our positive and unique qualities. When we mess up, it’s because of

forces beyond our control,” he says. “But with others, we believe the

# opposite.”

Think, too, about how you approach your coworker and how they might

perceive you. “When you‘re having trouble with a colleague, it’s often

because you’re sending a signal that threatens them,” says Uzzi. Even

if it’s not your intention, your actions imply “that you are smarter,

faster, more energetic, or your skills are more in line with where the

organization is heading.” If this might be the case, you must “ﬁgure out

ways to remove that threat” by “putting time and energy into making

the relationship better,” he says. “Make it apparent that your success

is their success. Say, ‘I have expertise in this area; you have expertise

in that area. Our skills complement each other. We have a lot to learn

from each other together.’” Your message to this person is simple and straightforward: “Together, we will do the job more eﬃciently.”

Talk to your colleague. If you’re comfortable and relatively friendly

with the colleague in question, Uzzi recommends reaching out to them

directly about their lackluster execution. “Ask, ‘Is anything going on?’”

You might learn that their child is having trouble in school, or their

mother is sick, or that they’re going through a painful divorce. In this

case, you have every reason to believe that “their performance in the

future will be diﬀerent” and you “need to ride this one out,” he says.

Be compassionate. White suggests oﬀering your help so long as it’s

“explicit and time-limited,” she says. Your support “is a stop-gap

measure, not a long-term solution.” For instance, “I noticed you haven‘t

called the client back. Can I do that for you this time?” After all, “there‘s

nothing wrong with helping this employee out if they can help you out

later on.” Employees should trade favors, she adds, “but there has to be

# reciprocity.”

## HBR / Digital Article / When You’re Stuck Working with a Slacker

Talk to your boss (but be judicious). You really shouldn’t complain to

your supervisor about a colleague, says Uzzi. For one thing, “it makes

you look bad. You seem like a whiner—someone who can‘t manage

relationships well,” he says. For another, it makes the boss look bad, he

adds. Your complaint “reﬂects badly on the boss’s ability to select the

right people for the job.” That said, there are ways to broach the issue

## with your manager, both directly and indirectly.

Discuss challenges. “The last thing your boss wants to do is mediate

a relationship between you and your coworker,” says White. And yet,

your boss has a vested interest in your ability to do your job, particularly

if something or someone is getting in the way. Frame the conversation

with that in mind, says White. She recommends saying something along

the lines of, “I’m not able to do my best work because during the day I

ﬁnd myself checking up on things outside [my purview] that distract

me from my assignments.” White cautions against mentioning your

colleague by name. “Make it about you and your work.”

Request joint feedback. If you and this problem individual are involved

in projects that are tightly integrated and being evaluated on your

joint output, “you should ask your boss if the two of you could receive

performance feedback at the same time,” says Uzzi. During the feedback

session, “your boss will ask probing questions about the project, and it

will become obvious who dropped the ball,” he says. Then, assuming

your colleague cares about their job, you’ll have some leverage to

suggest changes. “You can say, ‘The boss is right; we can do better. I

have ideas of how we can improve next time,’” Uzzi says. He predicts

your colleague will be grateful. “The other person will be looking for

solutions that take the pressure oﬀ.”

Seek out different ways to shine. You also need to look for ways

to “reduce your interdependence” on this questionable colleague,

says White. She suggests asking your boss for additional individual

assignments. For instance, “you might say, ‘I love being on the team,

but I‘m looking for new challenges, and I want to do more. Are there

any solo tasks I could take on?’” Your goal is to demonstrate your

competence and “give your boss another way to evaluate you and your

# performance.”

Deﬁne expectations. One way to safeguard your reputation is to ensure

that “expectations and roles are clearly deﬁned,” says White. Let’s

say you and this colleague are collectively responsible for producing

particular elements of projects. White recommends proposing that each

project “has a clear and designated leader.” Project leadership would

rotate to “increase accountability.” This way, “at least you know you’re

going to get credit” for success when you’re the leader, she says.

Bringing your boss into these conversations is key, says Uzzi. When your

manager has weighed in on how “Janet will do this and Deepak will

do that,” then there’s a trail for the boss to know who’s responsible for

each deliverable. “This should provide motivation for the weak link to

produce more high-quality work,” he says.

Invite others in. Another way to change the dynamic of your

relationship with this colleague is to incorporate another person into

the work, says Uzzi. “Paired relationships often fall out of balance,” he

says. “There may be something about the two of you that dampens

[your colleague’s] creativity or hurts their motivation.” Inviting a third

party into your project “changes your chemistry” and builds trust. So,

think about who might make a strong addition to your relationship

and how they might contribute. “Perhaps this person provides new

skills that neither of you have; maybe they inject some creativity; or

maybe they’re a sounding board and can oﬀer feedback.” If this third colleague doesn’t have capacity to oﬃcially join your project, “even just

going out to lunch with them” might improve your interactions with

the underperforming colleague. “The third party helps create social and

professional incentives” to do better.

Cultivate other relationships. Fostering relationships with people

outside your department is always a smart career move, says White. And

when you’re working closely with an underperformer, these connections

can be your lifeline. “Cultivating relationships with colleagues from

other parts of the organization not only makes your job more pleasant, it

also helps you have a reputation outside of your direct team,” she says.

This is especially important “if your team is not in [good standing].” So,

work on seeking out a new network at work. Make time for lunch or

coﬀee with people in diﬀerent divisions. Strike up conversations with

other colleagues. Ask, “What are you working on at the moment? Can

you tell me about your latest project?” This strategy is a much better

option than complaining or jumping ship, notes White. “You’re trying to

solve your problem.”

Stop covering for them. One ﬁnal word: Don’t enable an

underperformer. Of course, it’s good to help other people, but covering

for someone else’s mistakes or lack of ability “is not sustainable,” says

White. Research shows that women, in particular, fall prey to this.

“Women are expected to help out,” she says. Be on your guard. “It will

become toxic for you, and then it becomes toxic for the rest of your

team.” In the long run, “you’re going to be angry at yourself.” If this

person is always bringing you down, you can’t aﬀord to let it continue,

says Uzzi. When all else fails, it might be time to ﬁnd a new job or look

# for a transfer.

# Principles to Remember

# Do:

- Think about what you can do to change the situation. After all, you’re

not going to be able to change your colleague.

- Consider changing the dynamic of your relationship with this

colleague by incorporating another person into the work.

- Foster relationships with people outside your department. It makes

your job more pleasant, and it helps protect your professional

# reputation.

# Don’t:

- Neglect to consider your role in the situation. Ask yourself, is my

behavior having an impact? How might this colleague perceive me?

- Complain to your boss about this colleague. Rather, be thoughtful and

judicious about how you approach your manager.

- Constantly covering for an underperformer is toxic for your career. If

the situation doesn’t improve after you’ve tried numerous strategies,

# move on.

# Advice in Practice

Case Study #1: Request joint feedback and make sure your boss is

aware of your contributions. Lauren Crain, a digital marketer, knows

all too well what it’s like to work with colleagues who aren’t up to

scratch. “In the past, I used to do the work for them, take over when

talking about projects since they would know so little about them, and

do things to save face for the company,” she says.

“But I wasn’t helping the company; in fact, I was helping these

underperformers, and in turn, actually hurting the company by

protecting bad employees.”

A few years ago, she worked closely on a project with a colleague whom

we’ll call Brian. Brian was incompetent and lacking in motivation.

As a woman of color, Lauren felt a special urgency to address the

situation. “Working closely with an underproducing white male was

eye-opening for me,” she says. “He was viewed as more knowledgeable

## and credible simply because of his skin color and sex.”

She quickly realized that covering for Brian would only perpetuate the

idea that he was as good as she was, when “he was not even close,” she

says. Lauren knew she couldn’t change Brian; she could only change

how she handled the situation. She decided against going to her boss.

“I felt like if I complained about Brian, it would make me look petty or

# spiteful.”

But she did a number of other things. At the beginning of the project,

she delineated her responsibilities from Brian’s—and made sure the

boss knew who was responsible for certain deliverables. “I clearly

indicated who had been assigned to work on what, and I made

continuous written updates of my progress,” she says. “I documented

my contributions and ensured that my parts were completed.”

Her goal was to distance herself from Brian’s performance and make

sure her manager knew that she was getting results even if he wasn’t.

The project came in late. “It was presentable, but it wasn’t as great as it

could have been,” says Lauren.

When it was over, Lauren requested that her manager provide feedback

to her and Brian at the same time. Her boss knew that something was

awry. “In the meeting, I was conﬁdent about my performance, so I

let Brian try to explain himself,” she says. Her boss knew what she

accomplished; Brian’s poor performance was also apparent.

Lauren continued to work at the organization, and she got used to

dealing with Brian. “He became known as the underperformer in

our department, and nobody wanted to work with him,” she says.

“Eventually, he left the company.”

Her advice to others in this situation: “Don’t let an underperformer drag

you down, because they will if you let them. Stand tall; let your work

speak for itself.”

Case Study #2: Deﬁne roles and responsibilities to increase

## accountability. Rafael Salazar, an occupational therapist and

consultant, has ﬁrsthand experience working with an underperforming

# colleague.

Earlier in his career, Rafael was involved in a project to roll out a

new initiative at a veterans’ hospital. “My team was tasked with doing

some PR and developing training materials and messaging strategies to

increase employee adoption,” he says. “There were a couple of members

of the team who were minimally engaged throughout the duration of

the project.”

One person—we’ll call him Sam—was particularly challenging. Sam

didn’t respond to email, let deadlines slip, and often failed to show up

for meetings. Rafael was frustrated. “There were times when I and other

team members ended up covering for Sam,” he says. “We just pitched in

and got the work done.”

Rafael didn’t want Sam to drag down the project. He also knew he

needed to protect his professional reputation. He employed multiple

strategies. For instance, he left a “substantial paper trail” in all his

communication with Sam. “I cc’d the rest of the team and other

pertinent stakeholders when appropriate,” he says.

The paper trail made it clear that Rafael was working hard and getting

results; it also showed when Sam was dropping the ball.

In addition, Rafael made a point to clearly deﬁne individual roles

and expectations for each part of the project. “I made sure there was

documentation showing each team member’s responsibilities, with

deadlines and points of contact,” he says. “That way, if there ever was

any question about who was responsible, people could simply check the

# last update email.”

The situation improved and the project came oﬀ well. “Increased

communication led to clarity around roles and responsibilities,” he

says. “And it also increased accountability and social pressure that

incentivized everyone involved to pull their weight.”

## Today, Rafael is the president of Rehab U Practice Solutions, the

Augusta, Georgia-based healthcare education and consulting company.

He says he learned a lot from the experience. “You need to look

at situations like these as opportunities to develop interpersonal

leadership skills,” he says. “Sometimes underperforming team members

need extra guidance, clarity, or motivation to achieve the goals of the

project. You don‘t have to be the team lead or project manager to assist

or provide that leadership and direction.”
