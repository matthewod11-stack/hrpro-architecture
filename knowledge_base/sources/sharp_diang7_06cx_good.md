## Competency Models Develop Top Performance

Sharp Electronics finds successful

# formula for competency model.

## By Richard Montier, David Alai, and Diana Kramer

THERE IS NO ONE magical solution that enables companies to succeed in today’s competitive global marketplace. However, businesses are increasingly adopting com- petency models,which prove their value as a human resources management tool.

Sharp Electronics Corporation, the North American sales and marketing subsidiary of Osaka, Japan-based Sharp Corporation, was among the first wave of companies to adopt competency models and is now set to embark upon a second phase.

Sharp developed a core competency model nearly seven years ago. The second

phase of the initiative will include five competency models that are specific to several strategically important job func- tions in sales and marketing, and a revised core competency model.

High-potential employees Sharp’s interest in developing its initial core competency model was instigated by the need to adapt to a more competitive market characterized by increased cus- tomer requirements and many new digital products. To meet that demand, the com- pany set out to clarify the knowledge, skills, and behaviors that would enable employees to achieve the organization’s goals. While competency models have many applications, some appealed more than others to important stakeholders.

# MEASURING AND EVALUATING

For example, executive management was very interested in consistent and ob- jective criteria to identify high-potential employees. Additionally, the human re- sources department wanted to use com- petencies as part of an employee development system in which employ- ees could, on their own or with their managers, use core competencies as ref- erence points to compare nontechnical job requirements with their individual profile to identify meaningful gaps. HR also considered the competencies as a useful listing of “how” factors to supple- ment a performance appraisal that em- phasized management by objective.

The fact that so many stakeholders with differing perspectives can find val- ue in competencies is probably one of the key attributes that contributes to the past, present, and future popularity of this technology.

Comprehensive research The concept of a competency model is likely to find broad appeal within most or- ganizations. When conducted in a pur- posefully inclusive manner, the creation process is likely to reinforce these initial positive perceptions. Fortunately, the methodology used to build and validate a model strengthens those feelings as the necessary research and analysis re-

for the competency project. Interviews were conducted with senior executives to outline the corpora- tion’s future. The dis- cussions included ● Sharp’s strategic di- rection ● anticipated changes in the business ● knowledge, skills, behaviors necessary to achieve goals.

The model incorporates the following competencies:

There has been a productive profession- al debate about the value of generic com- petency models versus custom-designed ones. When time permits and the cost of cus- tomizing is within the means of the customer, customized models are more likely to be ac- cepted and applied. Customized competen- cy models constructed with employee invol- vement create buy-in and marketing buzz. They are also more likely to reflect busi- ness priorities and use language that management and employ- ees recognize as their own.

- demonstrates creativity ● learns continuously ● establishes high standards ● uses information technology ● communicates effectively ● partners with others ● understands the organization ● drives change ● focuses on the customer ● knows the global business ● thinks strategically ● delegates authority ● develops and coaches ● leads others.

Other competency models and best prac- tices were also re- searched. These pro- vided an external vali- dation benchmark for the study. Moreover, behavioral interviews were conducted with top performers, and examples of exceptional performance were analyzed. Themes emerged and were interpreted to construct the initial competency model.

In Sharp’s case, individuals at all levels throughout the organization played a sig- nificant role in developing and validating processes for the custom core competen- cy model.

Focus groups provided additional in- put regarding knowledge and skills re- quired for specific competencies. They also facilitated lively debate among par- ticipants to create ownership and com-

mitment to the process. Data from the focus groups were analyzed,and the core competencies were further developed.

Interview and focus group participants met to validate the specific core compe- tencies.Senior management reviewed the core competency model to ensure that it reflected the desired competencies.

Core competency model The core competency model that emer-

ged contains 14 competencies grouped into four themes. Each competency has a unique behavioral definition and five stages of development. The be- havioral descriptors depict perfor- mance along a continuum from low to high. Each descriptor incorporates all prior behaviors for that competency.

When assessing individual perfor- mance, typical behavior is evaluated. Because descriptors reflect observable

behaviors,individuals can readily identi- fy where they are on the scale and target opportunities for enhancement based upon their strengths and gaps compared to job requirements.

Shortly after launching the core com- petency model, a sales department man- ager inquired about how to use the methodology to improve sales manager performance. The process included a multi-phase approach similar to the core

competency model. A targeted model specific to sales managers was developed that consists of 12 competencies grouped into four categories.

A process was adopted whereby each sales manager was evaluated to assess strengths and developmental areas. Once complete, the sales director met with each sales manager to review the outcomes and create individual develop- mental plans to enhance each sales manager’s performance.

Core competency applications Integrating competency models into oth- er human resources systems is crucial to their acceptance. There are three key processes upon which Sharp focused its initial competency applications. Developing people. Using competencies as the foundation for development plans enables employees and their managers to target specific strengths and develop- mental areas.The company then created a detailed resource guide matching the company’s custom competency model that lists a wide variety of self-improve- ment ideas (job activities, readings, web- sites, and seminars). The goal of the resource guide is to increase the frequen- cy of development planning by making it easier to do. Selecting top performers. Competencies are often used as tools to identify the best candidates to fill new or open posi- tions.To encourage interviews based up- on the custom core competency model,

Sharp created a spe- cial interview guide that includes pre- interview activities, suggestions on how to open and close the interview, a section on work history, and summary ratings on competencies. Managing performance. Sharp’s performance management pro- cess strongly empha- sizes evaluating em- ployee performance based upon mutual expectations without offering the tradi- tional section where the manager assesses “how” factors.The core competency model became a way to give employees feedback about how per- formance results were achieved.

For the next phase, Sharp’s highest pri- ority will be to in- crease the use and application life span of the competency models. The com- petency models must be better integrated into the company’s selection and promotion procedures and its performance management process. There are different ways of achieving these goals, and part of the challenge will be matching options to the company’s culture, resources, and needs. TD

Lessons learned The organization is now poised to begin a second round of competency models. Major lessons learned during the original implementation included ● Given the company’s culture, cus- tomizing is important. ● Employee participation in the devel- opment of the model created good awareness about the initiative. ● Nearly all nonsales supervisors and mid-level managers received training
