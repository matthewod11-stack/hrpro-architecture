# Introduction

Today’s competitive world has posed many challenges to organizations in the form of diverse

consumer demographics, complex strategies of competitors, changing customer base, workforce

issues and many others. Sustaining in such a situation requires an organization to have

committed and loyal employees. It is also necessary that these employees guarantee high levels

of productivity. Managements have ensured that they have all the necessary programmes and

initiatives to satisfy their employees. At the same time they are aware that satisfaction may not

always result in productivity. Satisfied employees may just be working to meet the demands of

the job. Such efforts do not lead to higher productivity. Research has shown that it is engaged

employees ensures higher productivity in organizations. Hence, the trend is towards designing

programmes to enhance the level of employee engagement through satisfied employees.

Employees are said to be engaged when they show a positive attitude towards their organization

and express a commitment to remain with the organization.

Defining employee engagement

There are many definitions to employee engagement. CIPD defines employee engagement as a

combination of commitment to the organization and its values plus a willingness to help out

# Journal of Economic Development, Management, IT, Finance and Marketing, 4(1), 27-37, March 2012 28

colleagues. This definition says that engagement is more than job satisfaction and is a complex

# concept than motivation.

Right Management (2006) defines true engagement as every person in the organization

understanding and being committed to the success of the business strategy, and that this goes

more than just simple job satisfaction and incorporates aspects of commitment, pride and

## advocacy about the organisation’s products and brand.

Kahn defines employee engagement as the harnessing of organization members’ selves to their

work roles, in engagement, people employ and express themselves physically, cognitively, and

emotionally during role performances. The cognitive aspect of employee engagement concerns

respondents’ beliefs about the organisation, its leaders and working conditions. The emotional

aspect concerns how respondents feel about each of those three factors and whether they have

positive or negative attitudes toward the organisation and its leaders. The physical aspect of

employee engagement concerns the physical energies exerted by individuals to accomplish their

# roles.

To sum up, Truss defines employee engagement as ‘passion for work’, a psychological state

which is seen to encompass the three dimensions of engagement discussed by Kahn.

Job satisfaction as a factor leading to employee engagement

Job satisfaction is defined as the extent to which employees like their work. Based on

perceptions, an employee develops a positive or negative attitude towards their job and

environment. (Ellickson, M, 2002). The more a person’s work environment fulfills his or her

# needs, values or personal characteristics, the greater the degree of job satisfaction.

# Journal of Economic Development, Management, IT, Finance and Marketing, 4(1), 27-37, March 2012 29

Job satisfaction is defined as a pleasurable or positive emotional state resulting from the

## appraisal of one’s job or job experiences (Locke & Henne, 1986).

Only a satisfied employee can become an engaged employee. Satisfied, loyal and productive

employees create value. Employee’s satisfaction in turn results primarily from high quality

support services and policies that enable employees to deliver results to customers. Hence, it is

necessary to match the job with the career goals of an employee so that he or she experiences

# satisfaction with the job.

# Rationale of the study

Nowadays more and more organisations come forward with the mind to improve employee

satisfaction level as it is the key to successful rising of employee morale and hence productivity

it also helps in minimizing attrition rates. The study is for finding the level of employee

satisfaction in the organization and developing an employee engagement programme to increase

# productivity.

# Objectives of the study

1.(cid:32) To study the factors influencing employee satisfaction among employees in the company.

2.(cid:32) To develop an employee engagement programme for the organization.

# Literature review

Employee engagement and job satisfaction and their inter-relationships have been researched

extensively from the academic and practitioner’s perspective. An attempt is made here to

highlight a few of the studies to support the present study.

BlessingWhite (2011) have reported the engagement levels in India during the year 2010.

According to the report 37% of the employees in India are engaged. Engagement levels in India

# Journal of Economic Development, Management, IT, Finance and Marketing, 4(1), 27-37, March 2012 30

# vary across organizations, organization size, gender, workplace structure and functions. Younger

employees were less engaged as compared to older and married employees. Employees in

healthcare and chemicals had maximum engagement levels and least in banking and financial

services. Among the drivers of engagement, Indian managers identified three factors of job

# satisfaction such as career development opportunities and training (28%), more opportunities to

do what one does best (21%) and more challenging work (15%) as the most important

# contributors.

The Towers Perrin (2003) study of engagement identified both emotions and nationality as core

components. They found that emotional factors are linked to an individual’s personal satisfaction

and the sense of inspiration and affirmation they get from their work and from being part of their

# organization.

Harter et al (2002) conducted a meta-analysis of studies previously conducted by the Gallup

Organisation. The study examined aggregated employee job satisfaction sentiments and

employee engagement, with the latter variable referring to individual’s involvement with as well

as enthusiasm for work. Based on 7939 business units in 36 organisations, the results showed

# positive and substantive correlation between employee satisfaction, engagement and business

# unit outcomes of productivity, profit, employee turnover, employee accidents and customer

# satisfaction

Many studies aimed at identifying what contributes to satisfaction have revealed that situational

context (eg. Supervisory support) as a cause of satisfaction and has argued that high –

# performance work practices and a positive working climate foster employee satisfaction (Bowen

## & Ostroff, 2004; Wright, Dunford & Snell, 2001).

# Research methodology

# Journal of Economic Development, Management, IT, Finance and Marketing, 4(1), 27-37, March 2012 31

The present study aims to know the influencing factors on employee satisfaction and developing

an employee engagement and was done at UAE Exchange and Financial Services Ltd located in

Cochin. The organization had 2500 permanent employees. For the purpose of the study 150

employees were selected using systematic sampling technique. A questionnaire was prepared

with 30 statements on job satisfaction. This was pretested for its reliability and an alpha score of

0.76 was obtained. This questionnaire was used to collect primary data from the respondents

through a survey. The data collected was subjected to correlation and regression analysis to

satisfy the first objective of the study. Based on the results suitable suggestions are given to

# design employee engagement programmes.

# Limitations

1.(cid:32)

Some respondents were seen to be cautions in responding openly to the items in the

# questionnaire.

2.(cid:32)

There were also constraints of limited time available.

# Findings and discussion

The questionnaire used for the current study had the following factors under consideration:

# Leadership and planning, Corporate culture and work ethics, Communication, Career

development, Role, Recognition and reward, Teamwork and cooperation, Working conditions,

Immediate supervisor, Training program and Benefits. The following section shows the findings

of the objective, i.e., to identify the factors influencing employee satisfaction. Correlation and

regression analysis was done on the data collected to get the results.

The above Table 1 indicates the factors of employee satisfaction that are related with the overall

employee satisfaction score. Correlation is high in case of Recognition and reward (r = 0.813, p

< 0.01), Immediate supervisor (r = 0.792, p < 0.01), Communication (r = 0.788, p < 0.01), Role

(r = 0.779, p < 0.01), Culture and ethics (r = 0.746, p < 0.01), Training programme (r = 0.725, p

< 0.01), Working condition (r = 0.688, p < 0.01), and Leadership and planning (r = 0.684, p <

0.01). The correlation was low for Team work (r = 0.580, p < 0.01) and Career (r = 0.496, p <

0.01).

The above factors were subjected to regression analysis to identify the most influencing factors

of employee satisfaction and the results are indicated in the table below.

The above table 2 shows the important influencing factors of employee satisfaction. Role is the

most important influencing factor of employee satisfaction (B = 1.435) followed by Training

programme (B = 1.280), leadership and planning (B = 1.181), culture and ethics (B = 1.098),

Supervisor (B = 1.018). The least influencing factor of job satisfaction was Communication (B =

0.507).

The respondents were highly satisfied with their work. They had the necessary materials and

equipments to perform the job supported by adequate authority to make decisions related to the

work. They took pride in contributing towards organizational goals through their efforts. On the

other hand the management provided them with adequate training to help the respondents to

effectively do their jobs. The management guided the respondents through clear cut objectives

and well laid out policies which were implemented without any prejudice. The respondents had

full trust on all managerial actions relating to work. The management on the other hand respected

the initiatives taken by the respondents to ensure superior quality in providing service to clients

and customers. The respondents were satisfied with the relationship they had with their

immediate supervisor who were including the opinions of the respondents in taking decisions on

work related issues. The fair treatment by the supervisors was a motivation to the respondents to

# provide superior customer service.

The respondents were moderately satisfied with benefits and recognition and reward schemes in

the organization. This shows that the monetary compensation was not up to the satisfaction of the

respondents. The training programme provided was to meet the current work needs and career

# Journal of Economic Development, Management, IT, Finance and Marketing, 4(1), 27-37, March 2012 34

needs were not adequately met through these programmes. The working conditions were

# moderately satisfactory with realistic deadlines and adequate physical work conditions.

Sometimes work pressure interfered with personal life thereby causing some dissatisfaction to

the respondents. Respondents showed very low satisfaction with teamwork as it caused

confusions at work thereby slowing down the pace of work. They also felt that communication

between the top management and employees were not clear and information on strategies and

activities were not transparent on all occasions.

suggested to

the management to enhance employee commitment
