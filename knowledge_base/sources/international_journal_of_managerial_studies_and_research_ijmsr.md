Abstract: This study is aimed at looking into the importance of motivation in the management of people at work, no system moves smoothly without it, and no organization achieve its objective without motivating its human resources. The study therefore is to study and come out with the effect and ways of motivating worker in organization, hence comparative study of Manufacturing firms in Nnewi, Chicason group Nig Ltd, Ibeto group of company Nig Ltd, Capital Oil and Gas Nig Ltd, Cultix Cable Nig Ltd, and Innoson Motors Nig Ltd. Descriptive and inferential statistics were used in the analysis of the data. Necessary literatures were reviewed. During the analysis of the data it was discovered that the goal of motivation is to cause people to put fourth their best efforts with enthusiasm and effectiveness in order to achieve and hopefully surpass organizational objective. It is evidence that workers of manufacturing firms in Nnewi are poorly motivated; hence low productivity. Findings from the research on productivity of manufacturing firm’s staff are reported. Two sets of questionnaires were employed in the study. One set was administered on management staff and the other on junior staff. The study reveals that salaries paid to junior staff in the company were very below the stipulations of Nigerian National Joint Industry Council. It further shows that the junior staff is rarely promoted and the junior staff prefers financial incentives than non financial incentives. The study recommended that increase in salary via promotion; overtime allowance and holiday with pay should be used as motivational tools.

- 1. INTRODUCTION 1.1 Background of the Study Motivation, as a process, started with a need in human being which creates a vacuum in a person. In an attempt to fill the vacuum an internal driving force is generated which starts and sustains a chain of action and reaction. It is at that point that the vacuum is also filled. With this background information, Nnabuife (2009), define motivation as the internal or external driving force that produces the willingness to perform an act to a conclusive end. This first aspect of motivation we choose to describe as internal motivation because the driving force comes from within an individual. The second aspect is external motivation, is applied by the organization. This is because employees are motivated to identify with organization in order to satisfy their varied and variegates needs and desires. Until they have been identified and properly satisfied, they will never cease to impede smooth running of the organizations One of the biggest problems facing manager in the organizations is how best to get employees committed to their work and put in their best towards the accomplishment of organization’s objectives. Motivation is concerned with why people do what they do. It answers such questions as why do managers or worker go to work and do a good job. This tries to explain what motivates people to act the way they do, with primary focus on the work place. It is the primary task of the manager to create and maintain an environment in which employees can work efficiently and realize the objectives of the organization.

Employees differ not only in their ability to work but also in their will to do so (motivation). To motivate is to induce, persuade, stimulate, even compel, an employees to act in a manner which fulfilled the objectives of an organization.

The motivation of employees depends on the strength of their motives. Motives are need, wants, desire, or impulses within the individual and these determine human behaviour. Therefore, motivation is the process of arousing behaviour, sustaining behaviour progress, and channeling behaviour into a specific curse of action. Thus, motives (needs, desire) induce employees to act. Motivation therefore is the inner state that energies people, channels and sustains human behaviour.

Since it has been established that all behavior except involving responses are goals directed, manager can apply motivational theories of management in their attempt to direct the job behaviour of employees towards the goal of their establishment.

Every organization and business wants to be successful and have desire to get consent progress. The current era is highly competitive and organizations regardless of size, technology and market focus are facing employee retention challenges. To overcome these restraints a strong and positive relationship and bonding should be created and maintained between employees and their organizations human resource or employees of any organization are the most central parts so they need to be influenced and persuaded towards task fulfillments.

For achieving prosperity, organizations design different strategies to compete with the competitors and for increasing the performance of the organizations. A very few organization believe that the human personnel and employees of any organization have its main assets to which can lead them to success or if not focused well to decline. Unless and until, the employees of any organization are satisfied with it, are motivated for the tasks fulfillment and goals achievements and encouraged, none of the organization can progress or achieve success.

Employee motivation is one of the policies of managers to increase effectual job management amongst employees in organization (shadier et al. 2009). A motivated employee is responsive of the definite goals and objectives he/she must achieve, therefore in that direction. Rutherford (1990) reported that motivation formulates an organization more successful because provoked employee are constantly looking for improved practices to do a work, so it is essential for organizations to persuade motivation of their employees (Kalimullah et al 2010) Getting employee to do their best work even in strenuous circumstances is one of the employees most stable and greasy challenge and this can be made possible through motivating them. 1.2 Statement of Problem

Workers leave organization due to the fact that they are not motivated enough. Some are not willing to leave because they are enjoying some benefit in terms of promotion, which leads to increase in salaries and wages, bonus and some other incentives.

The workers of Manufacturing firms in Nnewi will prefer financial incentives to non financial incentives ,more especially the junior workers ,due to the fact that such incentives are not used as a motivational technique, the company have the problem and challenges of retention of their employees. Hence low performance and productivity becomes the end result and finally work dissatisfaction. 1.3 Objective of the Study The main objective of this study is to ascertain the motivational techniques adopted by the Manufacturing firms in Nnewi. Other specific objectives are:

- 1. To investigate the motivational techniques adopted by the Manufacturing firms. 2. To examine the response of the employees to motivational techniques adopted by the Manufacturing firms in Nnewi.

- 3. To find out the problem hindering the success of the employees motivation in the Manufacturing firms in Nnewi

- 4. To ascertain if motivation lead to higher performance and productivity.

- 2. CONCEPTUAL FRAMEWORK

Several management scholars have given several definitions of motivation. According to Middle Most and Hit (1981), motivation is the willful desire to direct one’s behaviour towards goals. The three key elements in this definition are willful desire, (person’s choice) behaviour and goal - directed purpose of behaviour. Lakin Folajin (2001), spoke at motivation as term used generally when somebody is stimulated, the interest of a worker so as to be able to work and bring or breeds efficiency in his work. Robbins (2001) defines motivation as the forces that energizes, direct and sustains a person’s effort. Joena Agbato (1988) says motivation is an important determination of human behaviour, it sit that which moves one towards a goal, thus, motivation begat performance. Luthans (1998) motivation is a process which starts with a physiological or psychological deficiency or need that activates behavior at a drive that is aimed of a goal or incentive.

Motivation is an art targeted to getting people work willingly, and an art of inducing one to behave in a particular manner to achieve a task Mee-Edoiye and Andawei (2002) viewed motivation as a human engineering approached being triggered by the individual needs. Flippo (1982) defined motivation as a psychological process initiate by the emergence of needs involving a good directed action and behaviour aimed at satisfying a particular desire. It is inducement given to workers for higher output.

Motivation behaviour has three basic characteristics:-

- 1. It is sustained – it is maintained for a long time – until satisfied. 2. It is goal directed – it seeks to achieve an objective. 3. It results from – felt need – an urge directed towards a need.

Several authors including Robert and Gene Neuport (1995), Williams (1997) and Cole (1990) have propounded theories to help to understand the human being and how to handle them to get goals achieved.

# The Theories Propounded Include:-

The Maslow’s theory of Hierarchy Needs: Abraham Maslow developed a need based theory of motivation. People are extraordinary complex creatures with many motives for behaviors on and off the job. Maslow (1954) identified and analyzed five basic needs which he believed underlay all human behaviors, these needs relate to physiology (the needs for food water, air, shelter, clothing and sex) security (safety, the absence of illness), society or affiliation (friendship, interaction, love) esteem (respect and recognition), and self actualization (the ability to reach one’s potentials). These are perceptions for higher performance and productivity of individuals

Before Maslow, most managers assumed that money primarily motivated people. With Maslow’s work, managers can evaluate their own actions, their companies conduct and their individual philosophies about people. Maslow’s needs theory presented a workable motivation framework for managers.

# Mc Gregory’s Hygiene Theories X and Y

An unmet need can frustrate an employee and make him unproductive. Douglas McGregor published the human side of enterprise in 1960. In it, he explained that managers operate from one or two basic assumptions about human bahaviour.

# Theory X and Y

The first theory, the view traditionally held about employees, portrayed workers in organization as being lazy and needing to be coerced, controlled and directed. The second described people as McGregor thought them to be:, responsible, willing to learn and given the proper incentives inherently motivated to exercised ingenuity and creativity Mc Gregory holds the view that the traditional way of treating people regarding them as unthinking, uncertain robots – must changes. Indeed McGregor stressed that only changing these assumptions could managers tap workers or laborer’s vast talents.

He emphasized that what matters was how people were treated and valued in their work setting. He went further by advising managers to give employees a chance to contribute, take, control and responsibility familiarity with theories of motivation allows a manager an educated view point from which to consider how to develop workers, captive commitment and develop a positive work environment.

Theory X Human being basically dislike to

Theory Y Most human beings find work as

Because most people dislike working, they have to be closely supervised threatened with punishment little to reach objectives. Most people have creativity. They are not capable of solving problems. Rather they must be directed.

People do not need threatened with punishment; they will work voluntarily towards they are organizational objectives committed.

# Effect of Motivation on Employee Productivity: A Study of Manufacturing Companies in Nnewi

The cores of theories X and y is that a management philosophy influences the type of work climate the manager endeavors to create and ultimately, how the managers treat people.

# The ERG theory of Motivation:

The ERG theory of motivation propounded by Clayton Alderfer is indeed a reaction of Maslow’s theory. He argued that there are three core needs which he classified as

# E = Existence needs

# R= Relatedness needs

# G= Growth needs

Alderfer’s Existence needs has to do with the satisfaction of our basic material requirement such as food, water, pay and working conditions, they can be classified as physical and safety needs.

The relatedness needs is similar to the social role needs of Maslow’s theory and their includes social and interpersonal relationship.

Finally, the growth need is intrinsic desire for personal development or making creative productive contribution. Alderfer argued that if the gratification of a higher level order need is stifled, the desire to satisfy a lower level need increase i. e frustration, regression and dimension (Stone et al, 2009). Alderfer also suggests that people can have the desire to fulfill the three needs at a time and pursue them simultaneously.

Another type of need theory is the Acquired need theory. This was made popular by David McClelland and states that some needs are acquired as a result of life experiences. He identifies need for achievement, need for affiliation and need for power to control others.

# The Need for Achievement:

This is the need/desire to set challenging goals, work to achieve the goals or the desire to excel in relation to set standard.

The need for achievement is defined by the following desire to accomplish something difficult: to master, manipulate or organize physical objectives human being or ideas.

To rival and suppress others to increase self regards by the successful exercise of talents

# The Need for Affiliation:

This is the need to be like and accepted by others. People with the need strive for friendship, prefer co-operative situation rather than competitive situations and desire relationship involving a high degree of mutual understanding. People with higher need for affiliation prefer to spend more time maintaining social relationship joining groups, etc individual with a high degree of need are not effective managers or leaders because they will find it difficult to make decisions without worrying about the feeding of others or being dislike by others.

# The Need for Power:

This is the dislike to have impact, to be influenced and to control others. They also have the desire to coach, teach or encourage others to achieve, they love to work and are concerned with discipline and self respect. The need for power has both negative and positive respect. The negative side is manifested in a winner’s take all mentality e.g. “if I win you u lose” The positive side is focused on accomplishing group goals and helping others obtain the feeling of competence.

Other theories exist and include equality theory which states that it is not the actual reward that motivate but the perception, and the perception is based not on the reward in isolation, but in comparison with the efforts that went into getting it and the rewards efforts of others. The reinforcement theory of the B.F Skinner indicates the effects of the consequences of a particulars bahaviour on the future occurrences of the behaviour which are positive reinforcement, negative reinforcement, punishment and extraction.

## Vroom’s Expectancy Theory Brought Quantitative into Motivation Theory.

It brought together many of the elements of the previous theories. It combines perceptual aspects of equity theory with the behavioral aspects of the other theories; it gives the equation

M = E x I x V Where: M = MOTIVATION E = EXPECTANCY I = INSTRUMENTALITY V = VALENCE

This shows that motivational force is related to expectancy, instrumentality and valence in a multiplicative manner. The summary is that people tend to sustain behaviour that results in the satisfaction of their needs. 3. THEORETICAL FRAMEWORK The theoretical framework adopted for this work is the Political System Theory. Eckstrand (1964) which we have specifically adopted for this research project: will briefly explain on a general plane what systems theory or approach is all about.

System approach for analyzing social and organization phenomena was introduced by Easton (1953). Easton wished to construct an empirically oriented general theory of politics. Although the system approach was first developed in the biological and engineering sciences. David Easton adopted it and sought to define the kind of function characteristics of any political system through a systematic framework for political analysis. He examined the basic processes through which a political system regardless of its genetic or specific type is able to persist as a system of behavior in a world either of stability or of change.

# The Tenets of the Theory

- 1. System: It is useful in the sense that it views political life as a system of behavior. A political system is a sub-system of a social system.

- 2. Environment: A system is distinguished from the environment in which it exists and opens to influence from it.

# Figure 2. A Model of the System Approach

Response: Here, a system interacts with its environment by importing inputs, while it exports output in order to maintain itself in a permanent state of equilibrium.

Feedback: The capacity of a system to persist in the face of stress is a function of the presence and the nature of the information and other influences that return to its actors and decision makers. 4. METHODOLOGY The method of investigation used was the survey method. This study covers the two major categories of staff in manufacturing firms in Nnewi, the management and junior staff categories. This was done in order to determine whether workers are adequately motivated and how it affects their job performance.

The research study covers a population of 2,000 workers in different department of the Firms. This cuts across all levels of workers made up of management, senior and junior staff.

The sample size of the study is of a situation whereby some parts of the population were randomly selected to make sure that everybody have the chance of been selected. The sample size for this study will be based on the mathematic model by Taro Yamani (1964) formulae

n =

N 1 + N (e) 2

# Where:

# n = Sample size

N = the population of size 2,000

# e = Level of significance (0.05)

# t = constant

Applying the above model, we have

2000 1 + 2000(0.05)2

= 2000 1 +2000(0.0025)

=

2000

# = 400 sample

Therefore, the sample for the study consisted of 400 staff of the manufacturing firms in Nnewi.

400 copies of questionnaires were administered by the researcher personally to the respondent at Chicason Group Of Company Nnewi (1) Ibeto group of company Nig Ltd (2) Capital Oil and Gas Nig Ltd Nnewi (3) Cultix Cable Company Nig Ltd Nnewi and Innoson Motors Nig Ltd Nnewi .

A 4-point Likert-type questionnaire scale was designed for the study. Section A consisted of closed-ended questions. Sections B, C, D and E used a structured 4-point modified Likert-scale battery of strongly agree (4), agree (3), disagree (2) and strongly disagree (1) in line with Atiku, Genty and Akinlabi (2011). The respondents were asked to indicate the extent to which they agree/disagree with various statements.

The data collected by administering the research instrument were analyzed in line with each research question and hypothesis. Descriptive statistics (such as frequencies and percentages) were used to answer the research questions. The Friedman Test was used to analyze the hypotheses. The SPSS version 17 for windows (a computer based statistical program me) was used to run all the analyses for the study. The decision rule follows: at 0.05 level of significance, reject null hypotheses for tests with probability estimates lower than 5% (0.05) and conclude that they are statistically significant. Otherwise, we accept (when probability estimates are above 0.05) and conclude that there is no overall statistically significance. 5. PRESENTATION AND INTERPRETATION OF RESULTS Out of the 400 questionnaires distributed, all the 400 were properly completed and returned. The return rate is (100%). The analysis is thus based on the responses from 400 staff of the Manufacturing firms in Nnewi the results of the analysis and interpretation are presented on three sub-sections: analysis of demographic data, analysis of research questions and hypotheses testing.

# Effect of Motivation on Employee Productivity: A Study of Manufacturing Companies in Nnewi

The results of the types of motivational techniques adopted by manufacturing firms in Nnewi has been analyzed and presented on Table 4.2 above. The remarks to each variable indicate the techniques being used in the company. It is shown that the employees strongly disagrees that they are given gifts for extra efforts put in the job. This implies that incentives are not used in the company. More so, the employees “disagree” that they are well paid, which implies that the salary scale is not attractive.

On the other hand, the respondents are of the view that sack, and penalties are employed by the company. More so, the employees are closely monitored while they work.

Other kinds of motivational technique analyzed are not employed by the company such as good working environment, promotions, financial allowances and trainings. Summarily, the main motivational techniques employed in manufacturing firm sin Nnewi are coercion in forms of close supervision, penalty and immediate sack.

The results Friedman test is 2419.647 (P. < 0.05). The decision rule is that we reject the null hypothesis when the calculated significance value (probability of the Chi-square value) is less than the chosen level of significance (5%) and to accept the calculated significance value is greater than 5%. Since the significance level (probability) is less than the 5% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis and then conclude that the motivational techniques adopted by manufacturing firms do not significantly lead to retention of the employees.

The factors that hinder the success of employee motivation in manufacturing firms in Nnewi are analyzed on Table 4.4 above. The results indicate that the motivation strategy from the company does not enable employees to meet their own needs. More so, there is no job security in the company. Besides, the company does not appreciate the efforts of the employees.

The results Friedman test is 468.507 (P. < 0.05). The decision rule is that we reject the null hypothesis when the calculated significance value (probability of the Chi-square value) is less than the chosen level of significance (5%) and to accept the calculated significance value is greater than 5%. Since the significance level (probability) is less than the 5% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis and then conclude that the there is significant factors hindering the success of employees motivation in the company.

The effect of the motivation techniques on employee productivity in the Selected firm is analyzed and presented on Table 4.5 above. The analysis shows that the employees perform their optimum best under the condition they work. This implies that the use of coercion as motivation strategy influences the employees to be productive.

The results Friedman test is 281.042 (P. < 0.05). The decision rule is that we reject the null hypothesis when the calculated significance value (probability of the Chi-square value) is less than the chosen level of significance (5%) and to accept the calculated significance value is greater than 5%. Since the significance level (probability) is less than the 5% level of significance, we reject the null hypothesis and then conclude that the motivation strategy given to the employees do significantly lead to higher performance and productivity. 6. SUMMARY OF FINDINGS The results of the analysis were presented on table and the results showed

That incentive is not used to motivate the employees for higher performance. The study reveals that salaries paid to junior staff in the company were very below the

- 7. CONCLUSION The researcher therefore conclude from his findings that the effect of motivation on employee productivity is of paramount important to the organization .In order to meet up with the current dynamic rate of the business trends, the management of the manufacturing firms in Nnewi should try as much as possible to adopt good and positive motivational techniques to increase the moral of the workers towards productivity and performance. Finally, management of the manufacturing firms in Nnewi should seek for various ways of improving productivity in their company by finding out the effect, causes or problems associated with motivation. Meanwhile, for the workers to be motivated, the management must posse good

quality and personal value which will help them to identify those things that motivate their staff and apply them properly. 8. RECOMMENDATIONS The government should set up employment policy and condition of services for the private sector as obtainable in the public sector. These policies should gear towards curtailing the inhuman treatment that the private sector employees suffer.

More so, the private sector establishments should be encouraged to adopt more positive motivational strategies in order to align themselves with the best practices. The researcher is of the view that more positive strategies will bring about more productivity in the company than the ones presently practiced.

Further studies should be carried out to find out whether the motivation strategy adopted by the manufacturing firms in Nnewi is common in private sector establishments in Nigeria. Studies should also be done to establish the reasons behind the adoption of punitive strategies by the manufacturing firms in Nnewi..
