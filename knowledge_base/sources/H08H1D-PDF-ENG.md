Right now, many of us feel suspended between what once was and

what is yet to come. In the United States, this sense of extended

uncertainty reﬂects the protracted presidential-election process, with

consequences that are felt in countries all around the world. But the

issue is even bigger: Uncertain times abound, in our organizations and

in our society, and as a result many of us are having what are known as

# liminal experiences.

Liminal experiences involve a prolonged separation from normal ways

of being and doing. They represent a break from the familiar, but they

don’t fully replace it. Instead, they’re at once disturbingly diﬀerent and

confusingly similar. And when they come to an end, they leave those

who have survived them forever changed.

We ﬁrst wrote about liminal experiences for HBR in 2021, during the

pandemic. Once we all emerged from that period, most of us thought

we had made it through the biggest challenge of the decade. But

since then, we’ve lived through many other profound challenges to

our expectations about the shape and nature of our lives — an energy

crisis, wars in Europe and the Middle East, unprecedented political

situations, extreme weather events, climate-change anxiety. Even at the

organizational level, the way we work together has been called into

## question by hybrid working and the anticipated impact of generative AI.

All of these challenges, needless to say, have made many of us feel

unsettled or anxious. Where do we stand when the ground underneath

us is shifting? What if the ground doesn’t stop shifting and an

acceptable “new normal” never emerges?

In the course of our work, we’ve spoken to many leaders and who have

described feeling confused and anxious about these questions in our

current era of uncertainty and liminality. The problem is, leaders are

supposed to know what to do about this — and most simply don’t.

# Ask the Big Questions

As a leader, what can you do to help colleagues who are struggling

through liminal times? And what can you do to help yourself? A good

place to start is with three basic but very big questions:

What do you value?

If you allow yourself to step back from the immediate challenges,

liminal periods can remind you of what you value most. The events

that have thrust you into this phase, and your feelings about them,

are indicators of what truly matters to you. When you ﬁnd yourself

angry about a situation, for example, it’s probably because something

(or someone) has transgressed in territory that you care deeply about.

So consider this moment an opportunity to acknowledge and aﬃrm

your values, and indeed to understand more about yourself. A liminal

experience gives you a chance to question your own assumptions

about the way the world is and should be, and to ask whether those

assumptions are still serving you.

Where do we stand?

For some leaders, especially those who have a bias for action,

introspection may feel suspiciously like navel-gazing. But introspection

and reﬂection are vital for leaders in liminal times. Colleagues will be

looking to you to supply reassurance and clarity — a job that can be

particularly challenging if views within your organization are polarized.

So leaders need to look inward and ﬁgure out what they and their

organization stand for. Only then will they possess enough conﬁdence

and clarity about their purpose to help their colleagues identify

common ground and negotiate the liminal period together.

How can we move ahead?

People tend to adapt to prolonged liminality by withdrawing into

helplessness or lapsing into cynicism. But that’s a tendency leaders

need to ﬁght against, because getting “stuck” in a liminal experience

serves nobody well. Although they are often unsettling, these

experiences also represent an opportunity to experiment and challenge

assumptions that no longer serve us — in liminal times, you usually

have more agency than you realize.

As a leader in such periods, your role should be to provide colleagues

with guardrails to hold onto as they build conﬁdence in themselves and

# reassurance about the future.

# Focus on the Fundamentals

When it feels like everything is changing, it helps to focus on the things

that stay the same, the things that need our attention, and where we can

make a tangible diﬀerence. You can start with these three actions.

Step back and take stock.

It’s easy to become distracted by the challenging economic, social, and

geopolitical context in which organizations currently operate. But also

use these times to focus on where exactly you are at the moment and where you want to get to. How can you reaﬃrm the core purpose of your

(and indeed all) organizations, which is to deliver a service or product

that is valued by its customers and to provide an environment where

people want to belong? The leadership challenge looks a little simpler

if you stay focused on those goals and encourage the people you work

with to do the same.

Strengthen the ties that bind.

Organizations exist to bring together people of diﬀerent expertise and

abilities to undertake activities that cannot be achieved by acting

alone. We learn to collaborate with colleagues we may not like or even

particularly respect because we need their help to get the work done.

When steering an organization through liminal times, expressions of

personal diﬀerence can easily come across as defensive. It’s worth

remembering that some diﬀerences contribute to a job done well.

Sustaining organizational connections feeds a sense of collective

capacity, an important anchor when we feel a lack of agency in other

# areas of our lives.

Hold fast and stay true.

“Hold fast” is what sailors used to tell one another during a storm —

grab on to something secure, in other words, to prevent yourself from

being swept overboard. “Stay true,” for its part, was an instruction for

the sailor at the helm, who had to watch the compass carefully to avoid

being blown oﬀ course.

Both expressions are useful as metaphors in our current moment:

Leaders in these challenging times need to make sure that they and

their colleagues hold fast, and they themselves need to stay true to

their course. Not only that, they need to remember what every sailor

knows: that all storms ultimately subside, and the key to weathering

them successfully has a lot to do with your preparation and judgement.

. . .

It’s worth thinking back to how the world looked in 2020, when we

suddenly found ourselves confronted with the pandemic — and when

we surprised ourselves with our resourcefulness and resilience. Our

organizations adapted rapidly and eﬀectively to challenges that only

a few months earlier would have been unimaginable.

Many of the changes forced upon us during that period are now part of

our collective sense of how to get things done. We have made them our

own. That’s a cause for hope. Knowing that we survived the collective

challenge of the pandemic, we can and should feel conﬁdent that we

will make it through the new challenges that we’re facing. The key is

to recognize that beyond the immediate anxiety and confusion, liminal

experiences can be invitations to reﬂect, reach out, and reorient — not

simply to feel lost at sea.
