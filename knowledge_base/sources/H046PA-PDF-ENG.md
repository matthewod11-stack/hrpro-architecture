We all know developing a personal brand is valuable, since a strong

reputation can put you on the radar for exciting career opportunities.

When your true talents are understood, it’s far more likely you’ll be

tapped for relevant and interesting assignments — and it helps you

stand out in a ﬁeld of competitors. Research by Sylvia Ann Hewlett at

the Center for Talent Innovation shows that cultivating your personal

brand is one of the best ways to attract a sponsor — and professionals

with sponsors are 23% more likely than their peers to be promoted. Your

brand is also a powerful hedge against professional misfortune. If there

are layoﬀs or cutbacks at your company, being recognized in your ﬁeld

makes it far more likely that you’ll be snapped up quickly by another

# ﬁrm.

But personal branding has some unique challenges for female

professionals. Research has repeatedly shown that women are subject

to a phenomenon known as the “likability conundrum.” Gender norms

presume that women should be agreeable, warm, and nurturing, and

when they violate these norms — such as when they step up to make

a tough decision, share a strong opinion, or promote themselves —

they’re often penalized for that behavior in a way that men wouldn’t

be. We can all think of examples of women who have been publicly

criticized for being “too aggressive” or labeled an “ice queen” or the

# “b-word.”

So how can you, as a woman, navigate this conundrum and develop a

robust personal brand? Here are three strategies that can help ensure

your talents are recognized.

## Network both inside and outside your organization. Too many

professionals over-index on “bonding capital,” to use a term popularized

## by Harvard sociologist Robert Putnam, and underinvest in “bridging

capital.” In other words, they have too many connections who are like

them (working in the same company or the same industry) and not

nearly enough who are dissimilar.

When only a select group knows about your talents and abilities, you

put yourself in jeopardy. You have fewer people who can speak to

your contributions or provide support, whether that’s help in securing

additional resources for an important project or moving up to a new

role. And if your department is reorganized or your company has

layoﬀs, the people who understand your talents won’t be in a position to

# help.

Instead, consciously cultivate a broad network, so if your situation

changes or you need backup, you have options. For instance, you could

make a point of building professional connections with people you meet

## through hobbies, relationships of proximity (for instance, neighbors or

parents at your kids’ school), or friends of friends.

Control your narrative. We often assume that if we work hard, people

will notice it over time, or that if we’ve made a transition, it will

make intuitive sense to others. Because people are so overstretched

these days, that’s unfortunately almost never true. They’re simply not

paying close enough attention to us or our professional trajectory to

formulate a coherent narrative of us. Worse, they may make inaccurate

assumptions — say, that your skills must be wildly out of date since you

took time oﬀ after having a child, or that you shifted to functional roles

because you were bored or “couldn’t hack it” — which could cause you

to miss out on growth opportunities.

Help others understand the truth about your journey by developing a

clear and concise elevator pitch that explains how your previous skills

connect with, and add value to, what you’re doing now. Make that

connection explicit, rather than hoping others will ﬁgure it out on their

# own.

To start, chart it out on paper. On one side, write down your past

position or experience. On the other side, write down the job you

currently hold. Then ﬁnd the connective tissue that links them.

For instance, your past might be “HR director” and your present might

be “regional sales leader.” An outsider may have no idea what connects

these two positions and assume your career path is somewhat random.

But you know that your experience in HR taught you about how to listen

empathetically, understand what motivates people, and develop win-

win solutions — all of which are perfect ingredients for sales success.

When you’re able to share this with others, they’ll almost always get

it and recognize the unique skills you bring to your position and the

# organization.

A crisp elevator pitch isn’t useful just for times when you’re job hunting.

There are often opportunities to shape the way you’re perceived by

others, but most people miss them. For instance, new acquaintances

will often ask how long you’ve been at your job or how you came to

your current ﬁeld. Having a pithy answer ready means you can turn

their question into an opportunity to subtly highlight your skills: “I

started out in HR and worked my way up to director. But I became

fascinated by the sales process, and realized the listening skills and

ability to connect with people that I’d developed in HR would enable

me to add real value to the company, so I transitioned last year and am

now the head of northeast sales.” You haven’t just laid out your job titles;

you’ve provided context that conveys a strong personal brand.

Similarly, during performance reviews, you can make a point of

reminding your boss about how you’re leveraging key strengths you’ve

developed over time. For instance, you could connect this year’s

increase in client upsells to your work developing your team’s listening

skills so that they’re more attuned to client needs.

Share your ideas publicly. If you keep a low proﬁle and let your work

speak for itself, you may indeed develop a good reputation among the

people you work closely with. But that’s a relatively limited number of

people. Individuals in other departments or leaders many levels above you may not be aware of your contributions. And any staﬃng changes

might disrupt the hard-fought reputational capital you’ve built. Your

new boss or colleagues, lacking personal experience with you, may have

no idea whether you’re any good.

Many women may feel uncomfortable talking about their

accomplishments and promoting themselves directly. But there are

other ways to show your areas of expertise when building a brand.

Content creation is a good way to share your ideas and build a positive

reputation at scale. The precise mechanics will diﬀer based on company

policies (your ability to use social media may be limited in certain

regulated industries, for instance), but in almost any organization, there

are ways that you can you demonstrate your knowledge and help others.

For instance, you could volunteer to host a lunch-and-learn about a

topic you’ve been researching, start writing for the company newsletter,

or oﬀer advice or respond to queries on the corporate intranet. Many

professionals ignore these opportunities, assuming they’re distractions that take them away from their “real work” or scoﬃng that no one

really pays attention to them. Even if these opportunities are not

popular among your colleagues, higher-ups are almost always paying

attention, since they view these channels as important vehicles for

transferring knowledge and sharing best practices. One college friend of

mine, for example, while working as a sales clerk at a large retailer, got

## into a private message exchange with the company CEO — eventually

winning a trip to headquarters — as the result of one of her posts on the

# corporate intranet.

Content creation may also open up completely unexpected

opportunities, including new jobs. Miranda Aisling Hynes, whom I

proﬁle in my book Stand Out, self-published a book about creativity

that she gave to a friend who worked at an arts organization. He liked

it and passed it along to his supervisor; when Hynes later applied for a

job at the organization, she was a shoo-in because the book had already

established her credibility in the ﬁeld.

Personal branding is fraught for many professionals — no one wants

to look like a craven self-promoter. And with the likability conundrum,

building meaningful connections and a strong reputation at work is

# even more complicated for women.

But if we don’t control our own narrative and show the world what

we can contribute, odds are very few people will actually notice. By

following these strategies, you dramatically increase the odds that your

true talents will get known, recognized, and appreciated.
