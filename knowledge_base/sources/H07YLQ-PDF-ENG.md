For businesses to survive, their leaders need to put succession plans

in place. There’s only one problem: A succession plan only works

if high-performing employees can advance through the ranks. That’s

impossible if their boss is a perennial bottleneck to high-potential

# workers’ progress.

Leaders who don’t see much movement in their ﬁrms don’t think

they’re bottlenecks, of course. They believe that the problem lies

elsewhere and is out of their control. Not true. More often than not, a

ﬁrm that’s trudging along at a snail’s pace — and losing great employees

year after year — is being negatively aﬀected by a leader’s bottleneck-

# style behaviors.

# What Are the Signs of a Bottleneck Boss?

- An over-scheduled, overstuﬀed calendar ﬁlled with agenda to-dos

- A business that can’t run on its own without a leader stepping in

- Clients who only feel special if they’re being fêted by the leader rather

than by sales team members, which results in the CEO becoming

overburdened with maintaining client relations, while the sales team

feels undervalued

- Key staﬀ who don’t feel empowered enough to lean into challenging

work (revealed by employee engagement reports)

# Empowering Your Employees

The employees who aren’t given the space and tools to take on more

challenging projects are the aforementioned high-potential employees

who are willing to put in extra eﬀort — but only if they see an endgame.

If a leader stiﬂes their progress, they’ll take their ball to another court.

In fact, study after study has shown that “lack of advancement” is one of

the most compelling reasons that professionals resign. And it’s been this

way for far longer than since 2020, so the pandemic can’t be used as an

excuse for why it’s hard to hold on to great folks.

If you’re a leader realizing you’ve fallen into this trap, you should

work to get unstuck immediately for the good of your company, its

employees, and its succession plan. You can start now by following a

step-by-step “break the bottleneck” succession planning model.

- 1. Figure out who your rock-solid, high-potential employees are.

You won’t go far without high-potential employees, so aim to surround

yourself with them. They are natural go-getters. Let’s face it: Growing,

scaling, and exiting a niche ﬁrm is too complex for one person

to do well. Therefore, it’s practical to distribute responsibilities and

## opportunities among high-performing employees.

Right now, you may have a handful of high-potential employees on

your payroll, or you may have employees that need an investment of

attention to get there. From this point forward, start building a key

group of people with the talent, determination, and abilities to be

future superstars. Even if they’re not ready for all the responsibilities

## of tomorrow yet, with the right instruction, investment, and guidance

## from you, many of the high-potential employees on your team will

become indispensable players in your succession plan.

From there, you’ll need to adjust your training and development

programs to ensure that high-potential employees learn at an

accelerated pace. Think of them as having two jobs: their day job and

the future job they’ll take on after proving themselves capable. As a

side note, some high-potential people won’t realize they’re cut out to be

leaders. You may have to help them see their abilities through your eyes

through continuous encouragement until they reach that milestone.

- 2. Start delegating responsibilities for permanent ownership transfer.

The emotional stress of a bottleneck culture leads to burnout and

turnover. Great Place To Work, a workplace culture research group,

reports that micromanaged employees are three times more likely to

experience burnout. To avoid this fate, learn to delegate and delete.

Write down all your duties and roles. Then, divide them into those that

are revenue-producing versus those that aren’t. Anything that doesn’t

generate money for your ﬁrm isn’t something you should do.

## For instance, as the leader, your involvement in strategic planning and

client relations directly impacts revenue generation. However, it should

be balanced to empower your team’s engagement with clients as well.

These are tasks you should focus on. Routine administrative work or

basic operational tasks, while necessary, don’t directly contribute to the

ﬁrm’s revenue. Treat those tasks as delegation opportunities and delete

them from your personal to-do list. Free up your time for high-impact,

revenue-generating activities so that your eﬀorts are aligned with the

# ﬁrm’s ﬁnancial goals.

At the end of the day, your time is better spent on high-level

responsibilities, not routine projects. You are not a salesperson. You are

not the marketing manager. You are not the human resources director,

the payroll administrator, or the IT person. Nor should you be. With

the right recruiting and training, your employees will be the experts

at these tasks. Let go of your ego and start working on strategies and

systems. Get everything that could help someone else grow in their role

oﬀ your plate and onto that other person’s. Alternatively, you could hire

an expert or outsource a workﬂow. This will allow your value to go up

and give everyone around you the chance to systematically progress

# toward succession.

- 3. Support your efforts with measurable results.

You are an expensive resource in the ﬁrm. Your time is not free. A quick

look at the payroll system will prove this. Delegating is indeed more

expensive at ﬁrst. It may take an employee twice as long to perform a

task the ﬁrst time. However, then the experience curve kicks in. Soon,

the employee is as fast as you and getting faster with experience. This

growth in proﬁciency is not just a beneﬁt to the organization; it’s also a

## valuable professional development opportunity for the employees. With

their fresh perspectives, they frequently discover innovative ways to

save time and money. It is always more proﬁtable to delegate.

You can benchmark anything by following a simple methodology.

First, start with what you want to benchmark, such as gross margins,

revenue per head, or founder income. Next, identify comparative

ﬁrms and begin collecting data. With data in hand, perform a

gap analysis to inform any action items. Finally, keep recalibrating

your benchmarks regularly (not haphazardly) so you don’t miss any

emerging opportunities or red ﬂags.

Every business needs a succession plan; to do that, you might just have

to check your bottleneck tendencies at the door. If you’re that person,

you should be working on tomorrow and handing over today to your

# high-potential employees.
