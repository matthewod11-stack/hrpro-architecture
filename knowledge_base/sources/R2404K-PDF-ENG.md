An innovation crisis is brewing in the United States: Too many ﬁrms,

both large and small, are failing to innovate. As a result, problems

remain unsolved, technologies are never invented, and meaningful

jobs go uncreated. According to one estimate, lost productivity cost

## the economy more than $10 trillion between 2006 and 2018, roughly

# equivalent to $95,000 per U.S. worker.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Middle Path to Innovation

We believe that a primary cause of this crisis is the polarized approach

companies take to innovation. At one end of the spectrum, corporations

increasingly focus R&D eﬀorts on product refreshes and incremental

line upgrades. Doing so maintains revenue streams and market share

while minimizing R&D budgets. These incremental innovations protect

## proﬁtability and generate modest growth with lower risk.

At the other end, venture capitalists favor high-risk “transformational”

innovations that seek to upend industries and generate outsize returns.

They anticipate that the returns from innovation eﬀorts that succeed

will more than compensate for the failures. In order to build a viable

## company for an eventual M&A or IPO, the entrepreneurial team behind

the innovation is forced to devote considerable time and energy to

building up a range of functional and operational capabilities. The exit

prices that venture capitalists require to generate the returns they need,

and the bidding wars to acquire the start-ups that arise, mean that a

large ﬁrm must pay a hefty price to purchase a successfully launched

innovative start-up. Although observers tend to celebrate when a start- up is acquired by an established company, there’s some ineﬃciency

to this transaction. From an economic standpoint, it would be better

if established companies did more innovation in-house—building, not

# buying.

For that reason, we suggest targeting the large gap in the middle of

the innovation spectrum. This space is considered too risky for large

ﬁrms, which worry about analysts’ disapproval when failures drag down

short-term proﬁtability. And it’s not risky enough for venture capitalists,

who avoid investing in a return proﬁle that’s unsatisfying to their

own investors. Yet the middle is precisely where large ﬁrms are best

positioned to execute their innovation eﬀorts.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Middle Path to Innovation

In this article we present a new model of innovation, the growth driver

model. To illustrate we use a detailed case study of how it revived

## innovation in Cordis, a large medical device technology ﬁrm. We also

show the model’s applicability in other sectors.

# The Growth Driver Model

Our model has three stages. First, a corporation partners with an

outside investor and identiﬁes where riskier innovations are needed,

how these innovations would ﬁt into the ﬁrm’s strategy, and how

they might be integrated into its operational and functional units.

## Second, again in partnership with the outside investor, the corporation

sets up an oﬀ-balance-sheet “accelerator” company that identiﬁes and

builds out the innovation projects for which the corporation will be

the customer. Finally, innovations are developed. As the accelerator

takes form, corporate leaders, investor partners, and the accelerator’s

management team identify a pipeline of “growth drivers”—products

and services that will generate long-term revenue growth in markets

where the ﬁrm is already established or in closely adjacent markets.

The corporation then establishes an operating model for these new

products that leverages its existing sales, manufacturing, regulatory,

# and management capabilities.

The model is most eﬀective when created as an active partnership

between a corporation and an external investor, as that enables

the accelerator to leverage the capital and resources at its disposal.

Typically, the partner will be an investment institution—and most

likely a private equity ﬁrm—because those investors have experience

working closely with large corporations. VC ﬁrms are less-ideal partners

because they are more interested in highly disruptive innovations and

prefer to manage the risk of such investments through diversiﬁcation.

Institutional investors tend to be passive investors and are not focused

on management in the way that this model requires.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Middle Path to Innovation

Although we lay out successive steps to the process, it’s important to

note that it is not precisely linear. There is a dynamic interplay between

the corporation and the accelerator as innovations are identiﬁed and

developed.

# Stage 1: Identifying the Opportunities

## In the ﬁrst stage corporate decision-makers and their investment

partners target the middle of the innovation stream: the opportunities

that fall between the incremental innovations favored for corporate

R&D and the transformative innovations pursued by venture capital.

Two types of innovations fall in this space: augmented and synergistic.

Augmented innovations signiﬁcantly improve upon, but do not

displace, existing products. They go beyond incremental innovations,

which aim to maintain customer interest in a product line, to devise

products that are signiﬁcantly better in terms of cost or functionality,

helping companies capture substantial market share or obtain footholds

in new markets. For example, in the medical technology ﬁeld, eﬀorts to

treat cardiovascular disease have focused on blood ﬂow in the arteries,

resulting in technologies (stents, balloons, and catheters, for example)

designed for that anatomy. One such device is a drug-eluting balloon,

which is inserted into an artery and releases medication to reduce

blockages that impede blood ﬂow. A successful start-up by one of us

(Duke) designed a balloon that was both cheaper and more eﬀective

than others on the market. That was an augmented innovation.

Synergistic innovations are new products that derive value from

their adjacency to existing products. The ﬁrm can bundle the new

product into its existing sales, marketing, and manufacturing processes.

Synergistic products are often “innovation orphans”: Their value

propositions are not high enough to attract VC investment, but their risk

is perceived to be too high for internal R&D investment. For example,

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Middle Path to Innovation

many devices for cardiovascular procedures designed to work in arteries

can be adapted to work in veins. But diﬀerences between arteries and

veins, such as the veins’ larger size and lower pressure, increase the

risk of signiﬁcant health complications. Those risks could be mitigated

with devices designed explicitly for venous use, but developing a single product for veins may not grow proﬁts relative to R&D costs suﬃciently

to merit development. If a series of venous devices were developed,

however, a sales force could sell them as a bundle and realize economies

of scale. Such synergistic innovations are often left unrealized because

companies and VCs continue to approach innovation from polarized

# ends of the spectrum.

The growth driver model creates a partnership in which the corporation

and investors align their interests and overcome each party’s primary

obstacle to growth. Virtually all corporate decision-makers have a long

list of products they’d like to have in their portfolios but are too wary

of risk to develop. And investors have funds at their disposal but must

spend signiﬁcant time and eﬀort searching for proﬁtable opportunities.

Working together they can bridge the gap to prioritize needs in the

portfolio, evaluate trade-oﬀs, and develop a list of target areas for

# innovation.

## Stage 2: Creating an Innovation Accelerator

## In the second stage the corporation, in partnership with external

investors, creates an oﬀ-balance-sheet accelerator to strategically

deploy capital to develop the target products. The corporation’s

decision-makers work with the accelerator’s leaders to identify where

new innovations are needed, which ones are possible, and how they

will ﬁt into the ﬁrm’s strategy, operations, and functional units. The

corporation becomes the customer for the accelerator’s innovations.

Next they determine the development budget and acquisition prices

for the accelerator’s products. The speciﬁc process for this will diﬀer

by industry, but certain general principles apply. Inviting trusted

development teams to bid on RFPs with clear speciﬁcations will ensure

## the quality of products and their ﬁt within the corporate portfolio and

provide a market check on costs.

The acquisition price is set on the basis of the anticipated value created,

taking into account the budget of the winning bid. It aims to provide a

## superior value proposition for both parties than would either internal

R&D or M&A. The corporation pays a lower price than it would in a

traditional M&A context because as an early investor, it can obtain the

product at a lower valuation and is not buying sales and manufacturing

capabilities it doesn’t need. The development team is willing to accept

## a lower price because of the greater certainty of acquisition and the

elimination of distracting and expensive activities such as fundraising,

sales, and manufacturing. A range of levers can be pulled in the

negotiation, including milestone-based funding, equity incentives, and

# cash bonuses.

Carolyn Doucette’s digitally altered photographs investigate the human presence in nature.

This arrangement leverages the existing operational capacities of

the ﬁrm while allowing an entrepreneurial environment to ﬂourish

at the accelerator. Because the accelerator custom-builds products

for the corporation, the ﬁrm is more likely to embrace them,

eﬀectively sidestepping the “not invented here” syndrome. Having a

predetermined budget ensures that funding for the innovation will not

## fall victim to corporate cost-cutting, and a predetermined transfer price

assures the accelerator of an excellent return in the event of success.

The company and the accelerator may have either a shared board or

independent boards, but the board structure should attain a balance

between strategic alignment and operational independence. What’s key

is that the accelerator’s management team should collaborate with but

not report to the company’s leadership when crafting strategy and

planning new products.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Middle Path to Innovation

By externalizing innovation in this way, corporations reap several

beneﬁts. First, they gain access to new products more quickly and with

lower risk than they would using typical internal R&D eﬀorts. They also

can reduce their dependence on M&As, which often fail. In addition, the

model increases the likelihood that a good idea gets commercialized:

Unlike a venture-backed start-up, which builds a product that needs

to appeal to many potential buyers, the accelerator develops growth

## drivers with one speciﬁc acquirer in mind and an understanding of

how that ﬁrm will manufacture, distribute, and sell it. While design

and engineering challenges exist, of course, the products chosen are

technically feasible, and their eventual acquisition is nearly assured. The process is more eﬃcient than acquiring a start-up. The corporation

## doesn’t end up with redundant operational assets; rather, it purchases

# bespoke innovations.

# Stage 3: Developing the Innovations

In the third stage the accelerator’s leadership team recruits key

management and technical talent to develop products and creates

incentives to ensure that the new products ﬁt the corporation’s strategic

aims. The advantage of working in an accelerator is that, unlike at a VC-

funded start-up, the team developing the growth driver is not expected

to spend time building up the operating infrastructure of a business

(HR, accounting, marketing, and sales) or engaging in multiple and

time-consuming rounds of fundraising. They are somewhat sheltered

## from the bureaucracy and political maneuverings of a large company. In

other words, working at an accelerator allows innovative people to focus

on what they do best: designing and engineering new products.

The accelerator attracts talent, both from large corporations and start-

ups, because it oﬀers a fast-paced entrepreneurial climate and removes

funding and acquisition risks. The best practice is to institutionalize

recruiting from an ecosystem of repeat players, which could include

## entire engineering teams, such as contract device and manufacturing

## organizations (CDMOs) in biotech or med-tech. Ideally, accelerators

hire not merely to staﬀ one project but to develop a bullpen of best-in-

class talent. Trusted workers from previous projects are the best place

to start, but an accelerator should consistently employ the strengths

of its growing ecosystem to attract, develop, and retain new talent.

Like a major league baseball team develops a minor league farm

system, accelerators should use smaller projects to evaluate and nurture

talent that can eventually be redeployed to larger and more complex

initiatives. Some talent will join the accelerator full-time. Teams are

assembled and evaluated primarily on the basis of their level of

experience in the target area, demonstrated entrepreneurial mentality,

and willingness to adapt to the growth driver model. By building a

complete support network for the accelerator that includes secondary

## functions, such as quality assurance, the accelerator’s leadership will

facilitate the teams’ rapid and focused delivery of new products.

The accelerator attracts talent because it offers a fast-paced entrepreneurial climate and removes funding and acquisition risks.

Each group of innovators creates a separate development company for

each product it designs, and a team may work on three to ﬁve products

at one time. The accelerator’s leadership team creates a portfolio of

## innovative products for the corporation through building a network

of development companies. The predetermined transfer price of each

successful product means that team members—who have an equity

stake in the development companies they are a part of—get a larger

return than what they would earn if they worked at a large corporation

and more certainty of an exit than if their work was backed by venture

# capital.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Middle Path to Innovation

Overall, the growth driver model produces innovations at lower cost and greater speed thanks to eﬃciencies created through collaboration

between the company and multiple development companies, fueled

by external investment. Liberated from the distractions of fundraising

and infrastructure-building, engineers can focus on their projects.

Coordinated teams can produce multiple innovations simultaneously,

each custom-designed for integration into an existing product portfolio,

with company input along the way to ensure a ﬁt between product

development and corporate strategy. If a product ultimately does not

## ﬁt the company’s needs, accelerator executives, with guidance from the

ﬁrm, may sell it to an outside entity. And if a product design fails to gain traction, the product portfolio is suﬃciently robust to disperse risk; a

few failures won’t curtail the overall eﬀort.

# The Innovation Spectrum

This table compares three points along the innovation spectrum. Incremental

innovation created within an incumbent firm is at one end, and entrepreneurial

innovation created outside of an incumbent firm is at the other. In the middle is the

# growth driver model.

# Risk

# Cost

# Strategy

# Control

# Talent

## INTERNAL INNOVATION (Example: corporate R&D units)

Avoided: Failing to produce is considered safer than producing a failure.

Avoided: R&D costs eat into EBITDA and therefore earnings per share.

Limited: Fixation on short-term profitability drowns out long-term innovation strategy.

Stifling: Innovation efforts are often killed by other priorities, bureaucracy, shortsightedness, political maneuvering, and the desire to maintain the status quo.

Squandered by bureaucracy: Best creative talent tends to avoid large bureaucratic firms.

GROWTH DRIVER MODEL (Example: independent accelerator collaborating with a large corporation and investors)

Mediated: Higher-risk products are developed by trusted teams with assurance of fit.

Minimized: R&D costs are off balance- sheet, and price is preset below M&A value.

Maximized: Collaboration with the accelerator to develop products fills in portfolio gaps.

Moderated: Development teams have autonomy, but accelerator teams guide efforts toward the corporation’s needs.

Mobilized and motivated: Talent can focus on what it does best.

# EXTERNAL INNOVATION (Example: M&A)

Increased: The product could be lost to a competitor, underperform expectations, or need extensive modifications.

Increased: Competing bids for an innovative asset raises its price.

Opportunistic: Innovation depends on opportunism (products that happen to be available), not strategy (products intentionally developed to meet needs).

Lacking: Product development can’t be aligned with a company’s sales, manufacturing, and other operational strengths, making product integration time- consuming and inefficient.

Squandered by distraction: The best creative talent wants to build a product, not a company.

Now we’ll look at how this model worked to kick-start innovation in a

## company in the medical technology sector.

# The Model in Practice

Medical technology is a $500 billion industry characterized by a

polarized approach to innovation. Large med-tech companies face

substantial barriers to internal innovation, including high development

## costs, long timelines, signiﬁcant technical complexity, and regulatory

hurdles. A recent McKinsey analysis found that large med-tech

companies respond to those hurdles by focusing on incremental

innovations to maintain market share in mature but low-growth

markets. At the other end of the spectrum, there has been an increase

in VC-funded start-ups, which are bought at premium price tags by

larger companies that quickly disband most of the start-ups’ operational

# capacities.

In 2021 Ajax Health, a large player in the health care sector, partnered

with investment ﬁrms Hellman & Friedman and KKR to purchase

## Cordis, a med-tech company in the cardiovascular and endovascular

space, for approximately $1 billion from Cardinal Health. Cordis was a

## well-regarded brand with yearly revenue of about $750 million, but it

had a stagnant product line and yearly revenue growth of only 2%. (Two

of us, Duke and Will, are executives at Ajax.)

Prior to the purchase, the Ajax team and its investor partners had

reviewed Cordis’s product portfolio and identiﬁed signiﬁcant gaps

in multiple product ranges, such as products targeting circulatory

problems and others treating cardiac complaints. They would establish

an accelerator to develop products to ﬁll those gaps, and they

would be manufactured in Cordis’s plants and distributed through

Cordis’s existing sales and marketing channels. The development risks,

therefore, were conﬁned to the technical challenges.

# Carolyn Doucette

Ajax’s choice of partners was crucial. Unlike typical venture-capital

ﬁrms, Hellman & Friedman and KKR were willing to partner with a large

corporation. Their investment provided the scale of capital needed to

## support an entire accelerator, rather than individual products, and it

allowed for an appropriate time horizon to build the product portfolio,

with both a medium-term (three to ﬁve years) and a longer-term (ﬁve

to 10 years) pipeline. To avoid a negative impact on operating proﬁts,

Cordis arranged for the accelerator to be an independent entity. As

## Ali Satvat, the global head of KKR’s Health Care Strategic Growth

platform, observes, “There are many ways to increase a company’s

value. Fostering innovation is often the most impactful but also the most diﬃcult. This accelerator structures the optimal relationships

among investors, corporations, and innovators to enable each to play

The investor partners and Ajax allocated an additional $300 million,

with the vast majority dedicated to R&D, to create an oﬀ-balance-sheet

accelerator called Cordis-X, which had the same ownership structure

as Cordis. Cordis-X recruited experienced teams to work on product

development, with each team forming its own development companies

# within the accelerator.

Innovators were recruited for their technical skill, reliability, eﬀective

project management, teamwork, and creativity. Both Cordis and the

innovators had to yield some autonomy to collaborate eﬀectively. The

accelerator’s leaders began by inviting innovators they had worked

with at Ajax to join. Recruitment snowballed as word of the unique

opportunities presented by the model spread. Leveraging the Ajax

network, Cordis-X’s leadership expanded the range of development

teams it invited to oﬀer bids on RFPs, which it then evaluated based

## on the team’s reputation and the cost, timeline, and quality of the

proposal. Cordis-X developed a dynamic network of vetted “Ajax

veriﬁed” partners that were then routinely invited to bid on projects

and even to propose project ideas of their own. Ajax also built a support

network of trusted partners to handle secondary tasks, such as quality,

clinical, and regulatory activities, so that the teams could focus on eﬃciently delivering innovative products.

Employing this model, Ajax was able to recruit a team of engineers that had been struggling to raise funding for several transformative projects.

Each development team worked on three to ﬁve products

## simultaneously with predetermined budgets and a set transfer price of

three times the invested capital for successful products. In two years,

the accelerator successfully initiated nine new products and closed

## one large-scale M&A transaction and three strategic investments. The

innovations improved Cordis’s oﬀerings in access and closure of the

circulatory system and added products at other stages in procedures,

## such as vessel prep solutions and a portfolio of specialized balloons

and stents. Two years after the purchase, Cordis’s revenue was growing

## at 8%. Philip Hammarskjold, the executive chairman at Hellman &

Friedman, notes, “This innovative growth model is a new tool we can

use to drive equity value in our companies by accelerating much needed

patient-care innovation on a cost-eﬀective basis. Looking forward, we

are excited to deploy this model alongside more-traditional growth

## strategies in other parts of our portfolio.”

By using the growth driver model during the 2022 investment

downturn, Ajax was able to recruit a team of engineers from Nidus

Biomedical that had been struggling to raise venture capital for several

transformative projects. The Nidus team had been pursuing innovations

to address signiﬁcant unmet needs in the acute and chronic heart-

failure spaces, which required large, lengthy, and costly clinical trials.

The team worked with Cordis-X on a series of more manageable projects

that were innovative but more iterative in nature. This approach

brought the team new capital to subsidize its pursuit of those higher

risk, more transformative innovations—thereby satisfying both Ajax’s

# objectives and the team’s ambitions.

All this was accomplished while Cordis was navigating a complex carve-

out from Cardinal Health, which involved completing more than 200

transfer-of-service agreements, executing exit agreements in more than

90 countries, managing 4,000 employees and hiring several hundred

new ones, and setting up a new infrastructure and supply chain. It would have been exceedingly diﬃcult for the same management team

to execute this carve-out while pulling together an innovation strategy.

# A Shield Against Disruption

We’ve shown how the growth driver model can kickstart growth in a

stable industry. But it can also be a survival strategy for incumbents

facing a disruptive challenge. The movie industry is a case in point.

Rising production costs, ﬁnancial pressures on both streaming services

and traditional players, and the implementation of AI tools are

transforming the industry. Incumbent studios lack the data-collection

capabilities of the streamers, who use customer data to come up with new products in an industry where it’s notoriously diﬃcult to accurately

predict which shows and movies will become hits. The streamers are

themselves locked in ﬁerce competition for market share, and they

face customer confusion over their burgeoning numbers and befuddling

# content tiers.

Hollywood executives and independent ﬁlm directors agree that the

industry’s innovation model is broken. The large studios, or “majors,”

have lost their edge, churning out lower risk but artistically redundant

sequels and remakes. At the same time, the content arms of streaming

services have crowded out many innovative independent ﬁlmmakers.

## Before 2010, approximately 80% of independent ﬁlms (which typically

cost less than $2 million) were proﬁtable. The revenue-sharing and

distribution models of streamers have dropped that number closer to

20%, according to a 2023 study by Naomi McDougall Jones and Liz

# Manashil.

As the industry transforms and a new structure emerges, adopting

the growth driver model could be the key to success. Consider the

art-house horror movie producer Blumhouse Productions, which has

already applied a version of this approach. In 2014 it found a partner,

Universal, to fund the production, distribution, and marketing of the

ﬁlms it accepts into its portfolio. Universal provided the operational and

ﬁnancial support that Blumhouse lacked, oﬀering it a 10-year deal for 15

pictures a year, ﬁve at $5 million and the remainder at $3 million or less.

Blumhouse eﬀectively became an accelerator, creating innovative ﬁlms

for Universal to distribute and market. The directors who led the

accelerator were given complete creative control and worked under a

prearranged budget. Its ﬁlms cost far less to make than the average

motion picture. Innovating in the middle generated signiﬁcant wins:

Blumhouse creates a dozen movies a year for $12 million or less each —and scores consistent global box-oﬃce hits like Get Out and The

Purge that have earned hundreds of millions of dollars. Its low-budget

model has had success with the low-cost horror genre, but hits like

BlacKkKlansman and Vengeance demonstrate its potential for broader

# application.

# Saving the Defense Sector

This model has the potential to drive growth in entire industries

without radically altering the structure of the large ﬁrms within them.

Consider the defense sector, for example, where the costs of developing

innovations are orders of magnitude higher than in medical technology:

Developing a new category of med-tech devices costs between $25

million and $200 million. The F-22 Raptor aircraft costs around $150

million to make and at least another $100 million to operate over its

lifetime, and that’s not counting the billions of dollars that went into

# research and development.

Many observers acknowledge the U.S. defense industry is innovation-

starved. Palantir and SpaceX are two examples of the limited but

growing number of defense “unicorns” (start-ups valued at $1 billion

or higher), but both also produce technology that’s important to the

## private sector. Defense start-ups routinely founder in the so-called

## Valley of Death, the two-year-plus government acquisition process

during which they cannot expect income. Risk-averse acquisition oﬃcers often turn back to established ﬁrms. Meanwhile, the “Big Six”

defense contractors spent an average of only 2.5% of revenue on R&D in

2020, slightly less than the 4% R&D investment that was available in the

national security budget, according to a McKinsey report.

The U.S. Department of Defense has launched more than 100 incubators

and accelerators to spur innovation, including the Defense Innovation

Unit, AFWERX, and NavalX, but the result has been characterized as

one, is hindered by a profound lack of understanding about how the

commercial innovation ecosystem works and its failure of imagination

about what it could do.”

Use of the growth driver model could transform the industry. An

accelerator, led by a team with a strong track record in defense

innovation, could deliver high-growth innovations in partnership with

start-ups or independent engineering teams. The primary investor

could be the government (as the buyer), a Big Six defense contractor

(as the supplier), or some combination of the two, together with a major

investment institution such as KKR. This approach would increase the

pace of innovation while leveraging the existing industry structure—an

important consideration if the U.S. is to maintain its strategic edge. As

rival countries rapidly increase their investment in military technology,

the U.S. cannot aﬀord to disrupt its entire defense industry in pursuit of

# new ideas.

## HBR / Magazine Article / The Middle Path to Innovation

The growth driver model leverages a ﬁrm’s capabilities to unlock new

revenue streams by tapping into innovators’ creativity and agility.

Incumbent ﬁrms develop a sustained innovation capability and are

no longer reliant on costly and uncertain M&A eﬀorts to drive

future growth. Executives are better positioned to develop corporate

strategy. Investors unlock greater value creation. And entrepreneurs are

empowered to focus on innovation. Moreover, society itself beneﬁts

through the creation of new jobs, a more productive use of resources,

and innovative new products that improve everyone’s quality of life.
